Israel retaliation kills 230 Palestinians after Hamas operation,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tells his shocked nation: ‘Citizens of Israel, we are at war’ after at least 250 citizens killed in unprecedented attack.","At least 232 people have been killed and 1,600 wounded in the Palestinian enclave of Gaza during Israel’s retaliation after a deadly multi-pronged attack by Hamas forces into Israel, the health ministry says. The growing casualty toll on Saturday came after the Palestinian group running the Gaza Strip launched thelargest attack on Israelin years, infiltrating areas in the south of the country following a barrage of thousands of rockets fired from the besieged territory. Israel’s national rescue service said at least 250 people were killed and hundreds wounded, making it the deadliest attack in Israel in years. An unknown number of Israeli soldiers and civilians were also seized and taken into Gaza. Hamas and Israel said late on Saturday that gun battles were raging in dozens of areas inside Israeli territory. Israel’s Defence Minister Yoav Gallant warned Hamas it made a “grave mistake” in launching the attack, which began at 6:30am local time (03:30 GMT) and involved barrages of rockets fired from multiple locations in Gaza as well as fighters infiltrating Israel by land, sea and air. “Citizens of Israel, we are at war. The enemy will pay an unprecedented price,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video message from military headquarters in Tel Aviv. Israel’s military launched a series of air raids on Gaza in response to the attack. “Dozens of [Israeli military] fighter jets are currently striking a number of targets belonging to the Hamas terrorist organisation in the Gaza Strip,” it said. Mohammed Deif, a senior Hamas military commander, said the rocket fire marked the start of “Operation Al-Aqsa Flood”, and he called on Palestinians everywhere to fight the Israeli occupation. “We’ve decided to say enough is enough,” Deif said as he urged all Palestinians to confront Israel. “This is the day of the greatest battle to end the last occupation on Earth,” he said in an audio message. Israel’s military told Israelis living around the Gaza Strip to stay in their homes and warned Hamas would pay a “heavy price for its actions”. Israeli media reported Palestinian fighters opened fire on passers-by in the town of Sderot, in southern Israel, and footage circulating on social media appeared to show uniformed Palestinians engaged in clashes. Another video on social media appeared to show a burning Israeli tank surrounded by jubilant Palestinians. Israeli warplanes started to pound locations in Gaza – in what the military called “Operation Iron Swords” – and Israeli soldiers were engaged in ground fighting in several locations around the besieged Palestinian enclave. “Right now we’re fighting. We’re fighting in certain locations around the Gaza Strip… Our forces are now fighting on the ground,” Israel’s army spokesman Richard Hecht told reporters. Witnesses in Gaza heard loud explosions. Enas Keshta, a resident of Rafah in southern Gaza, said Palestinians are looking at a “tough night” ahead as Israeli attacks on the blockaded enclave continue. “The situation here in Gaza is not good at all. I can assure you that we are not ready, and we have a tough night waiting for us,” she told Al Jazeera. “No place is safe.” Widespread shock and fear abounds in Gaza. “We have been as surprised and frightened as the [occupation] since the operation began,” said Munir Nasser, a Gaza grocery vendor. “We haven’t seen footage of Palestinians breaching the occupied towns and villages beyond the barriers like this before.”  The outbreak of major fighting between Israeli forces and Palestinian fighters comes after weeks of growing tensions along Israel’s volatile border with Gaza, and months of deadly clashes in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. At least 247 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces so far this year, while 32 Israelis and two foreign nationals have been killed in previous Palestinian attacks. Tor Wennesland, United Nations special coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, condemned “the multi-front assault against” Israeli towns and cities near Gaza, which he called “heinous attacks targeting civilians”. “These events have resulted in horrific scenes of violence and many Israeli fatalities and injuries, with many believed to be kidnapped inside the Strip. These are heinous attacks targeting civilians and must stop immediately,” Wennesland said in a statement. “I am deeply concerned for the well-being of all civilians. I am in close contact with all concerned to urge maximum restraint and call on all sides to protect civilians,” he said. “This is a dangerous precipice and I appeal to all to pull back from the brink.” I vehemently condemn the multi-front assault against Israeli towns & cities near#Gaza, & barrage of rockets reaching across central#Israelby Hamas militants. These are heinous attacks targeting civilians & must stop immediately.🔗https://t.co/S8Dyvjxo6kMy full statement👇pic.twitter.com/fz2aJWUsGW — Tor Wennesland (@TWennesland)October 7, 2023  In a statement posted on the Telegram messaging app, Hamas called on “the resistance fighters in the West Bank” as well as “our Arab and Islamic nations” to join the fight. Saleh al-Arouri, an exiled Hamas leader, said “Operation Al-Aqsa Flood” was a response “to the crimes of the occupation” and Palestinian fighters were defending their sacred site in occupied East Jerusalem. Lebanon’s Hezbollah movement, which was founded in 1982 to fight the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon, said in a statement it was following the events in Gaza closely and was in “direct contact with the leadership of the Palestinian resistance”. Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of Hamas, told fellow Arab countries that Israel cannot provide protection despite recent diplomatic rapprochements. “We say to all countries, including our Arab brothers, that this entity, which cannot protect itself in the face of resistors, cannot provide you with any protection,” he said. “All the normalisation agreements that you signed with that entity cannot resolve this [Palestinian] conflict.” In a speech broadcast on Hamas-run Al-Aqsa television, Haniyeh added: “We are on the verge of a great victory and a clear conquest on the Gaza front. Enough is enough, the cycle of intifadas [uprisings] and revolutions in the battle to liberate our land and our prisoners languishing in occupation [Israeli] prisons must be completed.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/7/sirens-warn-of-rockets-launched-towards-israel-from-gaza-news-reports

Palestinian killed as Israeli settlers attack West Bank town of Huwara,The killing of 19-year-old Labib Dumaidi comes amid a period of rising settler violence across the West Bank.,"A Palestinian has been killed when a group of Israeli settlers attacked the town of Huwara, amid a surge insettler violenceacross the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Labib Dumaidi, 19, was shot in the heart by an Israeli settler, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said on Friday. Relatives said he had sought refuge on the roof of his home, which was under assault from settlers, when a settler shot him. The Israeli military has offered a different account, stating that a suspect was shot after throwing a brick at a vehicle, but offering no details on the victim’s identity. “More than 200 settlers gathered in the middle of Huwara after midnight, shouting and dancing, some of them with covered faces,” Palestinian resident Abderrahman Dmidi told the news agency AFP. [1] Documentation of part of the damage from the settler violence events in Huwarah last night, after the military escorted an invasion of the village for a mass prayer. The residents suffered all night from the collective punishment of closing all businesses on the main street >pic.twitter.com/fUq2p7eQCU — Yesh Din English (@Yesh_Din)October 6, 2023  “They began throwing stones towards some houses, and then the young people … tried to defend their homes by throwing stones,” he added. Residents said Israeli soldiers turned a blind eye to the violence. “It’s clear that the settler militias are protected by the occupation’s soldiers,” Thaer Qawareeq, an employee at a supermarket damaged by the settlers in Huwara, told the Reuters news agency. He added that it was the third time that settlers had assaulted the store. The killing of Dumaidi, a university student, has come amid a rise in settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank, including instances of mob violence targeting Palestinian towns and residents, often in the presence ofIsraeli soldiers. Some of the assaults have followed attacks by Palestinians on Israeli settlements and settlers. The attack on Friday came a day after a Palestinian gunman shot at an Israeli car in Huwara. The town is located on a road between the Palestinian cities of Nablus and Ramallah and is surrounded by Israeli settlements, which are illegal under international law. The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the killing of Dumaidi a “heinous crime”. The Palestinian Red Crescent reported that at least 51 Palestinians were injured during a funeral procession for Dumaidi, as Israeli forces fired tear gas,rubber-tipped bullets, and live fire. Settler violence against Palestinians has seen asubstantial uptickover the last year, occurring at a rate of three per day for the first eight months of 2023, according to the United Nations. While Palestinian attacks on residents of Jewish settlements often meet harsh countermeasures, accountability from Israeli authorities in cases of settler violence has been rare. Palestinians have said that the impunity is part of a deliberate campaign to push themoff their land.    Huwara itself has been the scene of some of the most notable recent cases of settler violence: following the slaying of two Israeli brothers by a Palestinian in February, a mob of right-wing settlers rampagedthrough the town, firing weapons and killing a 37-year-old man. Israel’s far-right Minister of FinanceBezalel Smotricharoused controversy when he commented that Huwara should be “wiped out” several days after.

Who is Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi?,The jailed Nobel laureate has been a prominent voice in Iran’s women’s movement.,"When the chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee announced the winner of the peace prize,Narges Mohammadi, she recited a slogan associated with the women’s rights movement in Iran. “Women, life, freedom,” Berit Reiss-Andersen said on Friday. Mohammadi is a prominent Iranian human rights activist and physicist who has been fighting against the oppression of women in Iran. Here is what we know about theNobel Peace Prize winner: Mohammadi’s focus is on the fight for women’s rights in the region. The 51-year-old is also a writer and deputy director of the Defenders of Human Rights Center (DHRC). She also works on broader human rights issues, such as campaigning against the death penalty and corruption. “She has worked for human rights for everyone in Iran, so this is going to be a huge boost to the human rights defenders centre and one that is putting her work in Iran on the map,” Henrik Urdal, director of the Peace Research Institute, told Al Jazeera. Mohammadi wonthe prize“for her fight against the oppression of women in Iran and her fight to promote human rights and freedom for all”, according to the Norwegian Nobel Committee. She has worked on Iranian women’s fight against oppression for the past 30 years. She has contributed to the grassroots movement in Iran by empowering women through education and advocacy. Her work has included organising protests and sit-ins and writing essays. Mohammadi is currently serving a 12-year sentence in Evin Prison in Tehran for charges that include spreading propaganda against the state. This is not Mohammadi’s first sentence. She was first arrested in 2011 and held in Evin. She was againarrested in 2015, days after she was charged in court with crimes against national security, propaganda against the state and forming an illegal group called Step by Step to Stop the Death Penalty, Mohammadi told the US-based International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran. She was held in Zanjan Central Prison andreleased in 2020after her sentence was reduced. “The regime has arrested her 13 times, convicted her five times and sentenced her to a total of 31 years in prison and 154 lashes,” Reiss-Andersen said at the announcement ceremony in Oslo, Norway. In September 2022,Mahsa Amini, 22, was arrested in Tehran by the morality police for alleged non-compliance with Iran’s dress code. She was taken to a re-education centre where she collapsed. She was then taken to a hospital where she died a few days later. Mohammadi said the day of Amini’s death has become a day that symbolises “the oppression of the theocratic authoritarian regime against Iranian women” in a message sent from prison, according toRadio Free Europe Radio Liberty. After protests against Amini’s death broke out in Iran, Mohammadi has continued to report her experience of abuse as a woman in Evin Prison. “What the government may not understand is that the more of us they lock up, the stronger we become,” she wrote for The New York Times.    Mohammadi is the second Iranian woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize after Shirin Ebadi won the award in 2003 for her efforts to promote democracy and human rights. Ebadi is an Iranian human rights activist and lawyer. In 1975, she was the first female judge to be appointed in the Iranian judiciary. She is also the first Muslim woman to win the Nobel prize. She has campaigned for the reform of Iran’s family law, including matters of divorce, inheritance and child protection. Mohammadi has worked closely with Ebadi and is the deputy director of DHRC, which was founded by Ebadi. Mohammadi’s work has come at the cost of her health. She reportedly suffers from a lung condition and a neurological disorder that causes muscular paralysis. She has not been able to meet her husband and two children due to her imprisonment. “This Nobel Prize will embolden Narges’s fight for human rights, but more importantly, this is in fact a prize for the women, life and freedom [movement],” said Mohammadi’s husband and activist Taghi Ramahi.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/6/who-is-nobel-peace-prize-winner-narges
"Syria mourns Homs drone victims as gov’t, Russian attacks in Idlib kill 11",Funerals held for victims of attack on military academy during graduation ceremony.,"Eleven civilians, including a two-year-old child, have been killed in opposition-held Idlib, as Syrians began burying the dozens of people killed in Thursday’s large-scale drone attack on a military academy in the western city of Homs. Government forces stepped up shelling and missile attacks on Idlib after the Homs strike, the deadliest attack on government-held territory in years. Fourteen people were killed by government attacks in Idlib on Thursday, according to the Syrian Civil Defence, before three more were killed on Friday. The two-year-old child was killed in a Russian air attack on a family home in the village of Jaftallak Haj Hamoud, north of Jisr al-Shughour, according to the Civil Defence, medics and locals. A married couple was among four people killed in Idlib city, where Syrian government artillery hit residential neighbourhoods on Friday evening. Friday prayers were cancelled by authorities in opposition-held areas of Idlib and Aleppo, out of fear that mosques could be attacked. The bombardment has left civilians fearful of what may come in the next few days. “I was sleeping and suddenly the sounds of a strong explosion rang out,” said Muhammad al-Sameeh, a resident of Termanin, where four people were killed. “It was like judgement day… It turned out that there was bombing in our neighborhood. I felt very afraid. We were already displaced because of the bombing and military escalation, but it followed us here. Now we have to move again, but I don’t know where to.” The bombardment of rebel territory came as mourners took to the streets in Homs on Friday, with coffins draped in Syrian flags laid outside the Homs military hospital as a military band played sombre music and soldiers saluted. On Thursday, several dronesattackeda graduation ceremony in the academy’s courtyard, where families had gathered with the new officers. Syria’s Ministry of Health said at least 89 people had been killed, including 31 women and five children. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the Syrian conflict, put the toll at more than 120. Syria has declared three days of national mourning. There have been no claims of responsibility for the attack, and Syria’s Ministries of Defence and Foreign Affairs and Expatriates blamed what they described as “terrorist” groups without providing specifics. They promised to respond “with full force”. Thursday’s attack was an unprecedented use of drones against government forces in the war, which began with protests against President Bashar al-Assad in 2011 and spiralled into a conflict that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions. Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr, who has reported extensively on Syria, said the attack represented “a major security breach, a blow to the Syrian regime”. “It has been years since the forces of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, have been targeted in such an operation in the heart of government-controlled territory,” she said. “It seems that the Syrian regime is blaming the opposition because just moments after this attack, their planes started to target residential areas in the opposition-controlled enclaves in the northwest of the country,” she added.    United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres “expressed deep concern” about the drone attack in Homs, as well as “reports of retaliatory shelling” in northwest Syria, his spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said. Meanwhile, Russian President and Syrian government ally Vladimir Putin sent his condolences to al-Assad, Lebanese station Al-Manar reported on Friday.

Iran’s jailed rights advocate Narges Mohammadi wins 2023 Nobel Peace Prize,Narges Mohammadi is honoured for her fight against ‘the oppression of women’ in Iran at ‘tremendous personal costs’.,"Narges Mohammadi, a jailed Iranian women’s rights advocate, has won the 2023 Nobel Peace Prize for her courageous struggle against the oppression of women in Iran and relentless fight for social reform. While behind bars, she was awarded the prestigious prize on Friday for her efforts “to promote human rights and freedom for all”, according to the Norwegian Nobel Committee. “Her brave struggle has come with tremendous personal costs. Altogether, the regime has arrested her 13 times, convicted her five times, and sentenced her to a total of 31 years in prison and 154 lashes,” Berit Reiss-Andersen, head of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, said in Oslo during the announcement. Mohammadi, 51, is one of Iran’s leading human rights activists who has campaigned for women’s rights and the abolition of the death penalty. She is currently serving multiple sentences inTehran’s notorious Evin prisonamounting to about 12 years imprisonment, according to the Front Line Defenders rights organisation, one of the many periods she has been detained behind bars. Charges include spreading propaganda against the state. Mohammadi is the deputy head of the Defenders of Human Rights Center, a non-governmental organisationled by Shirin Ebadi, the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize laureate. She told The New York Times after the win she would never stop striving for democracy and equality – even if that meant staying in prison. “I will continue to fight against the relentless discrimination, tyranny and gender-based oppression by the oppressive religious government until the liberation of women,” the newspaper quoted her as saying in a statement. “I also hope this recognition makes Iranians protesting for change stronger and more organised. Victory is near.” Tehran accused the Nobel committee of meddling and politicising the issue of human rights. “The action of the Nobel Peace Committee is political move in line with the interventionist and anti-Iranian policies of some European governments,” Nasser Kanaani, a spokesperson for Iran’s Foreign Ministry, said. “The Nobel Peace committee has awarded a prize to a person convicted of repeated law violations and criminal acts, and we condemn this as biased and politically motivated,” he added in a statement carried by state media.    Henrik Urdal, director of the Peace Research Institute in Oslo, told Al Jazeera after the announcement it was “a very important prize, one that is celebrating the achievements of human rights defenders, specifically women’s rights defenders in Iran, which has been a very troubled country”. “This is a prize that is also focusing on the sacrifices of young people in Iran. It is a way of underlining their sacrifices and the challenges human rights defenders are operating under in Iran,” he said. Mohammadi’s award comes after a wave of protests swept Iran following the death in custody a year ago of ayoung Iranian Kurd, Mahsa Amini, arrested for violating Iran’s strict dress rules for women. Iran is ranked 143rd out of 146 countries on the World Economic Forum’s gender equality ranking. Tehran rejects accusations of discrimination against women. Mohammadi is the 19th woman to win the 122-year-old prize. The Norwegian Nobel Committee picked this year’s winner from 351 candidates, including 259 individuals and 92 organisations. Olive Moore, Interim Director at Front Line Defenders, said, “This Nobel Peace Prize is a resounding recognition of Narges Mohammadi and other women human rights defenders who – at great cost to personal liberty – have courageously advocated for Iranian women to enjoy the full range of human rights and freedoms”. Mohammadi’s brother Hamidreza said he has not been in touch with his sister but the Nobel Peace Prize “means a lot to her”. He added, however, it is unlikely to make a difference in Iran. “The prize means that the world has seen this movement, [but] the award will not affect the situation in Iran,” he said. “The regime will double down on the opposition, and it will have no effect on the regime. They will just crush people.” The head of the Norwegian Nobel Committee urged Iran to release Mohammadi. “I appeal to Iran: Do something dignified and release the Nobel laureate Narges Mohammadi,” committee chairwoman Berit Reiss-Andersen said. Incarcerated this time since November 2021, Mohammadi has not seen her children – who live in France with her husband – for eight years. She is considered a “prisoner of conscience” by Amnesty International. Mohammadi’s family said the Nobel Peace Prize was a “historic and profound moment for Iran’s fight for freedom”, while the United Nations called for “her release and the release of all human rights defenders jailed in Iran”. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said the award underscored the bravery of Iranian women. “They’ve been harassed for what they do or don’t wear. There are increasingly stringent legal, social and economic measures against them. This really is something that highlights the courage and determination of the women of Iran and how they are an inspiration to the world,” said OHCHR spokesperson Elizabeth Throssell. Last year, the prize went to human rights advocate Ales Bialiatski from Belarus, the Russian human rights group Memorial and the Ukrainian human rights organisation Center for Civil Liberties. The winners had for many years promoted the right to criticise power and protect the fundamental rights of citizens, the committee said at the time, which came during the first year of Russia’s all-out war in Ukraine. The Peace Prize is the only one of the Nobel prizes to be awarded in Norway’s capital Oslo, rather than Sweden’s capital Stockholm. Over the past week, the medicine, physics, chemistry and literature prizes have been announced. The final prize, for economics, is to be announced on Monday. This year, the prizes are worth 11 million krona ($990,000) in each category. To be nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize, eligible nominators, including a chancellor, professor, government, and previous winners, among others, must submit a name and explain why they are worthy of the prize. However, there is no official list of the nominees and the names considered are only published 50 years later. After being nominated, an eight-month-long decision-making process is under way, which includes the committee and a group of international advisers who give their expertise on a short list of candidates. The advisers will produce reports by the end of April, which committee members will study, and begin making decisions through midyear. By the beginning of October, the committee will make its decision through a majority vote. This year, there were 351 candidates for the Nobel Peace Prize – the second-highest number of candidates ever – except in 2016, when 376 were nominated. Of those nominated, 259 are individuals and 92 are organisations. It is the eighth straight year with more than 300 nominees. The amount of cash accompanying the Peace Prize jumped 10 percent this year to about $1m. Prize money has risen and fallen over the years. The Nobel Foundation says it increased the amount this year because of its stronger financial position. Winners also walk away with an 18-carat gold medal and a diploma.

US shoots down Turkish drone over Syria after attacks near Hasakah,The incident comes as Turkey intensifies its military operation in northern Syria after a suicide bombing in Ankara.,"The Pentagon says United States warplanes have shot down a Turkish drone, which was deemed a threat to its forces in Syria, in an incident that might raise tensions between the NATO allies. The development came on Thursday as TurkeytargetedKurdish forces in Syria following a suicide bombing in Ankara that was claimed by the outlawedKurdistan Workers’ Party(PKK). US troops observed drones carrying out raids on Thursday morning, some of them inside a “restricted operating zone” (ROZ) near Hasakah, about a kilometre (less than a mile) from Washington’s troops, Pentagon spokesman Brigadier General Pat Ryder told journalists. A few hours later, a Turkish drone returned to the ROZ and flew towards American forces despite what a US official said were a dozen calls to Ankara’s military. Ryder said “US commanders assessed … the UAV, which was now less than a half kilometre from US forces, to be a potential threat,” using an abbreviation for an unmanned aerial vehicle. “US F-16 fighters subsequently shot down the UAV in self-defence,” he said. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with his Turkish counterpart Yasar Guler on Thursday, urging “de-escalation in northern Syria and the importance of maintaining strict adherence to de-confliction protocols and communication through established military-to-military channels,” Ryder said in a statement. Turkey’s defence ministry confirmed the call, saying the two officials discussed “the latest developments in Syria”. Al Jazeera’s Sinem Koseoglu, reporting from Istanbul, said the UAV did not belong to the Turkish military, according to a statement. “It is not only the Turkish military that conducts counterterrorism operations in northern Iraq and Syria,” she said. She said that the Turkish intelligence and interior ministry’s gendarmerie also joined operations.    On Thursday night, Turkish militaryair attackskilled 26 fighters and destroyed 30 Kurdish fighter targets in northern Syria, including an oil well, a storage facility and shelters, and “neutralised” many fighters, the Turkish defence ministry said. Al Jazeera’s Alan Fisher, reporting from Washington, said Turkish officials say operations are carried out as part of the country’s right to self-defence. “Turkey has warned other countries to stay away from areas controlled by groups it will continue to target,” he said. On Friday, Turkey’s military conducted another round of air strikes in northern Syria and destroyed 15 other targets where it said PKK-affiliate fighters were believed to be, according to the defence ministry. It did not say where in northern Syria the strikes had hit. “As has been done in Iraq, all the capabilities and revenue sources developed by the terrorist organisation in Syria will continue to be destroyed in a systematic way,” the foreign ministry said in a statement. The US has about 900 troops deployed in Syria as part of international efforts to combat the ISIL (ISIS) armed group, and carries out frequent raids targeting the fighters.    US forces are partnered with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which led the fight that dislodged ISIL fighters from the last territory they held in the country in 2019. However, Turkey views the Kurdish People’s Protection Units that dominate the SDF as an offshoot of the PKK, which is considered a “terrorist” group by Ankara and its Western allies. Turkish attacks on military and infrastructure targets in Kurdish-held areas of Syria killed at least nine people on Thursday, according to Kurdish security forces. Syria contains a dangerous mix of often antagonistic forces operating on the ground and in the air, including those from President Bashar al-Assad’s government, Russia, the US, Turkey, Iran-linked armed groups and the Kurdish fighters, among others. Following the drone incident, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan on the phone on Friday. The top US diplomat “highlighted the need to coordinate and deconflict our activities”, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said. Fidan told Blinken that Turkey’s military operations in Syria would continue, a source familiar with the call told Reuters news agency. “During the call, Minister Fidan conveyed to his counterpart Blinken in strong terms that, as an ally, the United States must stop working together with the YPG terrorist organisation in the north of Syria,” the source said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/6/us-shoots-down-turkeys-drone-over-syria-after-strikes-near-hasakeh
The October 1973 War: How it led to the first Arab recognition of Israel,"Fifty years after the Arab-Israeli war, Israel continues to occupy the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza.","TheOctober 1973 Arab-Israeli Warlasted for barely three weeks but it shook the world economy and culminated in the Camp David Accords that saw Egypt become the first Arab country to establish diplomatic ties with Israel. The war, known to Israelis as Yom Kippur and to Arabs as the October War, started when Egypt and Syria launched a two-front attack on Israel to regain their territories lost in the 1967 Six Day War when Israel captured the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt and Syria’s Golan Heights. Israel also seizedlarge parts of historic Palestine, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in 1967. The defeat of Arabs and Palestinians is known asthe “Naksa”, meaning setback or defeat. Egypt regained control of Sinai but Syria’s Golan Heights remains occupied by Israel. The aftermath of the war contributed to the shifting political dynamics between Arab nations and the United States. Here are some of the key events that took place in the wake of the war: The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) led by Arab countries imposed an oil embargo on the US after accusing Washington of supplying weapons to Israel in the war that ended in a stalemate. The aim was to use the oil embargo to pressure the US to resolve the Palestinian issue. They pledged to maintain this until all the territories occupied by Israel in 1967 were relinquished and the rights of Palestinians were restored. Oil prices shot up around the world, causing the US to reassess its support for the war. Even though Israel did not pull out from the occupied Palestinian territories, the embargo on the US was lifted in 1974 following peace talks. The oil crisis was a shock to economies worldwide, causing the oil price to quadruple from around $2.90 a barrel before the embargo to about $11.65 a barrel in January 1974. To avoid a future shock, the International Energy Agency (IEA) was created as a response. The Paris-based intergovernmental organization works to ensure the security of oil supplies. Former US President Jimmy Carter brokered a series of peace talks between Egypt’s then-President Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin, the former Israeli Prime Minister. These secret discussions that took place in Camp David, a country retreat for the US President near Washington, DC, spanned over 13 days. The accords laid out conditions for an Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty, and a framework for Israeli-Palestinian peace using Resolution 242, which called for a withdrawal of Israel from territories occupied during the Six Day War in 1967. Israel agreed to pull out its forces and civilians from Sinai in exchange for diplomatic ties with Egypt and access to the Suez Canal after the Camp David Accords signed in 1978. While Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty in 1979, the framework never materialised. Egypt was expelled from the Arab League, and all Arab countries broke diplomatic relations with Cairo following its normalisation with Israel. Egypt was accused of disregarding the Palestinian cause, but 50 years on more Arab countries are eager to establish ties with Israel relegating the Palestinian issue to the side. Jordan followed Egypt in signing a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 while several countries, including the United Arab Emirates, recognised Israel as part of the so-called Abraham Accords in 2020.  Cairo was brought back to the Arab League in 1989. Fifty years after the Arab-Israeli war, Israel continues to occupy the Palestinian territory of West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza. The UScontinues to seethe Golan Heights as Israeli territory.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/6/the-october-1973-war-how-it-led-to-the-first-arab-recognition-of-israel
