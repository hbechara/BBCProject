"Israel kills dozens in Rafah strikes, frees two captives",Air raids come as Palestinians in Rafah brace for offensive that aid agencies fear would cause massive casualties.,"Israel has carried out air strikes in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, killing dozens, according to health officials, as Palestinians brace for a major offensive on the densely crowded urban area. There were conflicting reports of the death toll following the predawn strikes on Monday. The AFP news agency reported that the strikes killed 52 people. Reuters reported that at least 67 had been killed. Both outlets quoted health officials in Gaza. The Israeli strikes hit 14 houses and three mosques in Rafah, according to Palestinian officials. However, Al Jazeera Arabic colleagues have reported that at least 63 people were killed in the strikes on the mosques. A press statement from Hamas asserted that more than 100 had been killed in the city. “Israel is officially continuing to target civilians and transfer the war to Rafah to push the population to get displaced under bombardment,” the Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement released on X. “The recent massacres of the occupation are evidence of the validity of international warnings and fears of catastrophic results of the expansion of the war to Rafah,” the ministry added.

Netanyahu commits mass massacres with a mentality of revenge, not victory and not in accordance with…pic.twitter.com/cbuS7iaZr9 — State of Palestine – MFA 🇵🇸🇵🇸 (@pmofa)February 12, 2024  Israel’s military said it had struck a number of “terror targets” in the Shaboura district of Rafah and the strikes had concluded. It also announced that in an overnight operation in Rafah it had rescued two captives taken by Hamas on October 7. Military officials said the captives, named as Fernando Simon Marman and Louis Har, were in good condition. Hamas has warned that an Israeli ground assault in Rafah would “blow up” negotiations to release the group’s remaining captives in Gaza. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed on Monday to press on with the offensive. “Only continued military pressure, until complete victory, will result in the release of all our hostages,” he said in a statement. The strikes on Rafah come as Israel is preparing to launch a major offensive that aid agencies fear would result in significant civilian casualties in the last relatively safe area of Gaza. About 1.4 million Palestinians, or more than half the population of Gaza, have crowded into Rafah to escape Israeli bombardment, which has reduced much of the rest of the enclave to ruins.  Hamas has condemned Israel for the attacks, saying they represent an “expansion of the scope of the massacres it is committing against our people”. “The Nazi occupation army’s attack on the city of Rafah tonight… which [has] claimed the lives of more than a hundred martyrs so far, is considered a continuation of the genocidal war and the attempts at forced displacement it is waging against our Palestinian people,” the group said in a press release. United States President Joe Biden on Sunday warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not to launch an offensive on Rafah without a “credible and executable plan” to ensure the safety of people sheltering in the city. Netanyahu has promised “safe passage” for Palestinians in Rafah, but the lack of clarity about evacuation plans hasprompted fearsthat they may be pushed into Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula, stoking tensions with Cairo. Netanyahu on Sunday told Fox News that “there’s plenty of room” north of Rafah and that is “where we’re going to direct them”, without specifying which part of Gaza would be safe to evacuate to.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/12/israel-strikes-rafah-says-two-captives-freed
Hamas warns Israeli invasion of Rafah will ‘torpedo’ truce talks,Palestinian group issues warning as Biden says Israel shouldn’t invade without ‘credible’ plan to protect civilians.,"Hamas has warned Israel thata ground offensive in Rafahwould imperil negotiations on a truce and the exchange of captives and prisoners, as United States President Joe Biden said an assault should not go ahead without a “credible” plan to protect civilians in the city. Aid groups and foreign governments, including Israel’s key ally the US, have voiced deep concern over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s pledge to extend ground military operations into the far-southern Gaza city. Rafah, on the border with Egypt, is the last refuge for Palestinians fleeing Israel’s relentless bombardment elsewhere in the Gaza Strip in its four-month war against Hamas, triggered by the Palestinian group’s October 7 attack. “Any attack by the occupation army on the city of Rafah would torpedo the exchange negotiations,” a Hamas leader told the AFP news agency on condition of anonymity. Netanyahu has told troops to prepare to enter the city that now hosts more than half of Gaza’s total population, spurring concern about the impact on displaced civilians. A senior Biden administration official said on Sunday that negotiators working on a phased framework deal to release the remaining hostages have made “real progress” over the last few weeks. The hostage release deal was the main focus of a 45-minute telephone call between Biden and Netanyahu on Sunday, although there were still some “significant” gaps to close, the official said, adding, “It’s pretty much there.” Biden told Netanyahu the Gaza advance should not go ahead in the absence of a “credible” plan to ensure “the safety” of people sheltering there, the White House said.    Some 1.4 million Palestinians have crowded into Rafah, with many living in tents while food, water and medicine are becoming increasingly scarce. Netanyahu had told US broadcaster ABC News that the Rafah operation would go ahead until Hamas is eliminated, adding Israel would provide “safe passage” to civilians wishing to leave. When pressed about where they could go, Netanyahu said: “You know, the areas that we’ve cleared north of Rafah, plenty of areas there. But we are working out a detailed plan.” Mediators held new talks in Cairo for a pause in the fighting and the release of some of the 132 hostages Israel says are still in Gaza, including 29 thought to be dead. Hamas seized around 240 hostages on October 7, according to Israeli authorities . Dozens were released during a one-week truce in November. Hamas’s military wing on Sunday said two hostages had been killed and eight others seriously wounded in Israeli bombardment in recent days. Netanyahu has faced calls for early elections and mounting protests over his administration’s failure to bring home the hostages. North of Rafah on Sunday, Israel’s military said troops were conducting “targeted raids” in the west of Khan Younis, southern Gaza’s main city, while Hamas reported violent clashes and said air strikes also hit Rafah.    Hamas’s unprecedented October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of about 1,139 people, mostly civilians, according to an Al Jazeera tally based on official Israeli figures. Israel has responded with a relentless offensive in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip that the territory’s health ministry says has killed at least 28,176 people, mostly women and children. The Israeli assault has left much of the territory in ruins and displaced more than 80 percent of the population.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/11/hamas-warns-israeli-invasion-of-rafah-will-torpedo-truce-talks
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Qatar for Gaza ceasefire talks,"Abbas is scheduled to meet Qatar’s emir on Monday, as the Israel-Hamas war rages on.","Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has arrived in Doha for talks on securing a ceasefire in Gaza with the Qatari emir, whose country has been at the heart ofmediation effortsbetween Israel and Hamas. The official Palestinian news agency Wafa said Abbas would meet Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani on Monday, but did not say if he would also meet leaders of Hamas, a group that has long been at odds with Abbas and his West Bank-based Fatah group. The Palestinian ambassador to Qatar, Munir Ghannam, told Voice of Palestine radio on Sunday that Abbas and the emir would discuss efforts to secure a Gaza ceasefire with Israel and ways to increase aid for the territory’s 2.3 million people. “Qatar plays an important role in the international efforts and mediation to reach a ceasefire. Therefore, coordination with Qatar, also with Egypt, is of special importance, to bring an end to this aggression against our people,” Ghannam said. Qatar hosts the head of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, as well as another senior leader in the group, Khaled Meshaal, who handles diaspora affairs in the Hamas political office. The visit comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promises to advance plans for aground offensive on Rafah, despite growing international alarm at the potential consequences for the 1.4 million Palestinian civilians crammed in the city in southern Gaza. The United States, Israel’s key international ally, has warned that an attack on Rafah could be a “disaster” and United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that Palestinian civilians in the city had “nowhere to go”. Egypt warned of “dire consequences” of a potential Israeli military assault on the south Gaza city of Rafah near its border. “Egypt called for the necessity of uniting all international and regional efforts to prevent the targeting of the Palestinian city of Rafah,” its foreign ministry said in a statement. Mohammed Nazzal, a senior Hamas figure, told Al Jazeera that Netanyahu “wants the war to continue to stay in power, and doesn’t want to lose his right-wing coalition”. “He wants to keep the fighting going on until the US elections in November for [Donald] Trump to win,” Nazzal said. Israel began its assault on Gaza on October 7 after Hamas fighters carried out a surprise attack on southern Israel, killing at least 1,139 people and seizing around 240 others as hostages, according to Israeli officials. After the attack, Israel launched a devastating bombardment and a ground invasion that has reduced much of Gaza to rubble and killed more than 28,100 people, according to Palestinian authorities. Talks for a deal on a ceasefire and the release of hostages have so far failed to bring an agreement. Last week, Israel rejected a Hamas proposal, saying it would not stop fighting while the group retained brigades that Israel says are hiding in Rafah. Last Thursday, a Hamas delegation was in Cairo and left the next day after talking to Egyptian and Qatari officials for ceasefire talks. While Gaza has been governed by Hamas since 2007, areas of the Israeli-occupied West Bank are governed by the Palestinian Authority, led by Fatah. Abbas’s authority has largely been reduced to the West Bank, which is larger than Gaza but which is also fractured by Israeli settlements. Past attempts, mainly led by Egypt, to resolve disputes between Hamas and Fatah have so far failed to end the rifts, which analysts say weakens Palestinian efforts to secure a state of their own on land now occupied by Israel. Meanwhile, Israeli officialsblamethe PA for failing to control factions including Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement, which have called on Israel to remove the blockade of the enclave and end its occupation of Palestinian territories. Successive Israeli governments have expanded settler expansion in the occupied Palestinian territories in violation of international law.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/11/palestinian-president-mahmoud-abbas-in-qatar-for-gaza-ceasefire-talks
What’s happening in Gaza’s Rafah as Israel threatens to attack?,"Over a million Palestinians are trapped at Gaza’s southernmost point, with the Israeli army preparing a ground attack.","Rafah, a looming Israeli ground “operation”, and the impact on more than a million trapped civilians are top headlines. But what is Rafah and what are the details around this announced Israeli “operation”? Rafah straddles the border between the Gaza Strip and Egypt. On the Palestinian side, it is the name of Gaza’s southernmost governorate and its capital city, as well as of the crossing into Egypt’s Sinai. On the Egyptian side, it is a city in the North Sinai governorate. Palestinian Rafah is 64sq km (25sq miles) and, as Israel assaulted Gaza these past four months, more and more people have been herded into it by Israeli forces who keep promising safety “further south” – which never materialised. Approximately 1.4 million Palestinians have now been pushed into Rafah by relentless Israeli bombing that has killed nearly 30,000 Palestinians. People are in dense clusters in the limited space not filled with debris or being bombed by Israel. Conditions are dire, with severe shortages. Tel Aviv claims four Hamas brigades are present within Rafah, using their presence there to justify the ongoing attacks by air as well as a planned land assault. Israel also claims plans for the evacuation of the city – to where is unclear – are being prepared, leaving those sheltering in Rafah paralysed. Because the trapped civilians are pressed up against the border with Egypt, analysts say it seems likely Israel wants to push them into Sinai. This raises concerns over Egypt’s internal security and the prospect of having more than a million traumatised Palestinians forced into its territory. Egypt has reportedly moved 40 tanks and armoured personnel carriers to the Gaza border to halt any potential spillover from an Israeli land assault. Egypt has warned that any Israeli ground assault on Rafah would have “disastrous consequences” andthatIsrael’s aim to force the Palestinians out of their land would threaten the 40-year-old Camp David peace accord between the two countries. Cairo has beefed up border security since October 7. Palestinians have faced mass displacement in the not-too-distant past: the Nakba. In 1948, some 750,000 Palestinians wereethnically cleansed from their homes and landsto make way for the establishment of the state of Israel. Many in Gaza are the descendants of Nakba refugees and do not want to leave Palestine because they know it will be impossible to return – Israel won’t let them. Arab countries, like Egypt, also object to any displacement as the Palestinian Right of Return has been a main demand since 1948. No. Israel is already killing more than 100 people a day in air attacks on Rafah. Those who survive the attacks live in unspeakable conditions in tents that fill with water whenever it rains, or under whatever scraps they find to make a shelter. Many Palestinians in Rafah have been displaced many times over and say they will not move again, no matter what. Like Jihan al-Hawajri who told US broadcaster PBS that she would stay in her tent, come what may. “There is nowhere left… to flee to,” said Angelita Caredda, Middle East and North Africa director for the Norwegian Refugee Council. Satellite images obtained by Al Jazeera show an area already at breaking point. Some 22,000 people are crowded into each of Rafah’s 64sq km. Before the war, 275,000 people lived in those 64sq km, making Rafah one of the most densely populated parts of Gaza, itself among the world’s most overcrowded parts. The displaced crowd into UNRWA facilities, hoping the agency that was set up to help them would be able to. But nearly 150 of UNRWA’s staff were killed in Israeli attacks, aid is being stopped by Israel, and Western governments withdrew funding when Israel alleged – with no proof yet – that 12 UNRWA staff participated in the October 7 attack. Overcrowding has resulted in the spread of disease, with health officials reporting an outbreak of hepatitis A – which flourishes in close contact. With isolating patients impossible, there is little hope of stopping this outbreak or others, like scabies and lice, worsened by a lack of showers or hygienic toilets. When the October 7 attack happened – killing 1,139 people in Israel – and Palestinian armed fighters took 240 people into Gaza as captives, Israel’s declared aims were to return the captives and “eradicate Hamas”. Since then, the narrative has shifted back and forth. First claiming to only be targeting armed fighters, Israel soon imposed a complete starvation siege on Gaza, killing civilians with every passing minute. Then, it became apparent that when Israel said “avoiding civilian casualties”, it meant its secret calculus with an increased “acceptable loss margin”, or the number of people it felt it could kill to eliminate one target.  A massive attack on Jabalia refugee camp in October killed 50 people to eliminate one “Hamas commander”, a designation Israel has not presented proof of. It also started targeting hospitals, with a horrifying attack on al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City endangering more than 30 premature babies whose incubators stopped when Israel cut electricity. The declared aim to uncover “hidden Hamas command bunkers” under al-Shifa was never realised. More followed as Israel surrounded one hospital after another, killing and starving people inside, to “unearth Hamas command centres”. None have been uncovered. Not likely, as Israel’s claims about “dismantling terrorist battalions”, referring to armed Palestinian factions, appear as ephemeral as the claims of underground command centres. It had declared Palestinian fighting factions “neutralised” in north Gaza, only to admit later that that was not the case. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been under pressure – including from the UK and the US – to call off the land assault but he insists this will be the operation to “dismantle Hamas”. The US made its most pointed wartime criticism of Tel Aviv, saying Israel should “put civilians first and foremost”, but did not threaten to cut aid or support. The EU and the UK have followed suit with the US.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/11/what-is-happening-in-gazas-rafah-as-israel-threatens-to-attack
UNRWA refutes Israeli implications of Hamas tunnel below Gaza HQ,The aid agency says it has ‘no knowledge’ of areas beneath its headquarters in Gaza.,"The chief of the UN’s aid agency in Gaza has said that it had no knowledge of what was beneath its abandoned headquarters amid Israeli claims that a Hamas tunnel ran below the Gaza City site. Philippe Lazzarini of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) said on X late on Saturday that the agency “did not know what is under its headquarters in Gaza”. Israel has previouslyaccusedUNRWA of colluding with Hamas’s military operations, prompting several donors to withdraw funding. The UNRWA chief’s comments came after the Israeli army invited journalists to visit the tunnel. The Israeli military did not provide definitive proof that Hamas fighters operated at the location, but showed that at least a portion of the tunnel system ran underneath the courtyard of the aid agency’s headquarters. Inside one of the buildings journalists saw a room full of computers with wires stretching down into the ground. Soldiers then showed them a room in an underground tunnel complex where they claimed the wires connected. That underground room bore a wall of electrical cabinets with multicoloured buttons and was lined with dozens of cables. The military claimed the room served as a hub powering tunnel infrastructure in the area. Israel has repeatedly said that one of the main objectives of its war in Gaza is to destroy the underground network that it says is used by Hamas to move its fighters, weapons and supplies. While few know the full extent of what someIsraeli officials call the “metro”, the tunnels are believed to cross the entire enclave for hundreds of kilometres. Experts estimate a depth of 15 to 60 metres (50 to 200 feet). Israel’s claims over the tunnel appear part of a pattern intended to implicate UNRWA in Hamas’s military operations. The main humanitarian agency in Gaza, UNRWA, has been facing an unprecedented funding crisis after its main international donors led by the United States cut its funding over “terror” allegations. Lazzarini insisted that UNRWA had no knowledge if anything was below the headquarters, which it vacated shortly after Israel launched its bombardment of the Gaza Strip in early October. “UNRWA is made aware of reports through the media regarding a tunnel under the UNRWA Headquarters in Gaza,” said on X. He added that while the reports merit an independent inquiry, “that is currently not possible to undertake given Gaza is an active war zone”. – UNRWA did not know what is under its headquarters in Gaza. – UNRWA is made aware of reports through the media regarding a tunnel under the UNRWA Headquarters in Gaza. – UNRWA staff left its headquarters in Gaza City on 12 October following the Israeli evacuation orders and as… — Philippe Lazzarini (@UNLazzarini)February 10, 2024  Lazzarini said that UNRWA staff left the headquarters on October 12, following an Israeli evacuation order, and that they were not aware of any activity that may have taken place there since. In times of no active conflict, he added, the agency inspects its premises every quarter. “UNRWA is a human development and humanitarian organisation that does not have the military and security expertise nor the capacity to undertake military inspections of what is or might be under its premises,” he said. In the past, Lazzarini added, “protest letters” were filed to Hamas officials and Israeli authorities “whenever suspicious cavity was found close to or under UNRWA premises” and that the matter was “consistently reported” to the UN General Assembly. The UN agency, the only lifeline to the more than two million people in Gaza, has come under intense scrutiny after Israel alleged that 11 of its employees took part in Hamas’s deadly assault into southern Israel on October 7. Hamas fighters launched an unprecedented attack killing more than 1,100 people and took about 240 captives. Israel has responded with a ferocious bombing campaign killing more than 28,000 people and displacing nearly 85 percent of the population. Despite UNRWA terminating the contracts of those accused by Israel of joining the attack andlaunching an investigation, major donorssuspended their funding, plunging the agency into a financial crisis. The agency said that Israel has also frozen its bank account, embargoed aid shipments and cancelled its tax benefits.

‘We’re going to do it’: Israeli PM set on invasion of Rafah,Israel is yet to say how it will protect the 1.4 million civilians crammed into the city from the planned assault.,"Israel is determined to advance with its unspecified plans to invade the city of Rafah in southern Gaza, where millions of displaced Palestinians are sheltering. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated his intention to extend the military operation in an interview broadcast late on Saturday. “We’re going to do it,” he declared and said that the plans are being worked on. The statement comes despite international alarm over the potential for carnage. An estimated 1.4 million Palestinians are crammed into Rafah, and hemmed in by the border with Egypt, after being ordered by the Israeli military to evacuate their homes elsewhere in the Gaza Strip. The United States, Israel’s main backer, has warned against the plan to expand the ground assault into the city, which has for months been subject to almost daily aerial bombardments. At least 25 Palestinians have been killed in overnight strikes on Rafah, according to Al Jazeera journalists on the ground, as the Israeli army has beenramping up its attacksthis week. Over 28,000 Palestinians have now been killed since the start of the war on Gaza on October 7. Netanyahu said in the interview with US outlet ABC News that he agrees with Washington that civilians need to be evacuated from Rafah before any ground invasion. “We’re going to do it while providing safe passage for the civilian population so they can leave,” he said, according to published extracts of the interview. However, it’ is unclear where such a large number of people, who are pressed up against the border with Egypt and sheltering in makeshift tents, can go. When asked, Netanyahu would only say they are “working out a detailed plan”. “The areas that we’ve cleared north of Rafah are – there are plenty of areas there,” he said. “Those who say that under no circumstances should we enter Rafah, are basically saying ‘lose the war, keep Hamas there’,” he said. Reporting from Rafah, Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum said desperate Palestinians in the area feel they have no choices left. “We need to remember that the majority of injured people and displaced people have been transferred to Rafah in order to be away from Israeli operations,” he said.    Egypt has fiercely opposed the plan, which threatens to displace hundreds of thousands of Palestinians into its Sinai Peninsula. It is also remaining highly cautious of increased Israeli military activity near its borders. Cairo has warned that its decades-old peace treaty with Israel could face jeopardy if Israel deploys troops on its border. Israeli Transportation Minister Miri Regev said that the Israeli government takes Egypt’s sensitivity regarding the military operation in Rafah seriously and that the two sides will be able to reach an agreement. Mamoun Abu Nowar, a retired general of the Jordanian air force, told Al Jazeera that Hamas has deep tunnels in the area, some of which run through Egypt. “In order to control these tunnels,” he continued, “they have to work very hard, to cut these command posts or destroy them so [Hamas] loses this command as a whole, but this would be a very very difficult fight, it would take months.” International warnings against an invasion of Rafah continue to roll in. The European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, in a post on X late on Saturday, backedwarnings by the bloc’s member statesthat an invasion of Rafah “would lead to an unspeakable humanitarian catastrophe and grave tensions with Egypt”. I echo the warning by several EU member states that an Israeli offensive on Rafah would lead to an unspeakable humanitarian catastrophe and grave tensions with Egypt. Resuming negotiations to free hostages and suspend hostilities is the only way to avert a bloodshed. — Josep Borrell Fontelles (@JosepBorrellF)February 10, 2024  Regional leaders are also sounding the alarm. Jasem Mohamed Albudaiwi, secretary-general of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), said an attack on Rafah would further destabilise the region and harm Palestinians. UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini said on Sunday that there is a sense of growing anxiety and panic in Rafah. “A military offensive in the middle of these completely exposed, vulnerable people is a recipe for disaster. I am almost becoming wordless,” he said.   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/11/israel-working-on-rafah-invasion-in-gaza-despite-international-alarm
Yemen’s Houthis say 17 rebels killed in US-led attacks,Mourners gathering at public funerals in Sanaa say they remain resolute in their position on Israel’s war on Gaza.,"Seventeen Houthi fighters have been killed in United States and British attacks, the Yemeni rebel group has said through its official media, following public funerals in the capital Sanaa. “The bodies of a number of martyrs of the nation and the armed and security forces who were martyred as a result of the bombing of the American-British aggression were carried through Sanaa today in a solemn funeral procession,” a Houthi official media said on Saturday, listing their names. The US and United Kingdom have been hitting Houthi targets in Yemen since mid-January, in an attempt to get them to cease their attacks on ships in the Red Sea. The Iran-backed rebels, who control much of war-torn Yemen including the port of Hodeidah, have been targeting what they say are vessels linked to Israel in response to the war on Gaza. The USsaidon Thursday that its military had conducted several raids against missile launchers as Houthi fighters prepared to launch them against commercial shipping and US warships in the Red Sea. Large numbers of supporters gathered at Sanaa’s Al-Shaab mosque, formerly Al-Saleh mosque, on Saturday for the funerals of the Houthis killed in the attacks. One of the mourners, Abu Moataz Ghalib, told the AFP news agency that he and others present remained resolute in their position on the war in Gaza. “We convey our message through these martyrs that it is absolutely impossible for us to abandon our position, which is based on principles and faith, and which forced us to take action,” he said. On Wednesday the Houthis’ news agency reported that the US and UK had hit targets in Hodeidah province. On Tuesday, the Houthis said they hadtargeted US and British ships in two attacksin the Red Sea, causing minor damage but no casualties. The Red Sea attacks have raised insurance premiums for shipping companies, forcing many to avoid the vital route that normally carries about 12 percent of global maritime trade. On Friday, Steve Fagin, the US ambassador to Yemen,said on Xvia the US Embassy’s account, that the US will classify the Houthis as a terrorist group at the end of next week, unless the group ceases its attacks on ships in the Red Sea. The USannounced this movein January, giving the Houthis 30 days to cease the attacks before it went into effect. “In response to these continuing threats and attacks, the United States announced the designation of Ansarallah, also known as the Houthis, as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist,” White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said in a statement at the time.

Hamas official survives Israeli attack that kills two others in Lebanon,"The drone strike hit a car 35km (22 miles) from the Lebanese capital, Beirut.","An Israeli drone raid that hit a car 35km (22 miles) from the Lebanese capital, Beirut, has killed at least two people, but a Hamas official who was the target survived the attack, security sources told Al Jazeera. Two missiles fired by an Israeli drone hit the Hamas official’s vehicle in the coastal town of Jadra on Saturday and two bystanders were killed in the attack, Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr reported from Beirut. The two victims were civilians, a Lebanese Civil Defence official told the AFP news agency. The Hamas official targeted in the attack was close toSaleh al-Arouri, Hamas’s deputy chief killed last month in a suspected Israeli raid on a suburb of Beirut, a security source said. The Times of Israel daily reported that the person targeted was Basel Salah, describing him as a recruiter for Hamas in Gaza and the West Bank. The strike was the second attack in Lebanon this week beyond the border region with Israel. “This was deep inside Lebanon, approximately 60km [37 miles] from the border with Israel, outside the battleground where the Israeli army and the Lebanese group Hezbollah have been exchanging fire, triggered by the war on Gaza,” Khodr said. Hezbollah and Israel have been exchanging near-daily fire since October 7 when Hamas launched an attack on Israeli territory in which some 1,100 people were killed. Israel’s military then launched a land, air and ground assault on Gaza that has left more than 28,000 people dead. However, usual exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and Israel’s military have been mostly limited to the border region. There was no immediate comment from Hamas in Lebanon or from the Israeli military. Al Jazeera’s Khodr said this was “not the first attack” of its kind. “On Thursday, an Israeli drone targeted a vehicle in the southern city of Nabatieh, also outside the battleground, targeting members of Hezbollah. “This becoming a strategy on the part of the Israelis; what is clear, is that there’s no longer a front line,” she said. “Back in January,Hamas’s number two man was assassinatedin the heart of the Lebanese capital. Israelis are using this opportunity to target officials from Hezbollah, from Hamas, as well as to try to degrade the capabilities of Hezbollah in southern Lebanon.” On Saturday, Hezbollah said it had seized an Israeli Skylark drone over Lebanese air space “in good condition”. The Skylark is a small, unmanned aerial vehicle typically used for surveillance. After Saturday’s attack, the group released two statements claiming attacks on Israeli soldiers. The first targeted a “gathering of Israeli enemy soldiers” in the Hadab Aita Heights with rockets, hitting them directly, a statement read. The second statement said a building in al-Manara containing Israeli soldiers was attacked and hit directly. This attack, Hezbollah said, was “in response to the Zionist attacks on southern villages and civilian homes”. Lebanese officials and Western diplomats have said Hezbollah has signalled its openness to US diplomatic efforts to secure calm on the border with Israel once a ceasefire is in place in Gaza.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/10/figure-close-to-hamas-survives-israeli-strike-in-lebanon-2-others-killed
"Tehran ‘never sought’ to expand war in the region, Iran’s FM says",Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-abdollahian is in Lebanon to discuss the impact of Israel’s war in Gaza.,"Iran has never sought war in the region, the country’s foreign minister has said on a visit to Lebanon to discuss Israel’s war on Gaza and its impact on regional security. “Iran and Lebanon confirm that war is not the solution, and that we absolutely never sought to expand it,” Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-abdollahian said at a news conference alongside Abdallah Bou Habib, Lebanon’s foreign minister, in Beirut on Saturday. However, he threatened that any widespread attack by Israel on Lebanon would be Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s “last day”. His visit to Beirut came as the United States and Israel have continued to blame Iran and its aligned armed groups in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen for escalating tensions in the region via attacks on US and Israeli targets. “After months of aggression and genocide by the Zionist regime [Israel] in Gaza and the West Bank, Tel Aviv has not achieved any of its stated goals,” Amir-abdollahian told reporters. “The continuation of America’s support for the Zionist regime and for Netanyahu will have no results but a final defeat,” he said. در بیروت با آقایان نجیب میقاتی، نخست‌وزیر دولت پیشبرد امور لبنان، نبیه بری، رئیس پارلمان، زیاد نخاله، دبیرکل جنبش جهاد اسلامی و برخی مقامات حماس و فلسطین و همچنین سید‌حسن نصرالله دبیرکل حزب‌الله لبنان دیدار کردم.علاوه بر مناسبات دوجانبه میان ایران و لبنان، مهم‌ترین تحولات منطقه…pic.twitter.com/MT92FB1YGS — H.Amirabdollahian امیرعبداللهیان (@Amirabdolahian)February 10, 2024  During his visit, the Iranian diplomat met Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati, speaker of Lebanon’s Parliament, Ziad Nakhale, the secretary-general of the Islamic Jihad Movement, and some Hamas officials. He also met Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. After his meetings in Lebanon, Amir-abdollahian is scheduled to visit the Syrian capital Damascus, where Iran also allegedly wields influence over other groups. He is then due to head to Qatar, which has been the main mediator between Israel and Hamas. Some political analysts viewed the Iranian foreign minister’s trip tour to Lebanon and other regional countries as a way of influencing the outcome of negotiations on the Gaza war. Iran was not represented in Saudi Arabia at a meeting on Thursday, where ministers from Arab nations discussed initiatives for Gaza after the war ends. “Interestingly, the exclusion of Iran and inclusion of Qatar is something for us to take note of because the Saudis were saying that this is an Arab problem that requires Arab solutions. Iran, of course, wants to have a say in what transpires once the war is over,” Mehran Kamrava, a political analyst, told Al Jazeera. On Saturday, Amir-abdollahian said a political solution was the only way to end the Gaza conflict, and that Tehran was in talks with Riyadh on the issue. Reporting from Beirut, Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr said that this the Iranian foreign minister’s third trip to the region since the war began and, this time, he stressed that Palestinians themselves must decide their future. Moreover, Khodr pointed out that his trip to Lebanon also coincided with the Israeli threat to widen its attacks on Hezbollah if it does not get security guarantees along the border. After 17 years of relative calm along the Israel-Lebanon border, Hezbollah and the Israeli army began launching attacks in the area on October 8, a day after Hamas attacked southern Israel, killing about 1,100 people there, and Israel launched a relentless assault on Gaza that has killed more than 28,000 Palestinians. Hezbollah officials have said they will stop attacking Israeli military posts when Israel’s attack on Gaza ends. On Friday, Amir-abdollahian told reporters in Beirut that “Hezbollah and the resistance in Lebanon have courageously and wisely carried out their deterring and effective role”. He said Tehran will continue “its strong support to the resistance in Lebanon, as we consider Lebanon’s security as the security of Iran and the region”.

Body of 6-year-old killed in ‘deliberate’ Israeli fire found after 12 days,Relatives find body of Hind Rajab who had begged rescuers to send help after being trapped by Israeli military fire.,"The body of a six-year-old Palestinian girl, missing for 12 days after an Israeli tank targeted their family car in Gaza, has been found along with the bodies of two medics dispatched to look for them. The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) and the family of the girl, Hind Rajab, confirmed on Saturday that all seven people inside the car were killed, with the Palestinian relief organisation saying it lost crew members Yusuf Zeino and Ahmed al-Madhoun in the Israeli attack on civilians in Gaza City. Family members found Hind’s body along with those of her uncle and aunt and their three children near a roundabout in the city’s Tal al-Hawa suburb, the Palestinian news agency Wafa reported. Another of Hind’s uncles, Sameeh Hamadeh, said the car waspeppered with bullet holes. “The occupation deliberately targeted the ambulance upon its arrival at the scene, where it was found just metres away from the vehicle containing the trapped child Hind,” said the PRCS statement. “Despite prior coordination to allow the ambulance to reach the location to rescue the child, Hind, the occupation deliberately targeted the Palestine Red Crescent ambulance crew.” 🚨 Urgent: The Palestine Red Crescent ambulance was discovered bombed the Tal al-Hawa area of#GazaCity, resulting in the killing of crew members Yusuf Zeino and Ahmed Al-Madhoun, who had been missing since a rescue mission for the child Hind Rajab 12 days ago.#NotATarget❌…pic.twitter.com/dCgfeevTd8 — PRCS (@PalestineRCS)February 10, 2024  Earlier this month, the PRCS published an audio file in which Hind could be heard pleading on the phone with a member of the rescue team. All members of her family are believed to have been killed before her, leaving her terrified in the car with the dead bodies of her loved ones. “I’m so scared, please come. Please call someone to come and take me,” she was heard crying desperately in the call that PRCS said lasted three hours in an effort to calm the frightened child. The Israeli army had earlier said it was not aware of the incident. The PRCS had started a count of the number of hours since it lost contact with Hind and the crew in trying to attract attention to the plight of Palestinian healthcare workers, who persist under constant attacks by the Israeli army.    In an interview with Al Jazeera Arabic shortly after the family was targeted, Hind’s mother said she had managed to speak to her and an older cousin, 15-year-old Layan Hamadeh, who was with Hind in the car. “They are shooting at us. The tank is next to us,” Layan said in a recording released at the time. Then a barrage of shooting was heard, followed by screams, before the line cut out. The plight of Hind, revealed in the harrowing audio clips, underlined the impossible conditions for civilians in the face of Israel’s four-month assault on Gaza, which many governments have termed a “genocide”. Israel’s military has killed nearly 28,000 people – mostly women and children – since October 7 when Hamas fighters attacked Israel, killing more than 1,100 people and taking 253 captives, according to Israeli tallies.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/10/body-of-6-year-old-killed-in-deliberate-israeli-fire-found-after-12-days
Israeli military kills 28 after Netanyahu signals Rafah invasion plan,At least 10 children among the dead as fears of an Israeli ground assault intensify in southern Gaza.,"The Israeli military has killed at least 28 Palestinians in strikes on Rafah immediately after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signalled that an invasion of the city in southern Gaza may be close. Three air raids on residential homes in the Rafah area killed at least 28 people overnight into Saturday, according to a health official and The Associated Press journalists who saw the bodies arriving at hospitals. As with many previous Israeli air raids, each attack reportedly killed multiple members of three families, including a total of 10 children, the youngest of whom was only three months old. This came hours after Netanyahu said he had ordered the military to plan for the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of forcibly displaced Palestinians from Rafah in preparation for a ground invasion to accompany the air attacks.    Netanyahu did not provide details or a timeline, but his announcement only exacerbated widespread panic among over half of the Gaza Strip’s 2.3 million population who are now packed into Rafah. Many of them had been displaced several times before as a result ofIsrael’s war on Gaza. The Israeli leader has said clearing Rafah of the purported four Hamas battalions who are in the area would be necessary on his path to “total victory” over the group. Reporting from occupied East Jerusalem, Al Jazeera’s Rory Challands said, “At the same time, he said any massive army operation in Rafah can’t take place without the evacuation of civilians from the combat zone. He’s told the military and security establishment to come up with plans that do both.” “This is causing immense concern around the world. We’ve had the United States saying it can’t condone any operation there that doesn’t put in place a proper humanitarian plan. We’ve got the United Nations saying any forced displacement of the 1.4 million people there is out of line,” he said. Washington and other allies, as well as rights organisations,have warned Israelthat invading Rafah would lead to “disaster” and the United Nations has continued to express concern over devastating consequences for civilians. “Where are they supposed to go? How are they supposed to stay safe?” asked the UN’s humanitarian affairs and relief chief Martin Griffiths on Saturday. Many of the well over 1 million people who make up Rafah’s population today have endured unthinkable suffering.Where are they supposed to go?

The area’s largest medical facility, Nasser Hospital, is still under siege by Israeli forces whohave killed dozens in the surrounding areasusing among other things sniper fire and attack drones. About 300 overexerted medical personnel, 450 patients and some 10,000 displaced people are believed to be sheltering in the hospital, unable to leave because of Israeli fire and lack of safety elsewhere. Israel’s invasion of Gaza has killed at least about 28,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, with thousands more missing, likely remaining under rubble.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/10/israeli-military-kills-28-after-netanyahu-signals-rafah-invasion-plan
Who are the Islamic Resistance in Iraq?,And why are they exchanging fire with the US in tit-for-tat attacks around the region?,"At 9:30pm on Wednesday, a United States dronestrikehit a car in the al-Mashtal neighbourhood of east Baghdad. US Central Command claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement on X, saying it was a “unilateral strike” in retaliation for attacks on US soldiers at a base in Jordan in late January. Three men from Kataib Hezbollah, part of a coalition of militias-turned-state apparatus called the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), were killed in the US strike, including Wissam Mohammed, the commander in charge of Kataib Hezbollah’s operations in Syria, who went by the nom de guerre Abu Bakr al-Saadi. On January 28, a drone hadstrucka Jordanian-US outpost calledTower 22and killed three US soldiers. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq (IRI), an umbrella group of Iran-backed armed groups in the region, claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was carried out in response to US support for Israel’s war on Gaza. But Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said the drone attack bore the “footprints” of Kataib Hezbollah, adding, “We know Iran is behind it” but not presenting evidence. Iran has denied any involvement in the assault. In recent months, Iranian-backed groups in Iraq and Syria operating under the banner of  the IRI have launched about 170 attacks on US bases. But the attack on Tower 22 was the first to result in the deaths of US military personnel since October 18, the Pentagon said, adding that 143 Americans have been injured overall. The situation has led to what analysts described as a tit-for-tat exchange of fire between the US and Iran-backed groups in the region. On January 4, a US air strike in Baghdad killed Mushtaq Jawad Kazim al-Jawari, aka Abu Taqwa, a commander in Harakat Hizballah al-Nujaba, another PMF militia. The US said he had been involved in attacks on American personnel. “There has been an escalation in frequency but also in casualties,” Renad Mansour, a senior research fellow at the Chatham House think tank’s Middle East and North Africa Programme, told Al Jazeera. “And at the same time, this is not new. There have been moments in the past where this tit-for-tat has occurred.” Over the years since the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, a battle has played out in the country between Iran and the US for government influence. Among those working in alignment with Iran are a number of members of the PMF, a coalition of paramilitary groups that emerged in 2014 to fight ISIL (ISIS). In 2017, the PMF’s legitimacy was codified into law against the wishes of the Iraqi Ministries of Interior and Defence, and they were brought under the oversight of Iraq’s national security adviser. The main targets of US-led assassinations have been commanders in various Iraqi government-linked PMF groups. These many paramilitaries include pro-Iranian militias and some nationalist militias although in recent years the pro-Iranian faction has diluted the nationalist influence. The PMF’s leader, Faleh al-Fayyad, recently demanded that the US-led coalition withdraw from Iraq and warned that “targeting the PMF is playing with fire”. Despite the PMF’s anti-American delineation, recent attacks on the US have been credited to the Islamic Resistance in Iraq instead. The IRI is a vanguard group of armed actors from within the PMF that operates in Iraq and Syria but does not necessarily fall under the PMF’s chain of command. Despite being closely aligned with Iran, it at times act in its own interests and with its own agency. “The real objective of these attacks is to force the Americans to withdraw from Iraq and Syria,” Randa Slim, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, told Al Jazeera. The banner of the IRI is useful for both the PMF and the US, analysts said. This way, actors from the PMF and the US can trade attacks without directly implicating their partners in the Iraqi government. Members of the IRI “are on the front line and at times perform the violence on behalf of the wider networks connected to the PMF or Iran, which often prefer deniability”, Mansour said. “Therefore, when something goes wrong, the PMF is not necessarily implicated, even though they fall under the same umbrella group.” After the attack on Tower 22, Kataib Hezbollah released a statement saying it would cease attacks on US interests in the region to keep from embarrassing the Iraqi government, of which the PMF is now officially an extension. But “it was an embarrassment to the Iraqi government to put that in the public statement in itself,” Slim said. Whether Kataib Hezbollah resumes operations in response to Wednesday night’s assault by the US remains to be seen. The US has repeatedly stated it is trying to avoid a wider regional war despite many actors in the region declaring that their actions are connected to US backing of Israel’s war on Gaza. Analysts said the recent US actions amount to an intensification but were also to be expected after the killing of US military personnel. “The red line for the American presidents, including [Donald] Trump, has always been the death [of US soldiers],” Slim said. But the US government may be strategically backing itself into a corner. Domestically, President Joe Biden has come under pressure from parts of the Washington establishment to respond with strength against these attacks. Some have even called for direct attacks on Iran, such as Senator Lindsey Graham who, after the Tower 22 attack, said: “Hit Iran now. Hit them hard.” However, repeated assassinations, targeting of PMF weapons depots and increased US sanctions have had little impact on the Iran-backed groups’ behaviour. “The problem for the US is that their policy options and strategic thinking are often limited and incoherent so as to make its approach ineffective,” Mansour said. “The US has killed senior leaders from these resistance groups – including Qassem Soleimani and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, who was the leader of Kataib Hezbollah – and yet these groups are still operating and still moving back and forth between the [Syrian and Iraqi] borders. “One has to wonder if it would work or how it would look because, until now, the kinetic response of American intervention against Islamic resistance groups hasn’t altered their behaviour or weakened their influence. “On the contrary, they’ve become more powerful since.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/10/analysis-who-is-the-islamic-resistance-in-iraq
Football fever grips Jordan before historic AFC Asian Cup 2023 final,"An-Nashama’s Asian Cup success has enthralled Jordanians, many of whom are scrambling for last-minute flights to Qatar.","Amman, Jordan– For Mohammad Trakhan, a cafe owner in Amman, tennis has always been the sport of choice despite living in a football-mad country. He demonstrates his passion for the game by swinging an imaginary racquet before squeezing a glass of fresh orange juice at his colourful rustic cafe perched upon a hill in the Jordanian capital. This week, however, the 37-year-old has shifted his focus to football. Jordan are in the Asian Cup final for the first time in their history and Trakhan, the reluctant football fan, predicts a 3-1 win for his side over favourites Qatar. Football fever has truly gripped the country of 11 million people. On Tuesday night, when the referee’s full-time whistle confirmed Jordan’s semifinal victory over the mighty South Korea in the AFC Asian Cup 2023, thousands of people poured into the streets to celebrate. Traffic ground to a standstill as fans draped in Jordanian keffiyehs waved flags, belted out football chants and burst into impromptu performances of the traditional dabke dance. In a central thoroughfare located by a quiet residential area, teenagers fired makeshift flares by lighting the spray from aerosol cans, while others climbed on each other, causing the crowd to sway as they lost balance. Stern-faced police officers blared their sirens as they attempted to move the joyous throngs of fans along, but drowned out by the raucous crowds, they soon conceded defeat and stood aside. Jordan are ranked 78th in FIFA’s team rankings and their historic footballing achievement has captivated the nation. The fervent atmosphere has sparked an interest in the game for the uninitiated, including Mohammad al-Khayyat, a gregarious marketing manager, who admittedly does not watch a lot of football. “It’s the first time we have reached the final of this tournament, and we are all in shock,” he tells Al Jazeera. “We are asking ourselves: Wait, are we France or Argentina now?” The reference to the Qatar World Cup 2022 finalists is not the only hyperbole. For many Jordanians, including 23-year-old shop assistant Anas Awad, Tuesday evening was the “best night for Jordan”. Looking out at a bustling street in downtown Amman, Awad says the party will be much bigger on Saturday night if Jordan win the final. While most fans of the an-Nashama (the gentlemen) are betting on a win for their team, the more serious ones predict a difficult game. Waseem Mustafa, a sales assistant and avid kickboxer, draws on his own experience in sports and urges caution against predicting an easy win. “Qatar are a strong team,” he says, as he looks at the floor with furrowed brows before going with a 2-1 win to Jordan anyway. Awad, the shop assistant, says he has been impressed with tournament hosts Qatar. He says he would have flown out to see the game at Lusail Stadium if he “had been wealthier”. Thousands of Jordanians have been happy to splash out on the final, be it with last-minute flights to Doha or buying the football team’s shirts in local markets. Sales of replica Jordan football shirts have gone through the roof at Mustafa’s shop. His store manager desperately orders new batches over WhatsApp to meet the demand as a proud father places an order for his three children. A local travel agency told Al Jazeera they had been inundated with requests by football fans desperate to fly to Qatar. A new CHAMPION? Or a REPEAT? 🏆#AsianCup2023#HayyaAsiapic.twitter.com/1TYHONOxNy — AFC Asian Cup Qatar 2023 (@Qatar2023en)February 9, 2024  An-Nashama’s success is the talk of the town, but not everyone celebrated the win on Tuesday. Mohammed al-Barghuti, a soft-spoken customer at a popular clothes store in central Amman, chose to watch the game at home out of respect for the Palestinians facing the wrath of Israel’s war on Gaza. “I felt [we] couldn’t celebrate in public when humans are being killed,” he said solemnly. “If not for the war, you would have seen 10 times more celebrations on the streets than you saw on Tuesday.” Jordan is home to more than two million registered Palestinian refugees, according to UNRWA. Yahya Nasser, a 21-year-old trainee barber and pastry chef, has no intention of celebrating if Jordan wins. Football, he says, is the last thing on his mind. Being a Jordanian of Palestinian origin, he cannot enjoy anything when he sees his people “fighting for their land and their lives”. Trakhan, the cafe owner, is originally from Palestine and says that although he does not mind other people celebrating, he will watch the final in a subdued atmosphere, perhaps on his phone with a few friends.

Demands for Canada to stop supplying weapons to Israel grow louder,But loopholes and a lack of transparency stall efforts to hold government accountable for its role in arming Israel.,"Montreal, Canada –Human rights advocates are accusing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government of misleading the public over weapons sales to Israel, which have come under greater scrutiny amid the deadly Israelibombardment of Gaza. At issue is legislation that prohibits the government from exporting military equipment to foreign actors if there is a risk it can be used in human rights abuses. But regulatory loopholes, combined with a lack of clarity over what Canada sends to Israel, have complicated efforts to end the transfers. Dozens of Canadian civil society groups this monthurgedTrudeau to end arms exports to Israel, arguing they violate Canadian and international law because the weapons could be used in the Gaza Strip. But in the face ofmounting pressuresince Israel’s war on Gaza began on October 7, Canada’s foreign affairs ministry has tried to downplay the state’s role in helping Israel build its arsenal. “Global Affairs Canada can confirm that Canada has not received any requests, and therefore not issued any permits, for full weapon systems for major conventional arms or light weapons to Israel for over 30 years,” the department told Al Jazeera in an email on Friday. “The permits which have been granted since October 7, 2023, are for the export of non-lethal equipment.” But advocates say this misrepresents the total volume of Canada’s military exports to Israel, which totalled more than $15m ($21.3m Canadian) in 2022, according to the government’s own figures. It also shines a spotlight on the nation’s longstanding lack of transparency around these transfers.    “Canadian companies have exported over [$84m, $114m Canadian] in military goods to Israel since 2015 when the Trudeau government was elected,” said Michael Bueckert, vice president of Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East, an advocacy group. “And they have continued to approve arms exports since October 7 despite the clearrisk of genocidein Gaza,” Bueckert told Al Jazeera. “Unable to defend its own policy, this government is misleading Canadians into thinking that we aren’texporting weaponsto Israel at all. As Canadians increasingly demand that their government impose an arms embargo on Israel, politicians are trying to pretend that the arms trade doesn’t exist.” While Canada may not transfer full weapons systems to Israel, the two countries enjoy “a consistent arms trade relationship”, said Kelsey Gallagher, a researcher at Project Ploughshares, a peace research institute. The vast majority of Canada’s military exports to Israel come in the form of parts and components. These typically fall into three categories, Gallagher explained: electronics and space equipment; military aerospace exports and components; and finally, bombs, missiles, rockets and general military explosives and components. But beyond these broad categories, which were gleaned by examining Canada’s own domestic and international reports on weapons exports, Gallagher said it remains unclear “what these actual pieces of technology are”. “We don’t know what companies are exporting them. We don’t know exactly what their end use is,” he told Al Jazeera. Global Affairs Canada did not immediately respond to Al Jazeera’s question about what “non-lethal equipment” the government has approved for export to Israel since October 7.    “What does this mean? No one knows because there’s no definition of that and it really could be quite a number of things,” said Henry Off, a Toronto-based lawyer and board member of the group Canadian Lawyers for International Human Rights (CLAIHR). Human rights lawyers and activists also suspect that Canadian military components are reaching Israel via the United States, including for installation in fighter jets such as theF-35 aircraft. But these transfers are difficult to track because a decades-old deal between Canada and the US – 1956’s Defence Production Sharing Agreement – has created “a unique and comprehensive set of loopholes that are afforded to Canadian arms transfers to the US”, said Gallagher. “These exports are treated with zero transparency. There is no regulation of, or reporting of, the transfer of Canadian-made military components to the US, including those that could be re-transferred to Israel,” he said. The result, he added, is that “it is very difficult to challenge what are problematic transfers if we do not have the information with which to do so”. Despite these hurdles, Canadian human rights advocates are pressuring the government to end its weapons sales to Israel, particularly in light of the Israeli military’s continued assault on Gaza. Nearly 28,000 Palestinians have been killed over the past four months and rights advocates have meticulously documented the impact on the ground of Israel’s indiscriminate bombing, and its vast destruction of the enclave. The world’s top court, the International Court of Justice, also determined last month that Palestinians in Gaza face aplausible risk of genocide. Against that backdrop, eliminating weapons transfers to Israel is effectively a demand for “Canada [to] abide by its own laws”, said Off, the Toronto lawyer. That’s because Canada’s Export and Import Permits Act obliges the foreign minister to “deny exports and brokering permit applications for military goods and technology … if there is a substantial risk that the items would undermine peace and security”. The minister should also deny exports if they “could be used to commit or facilitate serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights laws” or in “serious acts of gender-based violence or serious acts of violence against women and children”, the law states.    Meanwhile, Canada is also party to the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), a United Nations pact that bans transfers if states have knowledge the arms could be used in genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and other violations of international law. But according to Off, despite a growing list ofIsraeli human rights violationssince October 7, Canada “has been approving the transfer of military goods and technology that might fuel” them. Late last month, Canadian Lawyers for International Human Rights wrote a letter to Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly demanding an immediate end to the transfers. The group said it would consider next steps, including possible legal action, if action is not taken. Still, Canada insists that it maintains one of the strongest arms export control regimes in the world. Asked whether his government intends to end arms transfers to Israel, Trudeau said in Parliament on January 31 that Canada “puts human rights and protection of human rights at the centre of all our decision-making”. “It has always been the case and we have been consistent in making sure that we are responsible in the way we do that. We will continue to be so,” the prime minister said. Gallagher, at Project Ploughshares, told Al Jazeera, however, that Canada maintains “a level of permissibility” in choosing which countries it chooses to arm, including Israel. “More than [27,000] Palestinians killed, the vast majority civilians; much of the Gaza Strip absolutely destroyed,” he said, referring to Israel’s offensive. “This is obviously an operation that is not being conducted within the bounds of international humanitarian law, which should be colouring the risk assessment performed by Canadian officials.” And while Canadian weapons exports to the Israeli government pale in comparison to other countries – notably the US, which sends billions of dollars inmilitary aid to Israelannually – Off said, “Any difference is a difference.” “It takes a village to make these instruments of death and it should make a difference if we cut off Canada’s contributions,” he told Al Jazeera, adding that the pressure on Canada also sends a message to other countries “potentially aiding and abetting Israel’s slaughter of Gaza”. “If you send arms to countries committing serious violations of international humanitarian law, you will be held to account.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/9/demands-for-canada-to-stop-supplying-weapons-to-israel-grow-louder
"UNICEF says 700,000 children in Sudan face life-threatening malnutrition","As the war continues, the UN agency warns tens of thousands of children will ‘likely die’ without more aid.","At least 700,000 children in Sudan are likely to suffer from the worst form of malnutrition this year, and tens of thousands could die, the United Nations children’s agency has warned. A 10-month war in Sudan between its armed forces and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has devastated the country’s infrastructure, prompted warnings of famine and displaced millions of people inside and outside the country. “The consequences of the past 300 days means that more than 700,000 children are likely to suffer from the deadliest form of malnutrition this year,” James Elder, spokesperson for UNICEF, told a press conference in Geneva on Friday. “UNICEF won’t be able to treat more than 300,000 of those without improved access and without additional support. In that case, tens of thousands would likely die.” Elder defined the most dangerous form of malnutrition as severe acute malnutrition, which makes a child more likely to die from diseases such as cholera and malaria. He said 3.5 million children were projected to suffer severe acute malnutrition. UNICEF provides “ready-to-use therapeutic food”, or RUTF, a life-saving food item that treats severe wasting in children under five years old, to Sudan. Elder said there had also been a “500 percent increase” in just one year in murders, sexual violence and recruitment of children to fight. “That equates to terrifying numbers of children killed, raped or recruited. And these numbers are the tip of the iceberg,” he said, reiterating the urgent need for a ceasefire, and for more aid.    Catherine Russell, the executive director of UNICEF, echoed Elder’s comments. The “lethal combination of malnutrition, mass displacement, and disease” is quickly growing, she warned in a statement. “We need safe, sustained, and unimpeded humanitarian access across conflict lines and across borders – and we need international support to help sustain the essential services and systems that children rely on for survival,” she said. UNICEF is appealing for $840m to help slightly more than 7.5 million children in Sudan this year, but Elder deplored the lack of funds collected in previous appeals. “Despite the magnitude of needs, last year, the funding UNICEF sought for nearly three-quarters of children in Sudan was not forthcoming,” Elder said. The UN on Wednesday urged countries not to forget the civilians caught up in the war in Sudan, appealing for $4.1bn to meet their humanitarian needs and support those who have fled to neighbouring countries. Half of Sudan’s population – approximately 25 million people – need humanitarian assistance and protection, while more than 1.5 million people have fled to the Central African Republic, Chad, Egypt, Ethiopia and South Sudan, according to the UN. “The world needs to stop turning a blind eye,” he said. “Where is our collective humanity if we allow this situation to continue.”   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/9/unicef-says-700000-children-in-sudan-face-life-threatening-malnutrition
Israeli snipers kill 21 civilians outside Gaza’s besieged Nasser Hospital,"Rights groups say repeated attacks on medical facilities, doctors and ambulances must be investigated for war crimes.","Israeli snipers have killed at least 21 Palestinians after they opened fire on displaced civilians trying to reach Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza’s Khan Younis. Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting fromRafah, said on Friday that snipers had surrounded the hospital and were “shooting at every moving object” as people were trying to reach it from two densely populated residential neighbourhoods near the facility. “The area around the hospital is very dangerous, and it has turned into a combat zone,” he said, noting that the hospital is the only place right now in Khan Younis that has some water left. Rights groups said the Israeli military’srepeated attacks on medical facilities, doctors, nurses, medics and ambulances must be investigated for war crimes. “Hospitals and other medical facilities are civilian objects that have special protections under international humanitarian law or the laws of war,” Human Rights Watch noted. Mahmoud said this represents a “new trend of targeted killings” by Israeli snipers, who shoot Palestinians in the streets. People inside the medical facility would also become easy targets by trying to retrieve the bodies. “Attack drones also targeted a group of young people who gathered on the roof of the hospital. Because of the communications blackout, they were trying to get signals for the internet on their mobile phones so they could communicate with family members,” Mahmoud reported.    Along with al-Amal Hospital, Nasser Hospital is the largest in Khan Younis. Both medical facilities have been under siege for weeks as the Israeli army said it “encircled” the area and ramped up its offensive from air, land and sea. Many Palestinians, who had been forcibly displaced by previous Israeli attacks in other areas, are now left with few options inside Nasser Hospital, along with limited medical staff and patients, all of whom have little to eat or drink. The Israeli military has destroyed or heavily damageddozens of medical facilitiesacross the Gaza Strip since the start of the war on October 7.  The Palestine Red Crescent Society said on Friday that al-Quds Hospital in northern Gaza City also suffered significant damage as a result of being fired on by Israeli tanks. “The Israeli army deliberately targeted the society’s headquarters and vehicles to put them out of service,” Red Crescent spokesperson Raed al-Nims said. This is while hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have been in the past few weeks forced to flee Khan Younis to Rafah further south, which lies at the border with Egypt. More than half of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million is now in Rafah, the last place previously designated a “safe zone” by the Israeli army. Israel has said it plans to launch aground assault on Rafahsoon, ignoring warnings of a “catastrophe” by the United States and the United Nations. “I think that we should push to avoid the tragedy instead of pushing for things to facilitate the tragedy,” said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Friday after being asked if he would urge for the border with Egypt to be opened to displace Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip.

"In Tunisia, the families of El Hancha’s disappeared fight to find them",They have vowed to continue their fight till they find out what happened to their disappeared loved ones.,"The families of 37 Tunisians from El Hancha near Sfax who went missing at sea have taken their protest to the capital over what they say is official silence about their missing relatives. Relatives of the missing people, aged between 13 and 35, said they received phone calls from their family members on board the boat at around 2:30pm on January 11. However, by 10pm, all contact had been lost. The boat has remained lost since. In the wake of the disappearance, extensive searches have been undertaken by Tunisia’s coast guard, supported by teams from Italy and Malta. But search operations appear to have faltered, with the last official comment on the issue coming by way of a press release in mid-January. Fatma Jlaiel, whose 25-year-old brother Ali is missing, was among the families who travelled to the Syndicat National des Journalistes Tunisiens in Tunis on Tuesday, trying to bypass officials and take their case directly to the media. “No one has contacted us from the government,” Fatma Jlaiel, whose brother, 25-year-old Ali, is among the missing. “The whole of El Hancha is miserable,” she told a translator. “All you hear in the street are questions about news or rumours. Everyone you meet is hollow-eyed. “Our mothers are sick. We’re constantly checking their blood pressure and sugar levels. They’re devastated. “It’ll shortly be a month since the boat disappeared,” she said. “We’ve been receiving bits of information from here and there, but we’re doing most of the work ourselves. We’re undertaking the investigations the police are supposed to do,” she said. Ali was one of the thousands of Tunisians who made their way without papers across one of the world’s most dangerous migratory routes. Unable to secure regular employment at home, his most recent job had been as a nighttime security guard in Sfax, some 50km (30 miles) distant, which barely left him with enough money for coffee and cigarettes, his brother Mohammed said. In the absence of official information, a variety of theories are taking hold within a population starved of information and desperate for news of family members. Rumours that the boat may have foundered off the island of Kerkennah, near Sfax, the country’s principal departure point for irregular migration, have been dismissed by relatives over a lack of evidence. Other theories, like that the boat may have been diverted to Greece, have been investigated and dismissed by the El Hancha families. Likewise, Tunisians in Italy have gone as far as appointing lawyers to work with authorities in scouring the detention centres where irregular arrivals are often held. Contacted by Al Jazeera – and stressing he had no knowledge of the case – Italian prosecutor Salvatore Vella, who deals extensively with undocumented migration, said it was unlikely the disappeared Tunisians had arrived in Italy. “Typically, the first thing Tunisians do on arrival is contact their families,” he said. That they had not done so, he said, did not bode well. For the El Hancha families – refusing to accept that their relatives may have been lost at sea – Libya, some 320km (200 miles) distant, remains an increasingly tantalising, prospect. Armed gangs from western Libya have long traded in the labour of captured refugees, often intercepting convoys of undocumented Black migrants as they seek to cross into the country and bringing them to detention centres where conditions are reported to border upon the medieval. Ali Buzriba, deputy for the Libyan coastal town of Zawiya told Italian news agency Nova that no boats from Tunisia had arrived in the region in the days after the El Hancha boat’s departure, saying that the seas had been particularly rough at that time. In addition, Buzriba said he had contacted the head of the maritime division of Libya’s Stability Support Apparatus who also had no information on the missing boat. Majdi Karbai, a member of parliament who is in contact with the El Hancha families, told Al Jazeera that Tunisian authorities’ silence on the issue was because of the character of Tunisian officialdom, as well as concern over the implications of any statement. “They do not talk to the citizens, they do not talk to the press. Their concern is that this may lead to a repeat of the previous unrest at Zarzis,” he said, referring to the disturbances that followed the loss of a boat carrying 17 Tunisians from the small southern town two years ago, which eventually became a national incident. “The families have this idea that as long as there are no bodies, their relatives are alive.” On the phone from El Hancha, Fatma is still angry. “We need the government’s help and that of the Ministry of Interior’s,” she said of the department with overall responsibility for the search. “All we’ve been given is a phone number to call when we hear news from our sources. That’s what we do: call the police ourselves to say that our children might be at a certain place.” “We need to know where our flowers are,” she said, referring to her term for the missing passengers, “We need our government to do its job and look for our precious kids. We’re devastated.” More than 97,000 people crossed the Mediterranean from Tunisia to Italy in 2023, according to the UNHCR, the majority of those transiting through Tunisia from sub-Saharan Africa. Of those, at least 2,500 are thought to have died. The true number is likely far higher.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/9/in-tunisia-the-families-of-el-hanchas-disappeared-fight-to-find-them
"Israel ramps up deadly attacks on Gaza’s Rafah despite US, UN warnings",US tells Israel it won’t support ‘unplanned’ Rafah offensive as President Biden calls Gaza attacks ‘over the top’.,"Israel is ramping up itsattacks on Rafahas it prepares to mount a ground offensive despite warnings of catastrophic consequences for displaced Palestinians and the United States saying it won’t back an assault on the southern Gaza Strip because it would be a “disaster”. The Israeli military launched several rounds of air strikes and tank shelling on Rafah on Thursday and Friday. At least three children were among eight people killed on Friday morning inIsraeli attacks on homesin Rafah, the Palestinian state news agency, Wafa, reported. Five of those killed were members of one family. “We have our backs to the [border] fence and faces towards the Mediterranean. Where should we go?” asked Emad, 55, a father of six, who fled to Rafah with his family. Four people were also killed and a number injured in the bombing of a kindergarten housing displaced people in az-Zawayda, and one person was killed in a bombing in Deir el-Balah, both in central Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials have said they are planning to expand their military offensive in Gaza to include Rafah, where more than half of the enclave’s population of 2.3 million has been forcibly displaced, some multiple times, as a result of unyielding Israeli attacks.    The US, the main military and financial backer of Israel and its war on Gaza, has cautioned against a large-scale offensive into Rafah, warning of “disaster” because of the large number of civilians sheltering in the city, which Israel had declared a“safe zone”and where it told them to flee. US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Thursday that the White House “would not support” such an operation, and a Department of State spokesperson said there appears to be “no planning and little thought” for such a move by Tel Aviv, noting that Rafah was also a crucial entry point for humanitarian aid. US President Joe Biden told reporters Israel’s conduct in Gaza has been “over the top”. The Biden administration said it issued a memorandum laying out the standards that countries receiving US military aid must adhere to. The memorandum does not outline new guidelines but calls for the State Department to receive written assurances from countries that they will abide by current US standards. For the first time, it also requires the US government to submit an annual report to Congress on whether countries are meeting those requirements. The memorandum was issued after Israel has killed about 28,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, and left much of the Gaza Strip in ruins. In a report on Friday, The New York Times cited unnamed senior US army intelligence officers as saying Israel has killed only one-third of Hamas fighters, meaning it is far from its stated goal of “total victory” over the Palestinian group. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a post on X that an Israeli incursion into Rafah would “exponentially increase what is already a humanitarian nightmare with untold regional consequences”. Half of Gaza’s population is now crammed into Rafah with nowhere to go. Reports that the Israeli military intends to focus next on Rafah are alarming. Such an action would exponentially increase what is already a humanitarian nightmare with untold regional consequences. — António Guterres (@antonioguterres)February 8, 2024  UNICEF, the organisation’s agency for children, also warned that more than 600,000children and their families have been displacedto Rafah, many of them more than once. The US, Qatar and Egypt have been mediating talks between Israel and Hamas for a truce with no tangible results so far. Israel this week rejected terms set out by Hamas, which demanded an end to the fighting and the withdrawal of the Israeli army from Gaza as part of an agreement that would also include an exchange of prisoners and more aid into the strip. Rafah sits along the Palestinian territory’s closed border with Egypt, which is also the main entry point for the limited humanitarian aid finding its way into the Gaza Strip after clearing stringent Israeli checks. Cairo has warned that any ground operation there or mass displacement of Palestinians into its Sinai Peninsula would jeopardise its four-decade-old peace treaty with Israel.

UAE in talks to develop $22bn beach land in Egypt,"Such a major agreement could boost the Egyptian economy, which is facing a dire foreign exchange crisis.","The United Arab Emirates is in advanced talks to purchase and develop a large piece of land on Egypt’s Mediterranean coast in a deal that could bolster the troubled economy of the North African nation. An UAE consortium has been picked to work with Egyptian partners to develop the land in Ras el-Hekma, about 350km (217 miles) northwest of Cairo, an Egyptian official was quoted by CNBC Arabia on Wednesday as saying. Hossam Heiba, the chief executive officer of the state-run General Authority for Investment and Free Zones, told the broadcaster that the initial estimate for the total project was $22bn and that an agreement was expected soon. He did not provide further details, nor name any companies or entities. On Thursday, Egypt’s cabinet said the government was preparing to announce new projects that will “earn huge amounts of foreign currency” and create hundreds of thousands of new jobs in an apparent reference to a multibillion-dollar development planned along the Mediterranean coast in an area of upscale luxury resorts. The emirate of Abu Dhabi, one of seven in the UAE and the country’s capital, is involved in the project, according to unnamed people familiar with the talks quoted by US outlet Bloomberg, which also reported that Egypt may retain ownership of about 20 percent of the vast territory spanning 180 million square metres. It said the minority stake would include a share for the Talaat Moustafa Group, a real estate developer, and some Egyptian state entities, adding that no final decision has been taken. The major deal could strengthen ties betweenEgypt and the UAE, a chief backer of Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi that has previously offered economic support in the form of investments or other assistance. Egypt is dealing with its worst foreign exchange crisis in decades, having undergone several currency devaluations, and is expected to enact another one soon – its fourth since early 2022. A foreign currency boost could also positively impact Egypt’s talks with theInternational Monetary Fund(IMF) on a major loan, that may bring in other partners and secure some $10bn in financing. Egypt is due to repay heavy foreign debts this year and the IMF has been pushing it to sell state assets, make space for the private sector and allow its currency to trade flexibly. An IMF team was in Egypt last month to negotiate the revival and possible expansion of a $3bn loan agreement which faltered soon after it was signed in December 2022. Egypt, along with Qatar, is a key mediator in talks aimed at endingIsrael’s war on Gaza, starting with another pause in hostilities and the exchange of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails for captives being held in the enclave.

Israel escalates Rafah bombardment as US warns of a ‘disaster’,Growing fears among more than a million displaced people in Rafah as Israel threatens large operation in the city.,"Israeli forces bombed areas in the southern border city of Rafah, where more than half of Gaza’s internally displaced population is sheltering, as the United States warned that a military push into the city could be a “disaster”. Aid agencies have warned of a humanitarian catastrophe if Israel follows through on its threat to enter Rafah, where people are desperate for shelter and one of the last remaining areas of the Gaza Strip into which its troops have not moved. “To conduct such an operation right now with no planning and little thought in an area” where one million people are sheltering “would be a disaster,” State Department deputy spokesman Vedant Patel said on Thursday. He said Washington had “yet to see any evidence of serious planning for such an operation”. Earlier, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that more than a million civilians were trapped in the city in southern Gaza. “Half of Gaza’s population is now crammed into Rafah. They have nowhere to go,” he said. Palestinians in Gaza are desperately hoping a ceasefire could arrive in time to head off the threatened Israeli assault on Rafah, hard against Gaza’s southern border fence and now home to more than a million people, many of them in makeshift tents. Israeli planes bombed parts of the city on Thursday morning, residents said, killing at least 14 people in attacks on two houses. Tanks also shelled some areas in eastern Rafah, intensifying the residents’ fears of an imminent ground assault.    The warnings come as diplomats sought to salvage ceasefire talks after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected a Hamas proposal. In a sign that the diplomacy was not over, a Hamas delegation led by senior official Khalil Al-Hayya arrived in Cairo on Thursday for ceasefire talks with key mediators Egypt and Qatar. Netanyahu said on Wednesday terms proposed by Hamas for a ceasefire were “delusional”, and pledged to fight on, saying victory was in reach and just months away. Despite Israel’s rejection of the Hamas proposal, more talks are planned. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who met mediators this week on his fifth trip to the region since the start of the war, said he still saw room for negotiations. Blinken also said that the civilian death toll was too high and reiterated that Israel’s operation should put civilians first. “And that’s especially true in the case of Rafah, where there are somewhere between 1.2 and 1.4 million people, many of them displaced from other parts of Gaza,” he said. He said he had suggested some ways to minimise harm in talks with Israeli leaders, but gave no details. Blinken departed to return to the US on Thursday afternoon. The Hamas delegation in Egypt is expected to meet officials including Egyptian intelligence chief Abbas Kamel, Egyptian security sources said. Hamas proposed a ceasefire of four and a half months, during which all hostages would go free, Israel would withdraw its troops and an agreement would be reached on an end to the Israeli offensive. Its offer was a response to a proposal drawn up by US and Israeli spy chiefs with Qatar and Egypt, and delivered to Hamas last week.    Hamas says it will not agree to any deal that does not include an end to the offensive and Israeli withdrawal. Israel says it will not withdraw or stop fighting until Hamas is eradicated. Israel began its large-scale military offensive after Hamas fighters killed 1,139 people and took 253 hostages in southern Israel on October 7, according to Israeli tallies. Israel’s military said on Thursday that, during the past day, its troops had killed more than 20 fighters in Gaza’s main southern city Khan Younis, now the site of some of the war’s most intense fighting. Gaza’s Health Ministry said at least 27,840 Palestinians have been confirmed killed, and more than 67,000 injured since the war began. The Israeli bombardment continued in Khan Younis and Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, killing Palestinian television journalist, Nafez Abdel-Jawwad, and his son. At least 124 journalists and media representatives have been killed in the enclave so far, Gaza’s information ministry said. Philippe Lazzarini, head of the main UN aid agency for Palestinians, UNRWA, said on X that the agency had not been permitted to bring food to areas where people are on the verge of famine.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/8/israel-escalates-rafah-bombardment-as-us-warns-of-a-disaster
"Tunisia’s press, civil society silent as Ghannouchi sentenced, analysts say",Analysts and rights groups have pointed to the muted response to Ennahdha leader Rachid Ghannouchi’s latest criminal conviction as an indicator of the president’s authoritarian reach.,"Tunisian media had little to say about the sentencing of Rachid Ghannouchi, leader of the self-styled Muslim democrats, Ennahdha, and former speaker of parliament, to an additional three years’ imprisonment, providing some indication of the extent of the president’s current authoritarian reach, analysts say. The 82-year-old Ghannouchi was sentenced along with his son-in-law, former Foreign Minister Rafik Abdessalem, for receiving foreign funding, illegal under Tunisian law. At the time of sentencing, Abdessalem was overseas while Ghannouchi was already in jail, having already been found guilty of “incitement” last year. Abdessalam had left Tunisia after he was convicted of having defamed the Post Office after he accused the body of having shared citizens’ savings with the government. A fine of about $1.17m, said to be the amount of overseas donations to the party, was imposed on the party. Significance Ennahdha has played a critical role throughout Tunisia’s post-revolutionary history, featuring prominently in most of the country’s governments and helping define the 2014 Constitution, which remained in place until the current President Kais Saied’s revisions of 2022. Throughout this period, Ghannouchi has played an outsize role in Tunisian politics, dominating headlines and serving as a frequent lightning rod for popular dissent. However, little of that hold on the popular imagination was on display following his sentencing. No mention was visible on any of the country’s newsstands, with the state-owned La Presse leading on Saied’s visit to a paper factory, rather than the Ennahdha leaders’ legal difficulties. Saied’s influence on Tunisian media since his dramatic power grab of July 2021, labelled a coup by his opponents, has had a chilling effect on the national conversation, observers claim. In 2021, the president had shuttered parliament and dismissed both independent Prime Minister Hichem Mechichi and Speaker Ghannouchi to a groundswell of support from a public beleaguered by years of false promises, a declining economy and soaring unemployment rates. Among a plethora of initiatives introduced by the untethered president during this period were new laws designed to reshape the judiciary, as well as strict laws governing freedom of expression in Tunisia. Return to authoritarianism “It’s like everyone already knew the rules of the game,” Tunisian political author Amine Snoussi, who now lives in France, said. “The journalists, editors and producers simply switched back to how they operated under the pre-revolutionary regime. The authoritarian machine was always there, just waiting,” he said. “I have some fairly profound political differences with Ghannouchi, but I never felt under threat from him,” Snoussi continued. “Some years ago, I even started a petition calling for him to be investigated for any links he may have had to two past political murders [strenuously denied by Ghannouchi]. It never occurred to me that he would, or could, target me. I can’t imagine doing the same under Kais Saied, it’s unthinkable,” he said. Decree Law 54, introduced by Saied in September 2022 – ostensibly to restrict the sharing of false information on electronic networks – and increased readiness to launch legal actions based on the country’s existing laws, have already seen more than 20 journalists and online activists jailed or being investigated for what critics say are free speech issues. In addition, the president’s political opponents, ranging from Ennahdah members to the party’s most vocal critic, the leader of the secular Parti destourien libre, Abir Moussi, have all found themselves imprisoned on charges denounced by rights groups as political. Snoussi describes watching as the president dismantled any source of potential opposition to his rule. “We all thought it couldn’t happen,” he said. “We had these protests about … police violence [and] Manich Msamah,” he said of the opposition group founded to oppose former President Beji Caid Essebsi’s attempts to reconcile with members of the pre-revolutionary regime. “Lawyers, jurists and civil society activists, all thought we wouldn’t be back here.” While vestiges of Tunisia’s once formidable civil society groups remain, most recently finding a voice in condemnation of Israel’s war on Gaza, a theme that chimes with one of the president’s passion projects, it is unarguable that the movement is a shadow of its former self. “It’s worth noting that civil society is today more threatened than at any time since 2011,” Salsabil Chellali, Tunisia director at Human Rights Watch, said of the muted response to Ghannouchi’s newest prison sentence. “In addition to being demonised by President Saied and his supporters, it is also facing increasing restrictions on its activities. The authorities’ repressive measures are undeniably contributing to a climate of fear and the gradual dismantling of the civil society dynamic,” she said. The case Both Ennahdha and Ghannouchi’s lawyers have released statements rejecting the accusations of receiving foreign funding, which they say relate to a separate organisation, the Ennahdha Party Diaspora Group, which is registered overseas. According to a statement released by the party following Ghannouchi’s sentencing, Ennahdha had no overseas representation, with the party only retaining one bank account which, they said, was “under the supervision of all judicial and financial institutions and is fully transparent and flawless”. A separate statement issued by Ghannouchi’s lawyers pointed to what they said were shortcomings in the trial and restrictions on their freedom to access evidence. Nevertheless, despite what the party sees as the injustice of the verdict, Ennahdha has no plans to appeal it. “Why?” Ennahdha party member and former minister of youth, Ahmed Gaaloul, said. “There’s no chance of it succeeding. There’s no chance of justice in Tunisia, no chance of a fair trial anymore. “This was a political decision, not a judicial one. Why would Rachid Ghannouchi put either his family or the party through an appeal? None of us, including Mr Ghannouchi, are going to help Saied repeat his propaganda, which is what we would be doing.” Further to declining to appeal the verdict, Gaaloul also confirmed that the party had no intentions of paying the $1.17m fine, an astronomical sum by Tunisian standards. “How are we supposed to raise that?” Gaaloul asked. “We don’t have it. What’s more, since the police closed all our offices [in April of last year] we can’t call upon our members to contribute towards it. “Even if we could, there are better places to spend that sort of money, we could put it to something that might actually benefit the country, rather than plug the shortfalls in Saied’s budget,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/8/tunisias-press-civil-society-silent-as-ghannouchi-sentences-analysts-say
At least 13 Sudanese asylum seekers killed after boat capsizes off Tunisia,Officials said an investigation was launched as the search was ongoing for 27 missing people.,"At least 13 Sudanese asylum seekers have died after their boat capsized off the coast of Tunisia. A Tunisian judicial official said on Thursday that 27 people were still missing after their boat sank on Wednesday, having set off from Jebiniana, a town near the Mediterranean port city of Sfax. The boat was carrying 42 people, all of them Sudanese, and two people were rescued, said Farid Ben Jha, a court spokesperson in the coastal Tunisian city of Monastir. The asylum seekers were likely “exploited in a human trafficking case or in the formation of a criminal group to reach Europe illegally”, he said, adding that an investigation was under way. The boat was fragile and hastily made with metal scraps, according to the investigation’s initial findings. All 42 people on the boat were asylum seekers registered with the United Nations refugee agency and were fleeingwar-torn Sudan. UN agencies have said that 10 months since the war broke out between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), half of Sudan’s population – some25 million people– needs humanitarian assistance and protection. More than 1.5 million people have fled across Sudan’s borders to the Central African Republic, Chad, Egypt, Ethiopia and South Sudan.     Tunisia and Libya are the maindeparture points for thousandsof people fleeing conflict and poverty from other parts of Africa and the Middle East who risk their lives to reach Europe. Last week, a boat carrying 37 refugees and asylum seekerswent missing off the coast of Sfax. The passengers were reported to be from the village of El Hancha in the Sfax governorate and ranged from about 13 to 35 years. Their families held protests, erected roadblocks and burned tyres around the village, only retreating when the authorities assured them that the search efforts would continue. During the first 11 months of 2023, Tunisian authorities said they intercepted 69,963 migrants, more than double the figure for the same period in 2022. According to the International Organisation for Migration, more than 2,270 people died attempting to cross the central Mediterranean in 2023, which was a 60 percent increase from the previous year.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/8/at-least-13-sudanese-migrants-killed-after-boat-capsizes-off-tunisia
Iraq condemns ‘clear-cut assassination’ operation after US strike,Baghdad says the US ‘has become a factor for instability and threatens to entangle Iraq in the cycle of conflict’.,"Iraq has denounced a US drone strike in Baghdad thatkilled a commanderof an Iran-aligned group, saying the United States-led military coalition in the country is becoming a “factor for instability”. Army spokesperson Yahya Rasool said on Thursday that repeated attacks by the US in Iraq are pushing the government to end the coalition’s mission. The US has conductedfrequent attacks, targeting Iran-backed armed groups that it said were behind missile and drone strikes on its troops in Iraq and Syria. On Wednesday night, a senior commander from Kataib Hezbollah, an Iran-backed armed group in Iraq that the Pentagon linked to an attack that killedthree US soldiersin Jordan, died in a drone strike on a vehicle in eastern Baghdad, security sources said. The vehicle targeted was used by Iraq’s Popular Mobilisation Forces, which includes dozens of armed groups, many of them close to Iran. Rasool said the US-led coalition “has become a factor for instability and threatens to entangle Iraq in the cycle of conflict”. US forces are “repeatedly and irresponsibly” carrying out a “clear-cut assassination operation”, he said, adding that such strikes fail to “care about the lives of civilians and international law”. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington was “bombing targets around the region not to fuel escalation but to prevent escalation”, according to Al Jazeera’s Shihab Rattansi, reporting from the US capital. “It’s caused clearly a lot of questions because the escalation we’ve seen around the region is directly correlated and quite openly blamed on the Israeli bombardment of Gaza,” Rattansi said. “But the one thing the US won’t do is try and stop Israel from bombing Gaza.”    Rasool said the US strikes are even more concerning because “the coalition consistently deviates from the reasons and objectives for its presence on our territory”. The US maintains several military bases in Iraq used by it and its allies to fight ISIL (ISIS). Last month, Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed al-Sudani said talks would be held to schedule anend to the coalition’s tasksin the country. “Administration officials [are] also saying this isn’t over, that there will be more attacks to come at a time and place of the US’s choosing,” Rattansi said. Iraq’s Harakat al-Nujaba movement promised a “targeted retaliation”, saying “these crimes will not go unpunished”. It said US “violations” will not cease without “a firm official position from the Iraqi government”. Palestinian group Hamas said the strikes were a “violation of Iraq’s sovereignty and security”, according to a statement. Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah group, meanwhile, said “resistance movements in the region have total confidence” in their Iraqi counterparts and the commander’s killing will only encourage them to continue acts in support of Palestinians.

Panic in hemmed-in Rafah as Israel PM orders troops to prepare ground entry,UN chief says ground invasion of city would widen the ‘humanitarian nightmare with untold regional consequences’.,"Panic is growing in Rafah over an imminent ground invasion after Israel’s prime minister ordered his military to prepare to enter the city in the southern Gaza Strip that is sheltering 1.2 million people with nowhere else to go as he rejected Hamas’s truce plan and rebuffed US efforts to reach a deal. A new round of talks aimed at securing a truce with Hamas were set to open on Thursday in Egypt after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel will not end the war and will push on until “total victory” over the Palestinian group. Visiting United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken insisted on Wednesday that he still saw “space for agreementto be reached” and was meeting on Thursday in Tel Aviv with Israel’s war cabinet members Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot to discuss the release of captives being held in Gaza. “We are on the way to an absolute victory,” Netanyahu said on Wednesday, adding that the operation would last months, not years. “There is no other solution.” Israeli air strikes overnight on Rafah – which Israel had once declared a safe zone for displaced Palestinians – killed 14 people, including five children. Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Rafah, said: “What people are experiencing in the southern part of the Gaza Strip is a surge in attacks from air, land and sea.” Safia Marouf, a displaced Palestinian who sought refuge in Rafah with her family after being uprooted from their home farther north, said she is afraid of what’s to come. “The children are scared all the time, and if we want to leave Rafah, we don’t know where to go. What will be our destiny and that of our children?”    United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said a ground invasion of Rafah would “exponentially increase what is already a humanitarian nightmare with untold regional consequences”. Al Jazeera’s Hashem Ahelbarra said the meeting in Egypt indicated that “we’re moving towards a critical phase of any potential agreement between Israel and Hamas” after senior Hamas leader Osama Hamdan said a delegation was going to Cairo. “I think we have reached a point where we’re really talking about operational aspects of the agreement, and what is happening behind closed doors is a real, genuine push towards that,” Ahelbarra said. The Muslim fasting month of Ramadan in March puts “political pressure on leaders in this part of the world”, he said, adding that if Israeli attacks continue then “I wouldn’t see a chance of any deal in the near future.” Hamas had laid out a three-phase plan to unfold over four and a half months that would see the release of all captives in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel, including senior fighters, and an end to the war. “While there are some clear non-starters in Hamas’s response, we do think it creates space for agreement to be reached, and we will work at that relentlessly,” Blinken told reporters after meeting Netanyahu to discuss the Hamas counterproposal to a truce plan drawn up by US and Israeli spy chiefs and delivered to the Palestinian group last week by Qatari and Egyptian mediators. Reporting from occupied East Jerusalem, Al Jazeera’s Rory Challands said Blinken “came to get a deal and he didn’t get it”. “He’s still going to try to bridge the huge gap between Israel and Hamas. He might be right – there might be a chance. But at the moment, he’s going back to Washington, DC, empty-handed,” Challands said on Thursday.

Paramilitary commander killed in Baghdad drone strike: Reports,"Abu Baqir al-Saadi of the Iran-backed Kataib Hezbollah group has been killed in eastern Baghdad, officials say.","A senior commander from Kataib Hezbollah, an Iran-backed armed group in Iraq that the Pentagon linked to an attack thatkilled three US troops, died in a drone strike on a vehicle in eastern Baghdad, according to security sources and media reports. One of the sources said three people were killed and that the vehicle targeted on Wednesday night was used by Iraq’s Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), a state security agency composed of dozens of armed groups, many of them close to Iran. Two officials with Iran-backed armed groups in Iraq said that senior commander Abu Baqir al-Saadi was among those killed, the Associated Press news agency reported. Local outlet Sabereen News also reported al-Saadi had been killed in the blast. Al Jazeera’s Ali Hashem, reporting from Baghdad, said that “several explosions” were heard across the Iraqi capital and that security sources said three people have been killed. Hashem said that the area where the attack took place, east of Baghdad, is “known to be a stronghold for armed factions”. Kataib Hezbollah fighters and commanders are part of the PMF, a coalition of mainly pro-Iran paramilitaries now integrated into Iraq’s regular security forces.    Three United States troops were killed in January in a drone attack near the Jordan-Syria border that the Pentagon said bore the “footprints” of Kataib Hezbollah. The group then announced it was suspending military operations against US troops in the region. Iraq and Syria have witnessed near-daily tit-for-tat attacks between Iran-backed armed groups and US forces stationed in the region since the Israeli assault on Gaza began in October. There was no immediate comment from US officials on the blast. The US struck Iran-backed Iraqi groups in Iraq and Syria last weekend in what it said was the beginning of its response to the killing of the three US soldiers in a drone attack. In January, a US drone strike killed a senior militia commander in central Baghdad, an attack Washington said came in response to drone and rocket attacks on its forces. On Wednesday, Iraqi special forces were on high alert in Baghdad and further units were deployed inside the Green Zone housing international diplomatic missions including the US embassy, a security source said.

‘Reckless’: Proposed ban on US funding for UNRWA raises alarm,Advocates say growing bipartisan support for curbs to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees is ‘concerning’ and ‘reckless’.,"A United Statessecurity billthat would curtail funding to the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees is raising alarm, as rights advocates say a years-long effort to dismantle the agency is gaining steam amid Israel’s war on Gaza. The proposed $118bn legislation, a draft of which (PDF) was blocked in the US Senate on Wednesday, includes a provision prohibiting Washington from allocating any funds to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). Seth Binder, advocacy director at the Middle East Democracy Center, said this would apply to humanitarian assistance included in the bill as well as any previously approved funds for UNRWA that have not yet been allocated, a sum totalling about $300,000. “It’s unclear … where and how this specific provision may become law, if it ever is able to,” Binder told Al Jazeera. “But it is concerning nonetheless just given recent developments.” UNRWA came under renewed scrutiny last month after the Israeli governmentaccusedaround a dozen of the agency’s more than 13,000 Gaza employees of taking part in Hamas’s attack on southern Israel on October 7, which killed a reported 1,139 people.    UNRWA immediatelysackedthe employees in question and announced that it was opening a probe into the allegations, which it described as “shocking” and “serious”. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterresalso has appointedan independent panel to investigate. Israel has yet to provide evidence to back up its allegations, butthe US and several other countriesquickly suspended funding to the agency as a result. UNRWA relies on government contributions to fund its operations in the occupied Palestinian territories, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. Against that backdrop, the Senate bill — which had the support of President Joe Biden — reflected growing bipartisan acceptance of what previously were Republican-driven attempts to curtailUNRWA, said Ethan Mayer-Rich at the Arab Center Washington DC. “We’re seeing a pretty quick departure from what used to be a split down party lines,” he told Al Jazeera. “It’s reckless, and ultimately I think history is going to see [the US] as being completely complicit in what is unquestionably an incredibly tragic and dire situation.” Mayer-Rich, the centre’s liaison for US government affairs, added that “the conversation in part is guided by the Biden administration”. “We’ve seen, at this point, an endorsement by the highest level of office that it’s OK for Democrats to call into question UNRWA’s mandate, to call into question the necessity of its mission, which has long been a Republican-guided effort,” he said. “This is a message that will have a durable impact on the way that Democrats are talking about UNRWA and the necessary services it provides.” Indeed, current attempts in the US to defund UNRWA come at a critical time. The agency is leading humanitarian aid efforts in Gaza, where Israel’s military bombardment has killed more than 27,708 Palestinians and caused wide-scale destruction since October 7. Palestinians in the besieged enclave also face dire food, water and medical shortages. The local healthcare system is near total collapse, and more than 1.7 million people have been internally displaced. Many families have sought shelter at UNRWA-run facilities. Since the Biden administration announced its UNRWA funding freeze in late January, top UN officials — as well as human rights advocates and humanitarian aid groups — have issued multiple pleas asking Washington to reconsider. The US previously provided$422m to the agencyin 2023, making it UNRWA’s largest contributor. Those funds accounted for nearly 30 percent of UNRWA’s contributions last year, explained Bill Deere, director of the agency’s Washington representative office. “If this proposal were to become law, that’s a huge hole that would have to be filled,” Deere told Al Jazeera in an email, referring to the Senate bill.    The legislation, which included more than $14bn in additional US security assistance to Israel, had the backing of the White House, but it is unlikely to reach Biden’s desk to be signed into law, particularly after Wednesday’s setback in the Senate. Top Republicanshave also saidit will be “dead on arrival” if it reaches the House of Representatives, amid calls for stricter immigration measures. Still, Deere — who described the atmosphere in Washington as a “challenging policy environment” — said the bill “demonstrates that we need to keep discussing with lawmakers the fact that UNRWA and the UN have acted swiftly and decisively in the wake of the recent news”. He also warned that the agency “will have a very hard time operating beyond March 1st if donor states do not resume their support” and stressed that UNRWA operates beyond Gaza alone. “Hundreds of thousands of Palestine refugees in the West Bank, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan will lose access to primary healthcare, direct food support, rental assistance, and education,” Deere said. “Human decency aside, such an occurrence also poses a regional stability issue.” But despite those warnings, Republicans have seized on the accusations against UNRWA to reinvigorate a years-long effort to stymie the agency. “This is something that they’ve long been trying to do, and they’ve really seized the moment,” said Mayer-Rich. At leastseven pieces of legislationaimed at defunding or disbanding UNRWA have been introduced by the Republicans in Congress since Israel’s allegations were made public, according to a tally by the Arab Center Washington DC. Republican legislatorshelda subcommittee hearing last week titled, “UNRWA Exposed: Examining the Agency’s Mission and Failures”. And a group of nearly two dozen Republican senators had called for legislation to include “an immediate and permanent prohibition” on US assistance to UNRWA. “The United States must permanently stop all contributions to UNRWA,” they said (PDF) on January 31. The push comes less than six years after former Republican President Donald TrumpendedUS assistance to the agency in 2018,sayingthat Washington was shouldering a “very disproportionate share of the burden of UNRWA’s costs”. That move — widely seen as part of the Trump administration’s hardline, pro-Israel stance —crippledUNRWA’s operations. Biden restoredfundingin 2021.    Tariq Kenney-Shawa, US policy fellow at Palestinian think tank Al-Shabaka, said Israel and its allies in the US have attacked UNRWA for decades in an effort to weaken the right of Palestinian refugees to return to what is now Israel, a long-standing demand. “What Republicans would like to see is a dismantling and defunding of UNRWA so that the Palestinian refugee ‘problem’ can fade into the annals of history,” he told Al Jazeera. While Republicans have historically been the “loudest voices” pressuring UNRWA, Kenney-Shawa explained that staunch support for Israel in the US is bipartisan. Some establishment Democrats last month quickly called to cut funding to the agency, too, following the recent allegations. He also noted the timing of the accusations against UNRWA and the US funding cut, just hours after the International Court of Justicedeterminedon January 26 that Israel was “plausibly” committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. “Representatives ofthe [Biden] administrationhave themselves emphasised the critical role that UNRWA plays in providing aid and support for Palestinian refugees and Palestinians in need,” Kenney-Shawa said. “But at the same time, I think their larger concern is providing cover for Israel at any cost — and I think that cost is Palestinian refugees and is UNRWA.” Though the Senate bill is unlikely to pass in its current form, the UNRWA provision continues to raise alarm. The US State Department acknowledged this week that the Biden administration is looking into other ways to support humanitarian efforts in Gaza because the legislation contains language that would block its ability to fund the agency. Spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters on Monday that Washington plans to “redirect funding for UNRWA to other partners to provide assistance in Gaza”, including to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the World Food Programme (WFP). The Senate bill included $1.4bn of humanitarian assistance for Gaza, Patel said. “This is tangible money that we believe will save lives and have a direct impact on Palestinian civilians.” However, the leaders of several UN agencies — including UNICEF and the WFP —saidlast week that suspending funds for UNRWA would have “catastrophic consequences” because “no other entity has the capacity to deliver” what is needed in Gaza. The International Rescue Committee and other humanitarian groups alsosaid, “UNRWA’s humanitarian role in this crisis is indispensable and cannot remotely be replaced by any other aid organization”. According to Kenney-Shawa, the future of UNRWA funding in the US right now largely hinges on the political will of the Biden administration and the Democratic Party. “If the Biden administration is truly committed to the provision of humanitarian aid to the Palestinians, like they on paper say they are, then there are avenues to push back against Republicans and make sure there is no provision within these proposed bills that automatically just cuts funding outright,” he said. But that appears unlikely, Kenney-Shawa explained, because it would mean standing up to Republicans andpro-Israel lobby groupsin an election year — and possibly appearing to challenge Israel. “I think the Republicans are, as always, … seizing the opportunity to kind of put the Biden administration between a rock and a hard place, knowing full well that, at the end of the day, the Biden administration is going to side with Israel.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/7/reckless-proposed-ban-on-us-funding-for-unrwa-raises-alarm
Blinken says ‘a lot of work’ remains on Israel-Hamas truce talks,US secretary of state meets Israeli officials as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appears to reject Hamas plan.,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said “a lot” of work remained to secure a deal on an extended truce in Israel’s war on Gaza and a captive-prisoner exchange after the Palestinian group Hamas responded to a truce proposal with its own plan. “There’s a lot of work to be done, but we are very much focused on doing that work, and hopefully being able to resume releasing hostages that was interrupted,” Blinken told reporters on Wednesday at the start of a meeting in Jerusalem with Israeli President Isaac Herzog. The top United States diplomat earlier met Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and discussed a Hamas counterproposal to a truce plan drawn up by US and Israeli spy chiefs and delivered to the Palestinian group last week by Qatari and Egyptian mediators. Hamas laid out a detailed three-phase plan to unfold over four and a half months. The plan stipulates that all hostages would be released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel, including senior fighters, and an end to the war. Netanyahu appeared to reject the Hamas plan, promising Israel would continue its military assault on Gaza until “absolute victory”. “We are on the way to an absolute victory,” the Israeli prime minister said, adding that the operation would last months, not years. “There is no other solution.” Later on Wednesday, Blinken said he believed the Hamas response “creates space” for a deal. “While there are some clear non-starters in Hamas’s response, we do think it creates space for agreement to be reached, and we will work at that relentlessly,” Blinken told reporters in Tel Aviv. An Egyptian official told the news agency AFP that “a new round of negotiations” would start on Thursday in Cairo aimed at achieving “calm in the Gaza Strip”, now in its fifth month of war. A Hamas source with knowledge of the matter said the Palestinian group had agreed to the talks, with the goal of “a ceasefire, an end to the war and a prisoner exchange deal”. More than 27,580 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its assault on the territory on October 7 after Hamas carried out an attack on southern Israel. At least 1,139 people were killed in the Hamas attack, according to an Al Jazeera tally based on official Israeli figures. Israel has bombarded Gaza relentlessly and launched a ground invasion, reducing much of the territory to rubble and displacing more than 80 percent of the population.    Blinken has been conducting intense shuttle diplomacy, crisscrossing the Middle East on Tuesday in his fifth visit to the region since the war started, and meeting with the leaders of Egypt and Qatar, countries mediating the hostage negotiations with Hamas. There remain major gaps between the two sides: Israel has previously said it would not pull its troops out of Gaza or end the war until Hamas was wiped out. A source close to the negotiations said the Hamas counterproposal did not require a guarantee of a permanent ceasefire at the outset, but that an end to the war would have to be agreed before final hostages were freed, the Reuters news agency reported. Israeli government spokesperson Avi Hyman told reporters: “We have received an update, we have received notification from the Qatari negotiators. We are looking at them. The Mossad is looking intently at what was presented to us.” Osama Hamdan, a Hamas official in Beirut, said the group “submitted its comments in a way that ensures a complete and full end of aggression andto allow aid and provide shelter to the displaced, to ensure reconstruction and lift the blockade against Gaza and to go into a prisoner swap.” During the first 45-day phase, according to the offer document seen by Reuters, all Israeli women hostages, males under 19 years old and the elderly and ill would be freed, in exchange for Palestinian women and children held in Israeli jails. Israel would withdraw troops from Gaza’s populated areas. Implementation of the second phase would not begin until the sides conclude “indirect talks over the requirements needed to end the mutual military operations and return to complete calm”. The second phase would include the release of remaining male hostages and full Israeli withdrawal from all of Gaza. The remains of the dead would be exchanged during the third phase. Ensuring more humanitarian aid reaches Gaza and is distributed to those in need also depends on an end to the fighting, officials say. For now, thewar rages on unabated in Gaza, where the health ministry said on Wednesday that at least 123 people were killed in the previous 24 hours. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that if Israel presses into Gaza’s far-southern Rafah, it “would exponentially increase what is already a humanitarian nightmare with untold regional consequences”. UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese told Al Jazeera on Wednesday that it’s critical to secure an agreement to provide aid to Gaza as soon as possible. “There is the need to deliver aid to the Palestinians, which is critical and it’s not happening,” Albanese said.

UN chief warns of ‘age of chaos’ as Security Council stays divided on Gaza,Antonio Guterres says the divisions within the UN Security Council are ‘dangerous’.,"UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned that the world is entering into an “age of chaos” as the UN Security Council remains sharply divided over Israel’s war on Gaza. Guterres said he was “especially alarmed” after Israel said last week that it intends to focus its military assault in Gaza on the southern city of Rafah, where more than a million people have sought shelter. “Such an action would exponentially increase what is already a humanitarian nightmare with untold regional consequences,” he told the UN General Assembly on Wednesday. “It is time for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and the unconditional release of all hostages,” he added. Israeli forces launched a devastating assault on Gaza with the aim to “destroy” Hamas in response to the Palestinian group’s attack on southern Israel on October 7. At least 1,139 people were killed in the Hamas attack, according to an Al Jazeera tally based on official Israeli figures. Israel has since bombarded the territory relentlessly and launched a ground invasion, leaving much of Gaza in ruins. At least 27,708 people have been killed in the Israeli assault, according to Palestinian authorities in Gaza, and more than 80 percent of the population has been displaced. In his address on Wednesday, Guterres also called for reforms to the Security Council, which has been unable to agree on a joint position on the war in Gaza despite calls from multiple UN agencies for an urgent ceasefire. “The United Nations Security Council – the primary platform for questions of global peace – is deadlocked by geopolitical fissures,” he said. “This is not the first time the Council has been divided – but it is the worst. Today’s dysfunction is deeper and more dangerous.” Guterres added that unlike during the Cold War, when “well-established mechanisms helped manage superpower relations”, those mechanisms are gone “in today’s multipolar world”. “Our world is entering an age of chaos … a dangerous and unpredictable free-for-all with total impunity,” he warned. The UN chief urged world leaders to seize the “Summit of the Future” opportunity, which will be held in September in New York on the sidelines of the annual General Assembly, to “shape multilateralism for years to come”. He also mentioned that as conflict grows worldwide and humanitarian needs are “at an all-time high,” funding was not “keeping pace”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/7/un-chief-warns-of-age-of-chaos-as-security-council-stays-divided-on-gaza
Network blackout cuts communications for millions in war-torn Sudan,All three of Sudan’s main internet providers are offline as the United Nations appeals for aid funds.,"All three of Sudan’s main internet operators were offline on Wednesday, internet observatory NetBlocks has said, cutting communications for millions of people stuck in conflict zones or fleeing for their safety. The network blackout could also freeze e-wallets that many people depend upon amid a widespread cash shortage. A source from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary has denied responsibility, the Reuters news agency reported, and the companies have not publicly blamed anyone for the outages. Two of the networks had been offline since Friday, when telecom sources and the army-aligned state news agency said the RSF had shut down the networks belonging to MTN Sudan and Sudani. Zain Sudan is now also offline, NetBlocks said. Aid agencies have warned of rising hunger in Sudan and famine-like conditions in some areas, as a result of the nine-month war between the Sudanese army and paramilitary RSF. The United Nations on Wednesday urged countries not to forget the civilians caught up in the war,appealing for $4.1bnto meet their humanitarian needs and support those who have fled to neighbouring countries. Half of Sudan’s population – around 25 million people – need humanitarian assistance and protection, while more than 1.5 million people have fled to the Central African Republic, Chad, Egypt, Ethiopia and South Sudan, according to the UN. In the launch of its joint appeal with the UN refugee agency (UNHCR), the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) called for $2.7bn in funding to provide humanitarian aid for 14.7 million people.    The UN refugee agency asked for $1.4bn to support nearly 2.7 million people in five countries neighbouring Sudan as part of the appeal. OCHA’s appeal last year to provide aid to civilians in Sudan was less than half funded. Later on Wednesday, the UN aid chief said that Sudan’s warring sides have agreed to meet in UN-mediated talks on enabling aid delivery. Martin Griffiths told reporters in Geneva, Switzerland that he had been in contact with the heads of the two sides in the war about convening “empowered representatives of the two militaries” to discuss aid access. He said he wanted “to get them to follow up the commitments of the so-called Jeddah Declaration”, which the two sides signed last May, agreeing to spare civilians and civilian infrastructure and to let in badly needed aid. Griffiths warned the lack of access remained “very, very considerable”. While the Jeddah conference was organised by Saudi Arabia and the United States, Griffiths said “this time it’s the UN that will be the mediator”. “I had positive responses from both sides,” he said, adding that he was “still waiting for a confirmation on when and where”, but that Switzerland had been suggested as a venue. He said he hoped the meeting could take place “face to face”, but said plans were under way to organise a virtual call next week “as a first step”. Griffiths said the international community needed to act with a heightened sense of urgency. “We must not forget Sudan,” he said. “That’s the simple message that I have to say today.”   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/7/network-blackout-cuts-communications-for-millions-in-war-torn-sudan
"UN calls for $4.1bn in aid for Sudan, says crisis needs world’s attention","The 10-month conflict has created one of the world’s ‘largest displacement and protection crises’, UN agencies say.","The United Nations has appealed for $4.1bn to meet the humanitarian needs of civilians in war-torn Sudan and to support those who fled the conflict to neighbouring countries. Ten months since the war broke out between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the paramilitaryRapid Support Forces(RSF), half of Sudan’s population – some 25 million people – needs humanitarian assistance and protection, UN agencies said on Wednesday. More than 1.5 million people have fled across Sudan’s borders to the Central African Republic, Chad, Egypt, Ethiopia and South Sudan. “Sudan keeps getting forgotten by the international community,” UN aid chief Martin Griffiths told diplomats in Geneva. In its joint appeal with the UN refugee agency (UNHCR), the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) called for $2.7bn in funding to provide humanitarian aid for 14.7 million people. The UNHCR requested an additional $1.4bn to support nearly 2.7 million people in five countries neighbouring Sudan that were already overstretched and were hosting large refugee populations. Both plans aim to support some 17.4 million people in Sudan and the region. 🚨 The crisis in#Sudandemands the world's immediate action. ⚠️The intensifying conflict is causing immense suffering, leaving millions of people in dire need of humanitarian aid. 📄Press Release on the@UNand partners' urgent appeal for 2024:https://t.co/AsGRLhGrwmpic.twitter.com/bPowFcdIzS — UN OCHA Sudan (@UNOCHA_Sudan)February 7, 2024  “There is a certain kind of obscenity about the humanitarian world, which is the competition of suffering, a competition between places: ‘I have more suffering than you, so I need to get more attention, so I need to get more money’,'” Griffiths said. In December, the RSF captured Gezira state – the country’s breadbasket – getting the upper hand against the army. The state was also a haven for hundreds of thousands of displaced people who relocated from the war-torn capital, Khartoum, earlier in the war, which began in April. The conflict has created one of the world’s largest displacement and protection crises, the agencies said, and nearly 18 million people face “acute food insecurity”. With two-thirds of the population lacking access to healthcare, diseases including cholera, measles and malaria are spreading. About 19 million children are out of school. Human rights violations are widespread, said the agencies. “They desperately need help, and they need it now,” said UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi, who recently met displaced families in Sudan and neighbouring Ethiopia.    TheWorld Food Programme (WFP), the UN’s food agency, said this week it is receiving reports of people dying of starvation in Sudan and the number of hungry people has doubled over the past year as the ongoing war cuts civilians off from aid. “The situation in Sudan today is nothing short of catastrophic,” said Eddie Rowe, WFP’s Sudan representative and country director. The WFP called on Sudan’s warring factions to provide immediate guarantees for the unimpeded delivery of relief. The conflict has killed 12,000 people, according to UN figures, although the actual death toll is thought to be higher. More than 10 million people have been displaced. The fighting has continued to escalate despite international attempts to forge a ceasefire. The conflict broke out over an internationally backed plan to merge the RSF into the SAF and begin a transition towards elections. The SAF and the RSF had shared power after longtime ruler Omar al-Bashir was toppled in a popular uprising in 2019. The two sides had also jointly staged a coup in 2021 that upended efforts to steer Sudan towards democracy. Throughout the current war, both the SAF and the RSF have been accused of war crimes, including indiscriminate shelling of residential areas, torture and arbitrary detention of civilians.

"In Turkey’s Gaziantep, weddings are dispelling some post-earthquake sadness","In the lively wedding district, celebrations are cautiously starting up again as couples start their futures together.","Gaziantep, Turkey– Gazi Muhtar Pasa Boulevard in downtown Gaziantep, an elegant district of bridal shops and venues in a city known as a wedding destination, is much livelier than a year ago, the sidewalks clear of debris and shattered window glass. Businesses have been open since the early morning and, despite a drizzle, the street bustles with life and brides-to-be seeking their dream wedding dress – like Aysenur from Pazarcik, who is window-shopping dreamily. Primary school teacher Diana Hajj Assad, 37, remembers when she, too, was excitedly browsing shop windows in January 2023, not knowing that her big day, scheduled for February, would be called off by a natural disaster. On February 6, 2023, amagnitude 7.8 earthquakerocked southeastern Turkey and northern Syria at 4:17am, killing more than 50,000 people, displacing millions and causing an estimated $34bn in damage. In Gaziantep, just 68km (42 miles) from the epicentre, itshattered homes and buildingsas well as the dreams of many couples who were about to start their futures together. Hajj Assad was expecting her fiance, Shareef, to finally fly from Saudi Arabia to Gaziantep to get married after waiting months for his visa – but everything changed overnight. “It was horrific,” Hajj Assad recalls. “I remember similar fears during the war in Syria.” Gaziantep, which is among the bigger and richer Anatolian cities, has had many big bridal shops and wedding venues set up here and, since the beginning of the Syrian conflict, many Syrian refugees like Hajj Assad have settled here. Some started wedding businesses to cater to the ever-growing Arabic-speaking community, like 36-year-old Reem Masri, who moved to Gaziantep from her native Aleppo, Syria, in 2013. Masri and her wedding planning agency Dantel were hired in late 2022 to organise Hajj Assad’s big day. The creative design graduate had not wanted to be one of the thousands of refugees forced to open food ventures to survive – so she set Dantel up in 2016. After surviving a war, living in exile and enduring her mother’s death from afar, she says the earthquake days were some of the toughest of her life, especially as a single mother of two young girls. “We were alone in the house when the tremors started shaking our beds,” Masri recalls. “My first thought was to grab the passports in case we had to run, like during the war. We slept three days in our car, then left for Istanbul by bus with some friends.” The earthquake came at the busiest time of the year for her – most weddings are in the spring, so the winter is when a lot of phone calls, appointments and shopping happen. That day, Masri lost her home, one of her employees who was visiting family in Hatay, and her only source of income. Before the earthquake, she organised about four weddings a month, but suddenly there were no more events on her agenda. “I was scared I had to start all over again,” she says. From a city of joy and celebration, Gaziantep became a place of sorrow, with even the places built to celebrate happy moments turned into temporary refuges for the displaced. Aykut Goktenik, 80, director of the famous Sato Saloon wedding venue in Masal Park, also known as the “fairytale park” – decided to open his venue on the night of February 6 to survivors who were outside in the cold, not knowing how long the emergency would last. Goktenik has been in event planning for the past 40 years, 13 of those at Sato Saloon. “The night before the earthquake, we organised a henna event, a Turkish traditional ritual that takes place one or two days before a wedding,” Goktenik recalls. “Within hours, the same saloon turned into a shelter. We were lucky to have a storage full of food for planned events.” With three big rooms and a maximum capacity of 1,500 people, the building offered a safe refuge to the many displaced in the city. For the first eight days, Sato’s seven staff members volunteered to deliver hot meals to nearly 3,000 people daily. “Weddings are a symbol of unity and happiness, a very important celebration deeply rooted in Turkish culture,” Goktenik adds. “It was our duty to keep this spirit in our saloon even during the emergency.” In the 10 provinces affected by the earthquake, weddings were suspended for six weeks after a state of emergency was declared. But even after the suspension was lifted, few were in the mood to celebrate after so many families were wiped out and swaths of homes destroyed, particularly in the surrounding villages, where most Antepians have roots. Although part of her mother’s family had died in the earthquake, Hajj Assad and her fiance were motivated to resume the wedding preparations. “We had been engaged for four years and it took so much effort for Shareef to get that visa that we felt like we couldn’t wait any more,” Hajj Assad says. “We also wanted to share some positive moments with our relatives after all the tragedy.” When Masri received Hajj Assad’s phone call asking her to reschedule the wedding, she burst into tears. “When the day finally came, I didn’t even remember how to put makeup on, I had lost the habit of getting ready for parties.” On May 2, Diana and Shareef’s wedding was one of the first to be celebrated after a long period of mourning. Masri has organised three more since then as the summer encouraged people to celebrate life again. ‏‏Last August, Ayhan Kahriman and his Italian partner Giuliana Ciucci celebrated their wedding in a small ceremony with a limited group of friends. They had originally planned their big day for the spring, but Kahriman lost many family members in February in his hometown of Islahiye, one of the most affected areas. The couple was no longer in the mood for big celebrations. “Even finding wedding rings was a challenge, because the jewellery shop I planned on getting them from closed for months,” Kahriman says. After the ceremony, the newlyweds visited Kahriman’s village to celebrate with his relatives. “We couldn’t celebrate [traditionally], with drums, a parade and lots of gold as gifts,” Ciucci explains. “To respect the mourning, wedding celebrations were openly discouraged. So we just sat at a small table and talked quietly while sipping tea. It was not the day I had in mind before the earthquake.” ‏‏Because Gaziantep was spared heavy destruction, many people from other provinces flock there to shop for or celebrate their big day. Masri is currently organising the wedding celebration for Aysenur and her fiance Ali, to be held in a month. “After having to postpone for one more year our happy day, it’s such a relief to wrap up the last details, it means this time it’s really happening,” says Aysenur, whose hometown in the Kahramanmaras province was heavily destroyed. “Although it’s a heartache having to celebrate it far from our hometown, but at least we get to celebrate.” Giulia Bernacchi contributed to reporting from Gaziantep.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/7/in-turkeys-gaziantep-weddings-are-dispelling-some-post-earthquake-sadness
Blinken in Israel to try to seal Gaza truce deal,The US official arrives as reports suggest fading optimism over efforts to bring the war to a halt.,"United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken has arrived in Israel as he seeks to seal a truce deal to bring the war in Gaza to a halt. Following meetings the previous day in Egypt and Qatar, both mediating between Hamas and Israel, Blinken landed in Jerusalem on Wednesday on hisfifth tourof the tense region since October last year. He will meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Isaac Herzog, among others, to discuss the Palestinian group’s response to the proposed deal. Hamas has said previously that any deal must bring about a definitive end to the war. Israel has said it will not halt the war permanently until Hamas is destroyed. The Palestinian group said in a statement on Tuesday that it had reviewed the “comprehensive ceasefire deal … with a positive spirit”, including details on securing relief and shelter, reconstruction, the lifting of a 17-year-old crippling siege, and the completion of the “prisoner exchange” process. On Wednesday, Hamas said it has put forward a counterproposal. The document features a three-stage ceasefire plan according to which the group would exchange Israeli captives it captured on October 7 for Palestinian prisoners, secure the reconstruction of Gaza, and ensure the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces and an exchange of bodies and remains. Mohammad Nazzal, a senior member of Hamas’s political bureau, told Al Jazeera that the counterproposal lays out clear deadlines, in particular for a ceasefire, something that he suggests the original proposal lacked. “Among these details, none can be compromised,” he insisted. “The Israeli killing machine must be brought to a halt. We wish to see Israeli occupation forces’ withdrawal from the Gaza Strip entirely. Our response is realistic and our demands are reasonable.” Blinken will now discuss the response with Israel. Speaking to reporters in Doha on Tuesday, the US official called the deal “essential”. “There’s still a lot of work to be done. But we continue to believe that an agreement is possible and indeed essential, and we will continue to work relentlessly to achieve it,” he said. The same day, Netanyahu’s office said Hamas’s response was being studied. “Hamas’s reply has been conveyed by the Qatari mediator to the Mossad. Its details are being thoroughly evaluated by the officials involved in the negotiations,” said a statement from Israel’s foreign intelligence agency. Sources close to the talks have said the original proposed truce would last at least 40 days, during which Hamas would free the civilians among the remaining captives being held. Further phases would follow to hand over soldiers and the corpses of captives in exchange for the release of Palestinians imprisoned in Israel. Hamas’s counterproposal envisages an initial truce lasting 45 days, leading to an agreement on a full halt to hostilities. The Palestinian group’s plan for a three-step swap of prisoners demands that Israeli troops leave Gaza and a full ceasefire be agreed before the second stage can proceed. Nazzal noted this condition is being put forward as Hamas wants to test whether the Israelis are “seriously committed to this deal”. “We expect a negotiation to start. Once it starts, any obstacles can be ironed out along the way to reach a final agreement whereby we can dot the i’s and cross the t’s,” he said. Qatar said on Tuesday that Hamas is “generally positive” on the proposed deal, which itbrokeredalongside Egypt and the US, with Israeli officials also present. However, there is less optimism in other quarters, reports Al Jazeera’s Rory Challands from occupied East Jerusalem. “The Qataris are positive a deal is within reach, but if you go elsewhere, I think that positivity starts to fade a bit.” “The Americans seem to be less positive,” he continued, noting that President Joe Biden was quoted overnight as saying “Hamas’s response seems to be ‘a little over the top’”.    It is thought that Blinken’s efforts will likely meet more significant pushback on Wednesday. “In Israel, the mood is significantly more negative. Hamas is saying ‘end the war’, Israel is saying ‘no way’,” Challands added. Blinken will also meet Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas later on Wednesday, with potential post-war scenarios likely to be discussed. The US insists that a Palestinian state, albeit one not controlled by Hamas, is essential to bring about a lasting peace. Blinken has also emphasised that Israeli integration is integral to the US vision for the region. However, Netanyahu has suggested that he does not foresee a two-state solution, although he has yet to clearly state his post-war plans. Under intense political pressure at home, Netanyahu continues to insist that the military campaign will not end until Hamas is destroyed. That means the devastating war could last months at least unless a deal can be brokered or the US, Israel’s biggest supporter, reins in its ally. Blinken has also arranged to meet privately with Israeli military chief Herzi Halevi. Israeli media suggest that the “unusual” private meeting may be an attempt to gain a more “honest analysis” of the state of the conflict. Israel’s Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has claimed that 18 of 24 Hamas battalions have been dismantled. However, war monitors have questioned that.

US House rejects Israel-only bill; Ukraine-Israel-border bill shaky,Republicans harden positions as probable presidential candidate Donald Trump increases pressure.,"The United States House of Representatives has rejected a Republican-led bill to provide $17.6bn in assistance to Israel as a wider bipartisan bill that would also help Ukraine and ensure more money for border security looked to be in trouble as well. The Tuesday vote on the Israel bill, which needed a two-thirds majority to advance, was largely along party lines. Aid for Israel – one of the largest recipients of US foreign aid – has traditionally received strong bipartisan support. However, the bill’s opponents said it was a Republican ploy to distract from their opposition to the$118bn Senate billcombining an overhaul of US immigration policy and new funding for border security – measures Republicans had demanded – with billions of dollars in emergency aid for Ukraine, Israel and partners in the Asia Pacific. House Democratic leaders called the Israel bill a “nakedly obvious and cynical attempt” to undermine the larger package, hammered out at the weekend after months of negotiations by a bipartisan group of senators. Support for that bill has dwindled among Republicans with former President Donald Trump – who is likely to be the Republican candidate for November’s presidential election – pressuring them to avoid handing President Joe Biden, his probable Democrat rival, a legislative victory ahead of the poll. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said the Senate bill was “dead on arrival” in the chamber even before it was introduced. Senate Republican leaders said on Tuesday they did not think the measure would receive enough votes to pass. “It looks to me and to most of our members that we have no real chance here to make a law,” Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters. Biden, who supports the Senate bill, had promised to veto the House’s Israel-only measure if it were passed. On Tuesday, he urged lawmakers to back the wider bill, saying the clock was “ticking” for Ukraine two years since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered afull-scale invasionof his country’s neighbour. He called on them to “show some spine” and stand up to Trump. Out of funds, the Pentagon is sending no more arms shipments to Kyiv even as Ukraine is struggling with ammunition and personnel shortages as Russia mounts relentless attacks. “Every week, every month that passes without new aid to Ukraine means fewer artillery shells, fewer air defence systems, fewer tools for Ukraine to defend itself against this Russian onslaught,” Biden said. “We can’t walk away now. That’s what Putin’s betting on,” Biden said. “Supporting this bill is standing up to Putin. Opposing this bill is playing into his hands.” The immigration portion of the legislation, Biden added, included the “toughest set of reforms to secure the border ever”. The Israel bill’s supporters insisted it was not a political stunt, saying it was important to move quickly to support the country, which launched anoffensive on Gazaafter members of the Hamas armed group launched an unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people and taking dozens captive. At least 27,585 Palestinians have been killed in theIsraeli onslaught, with thousands more injured. “This bill simply provides necessary resources to our closest ally in the region and our own military,” said Republican Ken Calvert, who introduced the measure. Some Democrats also condemned the House bill for failing to provide humanitarian assistance for Palestinian civilians. Members of Congress have been struggling for months to reach an agreement on sending security assistance overseas, particularly to Ukraine. Biden has twice sent Congress requests for emergency spending bills, most recently in October. The Republican-majority House passed an Israel-only bill in November but it was never taken up in the Democratic-led Senate. Negotiators had worked on Biden’s request for a broader emergency security package and Republican demands that any security assistance be combined with changes in immigration policy and security at the border with Mexico. The failed Israel House vote was the second in quick succession for Johnson’s Republican majority on Tuesday. It came immediately after the chamber voted against impeaching Biden’s top border official, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/7/us-republican-led-israel-only-bill-fails-ukraine-israel-border-bill-shaky
Qatar says Hamas response to truce proposal ‘generally positive’,"On a visit to Qatar, top US diplomat Antony Blinken says Hamas’s response to a truce proposal has been shared with Israel.","Mediator Qatar says Hamas has given a “generally positive” response to a proposed truce deal with Israel, as the Palestinian group reiterated its demand for an end to the Israeli assault on Gaza. During a press conference on Tuesday with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani described Hamas’s reaction to the proposal as “generally positive”, without providing more details. Blinken said Hamas’s response to the proposal brokered by Qatar, Egypt and the United States has been shared with Israeli officials. Blinken is on alightning tour of the Middle East, and said that he would discuss the response with Israel’s officials when he visits the country on Wednesday. Speaking to reporters in Doha on Tuesday, Blinken said the deal is “essential”. “There’s still a lot of work to be done. But we continue to believe that an agreement is possible and indeed essential, and we will continue to work relentlessly to achieve it,” he said. Hamas said in a statement that its leaders had reviewed the “comprehensive ceasefire deal … with a positive spirit”, including details on securing relief and shelter, reconstruction, the lifting of a 17-year-old crippling siege, and the completion of the “prisoner exchange” process. Qatar has been working with the US and Egypt to broker a truce that would involve an extended halt in fighting and the release of hostages held by Hamas. PM Sheikh Mohammed Al Thani said there are a number of challenges that mediators are facing throughout the talks, and that events on the ground in Gaza affect the course of the negotiations. “We are hoping to see it yielding and yielding very soon,” he said. Earlier, Blinken met Qatar’s Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. I met with Amir Sheikh@TamimBinHamadin Doha to discuss efforts to secure the release of all remaining hostages held by Hamas. We appreciate Qatar’s partnership and indispensable role in mediating.pic.twitter.com/NYUp4NvPk7 — Secretary Antony Blinken (@SecBlinken)February 6, 2024  The proposed deal was drawn up more than a week ago by US and Israeli spy chiefs at a meeting with Egyptian and Qatari officials. Hamas has said previously that any deal must bring about a definitive end to the war. Israel has said it will not halt the war permanently until Hamas is destroyed. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Hamas’s response to the deal is being studied by all parties involved in the mediation process. “Hamas’s reply has been conveyed by the Qatari mediator to the Mossad. Its details are being thoroughly evaluated by the officials involved in the negotiations,” a statement from Israel’s foreign intelligence agency, the Mossad, said on Tuesday, per the office of the prime minister. Sources close to the talks have said the truce would last at least 40 days, during which fighters would free civilians among the remaining hostages they hold. Further phases would follow, to hand over soldiers and the corpses of hostages, in exchange for the release of Palestinians imprisoned in Israel. The only truce so far, in November, was initially agreed for just four days and extended to last a week. At the time, Hamas released 110 hostages in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Most of the besieged enclave’s 2.3 million population is displaced, facing severe shortages of food, water, medicine, and shelter, with the majority of Gaza now in ruins following nearly four months of Israeli bombardment. Israel began its military offensive in Gaza after Hamas fighters killed 1,139 people and took around 150 hostages in southern Israel on October 7, according to an Al Jazeera tally based on official Israeli figures. At least 27,585 people have been confirmed killed in Israel’s military campaign, with thousands more feared buried under rubble, according to Palestinian health authorities in Gaza. More than 66,000 others have been wounded, according to Palestinian authorities.    In his remarks, Blinken outlined the US’s vision for the region, emphasising Israeli integration. He mentioned continuing US efforts to promote normalisation deals that critics say sideline Palestinians and do little to address the political problems at the root of the conflict. His visit comes amid statements from Israel that it plans to expand its ground attacks in Gaza, particularly in the southern governorate of Rafah that is crammed with internally displaced Palestinians. Rafah, on the Egyptian border, is where more than half of Gaza’s population have sought refuge and are now living in increasingly miserable conditions. United Nations humanitarian monitors said Tuesday that Israeli evacuation orders now cover two-thirds of Gaza’s territory, driving thousands more people every day towards the border areas. Egypt has warned that an Israeli deployment along the border would threaten the peace treaty the two countries signed more than four decades ago. Egypt fears an expansion of combat to the Rafah area could push terrified Palestinian civilians across the border, a scenario Egypt has said it is determined to prevent. Blinken, who met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in Cairo earlier on Tuesday, has said repeatedly that Palestinians must not be forced out of Gaza. Many have criticised the US and the secretary of state himself for not taking a tougher tone with Israeli officials, even as they have publicly contradicted US positions on the future of Palestine and on military action and humanitarian aid in Gaza. Al Jazeera’s senior political analyst Marwan Bishara, said the both Blinken and Biden have been “a leading party in the conflict”. “They are the ones who’ve backed Israel’s aggression, financially and militarily, and diplomatically,” Bishara said. The Biden administration must “change its tone” and “impose its will on the Netanyahu government”, he added.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/6/qatar-says-hamas-response-to-truce-proposal-generally-positive
"UN envoy in Iraq to step down at end of May, says country ‘on a knife edge’","Jeanine Hennis-Plasscha urges cessation of attacks, ‘reining in armed actors operating outside state control’.","The head of the United Nations political mission in Iraq, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, has told the Security Council she expects to step down at the end of May, adding the country was “on a knife edge”. The former Dutch defence minister was appointed by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in late 2018. The UN Assistance Mission for Iraq aims to advance inclusive political dialogue and helps coordinate humanitarian and development aid. “For Iraq to further continue on its path of stability and progress, an enabling environment will prove essential. And, such an environment requires restraint from all sides,” Hennis-Plasschaert told the 15-member Security Council on Tuesday. Iran-aligned groups, known collectively as the “Axis of Resistance”, have been waging attacks against Israeli and US targets from Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq and Syria, since Israel began its war in Gaza following the Hamas attack on October 7. Washington responded with attacks in a cycle of escalating violence that Iraqi officials said threatened to undo progress towards stabilising the country after decades of conflict. “While we are, of course, aware that many authorities and actors seek to limit further escalation, it is clear that the situation remains volatile. Iraq – indeed, the wider region – remain on a knife-edge, with the tiniest miscalculation threatening a major conflagration,” Hennis-Plasschaert said. There was an “urgent need to cease attacks, be they originating from within or outside” of Iraq, she said, adding, “And, as stated many times in past years, this must include reining in armed actors operating outside state control.”    Security Council permanent members Russia and China havecriticsed the US for its recent air raidson targets in Iraq and Syria. The two countries accused Washington of raising the risk of regional escalation at a meeting of the Security Council late on Monday. Moscow claimed that the US decision to launch the attacks was linked to the upcoming presidential election in November. Russia had requested the council meeting after the US launched dozens ofattacksagainst Iran-aligned targets in Iraq and Syria. The raids followed a drone attack on a US base in Jordan thatkilled three soldiers. The US air raids,which killed more than a dozen people, including civilians, demonstrate Washington’s complete disregard for international law, Moscow’s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said. He accused the US of seeking to draw Middle Eastern powers, including Iran, into a regional conflict. The United States invaded Iraq and toppled leader Saddam Hussein in 2003, precipitating years of rebellion and fighting among Iraq’s ethnic and religious groups. It withdrew its troops in 2011, but sent thousands back after ISIL’s surge into the country three years later.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/6/un-envoy-in-iraq-to-step-down-at-end-of-may-says-country-on-a-knife-edge
Argentina President Javier Milei reveals plans to move embassy to Jerusalem,"Javier Milei made the remarks upon his arrival to Israel, where is he set to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.","Argentina President Javier Milei has announced plans to shift his country’s embassy to Jerusalem as he embarked on a visit to Israel. The 53-year-old economist, who upended traditional politics to win election last year, was greeted warmly by Israel’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz at Ben Gurion airport near Tel Aviv. Milei, on his first official visit since taking office barring a brief swing through the Davos economic forum in Switzerland, said, “My plan is to move the embassy to west Jerusalem.” Confirmation of the widely expected announcement found favour with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose office said he “warmly welcomes” the move. “The prime minister spoke about this with President Milei after his election, and welcomes the fact that the president has kept his promise,” a statement read. Right-winger Netanyahu and the libertarian Milei, who has been compared with former US president Donald Trump – who moved the US embassy to Jerusalem in 2018, are set to meet for talks on Wednesday, with the aim of deepening ties between the two countries.    After his arrival, Milei headed to the Western Wall in occupied East Jerusalem’s historic Old City, the holiest place where Jews can pray. His trip will also see him visit a kibbutz and meet families of hostages taken by the Palestinian armed group Hamas when it attacked southern Israel on October 7, killing at least 1,139 people according to an Al Jazeera tally based on official Israeli figures. The group, which governs Gaza, seized about 240 other people as hostages. After the Hamas attack, Israel launched a devastating bombardment and ground offensive on Gaza, while severely restricting supplies of water, food and aid to the territory. The campaign has reduced much of the territory to rubble and displaced more than 80 percent of Gaza’s residents. More than 27,500 people have been killed in the Israeli assault, and more than 66,000 others have been wounded, according to Palestinian authorities. Palestinian group Hamas said it “strongly condemns” Milei’s announcement. Hamas, the group that governs Gaza, said it viewed the move “an infringement of the rights of our Palestinian people to their land, and a violation of the rules of international law, considering Jerusalem as occupied Palestinian land”. Milei, known for his fiery speeches and wild sideburns, describes himself as an “anarcho-capitalist”. He was raised in a Catholic family but has studied Jewish scripture. After his election win in November, he visited the tomb of a revered rabbi in New York – a popular spiritual destination for some Jews. Argentina’s Jewish community is 250,000 strong and one of the largest in Latin America. From Israel, Milei heads to Rome on Friday for a meeting with Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and a private audience with Pope Francis. Milei has previously criticised his fellow Argentinian but toned down his rhetoric more recently.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/6/argentina-president-javier-milei-says-plans-to-move-embassy-to-jerusalem
Israel should be disqualified from Eurovision 2024: European politicians,Political figures pen angry letter to Eurovision organisers saying Israel should be excluded for its war in Gaza.,"The organisers of the Eurovision Song Contest are under increasing pressure to exclude Israel from this year’s competition as it wages a devastating war on Gaza. More than 20 politicians wrote to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) on Tuesday saying Israel’s participation in the contest “whitewashes a regime that is carrying out ethnic cleansing in Palestine and committing war crimes and genocide”. European Parliament members and politicians from Spain’s left-wing Podemos party are among the signatories of the letter seen by Al Jazeera. The annual contest is set to take place in May at Sweden’s Malmo Arena after Swedish singer Loreen won last year. The politicians behind the letter acknowledged that the EBU, which is a group of public media organisations, wants Eurovision to remain a non-political event. “However, the Eurovision Song Contest did veto Russia’s participation in the contest from 2022 in response to its invasion of Ukraine. Also, in 2019, Iceland was fined by the festival organisers because the Icelandic contestant displayed a Palestinian flag at the Eurovision Song Contest in Tel Aviv,” they said. “Israel’s participation is in clear conflict with what the EBU claims to stand for, as it misinforms about Israel and conceals its genocidal behaviour,” they added. Thirty-seven countries will participate this year. Israel became the first non-European country to participate in 1973 and hosted the pop culture event in Tel Aviv in 2019. Entry to the contest is open to all members of the EBU. Besides the European politicians, musicians in Sweden, artists in Finland, and protesters in Norway and Ireland have sent letters to the EBU urging public broadcasters to exclude Israel from the contest. Iceland, meanwhile, is reconsidering its participation if Israel is allowed to compete this year. At the time of publishing, the EBU had not responded to Al Jazeera’s request for comment. Israel accuses everyone of terrorism to continue massacring the Palestinian people with total impunity. We must prevent its participation in any international event that allows it to whitewash its barbarism, such as Eurovision.pic.twitter.com/g8A1BiUCSh — Ione Belarra (@ionebelarra)February 4, 2024   Eurovision, which began in 1956, is an international music pageant watched and adored by millions of viewers. But this year, some fans said they will join protests against Israel by boycotting the contest and turning off their screens should it be allowed to participate. “I’m a huge Eurovision fan. It should just be a bit of fun, but we all know behind the glitz and glamour, geopolitical games are at play,” Ciara Greene, a Belgium-based fan told Al Jazeera. “The day after Russia invaded Ukraine, it was rightly excluded from the song contest. Allowing Israel to participate contributes to Israeli exceptionalism and normalises the state’s genocidal policies.” In Sweden, home to the 1974 Eurovision winner Abba, famous musicians like Robyn have also signed a letter calling out the competition’s alleged double standard. “It’s hard to not be political with music,” said Ida, a 33-year old student in the Swedish capital, Stockholm. “If Israel were to take part, I think most just wouldn’t vote for them and make their displeasure known.” Israel is reportedly planning to announce its entry on Tuesday. Brian Donnelly, a human rights activist in Ireland, organised a campaign designed to pressure RTE, Ireland’s representative broadcaster in the Eurovision Song Contest, into urging the EBU to disqualify Israel. “We heard this strategy worked when Russia invaded Ukraine,  but in our case, we have not yet got a reply from RTE,” Donnelly told Al Jazeera. “If Israel takes part, it will help their PR campaign of normalising what they’re doing to the Palestinian people.” Claire Charles, a marketing manager from France, said Israel’s inclusion was a sign of “Western hypocrisy”. “All these public institutions are useless. Western governments are useless. Murder and occupation and war and genocide continues to happen,” she told Al Jazeera. “Excluding Russia last time reveals the blatant racism of not excluding Israel this year.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/6/israel-should-be-disqualified-from-eurovision-2024-european-politicians
Israel’s war on Gaza: Are boycotts hurting US brands?,McDonald’s is the latest of several brands to report a sales dip in Asia and the Middle East.," McDonald’s hasmissed sales targetspartly due to boycotts against its products in some parts of the world over its perceived support for Israel, the company says. The war on Gaza “meaningfully impacted” performance in the last quarter of 2023 in some regions, company officials said on Monday. Sales growth in the Middle East, China and India stood at 0.7 percent in the quarter, far below expectations. The fast food company is only one of several United States brands hit by boycotts and protests over their perceived support for Israel’s war on Gaza. On social media sites, lists are going around of brands accused of supporting Israel although the ties are often not clearly explained. The push is part of a larger Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign targeting Israel-friendly brands since 2005.  #bdsmovement#palestinelivesmatter ♬ original sound - Mai   Here’s a breakdown of how some brands say they’ve been hit so far: Fast food giant McDonald’s drew the ire of Israel’s critics, especially in the Middle East, when its Israel branch gave thousands of free meals to Israeli troops in October, the month the country launched its bombardment and ground offensive in Gaza, which have now killed more than 27,000 people. Since October, campaigners have called for a boycott of the company around the world. The impact has been more pronounced in the Middle East, where at least 5 percent of McDonald’s franchises are registered. While the growth target for sales in the Middle East, India and China was set at 5.5 percent from October to December, the company achieved 0.7 percent growth — and likely saw its sales shrink in just the Middle East. Global sales grew by 3.4 percent in the same period, compared with 8.8 percent in the preceding quarter. Franchises in Saudi Arabia, Oman, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Bahrain and Turkeyissued statements distancing themselvesfrom the free food campaign in Israel and collectively pledged aid worth $3m to Gaza. Chief Executive Chris Kempczinski said the company is not expecting significant changes as long as the war persists. “It’s a human tragedy what’s going on, and I think that does weigh on brands like ours,” he said. Last week, coffee chain Starbucks slashed its annual sales forecast after a slump in growth. The company now expects full-year sales – globally and in the US – to grow from 4 percent to 6 percent, down from its previous range of 5 percent to 7 percent. CEO Laxman Narasimhan told journalists that Starbucks saw a “significant impact on traffic and sales” in the Middle East due to the war in Gaza. Sales also slowed in the US, where protesters have campaigned against the Seattle-based company, calling for it to take a stand against Israel. Starbucks’s troubles started after Starbucks Workers United, composed of thousands of baristas across more than 360 US cafes, showed support for Palestinians in a post on X days after the Gaza war broke out. The post was deleted less than an hour later. Starbucks sued the union in an Iowa court for trademark infringement, asking the union to stop using its name and a similar logo. The post reflected “support for Hamas” and had badly damaged the company’s reputation, Starbucks said in the suit, adding that it had received more than 1,000 complaint calls. The company also said some of its cafes were vandalised. The union countersued, asking a federal court in Pennsylvania to rule that it may continue to use the logo. It also accused Starbucks of defamation. Both sides are engaged in ongoing, fraught negotiations on labour issues with the union demanding better pay and more consistent scheduling for workers. Meanwhile, many people inIndonesia, the country with the world’s largest Muslim population, have been boycotting Starbucks and McDonald’s since the start of the war. The fizzy drinks manufacturer has long been caught in the crossfire of conflict in the Middle East. From 1967 to 1991, Coke was officially boycotted by the Arab League for building a bottling plant in Israel. Now again, the brand’s red logo is on lists of brands being circulated for boycotts on social media channels. The company does not appear to have set off any recent triggers, but its past affiliations with Israel as well as its reputation as an American company seem to be enough. In November, Turkey’s parliament voted to remove the drink from the shops and restaurants on its grounds. Coke’s Turkey distributor reported a 22 percent drop in sales in the last quarter of 2023. Meanwhile, in Egypt, the boycott of Coke and other American soft drinks has fuelled the revival of a 100-year-old local soda brand,Spiro Spathis, which has seen its sales surge. Domino’s, a US-based pizza maker with franchises around the world, is also facing blowback. Social media posts said Domino’s also gave free food to Israeli soldiers although there’s no evidence to support the claims. In Asia, the brand’s same-store salesdippedby 8.9 percent in the second half of 2023, mainly because consumers in Malaysia associate it with the US, an Israeli ally, a company official said. Malaysians have rallied in their thousands to call for an end to Israel’s war in Gaza. Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim’s office also announced in December that all Israeli-owned, Israeli-flagged or Israel-destined ships are banned from its docks. The country has no diplomatic ties with Israel. “It’s well publicised that American brands in Asia, and I largely talk to Malaysia in this case, have been affected by what’s happening in the Middle East right now,” Don Meij, managing director for Domino’s Pizza Enterprises, told analysts.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/6/israels-war-on-gaza-are-boycotts-hurting-us-brands
Blinken arrives in Egypt on regional crisis tour pushing Gaza truce deal,Top US diplomat begins yet another Middle East tour seeking to push through truce deal amid Israel’s war on Gaza.,"United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken has arrived in Egypt on his fifth regional tour since October last year, aimed at paving the way for an agreement between Israel and Hamas as the war in Gaza rages on. Blinken was set on Tuesday to meet Egyptian mediators, who, together with other Arab counterparts, have tried to put together a deal to end thevicious war, which has killed more than 27,500 Palestinians, mostly women and children. Most of the besieged enclave’s 2.3 million population is displaced, facing severe shortages of food, water, medicine, and shelter, with the majority of Gaza now in ruins following nearly four months of Israeli bombardment. The US, Egypt and Qatar have beenworking on a dealthat would halt the war and enable the exchange of Israeli captives held by Hamas and Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. However, it is reported that Israel and Hamas remain far apart in agreeing to the conditions. US officials said Blinken hopes in Cairo – and then in Doha – to get an update on Hamas’s response to the proposed deal. He will then travel to Israel to brief Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday. However, Blinken’s diplomatic whirl around the region echoesa similar tour just a month ago, which produced few tangible results, if any. It also comes amid statements from Israel that it plans to expand its ground attacks in Gaza. Insisting it will not let up on its military push, despite claims that it is failing in its goal of destroying Hamas, Israel says it plans to move on Rafah, despite the majority of the population having been forced to flee to the city sitting on the border with Egypt. United Nations humanitarian monitors have warned that Israeli evacuation orders now cover two-thirds of Gaza’s territory, driving thousands more people every day towards the border areas. Egypt has warned that an Israeli deployment along the border would threaten the peace treaty the two countries signed more than four decades ago. Egypt fears an expansion of combat to the Rafah area could push terrified Palestinian civilians across the border, a scenario Egypt has said it is determined to prevent. The US diplomat’s arrival in Cairo comes a day after he met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) in Riyadh. Saudi Arabia has said it remains interested in normalisation with Israel, but only ifthere is a credible roadmapto creating a Palestinian state. The Department of State said the pair discussed “regional coordination to achieve an enduring end to the crisis in Gaza”. Blinken and MBS also talked about humanitarian needs in Gaza and the Houthi attacks on Israel-linked ships and the warships of the US and the United Kingdom that the Iran-aligned Yemeni group has said areaimed at stopping the warand getting more aid to Palestinians. He will visit Qatar later on Tuesday for further discussion with Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani amid the efforts to secure a truce deal. The meetings come shortly after the US launched dozens of deadly strikes on Iraq and Syria to avenge three US soldiers killed in a drone attack on northern Jordan. China, Russia and Irancondemned Washington for the strikesduring an emergency UN Security Council meeting late on Monday.    Blinken will be in Israel on Wednesday to meet Netanyahu and other top Israeli officials before heading to occupied Palestinian territories in the West Bank. The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates said in a statement on Tuesday that Israel is welcoming Blinken “with an escalation of its crimes against Palestinian civilians and depriving them of their basic human rights”. Blinken is heading to Israel amid US media reports of President Joe Biden’s anger with the Israeli premier over his divergence from Washington on key issues concerning the war and the future of the region. Netanyahu has said he still wants “total victory” over Hamas and has undermined a two-state solution, while senior Israeli officials aretouting plans to take over the Gaza Stripand build illegal settlements there. Netanyahu’s far-right allies have warned him of political consequences if he strikes a weak deal with Hamas. Meanwhile, Palestinians in the occupied West Bank continue to be subject toviolent and deadly raidsby Israeli forces on a daily basis. Negotiations over an agreement have included putting a stop to the fighting for several weeks, where Hamas and Israel would conduct another exchange of prisoners.    According to the UN, Israel has beensignificantly hampering the flow of aidto the besieged enclave, where most of the 2.3 million population faces famine and is in dire need of humanitarian assistance. The UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said on Tuesday that Israel’s “evacuation orders” now cover two-thirds of the Gaza Strip, affecting an area that was home to 77 percent of the population. Palestinians in the enclave face life-threatening conditions in addition to the falling Israeli bombs, which according to the UN include severe shortages of water, food and medication, along with a rapid spread of diseases.

"Defiant Houthis claim fresh Red Sea attacks on US, UK ships",Latest attacks on civilian ships demonstrate the Iran-backed group’s determination to continue its campaign.,"Yemen’sHouthissay they have fired missiles at two civilian ships in the Red Sea. The attacks claimed by the Houthis on Tuesday, one on a British vessel and one on an American ship, are the latest in a campaign that they said is motivated byIsrael’s war on Gaza. The Iran-aligned armed group has stated itsdetermination to continuethe attacks despite several air strikes by the US and its allies patrolling the Red Sea. The ongoing campaign is helping to stokesimmering tensionsacross the Middle East. It is also disrupting world trade because the Red Sea is a major route for container ships. The Houthi’s military spokesman, Brigadier General Yahya Saree, confirmed the attacks on the two ships and repeated the threat to carry out more “self-defence” operations against “hostile” American and British targets. The attacks took place west of the Yemeni port of Hodeidah. Saree said naval missiles hit the Morning Tide, a Barbados-flagged, British-owned cargo ship, and the Star Nasia, a Marshall Islands-flagged American ship. The owner of the Morning Tide, British firm Furadino Shipping, told the Reuters news agency the ship was currently sailing without problems but gave no further information. British maritime security firm Ambrey said the British ship had performed evasive manoeuvres and continued its journey. No injuries were reported. The Houthis have launched dozens of missile, drone and boat attacks on commercial ships linked with Israel in addition to US and UK military warships since November 19. Thecampaignhas caused major headaches for global shipping firms, forcing them to suspend transits through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden and reroute over longer, more expensive journeys around Southern Africa. Operations will continue “against Israeli shipping or those heading to the ports of occupied Palestine until the siege is lifted and the aggression against the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip is stopped”, Saree said. Last month, the US and Britain began striking Houthi targets in Yemen in retaliation. The US military confirmed its latest attack, conducted on Monday, against two explosive Houthi naval drones that it said presented an imminent threat to navy ships and merchant vessels. The US government has now designated the Yemeni group as“global terrorists”. Amid the threat of extended shipping disruptions, the European Union is planning to launch its own Red Sea naval mission by the middle of February.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/6/houthis-defiant-as-they-claim-new-attacks
One person killed in attack on Istanbul courthouse,Turkish officials say two assailants shot dead in ‘terrorist’ attack blamed on leftist group.,"One person has been killed and two alleged attackers shot dead at a court in Istanbul in what authorities are describing as a “terrorist act”. Authorities said six people were wounded on Tuesday, including three police officers. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan later said one of the wounded died in hospital but did not say whether the victim was a civilian or a police officer. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, but officials blamed the incident on the leftist armed group Revolutionary People’s Liberation Party/Front (DHKP-C). Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said on X that the shooters were killed in a gun battle after they opened fire on a checkpoint near the Caglayan court in Istanbul. The suspects, a man and a woman identified only as EY and PB, were alleged members of the DHKP-C, listed as a “terrorist group” in Turkey, he said. The DHKP-C has waged a campaign against the Turkish state since the 1980s. Footage from the scene in the aftermath of the incident showed a heavy police presence at the entrance to the court with entry and exit points closed. Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said prosecutors launched an investigation into the attack. “The Republic of Turkey will continue to fight against all terrorist organisations and those who support them,” Erdogan said at an earthquake commemoration ceremony in the southern city of Kahramanmaras. “I would like to pray for the soul of the injured person who lost their life.” The attack is the latest to hit Turkey as the war in Gaza spreads tensions across the Middle East. It follows closely in the wake of several other attacks in Turkey. Masked gunmen, purportedly members of ISIL (ISIS), stormed a church in Istanbul last month during Sunday Mass and killed one person. Authorities have since arrested many people over their suspected involvement in the attack or links to the group. The Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) armed group, which has also waged a bloody campaign against the Turkish government for decades, launched a suicide attack on the Ministry of Interior in the capital, Ankara, in October. Authorities reacted bybombing Kurdish positions in northern Iraqand have since arrested hundreds of people with purported links to Kurdish groups.

Anger as Turkey marks anniversary of devastating earthquake,"One year on from disaster, mourning mixes with frustration over authorities’ response.","Crowds have gathered across Turkey to mark theone-year anniversaryof the earthquake that devastated the country, with many people expressing anger over the authorities’ response to the disaster. In Antakya, capital of Hatay, the worst affected of the 11 southern provinces hit by themagnitude 7.8 earthquakeon February 6, 2023, crowds jostled with police, calling on city mayor Lutfu Savas to resign and booing Health Minister Fahrettin Koca. The tremor and its aftershocks left towns and cities in ruins and killed more than 50,000 people in Turkey and 5,900 in Syria. Locals say the delayed response of the authorities meant that many were left to die, trapped for daysunder the rubble, in the freezing cold. People chanted “Can anyone hear me?”  – echoing the voices of those who lost their lives while waiting for help. “We won’t forget, we won’t forgive,” the crowd declared. After a moment of silence at 4:17am to mark the time that the quake struck, carnations were thrown into the river. The government has organised a series of events across the country to commemorate the anniversary. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a post on X that the pain is still fresh. “The unity of the century was displayed in the face of the disaster of the century,” he said.

"The Firats survived Turkey’s earthquakes, here’s their life a year later","A year on from the devastating earthquakes in Turkey, Al Jazeera follows up with a displaced family in Adiyaman as they contemplate love, loss and an uncertain future.","Besni, Turkey– Ahmet Firat steps out of the cramped confines of his container for a cigarette, and to share memories fromlast year’s earthquakesthat he doesn’t want his children to hear about – details that continue to prey on his mind. After the first magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck southern Turkey and northern Syria in the early morning ofFebruary 6, 2023, Ahmet, his wife, and their three children drove 50km (31 miles) from their heavily damaged home in Besni to Adiyaman, where most of their relatives lived. The southeast Turkish city was a war-scape of collapsed and crippled buildings, and a second magnitude 7.5 earthquake later in the day compounded the carnage. Over the next 10 days, Ahmet dug out the remains of 12 relatives. “Sometimes we retrieved the body parts, piece by piece, not the whole body. Sometimes the parents were holding their kids and died like that. It really affected me psychologically,” he recalled, his soft voice becoming nearly a whisper. “The sights and smells often come back to me. If I see a damaged building, I start to smell death, my brain automatically reminds me.” More than 8,000 people are thought to have died in the earthquakes in Adıyaman province, with the official death toll in Turkey at more than 50,000. When Al Jazeerafirst metthe now 40-year-old plumber and construction worker and his family last February, they had just buried the last of their dead.    The family were living in a tent encampment in Adiyaman with dozens of other relatives. They had no electricity and faced gnawing cold and scouring winds that blew smoke from a wood-burning stove back into the tent. The children were constantly ill and the adults took turns to guard the tents during the night. They had no idea what to do next. A year later, Ahmet, his wife and their children Muhammed Ali, Havvanur and Emir now live in a prefabricated container on the edge of Besni. They are among 689,101 people currently living in 407 container cities across the Britain-sized disaster zone in Turkey, according to the latest figures from Turkey’s disaster agency AFAD, out of an estimated three million displaced people. But while the Firat family’s circumstances have improved since last February, they still grapple with the aftershocks of trauma as they struggle to rebuild their lives. After a month in the tent last February, the family went to stay with the friends of a relative in a village in Mugla province, western Turkey. Ahmet found work, although the higher cost of living there made it hard to survive. But it was a break from the constant fear of earthquakes and the family started to get psychological support for their trauma. Then a relative back home died in a road accident and the Firats had to return to Adiyaman to support their extended family. They spent another month back at the tent encampment until they were given a container in Besni. Some 1,200 people live across about 300 containers in their settlement, which is on land belonging to a textile company. The streets are not much wider than a car. At the entrance to the camp is a police station, a small grocery store, and a mobile library on a bus. Inside the camp, there’s a hairdresser in a container, small playgrounds, and a container mosque. At the eastern edge of the camp, the densely packed containers give way to a vista of distant snowcapped mountains, offering some mental relief from the stifling walls and streets. The Firat family’s container – two rooms and a tiny bathroom with a toilet and a shower – was empty when they arrived. The children were shocked at how small it was – they had gone from a three-bedroom apartment of 170sq metres (1,800sq feet) to a “metal can” of 21sq metres (230sq feet), as 14-year-old Muhammed Ali put it. They had only been able to salvage a few rugs and items of clothing from their old apartment. AFAD provided them with a bunk bed, mattresses, an electric oven, and a small fridge, and installed an air conditioning unit in the summer. Ahmet applied sealant to cracks to stop rainwater leaking in and fixed tarpaulin and plastic sheeting as insulation. Over time they bought a second-hand washing machine and a bigger fridge. While the container is toasty with heat from the air conditioning unit, humidity is now a problem as moisture rises from the ground and exacerbates coughs and colds. “The container is much better than the tent, thank God. There’s running water, there’s no toilet issue, and you can lock the door, so we feel safer than in the tent,” Ahmet’s wife Ayten, 40, said. “But if you start to compare the container to our old apartment, you can’t live in the container. The kids argue with each other a lot because they have no space.” Meanwhile, the earthquake has left the family impoverished. Although Ahmet can find work, wages are low and eclipsed by soaring inflation. He earns 500 Turkish lira ($16) a day when he does find work, which could be 10 to 20 days a month. “So, I work, but at the same time I’m losing money,” he said. The family received a one-off 10,000 lira ($327) payment from the state and had an AFAD card topped up with 3,000 lira ($98) a month to use in the supermarket. But they cannot afford to replace seven-year-old Emir’s bottle glasses, which are no longer strong enough, or 11-year-old Havvanur’s glasses, lost months ago while swimming in Mugla. “Greece has them now!” she said. They also cannot return to their old apartment in Besni and, as renters not homeowners, they do not qualify for housing being built for earthquake survivors by the government-backed housing agency, TOKI. About 70 percent of the buildings in Adiyaman city were destroyed or damaged, and the scarcity of safe properties means rents have soared by about 300 percent and are now well out of reach for Ahmet. He says it is hard to see a way out of the container for the family unless rents fall dramatically when state-built housing for earthquake survivors becomes available. Meanwhile, their container may not be available to them beyond another 18 months or so. Despite their hardships, the family count their blessings because they are still more fortunate than many. The NGO Hayata Destek (Support to Life)reportedrecently that some displaced people in Adiyaman are still at risk from contaminated water and that containers are vulnerable to rain and cold. They also found that many refugees are living in heavily damaged buildings or makeshift tents and many children struggle to access education. And many families have suffered even greater losses than the Firats. “So if compare us with them we are lucky, thank God,” Ayten said. One of the Firat family’s hardest battles remains psychological. They often think back to that day in February last year when they huddled in the corner of a room as the building shook violently and shed its outside walls, as well as the subsequent days full of death, fear and suffering. “We lost the connection with life – I didn’t want to work, didn’t want to relax, the happiness went, what motivated me went,” Ahmet said. He was furious over what he’d seen and heard in years of working in the construction industry; the corners cut and shoddy materials used in the pursuit of contractor profits, the bribes paid to officials for them to look the other way. “After our losses, I was angry that these buildings weren’t strong enough to save people – it was like murder,” he said. He said psychological support has helped but it was his responsibilities that ultimately brought him out of months of despair. “At some point, I accepted it happened, it’s in the past, and I have to focus on work because I have kids to take care of,” he said. “But those we lost are always in our minds.” While Muhammed Ali and Havvanur pine for more space, they try to keep themselves busy with schoolwork and maintaining good grades; he wants to join the police, while she wants to become an ophthalmologist so she can help the many members of her family with eye problems. But Emir, the youngest, refuses to go to school and covers his ears whenever the subject is raised. “He always wants to keep his mother in sight because he’s still so afraid of earthquakes,” Ahmet said. Meanwhile, there’s little sense of community in the container village – the cramped spaces are not conducive to visitors, and people generally prefer to keep to themselves. “The earthquake also took people’s love of life, tolerance, happiness, it took everything – we became robots, we’re the not the same as before,” Ahmet said. The family members have become angrier and more aggressive with each other amid their stress, but Ayten said the disaster also brought them closer together and left them with the sense that life is something precious to be appreciated. “[We now know] there is no guarantee of life. When you sleep you might not wake up,” she said. But they are also left fearful of life’s fragility and with a depleted sense of the future. “Before the earthquake I was dreaming of the future, looking like five years ahead,” Muhammed Ali said. “Now I can’t even think five minutes ahead. We’ve stopped making plans.” “We had dreams before,” his father added. “Now we are afraid of dreams because they all get destroyed.”   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/6/the-firats-survived-turkeys-earthquakes-heres-their-life-a-year-later
Russia and China slam US for Middle East strikes,They accuse Washington of raising the risk of escalation in service of Biden’s election hopes.,"Russia and China have slammed the United States for its recent air strikes on targets in Iraq and Syria. The two countries accused Washington of raising the risk of regional escalation at a meeting of the United Nations Security Council late on Monday. Moscow also asserted that the US decision to launch the attacks was linked to the upcoming presidential election in November. Russia, whose invasion of Ukraine has been the topic of bitter debate at the UNSC over the past two years, had requested the council meeting after the US launched dozens ofstrikesagainst Iran-aligned targets in Iraq and Syria. The attacks followed a drone strike on a US base in Jordan thatkilled three soldiers.  Moscow’s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia alleged that the strikes were a US attempt to “flex its muscles”. It was also fuelled, he claimed at the UNSC, by a desire to influence its domestic political landscape and shore up the “disastrous” image of President Joe Biden’s administration. The attacks,which killed several dozen people, including civilians, demonstrate Washington’s complete disregard for international law, Nebenzia added. He also accused the US of seeking to draw Middle Eastern powers, including Iran, into a regional conflict. Ally Syria joined Russia in pointing at domestic US politics as a motive for the strikes. Envoy Koussay Aldahhak said Damascus rejects states being used as a “platform for US election campaigns and for displaying a brute force that undermines the principles of collective security”. China also condemned the attacks. Beijing’s ambassador Zhang Jun echoed the concern about escalating tensions. “The US purports that it does not seek to create conflicts in the Middle East or anywhere else, but in reality, it does precisely the opposite,” he said. “The US military actions are undoubtedly stoking new turmoil in this region and further intensifying tensions.” Saeid Iravani, the ambassador for Iran, said the US attacks had violated international law and displayed a “desperate attempt” to distract attention away from the root cause of current regional turmoil –Israel’s US-backed war on Gazathat has killed more than 27,000 Palestinians. “Claims that Iran’s bases in Iraq and Syria were attacked are rejected as unfounded and regarded as attempts to shift attention away from the US aggressive actions,” he said. “It is evident to everyone that the root causes in the region are occupation, aggression and continued genocide and horrific atrocities committed by Israeli regime, and fully supported by the US, against innocent Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and West Bank.” Washington said its attacks in Iraq and Syria hit targets linked with Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which has spent decades supporting an “axis of resistance” of like-minded political and armed groups against US influence in the region. Tehran says its supported forces in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemenoperate independentlyand it played no role in the attack on the US base in northern Jordan. The US and the United Kingdom have also been launchingbarrages of attacks on Yemen, where the Iran-aligned Houthi movement has been disrupting global shipping routes with the stated goal of stopping Israel’s war on Gaza.

Yemen appoints Foreign Minister Ahmed Awad bin Mubarak as prime minister,"Bin Mubarak replaces Maeen Abdulmalik Saeed amid rising tensions as Houthi rebels attack Red Sea shipping, triggering US and British reprisal strikes.","Yemen’s internationally recognised government has named Foreign Minister Ahmed Awad bin Mubarak as the new prime minister in a surprise appointment. Bin Mubarak replaces Maeen Abdulmalik Saeed at a time of rising tensions in the Arabian Peninsula’s poorest country after a spate of Red Sea attacks by Houthi rebels on ships that have prompted retaliatory strikes by the United States and the UK. A decree issued on Monday by Yemen’s Presidential Leadership Council and carried by the official Saba news agency announced bin Mubarak’s appointment as premier and assigned the outgoing prime minister to the post of presidential adviser. It did not give a reason for the move. Bin Mubarak, Yemen’s former ambassador to the US, is widely seen as a staunch adversary of the Houthi rebels. He came to prominence in 2015 when he was kidnapped by the Houthis while he served as Yemen’s presidential chief of staff during a power struggle with then-President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. The seizure of bin Mubarak helped plunge Yemen into a political crisis, resulting in clashes between the Houthis and Hadi’s presidential guards that prompted the president and the government to resign. Bin Mubarak was also appointed as the country’s envoy to the United Nations in 2018.    Mohammed Al-Basha, a Yemen expert for the US-based Navanti research group, said bin Mubarak is seen as one of the “architects of the Saudi-led coalition” that intervened against the Houthis in 2015 to prop up the internationally recognised government, a year after the rebels captured the capital, Sanaa. “The Houthis are unlikely to embrace the appointment of bin Mubarak,” he said, adding that bin Mubarak is a longtime adversary of the group. His appointment “is likely to intensify tensions between the Houthis and the internationally recognised government”, the expert added. The Houthis, part of the anti-Western, anti-Israel “axis of resistance” of Iranian-backed groups, have beentargeting Red Sea shipping for months, triggering US and British reprisal attacks. The Houthis have launched more than 30 attacks on commercial shipping and naval vessels since November 19, according to the Pentagon. The rebels said the attacks are in solidarity with the Palestinians and in protest against Israel’s war on Gaza that has been raging since October. The attacks have prompted some shipping companies todetour around Southern Africato avoid the Red Sea, a vital route normally taken by about 12 percent of global maritime trade. In response,US and British forces have launched strikestargeting Houthi missile sites and other military facilities. The US has also carried out a series of strikes. In recent remarks, bin Mubarak called on the European Union to designate the Houthis as a “terrorist group” and has pushed for increased military support to government forces in the wake of the Red Sea attacks.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/5/yemen-appoints-foreign-minister-ahmed-awad-bin-mubarak-as-prime-minister
UN chief appoints independent panel to assess UNRWA,"Panel to be led by former French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna, who will work with European research organisations.","United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has announced the creation of an independent panel to assess the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA). The aid agency has been under fire overaccusations by Israelthat 12 of its staff members were involved in the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7. More than a dozen countries – including the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom and Sweden – have suspended funding to the agency. The independent panel will be led by former French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna, who will work with three European research organisations, the UN said in a statement. The goal of the investigation is to “assess whether the agency is doing everything within its power to ensure neutrality and to respond to allegations of serious breaches when they are made”. The European research groups working on the independent assessment are the Raoul Wallenberg Institute in Sweden, the Chr Michelsen Institute in Norway and the Danish Institute for Human Rights. The panel is due to submit an interim report to Guterres in late March and a final one in late April with, if necessary, recommendations for “improvement and strengthening” of the agency’s mechanisms.    This assessment is separate from an internal probe that the UN launched last month after the accusations were first made against the 12 UNRWA employees. The October 7 attacks by Hamas resulted in the deaths of 1,139 people, mostly civilians, according to an Al Jazeera tally based on official Israeli figures. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said last week that the UN agency has been “totally infiltrated” by Hamas, which has governed Gaza since 2007. UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said he was looking forward to the findings of the review group. “I welcome the appointment by UN Secretary-General of an independent review group to assess how UNRWA ensures neutrality and responds to allegations of serious breaches. I look forward to the conclusion & recommendations of the report which will be made public,” Lazzarini said in a social media post. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said on Monday that his government has evidence linking the agency to “terrorism” that it plans to submit to the UN panel. “We will submit all evidence highlighting UNRWA’s ties to terrorism and its harmful effects on regional stability. It is imperative that this committee brings the truth to light,” Katz wrote on the social media platform X. An Israeli intelligence dossier alleged about 190 UNRWA employees, including teachers, have doubled as Hamas or Islamic Jihad fighters, the Reuters news agency reported. Palestinian officials have accused Israel of falsifying information to tarnish UNRWA. The UN fired nine of the accused workers, condemned “the abhorrent alleged acts” and launchedan investigationinto the allegations.    Lazzarini is visiting three Gulf states this week to drum up support after donors suspended funding to the agency. It warned last week that it might be forced to shut down its operations by the end of February if funding does not resume. Lazzarini said on X he met with the United Arab Emirates’ (UAE) Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan on Monday to discuss UNRWA’s work in “preserving the stability in the region” and delivering aid to two million people in Gaza. Spokesperson Juliette Touma told Reuters news agency that Lazzarini would visit Qatar and Kuwait later this week. “We are hoping those that paused [funding] will reconsider and others will step forward as well,” she said. Kuwait and Qatar rank 19th and 20th in UNRWA’s list of top 20 donors, giving $12m and $10.5m respectively in 2022. The UAE was not listed. Meanwhile, Spain’s foreign minister, José Manuel Albares, said his government will give 3.5m euros ($3.8m) to the agency to help it maintain its activities in the short term. Touma, however, noted that it was not nearly enough to offset the gap estimated at about $440m. Promising to eliminate Hamas, Israel launched a devastating bombardment and ground assault on Gaza,killing at least 27,478 people, mostly women and children, according to Palestinian authorities. More than 80 percent of Gaza’s population has been displaced and vast swathes of the territory have been reduced to rubble during the Israeli campaign.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/5/un-chief-appoints-independent-panel-to-assess-unrwa
Hungary’s ruling party boycotts parliament session on Sweden’s NATO bid,Hungary is the only NATO member yet to approve Sweden’s accession to the military alliance.,"Lawmakers from Hungary’s ruling party have boycotted an emergency parliament session in which a vote on Sweden’s bid to join NATO was on the agenda. At Monday’s session, which was supported by six opposition parties, Fidesz lawmakers didn’t attend, scuttling the attempt to place a vote on the National Assembly’s schedule. Turkey’s parliamentvotedto approve Sweden’s accession in January, making Hungary the last of the world’s largest military alliance’s 31 members not to do so. Sweden had pursued a policy of military non-alignment since the Cold War. However,Russia’s full-scale invasionof its neighbour Ukraine in 2022 caused upheaval in geopolitical calculations, and Stockholm applied to become a NATO member that same year. Hungary has maintained close ties with Russia since its invasion of Ukraine, and while it has said it supports the Swedish bid in principle, Budapest has been dragging its feet for months. Prime Minister Viktor Orban told NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg last month that he would urge his Fidesz party to ratify the bid “at the first possible opportunity”. On Friday, the United States embassy reminded Orban in a statement that he promised to act “at the first opportunity” and “Monday’s session provides him with one”. Several ambassadors from NATO member countries attended Monday’s proceedings, including US Ambassador David Pressman. In brief comments to the media after the session, Pressman said the US looks forward to “watching this closely and to Hungary acting expeditiously”. “Sweden’s NATO accession is an issue that directly affects the United States’s national security and affects the security of our alliance as a whole,” he said, reminding Orban of his pledge. Orban is delaying the vote due to his “personal vanity”, Agnes Vadai from the biggest opposition party told the Agence France-Presse news agency. She accused the prime minister of seeking to “make headlines in the international press while making a gesture to Russian President Vladimir Putin by undermining the unity of NATO and the EU”. In a separate statement, US senator Ben Cardin, a Maryland Democrat and chairperson of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, raised the prospect of imposing sanctions on Hungary for its conduct and called Orban “the least reliable member of NATO”. Hungarian officials have indicated that Fidesz lawmakers won’t support holding a vote on Sweden’s NATO bid until Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson accepts an invitation by Orban to visit Budapest to negotiate the matter. Kristerssonsaid he will make the trip but only after Hungary approves his country’s NATO membership. Fidesz said in a statement on Monday that ratification of Sweden’s NATO accession can take place during a regular session of parliament, “but we are expecting the Swedish prime minister to visit Hungary first.” “If this is an important issue for the Swedes, the Swedish prime minister will obviously come to Budapest,” the party said. Hungary’s National Assembly is scheduled to reconvene on February 26, and ratification could take place quickly once it has received Orban’s approval.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/5/hungarys-ruling-party-boycotts-parliament-session-on-swedens-nato-bid
Controversy after US adult performer Whitney Wright visits Iran,"Whitney Wright, 32, visited Tehran last week and posted a picture of herself at the site of the former US embassy.","Tehran, Iran –An adult performer from the United States has stirred controversy after visiting Iran and going to the former US embassy in Tehran. Whitney Wright, 32, from Oklahoma arrived in Iran last week and confirmed on her social media page on Monday that she had left the country. She posted several pictures of her visit, including one that went viral and showed her – in a headscarf and unrevealing clothing required in Iran – standing next to a lowered US flag at the site of the country’s former embassy. Iranian authorities have said the embassy was a “den of espionage” before its takeover in the aftermath of the 1979 Iranian Revolution and have since turned it into a museum. It is where embassy staff were held for 444 days, exacerbating hostilities thatreverberate across Iran-US relationseven now. Wright wrote on her Instagram account that she was eager to visit the embassy along with other museums in Tehran and suggested the backlash and negative attention online she has received are extreme. “I’m sharing exhibits from a museum that are never seen,” Wright wrote on Instagram. “It’s not an endorsement of the government.” Some critics alleged that her visit highlights inconsistencies from the Iranian authorities. Wright’s profession is considered “obscene” by Iranian authorities and could in theory lead to criminal charges. Her visit came after Iran in 2022 and early 2023 saw some of the largest public protests and unrest since the 1979 revolution,triggered by the death of Mahsa Amini. The 22-year-old died in the custody of Iran’s morality police after being detained for alleged noncompliance with the mandatory hijab, which has been in force since shortly after the revolution. The issues of being required to wear hijab by law and women’s freedom were at the centre of a lot of the protests. Iranian authorities have also engaged in a variety of efforts toenforce the hijab rulessince the protests have died down. Actor Setareh Pesiani referred to Wright’s visit to criticise the government’s mandatory headscarf policy. “You punish people of this country in various methods for removal of hijab but you allow a porn actress to come here to tour Iran!?” Pesiani wrote on Instagram.    As a US citizen, Wright would have required a visa for her visit. When asked about Wright’s visit during a weekly news conference on Monday, Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said he had no information about her. “Naturally, US citizens face no impediments in travelling to the Islamic Republic of Iran, and Iranian citizens are able to travel to the US. Whether those opportunities are equal can be judged separately,” he said. “Whitney Wright was not invited to Iran by any organisation, travelled to Iran personally and after obtaining a visa, and the visa issuance system was not aware of the nature of her immoral and obscene work,” the semiofficial Tasnim news website quoted an unnamed “informed” source as saying on Monday. Her visit to the embassy and Golestan Palace in Tehran were made as a regular visitor and without any invitations, it said. The Associated Press news agency cited the US Department of State as saying it has warned American citizens to avoid travelling to Iran and “exercise increased caution due to the risk of wrongful detention”. In September, Iran and the UScompleted a prisoner exchangethat was years in the making, swapping five Iranian prisoners held on charges of circumventing US sanctions on Iran for five US citizens held on charges of spying that Washington said were bogus. The US and Iran have not had diplomatic relations since 1980, shortly after Washington severed the ties after the embassy takeover in Tehran. Through her social media posts, Wright has consistently raised awareness aboutIsrael’s war on Gaza, which has killed more than 27,000 Palestinians so far, most of them women and children. This is not the first time a visit to Iran by a Western adult performer has stirred controversy. In 2016, British performer Candy Charms travelled to Iran to have plastic surgery on her nose, sparking outrage and receiving heavy backlash online. “Love Tehran, the people are so kind and generous, really overwhelmed by the whole trip, the people are amazing,” she had written on her social media at the time.

A child dies every two hours in Sudan camp for displaced people: MSF,Medical group warns of catastrophic humanitarian situation in the Zamzam camp in Sudan’s North Darfur state.,"At least one child dies every two hours in a camp for displaced people in Sudan’s North Darfur state during a nine-month war that has caused the collapse of humanitarian services, a medical charity says. Before the war began in mid-April, the health system in North Darfur was supported by UN agencies. “This aid has now come to an abrupt halt,” read a report published on Monday by Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontieres, or MSF). “What we are seeing in Zamzam camp is an absolutely catastrophic situation,” said Claire Nicolet, head of MSF’s emergency response in Sudan. The charity estimated about 13 children die each day. “Those with severe malnutrition who have not yet died are at high risk of dying within three to six weeks if they do not get treatment. Their condition is treatable if they can get to a health facility. But many cannot,” Nicolet added. MSF is the only operational health provider in Zamzam camp, one of the largest and oldest camps for displaced people in the country. “Staff no longer receive salaries, equipment and medicines are in short supply, as are fuel for generators, water and other supplies that are needed to keep health facilities running,” the report said. “Malnutrition programmes that were once present in El Fasher – the state capital – are non-existent,” it added. Last year, a simmering rivalry between the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and the Sudanese army erupted into all-out war. The fighting has caused about 10.7 million people to flee their homes while 17.7 million are now facing acute hunger,United Nations agencies said. January is usually a month when malnutrition is at its lowest because stocks of food are filled up after December’s harvest, but because of the war, people have been unable to tend to their crops, MSF said. On top of the war, rainfall has been lower than usual, exacerbating the already dire humanitarian crisis in the region.

Israel’s ‘chilling disregard’ for life in occupied West Bank: Amnesty,"During its war in Gaza, Israel has unleashed unlawful lethal force against Palestinians in the West Bank, rights group says.","Israel has unleashed unlawful lethal force against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, carrying out unlawful killings and displaying “a chilling disregard for Palestinian lives”, Amnesty International says. The human rights organisation said in a report released on Monday that Israel’s actions in the territory have intensified during its war on Gaza and its military and other bodies are committing numerous illegal acts of violence that amount to clear violations of international law. The world’s eyes are mostly on theGaza Strip, where the Israeli military has killed more than 27,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, since the start of the war on October 7. But Israeli forces are also carrying out unlawful killings in occupied Palestinian territories, Amnesty said in thereport. The document was compiled with remote interviews with witnesses, first responders and local residents as well as verified videos and photos. “Under the cover of the relentless bombardment and atrocity crimes in Gaza, Israeli forces have unleashed unlawful lethal force against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, carrying out unlawful killings and displaying a chilling disregard for Palestinian lives,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Amnesty International’s director of global research, advocacy and policy. “These unlawful killings are in blatant violation of international human rights law and are committed with impunity in the context of maintaining Israel’s institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination over Palestinians.” Palestinians in the West Bank were already experiencing deadly Israeli raids on a regular basis even before the war, but there has been anexplosive increase in the number of Israeli attackssince October. According to figures by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Israel killed at least 507 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank in 2023, including at least 81 children, making it the deadliest year since the organisation started recording casualties in 2005. UN numbers also show that 299 Palestinians were killed from the start of the war until the end of 2023, a 50 percent increase compared with the first nine months of the year. At least 61 more Palestinians, including 13 children, were killed by Israeli forces in January, the UN said.    Amnesty International’s analysis of a 30-hour-long Israeli raid on the Nour Shams refugee camp in Tulkarem that took place on October 19 demonstrates the tactics employed by the Israeli military. In that raid, Israeli soldiers used a large number of military vehicles and soldiers to storm more than 40 homes. They destroyed personal belongings, drilled holes in walls for sniper outposts, cut off water and electricity to the refugee camp, and used bulldozers to destroy public roads, electricity networks and water infrastructure. By the end of the raid, they had killed 13 Palestinians, including six children, four of them under the age of 16, and had arrested 15 Palestinians. One Israeli border police officer was killed after an improvised explosive device was used against a military convoy. Among those killed during the raid was an unarmed 15-year-old named Taha Mahamid, whom Israeli forces shot dead in front of his house as he came out to check whether Israeli forces had left the area, Amnesty said. “They did not give him a chance,” said Fatima, Taha’s sister. “In an instant, my brother was eliminated. Three bullets were fired without any mercy. The first bullet hit him in the leg. The second in his stomach. Third in his eye. There were no confrontations. … There was no conflict.” Taha’s father, Ibrahim, tried to carry his son to safety while unarmed but was shot and suffered serious internal injuries. “This unnecessary use of lethal force should be investigated as possible war crimes of wilful killing and wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health,” Amnesty said. But that was not the end of the Israeli operation for the family. About 12 hours after Taha’s killing, the Israeli military stormed his family’s home and locked his family members, including three children, in a room under the supervision of a soldier for about 10 hours. They also drilled holes in the walls of two rooms to position snipers overlooking the neighbourhood. One witness said the soldiers searched the house, beating a member of the family, and one was seen urinating on the doorstep. The extensive damage done by Israeli bulldozers to the narrow streets of the refugee camp meant that ambulances could not get through, hampering medical evacuation of the injured.    Amnesty also documented instances in which Israeli forces directly opened fire on ambulances and medical staff. The obstruction of medical assistance to Palestinians by Israeli forces is now “routine practice”, the human rights organisation said. It documented one instance in which Israeli soldiers prevented ambulances from reaching victims who ended up bleeding to death. “The victims were later collected by an Israeli military ambulance, and their bodies have yet to be returned to their families,” Amnesty said. The organisation also documented how the Israeli military cracks down on peaceful Palestinian protests held in solidarity with the people of Gaza, firing live bullets and tear gas canisters into crowds.

Attack on Syrian US base kills Kurdish fighters as regional tension simmers,The strikes extend a series of tit-for-tat attacks as Israel’s war in Gaza threatens escalation across the region.,"A drone strike on a United States base in eastern Syria overnight has killed several fighters from Kurdish-led forces. The United Kingdom-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said on Monday that seven fighters were killed and at least 18 others injured. The attack followsUS strikeson targets in Iraq and Syria over the weekend. Iran-aligned armed groups said they had also struck US bases in Syria as well as western and northern Iraq, as a low-level war with Washington simmers. “This attack in the first response by the Iranian militias to American bases after American airstrikes on militia positions in various areas within areas they control,” the observatory said of Monday’s incident. The SOHR added that since October 19, “108 attacks” were carried out on bases of the US-led Combined Joint Task Force across Syria. The US-led coalition was set up in 2014 to fight ISIL (ISIS). The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) announced a different death toll, saying: “Six of our fighters were martyred due to a terrorist attack” with a one-way drone, targeting a “training academy in the Al Omar oilfield”. The extending series of strikes illustrates the rising threat that Israel’s bombardment of Gaza risks provoking a regional escalation across the Middle East. That danger rose dramatically late last month when a drone hit a US base in Jordan, killing three soldiers and wounding more than 40. Washington blamed the attack on Iran-backed forces and promised retaliation, which came over the weekend. The US military hit Tehran-backed groups in Iraq and Syria on Friday and Saturday. US and UK forces unleashed attacks against 36 Houthi targets in Yemen on Sunday. The US military’s Central Command (CENTCOM) said its forces “conducted a strike in self-defense against a Houthi … land attack cruise missile” and later hit “four anti-ship cruise missiles, all of which were prepared to launch against ships in the Red Sea”. Feb. 4 Summary of Additional USCENTCOM Self-Defense Strikes in Yemen On Feb. 4, at approximately 5:30 a.m. (Sanaa time), U.S. Central Command forces conducted a strike in self-defense against a Houthi a land attack cruise missile.

The Pentagon has insisted that it does not want a war with Iran. However, officials say that further military action is planned. White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told national TV on Sunday that Friday’s strikes were “the beginning, not the end, of our response, and there will be more steps – some seen, some perhaps unseen”. “I would not describe it as some open-ended military campaign,” he added. But when asked whether Washington would rule out the possibility of striking Iran directly, Sullivan said, “It would not be wise for me to talk about what we’re ruling in and ruling out.” In response, Iran said on Monday that it “will not hesitate” to respond if the US directly attacks its territory. Iran “has shown that it has always reacted decisively to any threat to its security, territorial integrity and sovereignty,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani said. He added that Tehran “will not hesitate to use its capabilities” to respond to any attacks but reiterated that it “does not seek to aggravate tensions and crises in the region”.    So far, Iran has avoided any direct role in the Gaza conflict and its overspill, despite its affiliation with groups that are at odds with the US. The Iran-backed Houthis, who have been attacking ships in the Red Sea for several months, in solidarity, they assert, with Palestinians in Gaza, said on Sunday that the US and UK strikes would not defeat them. “These attacks will not deter us from our … stance in support of the steadfast Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip,” said Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree on social media. The strikes “will not pass without response and punishment”, he added.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/5/several-kurdish-led-fighters-killed-in-attack-on-us-base-in-syria
"A year on from Turkey’s earthquake disaster, the trauma haunts survivors","Thousands of lives changed forever when powerful earthquakes hit Turkey and Syria last year, and mental scars remain.","Gaziantep, Turkey– When Elmas Abdulghani has a flashback, her body still shakes like the floor of her apartment on that early February morning a year ago. She was woken up by the screams of her husband, crying: “Elmas, wake up! Save your life!” “I just remember fear and confusion,” 35-year-old Abdulghani says, almost tearing up as her mind travels back in time. Abdulghani’s husband did not survive the first magnitude 7.8 earthquake, followed by a second magnitude 7.6 one later in the day and hundreds of aftershocks, that killed more than 50,000 people in southeastern Turkey and northern Syria on February 6 last year. But Abdulghani did and, since that day, she has had to deal with the restlessness of mind that came from losing the love of her life and her home in Gaziantep, an important city in the southeast a few kilometres from the epicentre. The earthquakes created unimaginable psychological stressors for survivors like Abdulghani, from injuries and lasting fear of aftershocks to experiencing the destruction, displacement and deaths around them. A few weeks after the physical emergency needs were met, groups of volunteer therapists and mental health NGO workers were deployed across the region to support victims and help them process their trauma. “I’ve worked on other earthquakes and natural disasters in our country, such as the 1999 earthquake in Izmir, but this was different from any other,” says Hayal Demirci, a psychotherapist from the EMDR Trauma Recovery Group, which has deployed teams of mental health workers in tented settlements, container cities, hotels and temporary dormitories since early March last year. In the first few weeks of their deployment, Demirci and more than 1,000 volunteer therapists worked to provide a physically safe environment to reduce people’s acute reactions and, after a while, to establish a safe therapeutic bond and work with these reactions. Demirci explains that when the normal bonds between people disappear, the mind triggers the most primitive defence mechanisms to face a harsh reality. “There have been way too many losses of family members, friends, limbs, homes, cities and hope for the future. “When these defence mechanisms are active, the sympathetic nervous system is on duty and … the person [feels] like they are in danger all the time. It’s not possible for people who don’t feel safe anywhere, at any time, to eat, sleep or meet their basic needs properly,” she says. Most people, even after the aftershocks eventually disappeared, felt restless for months. “Even though my family house was declared safe one week after the earthquake, I still didn’t feel safe staying inside,” says Mert Ozyurtkan, a 22-year-old engineering student at Gaziantep University. “I would constantly stare at water bottles to see if the water was moving or at ceiling lamps to check if they were swinging slightly. It increased my anxiety levels, and affected my grades.” While most mental health support in crises focuses on a short-term, emergency approach, Demirci underlines the importance of continuing to work with victims online to address triggers and control flashbacks to reduce any symptoms. For some, the earthquake changed entire lifestyles. Neslihan Hicdonmez and her husband Ali Ozaslan started living in a camper van and kept their camping sleeping bags at hand because they no longer felt safe in their own home. “The earthquake totally impacted our way of living. We had never thought of abandoning our newly bought house, but we constantly live with the fear that something of that magnitude may happen again.” If adults find the effects catastrophic, for children in their early development the disaster left an indelible mark. Sare Bitir, a fourth-grader at Ilkokulu Elementary School in Gaziantep, still brings her doll to school for comfort. “It’s the first object I brought with me when we ran out of the house,” she says. “It kept me company for three days while we were sleeping in our car because our house didn’t make us feel safe. It gives me confidence.” Children are among the most exposed group, says clinical psychologist Zeynep Bahadir, who has expertise in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and volunteered for six weeks with the Turkish Red Crescent as an emergency online psychologist for families with young children. She adds that whether children have been directly affected or experienced secondary trauma, “they can be at the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, including nightmares and avoidance behaviour”. Separation anxiety specifically has shown up in school settings. When she returned to school in September, Sare did not want to enter the class, too afraid to say goodbye to her parents. It took a very patient teacher and friendly classmates to bring her inside, although, for the first few weeks, she couldn’t focus. Some children avoided school for several weeks in a row. According to Bahadir, fear can persist in children long after the earthquake has passed, which “sometimes can be temporary, but can also adapt into their lives forever”. The situation has been worse for Syrian refugees in Turkey who fled there during Syria’s war, says Yara al-Atrash, a mental health worker at INARA NGO. Al-Atrash has been in charge of psychological assistance to Syrians living in container camps and assisted many who have lost homes and children, just like they did during the war back home. “Having to live again the trauma of death, loss and displacement, as well as realising that the new place that gave them safety was no longer safe, was a last blow to those who had survived the Syrian conflict,” she says. Abdulghani, who lived through an offensive in her hometown of Homs, Syria, says the earthquakes reawakened traumas she thought she had healed. She had not sought therapy, even after the war, but her restlessness as the one-year mark since the earthquake neared finally made her seek help about two months ago. Now Abdulghani has been living in Istanbul since February 2023, incapable of returning to Gaziantep and reliving her trauma. In therapy, she hopes to address this fear to be able to finally return. “Therapy culture is not yet something known in our region, especially in the earthquake zone and villages, which were however the most impacted,” Demirci says. Many said they were not ready for therapy, but emergency workers tried to encourage them to speak about their wounds. “Those who do not receive support in the acute period may, in the long term, suffer from addictions, including alcohol and drugs, anger and impulse control problems, or even somatic issues such as fibromyalgia, or migraine,” Demirci adds. “The consequences could be as devastating as the earthquake itself in the future.” Demirci’s work with survivors will continue for at least three more years, the minimum time required to make sure their healing path will be effective. As aftershocks in the region continue, people say that coping with them as part of daily life is their new normal. Songul Dogan, who moved to Gaziantep after her home was destroyed in the earthquake last year, was paying a visit to her native Malatya this past January 6 when a magnitude 4.5 earthquake hit the town. “We can no longer trust the ground we walk on,” she says bitterly. “How can we keep going and still feel safe without losing our minds?”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/5/a-year-on-from-turkeys-quake-disaster-the-trauma-haunts-survivors

US-UK strikes on Yemen’s Houthis: What we know so far,The Houthis say they remain undeterred after the latest round of strikes that hit dozens of targets.,"The Houthi group in Yemen has again vowed that its attacks aimed at stopping Israel’s war on Gaza will not stop after the United States and the United Kingdom launched dozens of strikes overnight on Saturday. The latest strikes, backed by six other allies, come a day after the US launched dozens of strikes targeting armed groups in Iraq and Syria that Washington said were backed by Iran. The Houthis initially attacked only Israeli-linked ships in the Red Sea in solidarity with Palestinians, but expanded their attacks to include British and US ships after Washington and London launched strikes in Yemen. Let’s take a look at which Houthi targets were attacked, what kind of weaponry was used, and how everyone has reacted to it. The US and UK launched a barrage of strikes against Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen on Saturday, February 3. The US Central Command (CENTCOM) said it hit a Houthi antiship missile in the Red Sea on Sunday in a separate attack. The US and UK said they targeted 36 Houthi positions in Yemen, while Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree said the capital, Sanaa, was among the places attacked in Saturday’s strikes. So far there have been no reports of casualties. The targets included underground storage facilities, command and control centres, missile systems, drone storage and operations sites, radars, and helicopters, according to CENTCOM. The US military said it hit 36 Houthi targets in 13 locations, but as with many previous strikes on Yemen since the start of the war on Gaza, it refrained from disclosing further details. This was the third large joint operation against the Houthis in two weeks. The US had also announced strikes on several anti-ship cruise missiles that it said posed a threat to its military vessels and commercial ships travelling through waters near Yemen. The military of the Yemeni group, also known as Ansarallah, said it was targeted by 48 attacks on multiple governorates, including 13 on Sanaa and surrounding areas, 11 on Taiz, nine on Hodeidah, seven on al-Bayda, seven on Hajjah, and one on Saada. It reported no casualties.    The Houthi targets were struck by both fighter jets and military ships of the US military, and fighter aircraft from the British air force. F/A-18 fighter jets from the USS Dwight D Eisenhower aircraft carrier, British Typhoon FGR4 fighter aircraft, and US Navy destroyers USS Gravely and USS Carney participated in the strikes, according to US officials and UK Defence Ministry authorities cited by the Associated Press. The US ships fired Tomahawk missiles from the Red Sea, it said. The strikes come as the Houthis continue to launch missile, drone and boat attacks against Israel-linked commercial vessels and US and UK military ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden almost on a daily basis. The Houthis say the attacks, which have disrupted global trade, will stop when Israel ceases fire in Gaza. The Yemen strikes happened a day after the US launched strikes in retaliation for the drone attack by the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a coalition of armed groups linked to Iran, that killed three US soldiers at an outpost in Jordan on January 28. The US military said its forces struck 85 targets in Syria and Iraq linked to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and political and military groups. Some of the armed groups, which are part of the Iran-backed “axis of resistance”, have carried out dozens of attacks against US interests in the region in the wake of Israel’s brutal war on Gaza. They demand that Israel declare a ceasefire and allow humanitarian aid in the Palestinian enclave facing famine-like conditions. They have also vowed to fight the US military presence in Syria and Iraq and other places, which they consider to be “occupation” of their lands. Syria’s eastern province of Deir el-Zour and the northeastern province of Hasakeh, where US bases are located, have come under attack for years. The Euphrates River cuts through Syria into Iraq, with US troops and US-backed Kurdish-led fighters on the east bank and Iran-backed fighters and Syrian government forces to the west. US bases in Iraq, particularly the Ain al-Assad base, have come under hundreds of attacks over the past few years as well. The base was where the IRGC launched missiles after Washington assassinated its top general Qassem Soleimani in January 2020. The attack left dozens of US soldiers injured, but none killed. Iran-backed armed groups control the Iraqi side of the border and move freely in and out of Syria, where they man posts with their allies from Lebanon’s powerful Hezbollah and other Shia armed groups. Tehran is the main military backer of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the decade-long war.    The US military flew in B1 bombers from the US to strike targets in Iraq and Syria. It said the barrage of strikes hit command and control headquarters, intelligence centres, rockets and missiles, drone and ammunition storage sites, and other facilities connected to the Quds Force, the external operations arm of the IRGC. Syrian opposition activists said the strikes hit the Imam Ali base near the border Syrian town of Boukamal, the Ein Ali base in Quriya, just south of the strategic town of Mayadeen, and a radar centre on a mountain near the provincial capital that is also called Deir el-Zour. Rami Abdurrahman, who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said 29 rank-and-file fighters were killed in those strikes, according to AP. Al Jazeera could not independently verify the casualty figures. The attacks also hit a border crossing known as Humaydiya, where militia cross back and forth between Iraq and Syria, according to Omar Abu Layla, a Europe-based activist who heads the Deir Ezzor 24 media outlet. He said the strikes also hit an area inside the town of Mayadeen known as “the security quarter.” Iraqi government spokesperson Bassim al-Awadi said the border strikes killed 16 people and caused “significant damage” to homes and private properties. The Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), a coalition of Iran-backed militia that is nominally under the control of the Iraqi military, said the strikes in western Iraq hit a logistical support post, a tanks battalion, an artillery post and a hospital. The PMF said 16 people were killed and 36 wounded, and that authorities were searching for other missing people. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, which was blamed for the Jordan attack, targeted US interests in both Iraq and Syria hours after the US strikes. They promised more will come. Iran, Iraq and Syria were quick to condemn the US strikes, which they said violate the sovereignty of both countries. This is coming as Iraqi politicians have been increasingly discussing the withdrawal of US troops from the country. Along with Hamas, Tehran pointed out that the strikes also serve to shield Israel as they take away attention from its attacks on Palestinians, more than 27,000 of whom have been killed in Gaza since October. The UK and EU supported Washington, while analysts expressed concerns that the cycle of violence could lead to an all-out war across the region.

"US, UK launch new wave of strikes on Yemen’s Houthis amid Gaza war","The new wave of attacks comes as Houthis continue to target Israel-linked ships, demanding an end to the war in Gaza.","The United States and the United Kingdom have carried out strikes on Houthi-controlled positions in Yemen in a new wave of attacks against the Iran-aligned Yemeni group, which has been targeting US and Israeli interests in solidarity with Palestinians. In addition to Saturday’s strikes, the US Central Command (CENTCOM) also hit a Houthi antiship missile that was “prepared to launch against ships in the Red Sea” early on Sunday. Houthi attacks on Israel-linked ships in the narrow strait of Bab al-Mandeb in the Red Sea have disrupted global trade, drawing in the US and the UK response. Since mid-November, the Houthis have launched dozens of missile, drone and boat attacks on commercial ships linked with Israel, in addition to US and UK military warships, with the stated goal of stopping Israel’s devastating war on Gaza. The Houthis have also demanded that Israel allow the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza, where nearly the entire population of 2.3 million faceshunger. The wave of new strikes followed a US air assault in Iraq and Syria on Friday that targeted armed groups linked to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in retaliation for the killing of three US soldiers in Jordan last week. The US hasblamed the Jordan attackon the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a coalition of Iranian-linked armed groups. Tehran has tried to distance itself from the drone strike. The CENTCOM said it launched “proportionate” attacks with “support” from Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, and New Zealand. Thirty-six targets were hit “across 13 locations around midnight Saturday”, the US, the UK and supporting countries said in a joint statement. “These strikes are intended to degrade Houthi capabilities used to continue their reckless and unlawful attacks on US and UK ships as well as international commercial shipping in the Red Sea, Bab al-Mandeb Strait, and the Gulf of Aden,” it said. Reporting from Washington, DC, Al Jazeera’s Kimberly Halkett said the strikes were aimed at deterring Houthi attacks on US interests in the region. “What we understand is that weapons facilities were targeted, along with missile systems and launchers, as well air defence systems and radar. We know these strikes were launched from ships as well as fighter jets,” she said. The US-UK statement did not identify the specific places that were hit, but Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree said the capital, Sanaa, and other rebel-held areas were targeted. Saree said there were 48 attacks on multiple governorates, including 13 on Sanaa and surrounding areas, 11 on Taiz, nine on Hodeidah, seven on al-Bayda, seven on Hajjah, and one on Sa’dah. Video shared online by people in Sanaa included the sound of explosions and at least one blast was seen lighting up the night sky. “These attacks will not go unanswered and will be punished,” he reiterated, adding that thegroup remains undeterredin “supporting the steadfast Palestinian people”. Reporting from Sanaa, Al Jazeera’s Mohamed al-Attab said some of the air raids were on mountainous areas that the Houthis said had been targeted before. “So, we are talking about increasing air strikes by the US and the UK in order to limit what they say is Houthis’ ability to hurt US and UK maritime forces and attacks on Israeli ships, and the Houthis say this is pressure on Israel to end its aggression on people in Gaza and to end its blockade there,” he said. Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Nasser Kanaani condemned the attacks on Yemen in a statement on Sunday, saying they undermine international peace and security and go against Washington and London’s claims that they do not wish for wider war in the region. “The US and the UK, in continuing their all-out support for the war crimes of the Zionist regime with their military actions across the region, are spreading chaos, disorder, insecurity and instability with the goal of providing breathing room for the criminal regime that is accused of genocide of Palestinians,” he said, referring tothe ongoing genocide case against Israelat the International Court of Justice.    Washington intends to carry out additional air strikes against Iran-backed groups in the Middle East “to send a clear message that the United States will respond when our forces are attacked”, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told US broadcaster NBC on Sunday. Separately, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told Fox News that Friday night’s US strikes against Iran-backed groups were just the “first round” of action and more would follow. Houthi spokesperson Mohammed Abdulsalam warned the attacks by the US and UK – whether in Yemen, Iraq or Syria – will pull them into a quagmire in the region and “fan the flames of hatred of our people”. “Yemen’s decision to support Gaza is firm, principled and will not be affected by any attack,” he said. Abdulsalam also said: “Instead of escalating and opening a new war front in the region, America and Britain should listen to international public opinion, which is calling for an immediate halt to the Israeli aggression, lifting the siege on Gaza, and ending protection to Israel at the expense of the Palestinian people.” Sullivan said that humanitarian issues in Gaza will be a top priority for US Secretary of State Antony Blinken who will visit Israel, Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the occupied West Bank this week. Several peoplewere killed in the US strikes in Iraq, which Washington said was only the first step in its response to the Jordan drone attack that killed US soldiers. On Sunday, hundreds of people attended a funeral procession in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, for 17 members of the Iran-aligned Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF) killed in the strikes. US and allied troops in the region have been attacked more than 165 times since mid-October, mostly in Iraq and Syria, but the Jordan deaths were the first from hostile fire during that period. The Iran-aligned armed groups in these countries say the US interests are legitimate targets due to Washington’s military and diplomatic support to Israel in its war on Gaza. Iran, Iraq, Syria and others strongly condemned the attacks, while Russia, which backs Syrian President Bashar al-Assad,has called for an urgent meetingof the United Nations Security Council, which is expected to take place in New York on Monday. Negotiations to reach an agreement between Israel and Hamas on the war on Gaza are ongoing, with US outlet NBC quoting an unnamed US official as saying the talks are not expected to be hampered by the latest Western attacks amid fears of a wider regional escalation.

Do Yemen’s Houthis have their eye on Marib?,"The Houthis’ stance in support of Palestine is gaining accolades, could they also be looking at a domestic win?","Beirut, Lebanon– In the Red Sea, Yemen’s Houthi group continues to attack Israel-linked vessels in support of the people of Gaza, vowing to continue until Israel stops its relentless assault on the trapped population. Internationally, the Red Sea attacks have grabbed headlines, not least for the dedication they demonstrate to the Palestinian cause and the Houthi willingness to take action. “The Houthis aren’t going to stop what they’re doing, until the Israeli offensive in Gaza concludes,” Eurasia Group analyst Gregory Brew, told Al Jazeera. The Houthi rebel group, which took over the capital Sanaa in 2014, is still facing off against an internationally recognised Yemeni government represented by a Presidential Leadership Council (PLC) of Saudi and Emirati-backed forces. Domestically, analysts believe the Houthis have their eyes on completing their control of a strategic location that could drastically expand their influence in Yemen and bolster their ambitions as a regional actor: Marib. A region rich in natural resources, primarily oil and gas, Marib is about two hours east of Sanaa and strategically close to other oil-producing regions controlled by UAE-backed militias that oppose the Houthis. In recent weeks, Yemen analysts have seen reports of the Houthis building up a troop presence near Marib, although to what extent is hard to determine, and that smaller clashes in the area have continued. Marib is “one of the most strategically important points in Yemen”, Yemen analyst Nick Brumfield told Al Jazeera. “If the Houthis are really trying to take it … they’re not only in a good position to try to take Marib, they have a perfect in into Shabwah, and splitting southern Yemen in two.” In 1990, the People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen (South Yemen) unified with the Yemen Arab Republic (North Yemen). While the country has been united since, some factions – including groups in the PLC – have strong secessionist ambitions for the south. Various tribes reign supreme in other areas. Former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh once said governing Yemen was akin to “dancing on the heads of snakes”. “The Marib front is one of the fronts that flares up from time to time since the UN truce was declared in April 2022,” Faozi al-Goidi, a junior visiting fellow at the Middle East Council on Global Affairs, told Al Jazeera. The Houthis already control about 12 of 14 districts in the Marib governorate. But the two most important districts, al-Wadi and Marib City, are controlled by the al-Islah party, the Muslim Brotherhood affiliate that is part of the internationally recognised government. Al-Wadi, in particular, contains an important oilfield that the Houthis want to control, analysts said. “The Houthis are eager, if not desperate, to capture Marib’s oil resources and revenues,” Hannah Porter, an independent Yemen analyst, told Al Jazeera. “If the Houthis take Marib, then they would effectively control every important area of northern Yemen and they would become much more powerful economically.” It is unclear if the Houthis are planning another offensive on Marib. They have tried to take Marib repeatedly in recent years, but each effort was repelled with high numbers of losses for Houthi forces. “Marib has been seen as a red line that the Houthis cannot be allowed to cross,” Porter said. Not only would taking Marib expand the Houthis’ economic capabilities, it would level a crippling blow to the internationally recognised government. “⁠Should the Houthis succeed in fully capturing Marib, it will diminish the presence of the internationally recognised government and Islah to only a few small areas, namely Taiz and Wadi Hadramout,” said Raiman al-Hamdani, a Yemen researcher at the ARK Group. “This will also erode the internationally recognised government’s credibility, negatively impacting their negotiation position as well as their local support.” The Houthis and Saudi Arabia are currently engaging in ceasefire talks after a grinding civil war that lasted nearly a decade. Both have seemed committed to a deal, with analysts saying Houthis actions in the Red Sea and domestically are part of a strategy to negotiate better terms. In recent months, the Houthis have benefitted from widespread recruitment campaigns thanks to the popularity of their attacks on vessels that they say are connected to Israel. Analysts have said it is unclear if retaliatory US air raids or the attacks on US and UK warships have further drawn support to the Houthis, but the group has continued to turn out a crowd – in the millions, they claim – at Friday rallies. Many of these recruits joined to fight Israel, but the Houthis could use them to buttress their forces deployed in Yemen. Meanwhile, the Saudis have grown weary of militarily confronting the Houthis after entering the Yemeni civil war on the side of the internationally recognized government in 2015. For now, the Saudis seem committed to ceasefire negotiations with the Houthis since a truce was announced in April 2022. “Saudi Arabia is determined to achieve calm and ceasefire in Yemen, but the events of the Al-Aqsa Flood operation and the Gaza war delayed the signing process,” al-Goidi said. While tension builds around a potential offensive in Marib, the Red Sea attacks have remained the international focal point. Houthi forces announced on Wednesday that they fired several missiles at a US destroyer, the USS Greeley, and they would continue to attack US and UK warships in the Red Sea until the US-backed Israeli war on Gaza ends. The US and UK launcheda series of air raidsat Houthi targets in January, but their attempts at deterrence have had little effect as the Houthis continue to disrupt shipping traffic passing through the Red Sea that they say is connected to Israel. “Most of the targets hit by the American raids are targets that have been bombed repeatedly over the years of the war, so they are militarily useless,” said al-Goidi. “The only benefit [for the US] may be that some of the raids stopped or, let us say, reduced some of the Houthi group’s ballistic attacks on ships, as ballistic missile platforms were bombed before they were launched. “As the US Department of Defense says, the rest of the raids have no effect on the ground,” al-Goidi said. “If America escalates its attacks, it may restart the Yemen war from scratch.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/4/do-yemens-houthis-have-their-eye-on-marib

‘Overshadow Gaza crimes’: World reacts to US attacks on Iraq and Syria,"Iran, Iraq and Syria have strongly condemned the US strikes, saying they will only escalate regional tensions.","The United States hasconducted a wave of air strikeson Iran-aligned targets in Iraq and Syria in retaliation for an attack that killed American soldiers in Jordan. On Saturday, Iraq said 16 people, including civilians, were killed on its soil, and a monitoring group reported 18 people were killed in Syria. Washington haswarned of more strikesto purportedly deter the Iran-backed “axis of resistance” amidIsrael’s war on Gaza. In announcing the overnight attacks, US President Joe Biden said: “Our response began today. It will continue at times and places of our choosing.” Here is how the world reacted to the US action: “The attacks are a violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq and Syria, international law, and a clear violation of the United Nations Charter,” said Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Nasser Kanaani. “In addition to an all-out support of the US for four months of relentless and barbaric attacks by the Zionist regime against the residents of Gaza and the West Bank, and military attacks on Yemen and violating the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country, last night’s attacks on Syria and Iraq were another adventurous action and another strategic error by the US government which will have no result but to intensify tensions and instability in the region.” “The attacks merely support the goals of the Zionist regime. Such attacks increasingly involve the US government in the region and overshadow the crimes of the Zionist regime in Gaza.” “This aggressive strike will put security in Iraq and the region on the brink of the abyss,” the Iraqi government said in a statement, and denied Washington’s claims of coordinating the air raids with Baghdad as “false” and “aimed at misleading international public opinion”. The presence of the US-led military coalition in the region “has become a reason for threatening security and stability in Iraq and a justification for involving Iraq in regional and international conflicts”, read the statement from Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani’s office. “Iraq reiterates its refusal to let the country be an arena for settling scores,” said government spokesperson Basim Alwadi. Yahya Rasool, the Iraqi military spokesperson, said the attacks “constitute a violation of Iraqi sovereignty, undermine the efforts of the Iraqi government, and pose a threat that could lead Iraq and the region into dire consequences”. “The outcomes will have severe implications on the security and stability in Iraq and the surrounding region,” Rasool added.    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the strikes served to “inflame the conflict in the Middle East in an extremely dangerous way” and added to Washington’s “record of violations against Syria’s sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the safety of its people, proving once again that it is the main source of global instability”. The military said, “The area targeted by the American attacks in eastern Syria is the same area where the Syrian Arab Army is fighting the remnants of the Daesh [ISIL] terrorist organisation, and this confirms that the United States and its military forces are involved and allied with this organisation, and are working to revive it as a field arm for it both in Syria and Iraq by all dirty means.” “The aggression of the American occupation forces at dawn today has no justification other than an attempt to weaken the ability of the Syrian Arab Army and its allies in the field of fighting terrorism, but the army.” The coalition of US and Israel-opposed armed groups in Iraq, which had “suspended” its attacks earlier this week, said it launched drones at a US base in Erbil. Al Jazeera’s Mahmoud Abdelwahed reported from Baghdad that Iraqi groups have also carried out attacks with missiles targeting the al-Tanf military base in Syria which is home to US personnel, as well as the Ain al-Assad base in western Iraq. “We condemn in the strongest terms the American aggression against Iraq and Syria, and consider it a dangerous escalation, an infringement on the sovereignty of the two Arab countries, and a threat to their security and the stability of the region, in service of the occupation’s expansionist agenda and covering up its horrific crimes against our Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip,” read a statement from Hamas. “The administration of US President Biden bears responsibility for the consequences of this brutal aggression against both Iraq and Syria, which adds fuel to the fire, and we affirm that the region will not witness stability or peace except by stopping the Zionist aggression, crimes of genocide and ethnic cleansing against our people in the Gaza Strip, and ending the Zionist-Nazi occupation.”    “Hezbollah strongly condemns the blatant American aggression against Iraq and Syria. What the United States of America has done is a blatant violation of the sovereignty of the two countries, an attack on their security and territorial integrity, and a shameless violation of all international and humanitarian laws,” the Lebanese group said in a statement. “It is obvious that the airstrikes are deliberately designed to further inflame the conflict,” said Russia’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova. “By attacking, almost without pause, the facilities of allegedly pro-Iranian groups in Iraq and Syria, the United States is purposefully trying to drive the largest countries in the region into conflict.” Russia also called an “urgent” United Nations Security Council meeting over the US strikes. “We just demanded an urgent sitting of the UN Security Council over the threat to peace and safety created by US strikes on Syria and Iraq,” Moscow’s diplomat at the UN, Dmitry Polyansky, said on social media on Saturday. “Everybody should try to avoid that the situation becomes explosive,” said EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell. While Borrell did not address the US strikes directly, he repeated a warning that the Middle East “is a boiler that can explode”. He pointed to the war in Gaza, violence along the Israel-Lebanon border, bombings in Iraq and Syria, and attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. “That’s why we call everybody to try to avoid an escalation.” “The UK and US are steadfast allies. We wouldn’t comment on their operations, but we support their right to respond to attacks,” a British government spokesperson said in a statement. “We have long condemned Iran’s destabilising activity throughout the region, including its political, financial and military support to a number of militant groups.” “Iran’s proxies have played with fire for months and years, and it’s now burning them,” Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski told reporters as he arrived for a meeting with his EU counterparts in Brussels. Mike Johnson, the Republican speaker of the US House of Representatives, accused Biden of “placating” Tehran after the strikes, and said that “to promote peace, America must project strength”. “Instead of waging war across the Middle East, the Biden administration should demand an end to the far-right Israeli government’s ethnic cleansing and genocide in Gaza,”saidCAIR’s National Executive Director Nihad Awad. The US has ignored Israel’s “escalating human rights abuses”, maintained its troops in Syria, Iraq and other places “where they are not welcome”, and refused to re-enter the Iranian nuclear deal, Nihad noted. “These latest strikes in Iraq and Syria are just further evidence of the total failure of the president’s Middle East policy. President Biden should change course to protect both American soldiers and people of the region from more violence … Justice and freedom for the Palestinian people – not more bombs – is what can build a more peaceful future for the region.” Trita Parsi, executive vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, questioned the effectiveness of the US bombings. “The aim is to degrade their ability to strike over a longer period of time, albeit at the risk of starting a regional war. This is ultimately a suboptimal strategy. It would be more effective to reduce their interest in striking against the US … The most effective way to shift the interest of these militias is through a ceasefire in Gaza,” said Parsi. “There is no escaping this reality: Nothing in the region is likely to de-escalate unless there is de-escalation in Gaza. Unfortunately, Biden’s approach thus far has been to avoid putting material pressure on Israel for a ceasefire.” Joshua Landis, associate professor and director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, told Al Jazeera that politicians in Washington are pressuring Biden for a stronger response as the US presidential election looms. “He has to respond, but at the same time he’s made it very clear he does not want to escalate, and that means two things; he can hit Syrians, that’s easy and nobody cares about the Syrian government, but the Americans do care about the Iraqi government.” “America does not want to get ejected from Iraq, particularly not before the elections in November. So, it wants to be strong, but it doesn’t want to kill too many Iraqis.” HA Hellyer, a military analyst at the UK-based think tank Royal United Services Institute, told Al Jazeera, adding that if the US wants to de-escalate and not go to war with Iran, the key to that is Gaza. Washington has “failed to apply any real leverage in order to bring a ceasefire to Gaza, which I think would really diminish the tensions in the region and remove the fuel for this sort of escalation taking place, which is likely to continue over the coming days and weeks and beyond”, he said.

"‘Strategic error’: Iran condemns US attacks on Iraq, Syria",Iran’s Foreign Ministry says overnight US strikes are ‘violations of the sovereignty and territorial integrity’ of the two countries.,"Iran says the attacks by the United States inside Iraq and Syria are a “strategic error” that will only add to tensions and instability in the Middle East heightened by Israel’smilitary campaignin Gaza. The US forces launched awave of air strikesagainst Iranian-backed fighters in Iraq and Syria on Friday in retaliation for a drone attack in Jordan that killed three American soldiers on Sunday. US President Joe Biden later said the strikes “will continue at times and places of our choosing”.    In a statement on Saturday, Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said the US attacks were a “violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq and Syria, international law, and a clear violation of the United Nations Charter”. “The attacks merely support the goals of the Zionist regime. Such attacks increasingly involve the US government in the region and overshadow the crimes of the Zionist regime in Gaza,” it said, referring to Israel. “The continuation of such adventures is a threat to regional and international peace and security,” it added, urging the United Nations Security Council and the international community to prevent the expansion of the crisis. The Iranian statement said the “roots of the tension and crisis in the region go back to the occupation by the Israeli regime and the continuation of this regime’s military operations in Gaza and the genocide of the Palestinians with the unlimited support of the US”. “The return of stability and security to the region cannot be imagined but through focusing on the root cause of the crisis and resolving it,” it said. The US has operated military bases around the Middle East for decades. There are about 30,000 US soldiers scattered across the region. In addition, since the Gaza war began in October, the US has temporarily sent thousands of additional troops to the region, including on warships. Friday’s strikes by the US appeared to stop short of directly targeting Iran or senior leaders of the Iranian army within its borders. Iran has denied it was behind the Jordan attack.

"Iraq says 16 people, including civilians, killed in ‘new US aggression’","In response, Iran-aligned groups say they have attacked US bases in Syria as well as western and northern Iraq.","At least 16 people have been killed in US strikes in Iraq, the government said, as it condemned the “new aggression against” its sovereignty and warned of dire consequences in the region. Civilians were among those killed and 25 people were wounded in the bombings that targeted both civilian and security areas, a government spokesperson said on Saturday. The United States warned of more retaliatory attacks after it hit Iran-linked targets in Iraq and Syria overnight in response to an attack that killed American soldiers in Jordan amidIsrael’s war on Gaza. “This aggressive strike will put security in Iraq and the region on the brink of the abyss,” the Iraqi government said, and denied Washington’s claims of coordinating the air attacks with Baghdad as “false” and “aimed at misleading international public opinion”. The presence of the US-led military coalition in the region “has become a reason for threatening security and stability in Iraq and a justification for involving Iraq in regional and international conflicts”, read the statement from Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani’s office. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs subsequently summoned the US charge d’affaires in Baghdad to deliver a formal protest. The Syrian Ministry of Defence slammed the “aggression of the American occupation forces”, which it said was attempting “to weaken the ability of the Syrian Arab Army and its allies in the field of fighting terrorism”, adding that the areas targeted were the same where the military is fighting remnants of the ISIL (ISIS) armed group. Syrian state media reported several casualties after the attacks in the country’s desert region and border areas with Iraq. The United Kingdom-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 23 Iran-aligned fighters were killed in the Syria attacks, but it could not be independently verified. The strikes did not take place inside Iranian territory. Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday called them “another adventurous action and another strategic error by the US government which will have no result but to intensify … instability in the region”. US National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told journalists that the goal of the “multitiered” attacks was to stop attacks by Iran-aligned groups, and not to start a war with Iran. The Iranian ministry said tensions in the region “go back to the occupation by the Israeli regime and [its] military operations in Gaza and the genocide of the Palestinians with the unlimited support of the US”, adding that stability would only return by resolving “the root cause of the crisis”.    President Joe Biden said the strikes “will continue at times and places of our choosing” as his chief diplomat Antony Blinken is preparing to embark on his fifth regional tour since October 7 from Sunday, visiting Israel, the occupied West Bank, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Qatar. The US Central Command (CENTCOM) said itflew bombers from the USand used more than 125 precision munitions to hit more than 85 targets that included command and control operations centres, intelligence centres, weapons storage and supply chain facilities of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the armed groups backed by Tehran. Iraqi security sources told Al Jazeera that six air strikes targeted a number of locations in the country. Even though Washington said all its intended targets were supported by the Quds Force command of the IRGC, no Iranian personnel are believed to have been killed. The US took nearly a week to act after three of its soldiers were killed in a drone attack on the Tower 22 base near the Syria-Jordan border to strike back, andcontinued to leak information to the mediaprior to the overnight raids. The attack on the US base had been claimed by the coalition of forces known as the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, which views US troops as “occupying forces” and has demanded an end to Israel’s deadly war on Gaza. Iran, which, Washington suspects of supplying the weapons thathit the American soldiers in Tower 22but not of ordering the attack, has maintained that members of the “axis of resistance” that it supports across the region act independently. Reporting from Baghdad, Al Jazeera’s Mahmoud Abdelwahed said on Saturday that the Iraqi resistance, which includes Iran-aligned groups, carried out attacks, with missiles targeting the al-Tanf military base in Syria that is home to US personnel, as well as the Ain al-Assad base in western Iraq. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, which had announced the suspension of hostile operations against US troops this week, said it “attacked the American occupation’s Harir base in Erbil” in northern Iraq with an unspecified number of drones on Saturday. It said in a statement that the attack comes in resisting “American occupation forces” in Iraq and across the region, and in standing up to Israel’s war on Gaza. However, three security sources quoted by the Reuters news agency said there had been no attack detected on the air base hosting US forces. The Biden administration’s actions triggered dissatisfied reactions from US politicians who have demanded stronger and faster attacks, including direct strikes on Iranian soil, despite concerns that such a move would lead to an all-out war. Mike Johnson, the Republican speaker of the US House of Representatives, accused the president of “placating” Tehran after the strikes, and said: “To promote peace, America must project strength.” But the same US politicians are refusing to mention the Gaza war that has killed more than 27,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, as being a key link in thechain of more than 150 attacksthat have been directed at US bases in Iraq and Syria since last October. “I’m not surprised there has been this reprisal and retaliation by the United States,” HA Hellyer, a military analyst at the UK-based think tank Royal United Services Institute, told Al Jazeera, adding that if the US wants to de-escalate and not go to war with Iran the key to that is Gaza. Washington has “failed to apply any real leverage in order to bring a ceasefire to Gaza, which I think would really diminish the tensions in the region and remove the fuel for this sort of escalation taking place, which is likely to continue over the coming days and weeks and beyond”, he added.

Turkey appoints Fatih Karahan as new central bank chief after Erkan resigns,The appointment comes a few hours after the resignation of Hafize Gaye Erkan citing a media scandal.,"President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has named the central bank’s Deputy Governor Fatih Karahan as its new head following the resignation of the chief,Hafize Gaye Erkan. The appointment of the former senior economist at the US online retail giant Amazon was announced in the Official Gazette early on Saturday, hours after Erkan said she was stepping down partly due to the need to protect her family amid a media scandal. Cabinet leaders quickly said the economic programme that had begun cooling inflation expectations after a years-long cost-of-living crisis would carry on under Karahan, who is seen as having played a key role in engineering the monetary tightening. The first woman to lead the bank, Erkan began raising interest rates when she was appointed in June last year, launching a 180-degree pivot away from years of low rates under Erdogan that had sentinflation soaringand foreign investors fleeing. Since then, the central bank has hiked its key rate to 45 percent from 8.5 percent. Last week, after another 250-basis-point rise, it said it had tightened enough to achieve disinflation, signalling a halt. In her statement announcing the resignation, Erkan said “our economic programme has started to bear fruit”, citing rising foreign reserves and expectations that inflation will begin cooling around midyear “as proof of this success”. “Despite all these positive developments, as is known to the public, a major reputation assassination campaign has recently been organised against me,” she added on X. “In order to prevent my family and my innocent child, who is not even one and a half years old, from being further affected by this, I have asked our President to pardon me from my duty.”    Last month, the opposition newspaper Sozcu published an article about a central bank employee who said she was wrongfully dismissed from the bank by Erkan’s father. In response at the time, Erkan said an “unfounded” news story targeting her, her family and the bank was “unacceptable” and said she would exercise her legal rights against those responsible. Erdogan later decried efforts to spread “rumours” meant to undermine economic progress, in an apparent endorsement of Erkan, the bank’s fifth governor in as many years. Finance Minister Mehmet Simseksaid Erkan’s resignation was her personal decision and the economic programme would continue uninterrupted. Karahan has a doctorate in economics from the University of Pennsylvania and was also a former Federal Reserve Bank of New York economist. Simsek said Erdogan continues to back the economic team and programme, a sentiment echoed in a separate statement by Turkish Vice President Cevdet Yilmaz. Inflation neared 65 percent last month and is expected to begin dipping around June, spelling some relief for Turks after years in which rent and other basic needs became unaffordable for many. Foreign investors, including world heavyweights Pimco and Vanguard, began buying Turkish assets late last year in a strong signal of confidence in Erkan and Simsek’s programme.

US launches strikes in response to attack that killed troops in Jordan,US military struck more than 85 Iran-linked targets in Iraq and Syria after three US soldiers were killed on Sunday.,"The United States military has launched dozens of air strikes against targets in Syria and Iraq in the first retaliation for a drone attack that killed three soldiers at a remote US base in Jordan. “At my direction, US military forces struck targets at facilities in Iraq and Syria that the IRGC and affiliated militia use to attack US forces,” US President Joe Biden said in a statement on Friday, referring to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). “Our response began today. It will continue at times and places of our choosing,” he added. US Central Command (CENTCOM) said its military forces struck more than 85 targets in the two countries “with numerous aircraft to include long-range bombers flown from the United States”. “The air strikes employed more than 125 precision munitions,” it added in a statement. CENTCOM said the facilities that were struck included command and control operations centres, intelligence centres, weapons storage sites and other facilities connected to the militias or the IRGC’s Quds Force, the Guard’s expeditionary unit that handles Tehran’s relationship and arming of regional groups. CENTCOM Statement on U.S. Strikes in Iraq and Syria At 4:00 p.m. (EST) Feb. 02, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) forces conducted airstrikes in Iraq and Syria against Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Quds Force and affiliated militia groups. U.S. military forces…pic.twitter.com/HeLMFDx9zY — U.S. Central Command (@CENTCOM)February 2, 2024  Three US soldiers werekilledand about 40 others injured in a drone attack on the military base known asTower 22near the Jordan-Syria border on Sunday. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a coalition of Iran-linked groups, claimed responsibility for thedrone attack. Iran has denied directing the attack, saying the groups act on their own. “The US had said since the moment that attack happened that there would be a military response, and US officials like Joe Biden and Lloyd Austin said the response would come in multiple fashions. So this could very well be the first phase, but those retaliatory US air strikes have now begun,” said Al Jazeera’s Rosiland Jordan, reporting from the Pentagon. “This is the first step, I don’t think that it will be the last one,” she added. On Friday, Syrian state media said that an “American aggression” on a number of sites in Syria’s desert areas and the Syrian and Iraqi border resulted in a number of casualties and injuries. Iraqi security sources told Al Jazeera that six air strikes targeted a number of locations in the country. “These airstrikes constitute a violation of Iraqi sovereignty … and pose a threat that could lead Iraq and the region into dire consequences,” Iraqi military spokesman Yahya Rasool said in a statement after the strikes. While the US strikes did not target any locations inside Iran, they are likely to increase concern about tensions in the Middle East spiralling from Israel’s more than three-month-old war on Gaza. The strikes come hours after PresidentBidenmet with the families of the three troops who were killed on Sunday – identified as William Jerome Rivers, Kennedy Sanders and Breonna Moffett – as the service members’ remains arrived in the US. Biden and his wife Jill visited the Dover air base in the US state of Delaware on Friday to honour the soldiers during the “dignified transfer” of their bodies. US Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, CQ Brown, also attended – their presence highlighting the importance, as well as relative rarity, of returning dead service members in the wake of US exits from major foreign conflicts. On Friday, Biden’s statement said the US “does not seek conflict in the Middle East or anywhere else in the world”. But the US president added: “Let all those who might seek to do us harm know this: If you harm an American, we will respond.” Earlier this week, when Biden was asked whether he holds Iran responsible for the drone attack, he said, “I do hold them responsible, in the sense that they’re supplying the weapons to the people who did it.” US Republicans have been calling for a powerful response, including directly against Iran. The Biden administration has suggested that the US response to the drone attack would be prolonged, not a single strike. White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said on Thursday that it “will be a multi-tiered approach” over a period of time. “The first thing you see will not be the last thing you see,” he told reporters.

"UN estimates 17,000 Gaza children left unaccompanied amid Israel’s war","More than one million children in the besieged Gaza Strip now require mental health support, UNICEF says.","At least 17,000 children in the Gaza Strip have been left unaccompanied or separated from their families nearly four months into Israel’s assault on the enclave, the United Nations children’s agency estimates. Nearly all children in the strip also require mental health support, UNICEF said on Friday. “Each [child] has a heartbreaking story of loss and grief,” said Jonathan Crickx, UNICEF’s chief of communication for the occupied Palestinian territories. “This [17,000] figure corresponds to 1 percent of the overall displaced population – 1.7 million people,” he told a media briefing via video-link from Jerusalem, saying the number was an estimation as it is near impossible to verify information under current conditions. Each one “is a child who is coming to terms with a horrible new reality”, he added.    Crickx said that tracing who the unaccompanied children were was proving “extremely difficult”, as they were sometimes brought to a hospital wounded or in shock, and “they simply can’t even say their names”. He said that during conflicts, it was common for extended families to take care of children who lost their parents. However, in Gaza, “due to the sheer lack of food, water or shelter, extended families are themselves distressed and face challenges to immediately take care of another child as they themselves are struggling to cater for their own children and family”, said Crickx. Broadly, UNICEF terms separated children as those who are without their parents, while unaccompanied children are those who are separated and also without other relatives. Crickx also said the mental health of children in Gaza was being severely affected by the offensive, and that a million children in the Gaza Strip require mental health support. Children in Gaza “present symptoms like extremely high levels of persistent anxiety, loss of appetite, they can’t sleep, they have emotional outbursts or panic every time they hear the bombings,” he explained. Before the assault erupted, UNICEF estimated that more than 500,000 children in Gaza needed mental health and psycho-social support. Now, it believes that “almost all children are in need” of such help. “That’s more than one million children,” Crickx said. According to the Palestinian health ministry, Israeli attacks have killed more than 27,100 people in Gaza since the war began on October 7, around 11,500 of them children. More than 66,200 others have been wounded amid a severe lack of medical supplies and functioning healthcare facilities. Thousands more are missing and are under the rubble.

Many are now crammed in the southern Rafah governorate, which Israel has said is itsnext targetof attack. Many who fled their homes have been shot at and arrested. Those who make it to the south often have no contact with their relatives or caregivers in other parts of the enclave, especially during times of communication blackouts. “Children don’t have anything to do with this conflict. Yet they are suffering like no child should ever suffer,” said Crickx. “No child should ever be exposed to the level of violence seen on October 7 – or to the level of violence that we have witnessed since then.” He called for a ceasefire so that UNICEF could conduct a proper count of children who are unaccompanied or separated, trace relatives, and deliver mental health support.

"People ‘dying of starvation’ in Sudan, UN food agency says",The World Food Programme has called on Sudan’s warring sides to provide immediate security guarantees to deliver aid.,"The United Nations food agency says it is receiving reports of people dying of starvation in Sudan and the number of hungry people has doubled over the past year as the ongoing war cuts civilians off from aid. “The situation in Sudan today is nothing short of catastrophic,” said Eddie Rowe, the World Food Programme’s (WFP’s) Sudan representative and country director. “Millions of people are impacted by the conflict. WFP has food in Sudan, but lack of humanitarian access and other unnecessary hurdles are slowing operations,” he said in a statement on Friday. “Life-saving assistance is not reaching those who need it the most, and we are already receiving reports of people dying of starvation,” he added. Since Sudan’s war began in April, nearly 18 million people across the country are facing acute hunger, and more than five million are experiencing emergency levels of hunger in areas worst affected by the conflict. The WFP has called on Sudan’s warring factions – the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) – to provide immediate guarantees for the unimpeded delivery of relief. “People are really struggling to afford a basic meal a day. … Those experiencing the highest levels of hunger are resorting to extreme coping mechanisms to put food on their plates, including selling everything that they own,” Leni Kinzli, head of communications at the WFP Sudan, told Al Jazeera from the Kenyan capital, Nairobi. “The biggest challenge actually is that we are not able to deliver assistance across conflict lines. … We are not getting security guarantees and the approvals to move commodities freely,” she added. The WFP has been able to deliver aid to just one in 10 people in the conflict areas, which include Khartoum, the western region of Darfur and El Gezira state, where the RSF recently advanced. The agency added in a statement that it was trying to obtain security guarantees to restart operations in El Gezira, previously an aid hub that many had fled to from Khartoum. Recently, aid deliveries in Sudan had been limited because 70 trucks were stuck in Port Sudan for more than two weeks and another 31 had been stuck in El Obeid for more than three months, the WFP said. Both cities are controlled by the army. “For every single truck that we want to move from the port of Sudan elsewhere, we need to get stamps and signatures from different authorities, and this takes time for those clearances to be granted,” Kinzli said, calling on the international community to support the people of Sudan and galvanise political parties to ensure aid into the country is facilitated. “Every single one of our trucks need to be on the road each and every day delivering food to the Sudanese people,” Rowe stressed. The WFP said the number of hungry people in Sudan has more than doubled from a year ago. Nine months into a bloody war, nearlyeight million peoplehave also been forced from their homes, the UN said. Efforts to negotiate an end to the fighting in Sudan have not yet yielded a breakthrough.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/2/people-dying-of-starvation-in-sudan-un-food-agency-says
"Israel plans ground attack on Rafah, ‘last refuge’ for Gaza’s displaced","Israel’s defence minister says army will next target Rafah, the southern area it designated as a ‘safe zone’ for Palestinian civilians.","The Israeli military plans to expand its ground assault into Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, where most Palestinians in the besieged enclave have been forced to seek shelter amid heavy bombardment of the rest of the enclave. This has spread fear among the displaced and concerns from global aid organisations as the last place designated as a “safe zone” by the Israeli army in Gaza comes under threat while Israelcontinues to hamper the flow of aid. “The Khan Younis Brigade of the Hamas organisation is disbanded, we will complete the mission there and continue to Rafah,” Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said in aposton the social media platform X late on Thursday. “We will continue until the end, there is no other way.” About 1.9 million of Gaza’s 2.3 million people arecrammed into Rafahnear the border with Egypt, staying in residential buildings or sleeping in the streets without protection or basic infrastructure. Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Rafah on Friday, said the displaced population there lacks basics, including toilets and sufficient clean water. They are also “unprepared for winter” with no blankets or suitable clothing, all of which puts them at risk of getting sick, he said. Mahmoud said Gallant’s statement “shows a total lack of caring” for people in Rafah, who are already facing desperate conditions. “For many, it’s increased the level of panic. They don’t have anywhere else to go to. This is the last refuge for Palestinians in Gaza. Beyond, it is only the Egyptian border,” he said. Emad, 55, a businessman and father of six in Rafah, told the Reuters news agency that if Israeli tanks keep coming, “we will be left with two choices: stay and die or climb the walls into Egypt.” “Most of Gaza’s population is in Rafah. If the tanks storm in, it will be a massacre like never before during this war,” he said. According to the Ministry of Health in Gaza, the Israeli army has killed more than 27,000 people, mostly women and children, since the war began on October 7, and Palestinians believe Israel’s latest war plan will mean more death and destruction. “Gallant says the ‘victory won’t be complete unless the military expands into Rafah’ – a city declared a ‘safe zone’. For Palestinians, this means another genocide,” Mahmoud said.    The United Nations and international human rights organisations have been raising alarms as the Israeli military gradually expands its ground operations in southern Gaza. In the past few weeks, Israeli soldiers and tanks have been “encircling” Khan Younis, killing thousands of Palestinians and forcing hundreds of thousands to flee farther south towards Rafah. Nasser Hospital and al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis havebeen under heavy siegeby Israeli snipers, tanks and bombs as patients, medical staff and displaced Palestinians are trapped inside. The UN’s humanitarian office has voiced concern about the hostilities in Khan Younis. “I want to emphasise our deep concern about the escalation of hostilities in Khan Younis, which has resulted in an increase in the number of internally displaced people seeking refuge in Rafah in recent days,” said Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). “Thousands of Palestinians have continued to flee to the south, which is already hosting over half the population of some 2.3 million people. … Rafah is a pressure cooker of despair, and we fear for what comes next.” Israel’sattacks on Khan Younisand its planned expansion into Rafah come after the International Court of Justice (ICJ) made a provisional ruling last week on measures requested by South Africa in its genocide case against Israel. The ICJ directed Israel to take measures to prevent genocidal acts in Gaza and to allow more humanitarian aid into the strip. Talks to stop the war – at least temporarily – are being conducted between Israel and Hamas with mediation from the United States, Qatar and Egypt. But it appears unlikely that a potentially imminent agreement could stop Israel’s ground incursion into Rafah.

"One week after ICJ ruling, is Israel following the court’s orders?","After the International Court of Justice orders Israel to prevent acts of genocide, its attacks kill hundreds more people in Gaza.","It has been one week since the International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued anemergency rulingin thegenocide casefiled by South Africa against Israel in December. In itsinterim ruling, the court in The Hague ordered Israel to abide by six provisional measures. Among these, the court ordered Israel to take all possible measures to prevent genocidal acts, to prevent and punish direct and public incitement to genocide, and to take immediate and effective steps to ensure the provision of basic services and humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza. The court also ordered Israel to preserve evidence of genocide and to submit a report to the ICJ within a month laying out how it is complying with these orders. But on Wednesday, South Africa’s foreign minister, Naledi Pandor, said Israel has so far ignored the ruling by killing hundreds more civilians in just a few days in Gaza. So what has Israel done to comply with the orders from the ICJ so far? In the week since the ICJ’s ruling, Israeli forces have continued their military offensive in Gaza, and nearly 1,000 more Palestinians have been killed. The number of Palestinian casualties from January 26, the date of the ruling, to Thursday was 936, according to reports from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), which receives figures from Gaza’s Ministry of Health. “Hundreds of people have been killed in the last three or four days, and clearly Israel believes it has license to do as it wishes,” Pandor said on Wednesday. Despite the ruling, hospitals have also continued to be targeted in Israeli attacks, putting yet more strain on Gaza’s collapsing healthcare system. The Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza came under fire this week, and witnesses reported that tanks pounded areas of Khan Younis, particularly around Nasser Hospital, the largest hospital still functioning in southern Gaza. Besides Nasser Hospital, Israel has continued its 11-day siege on al-Amal Hospital inKhan Younis,according to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS), which runs it. The PRCS said Israeli forces stormed al-Amal for the third time on Thursday. Israeli forces have denied the claims made by the PRCS. “There’s no storming of the hospital, entry into it or any ordering of people to leave at gunpoint,” an Israeli military spokesperson said on Tuesday. On Thursday, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant made clear that Israel does not intend to cease its military operation in Gaza anytime soon. Gallant was one of three Israeli officials criticised personally by the ICJ for comments they have made that could be deemed to incite genocide against Palestinians, In a briefing on Thursday, Gallant said Israel’s military operation in Khan Younis, which it launched last week, had been successful, clearing the way for its forces to now advance on Rafah on the enclave’s southern border with Egypt. “We are achieving our missions in Khan Younis, and we will also reach Rafah and eliminate terror elements that threaten us,” Gallant said. Rafah is full of internally displaced Palestinians, who are running out ofplacesto go to within the Gaza Strip. “Thousands of Palestinians have continued to flee to the south, which is already hosting over half the population of some 2.3 million people,” Jens Laerke, a spokesperson for OCHA, said on Friday. “Rafah is a pressure cooker of despair, and we fear for what comes next.” It is unclear where Israel intends for the people of Gaza to move to, if Rafah becomes the new epicentre of its attacks. Meanwhile, the Israeli military this week also confirmed that it was pumping seawater into Hamas’s network of tunnels. But experts hear this could destroy Gaza’s underground water and soil, leaving the strip’s already desperate population with even less access to drinking water and agriculture opportunities. The Genocide Convention covers intentional actions calculated to bring about the physical destruction, in whole or part, of a distinct ethnic group like the Palestinians.     There has been no public announcement yet about actions Israel plans to take against Israeli ministers and officials who have made statements inciting genocide. The genocidal rhetoric has constituted an integral part ofSouth Africa’s caseagainst Israel before the World Court. Citing scriptures, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said himself in a televised address in late October: “You must remember what Amalek has done to you.” Amalekites were persecutors of the biblical Israelites, and in scriptures, God commands them to be destroyed. Two days after the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, Gallant said Israel was “fighting human animals” when he announced a complete siege on Gaza. Deputy Knesset Speaker Nissim Vaturi from Netanyahu’s Likud party wrote on X that Israelis had one common goal, “erasing the Gaza Strip from the face of the Earth”. Israeli Heritage Minister Amichay Eliyahu from the far-right Jewish Power party suggested that Israel drop a nuclear bomb on Gaza and said there were “no uninvolved civilians” in the territory. Rights groups and activists said such language has been left unchecked, dehumanising Palestinians and inciting violence. The statements remain unaddressed. In fact, many government ministers, including National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, both from far-right parties in the ruling coalition, attended asettler conferencein Jerusalem last Sunday calling for Israel to rebuild settlements in Gaza and establish more in the occupied West Bank. Such a stance has been criticised as calling for the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians.    Since the beginning of December, aid and fuel trucks have beenstrandedoutside the strip, blocked from entering by Israel’s siege and bombardment of the enclave. Because the bombardment has not stopped, the flow of aid continues to be hindered, humanitarian groups said. The same day that the ICJ ordered Israel to take provisional measures to ensure that basic services and humanitarian aid can reach civilians, Israel alleged that 12 employees of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) had been directly involved in the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7. Following this, the United States, United Kingdom, Germany and other major donorssuspended their fundingto UNRWA, which is the main humanitarian agency in Gaza providing food, shelter and medical supplies. UNRWA and other UN agencies havewarnedthat this could lead to UNRWA being unable to provide humanitarian services to Gaza from this month, which would plunge the enclave into starvation. No other humanitarian agency can replace UNRWA or match its services in Gaza.    The court’s ruling is legally binding on Israel. If it is found not to have complied with the ICJ’s orders, any member state on the UN Security Council may refer the matter to the UN’s highest decision-making body, which would then vote on whether to require Israel to abide by the provisional measures. If it still refuses to do so, Israel could faceUN sanctions, which could include economic or trade sanctions, arms embargoes and travel bans. The UN Charter also allows the Security Council to go a step further and intervene with force. However, any sanctions may be vetoed by the US, Israel’s close ally. It hasrepeatedly vetoedresolutions on Israel. Neve Gordon, an international law professor at Queen Mary University of London,told Al Jazeerathat a resolution drafted by a Security Council member state might hold different weight compared with a decision made by the highest court in the world. If the US vetoes a Security Council resolution based on the ICJ decision “it will expose the duplicity of the US like no other veto before,” Gordon said. Israel continues to assert that it is targeting Hamas and acting in self-defence after the October 7 attacks. The Gaza Health Ministry’s casualty count does not differentiate between combatants and civilians, but it has stated that the majority of the dead are women andchildren.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/2/one-week-after-icj-ruling-is-israel-following-the-courts-orders
US to hit back against Iran-linked targets: Who and where will it strike?,The US says it will strike Iranian-linked targets in Iraq and Syria after killing of three US soldiers at US base.,"The United States has approvedplans for strikesin Iraq and Syria against multiple targets, including Iranian personnel and facilities, CBS News reported on Thursday, quoting US officials. President Joe Biden said on Tuesday that he had decided how to respond to adrone attack in northeastern Jordannear the Syrian border last Sunday, which killed three US service members and wounded more than 40. Sunday’s attack was the first to result in the loss of American lives during the Israel-Hamas war. Here is what’s known about the US plans: The US plans to retaliate against the drone attack on the USTower 22 basenear the border between Syria and Jordan by targeting Iranian personnel and facilities inside both countries. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, believed to comprise multiple groups armed, funded and trained by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps, has claimed responsibility for Sunday’s strike on the base. But on Wednesday, Kataib Hezbollah, the most powerful element in the force,announcedthe suspension of hostile operations against US troops. Iran itself has denied any role in the attack. Nevertheless, according to US officials quoted in the CBS report, the US plans to press ahead with strikes of its own over several days. The timing of their launch is likely to be influenced by weather conditions. US officials were quoted saying that “the US has the capability to carry out strikes in bad weather but prefers to have better visibility of selected targets as a safeguard against inadvertently hitting civilians who might stray into the area at the last moment”. Hawkish Republican officials in the US have called fordirect strikes on Iran,but this latest plan appears to avoid any direct attack inside the country. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters on Thursday that the US will not tolerate attacks on American troops. This was Austin’s first news conference after undergoing prostate cancer surgery. During the news conference, he apologised for not disclosing his hospitalisation. Health-related questions dominated the session, during which he said he had also apologised to President Biden for not informing him about his diagnosis. But Austin also focused on the conflict in the Middle East. Starting with the drone attack, he said the group behind the attack will be held responsible. “I don’t think the adversaries are of a one-and-done mindset, and so they have a lot of capability, I have a lot more,” he said. “We’re going to do what’s necessary to protect our troops.” “This is a dangerous moment in the Middle East,” Austin added. “We will continue to work to avoid a wider conflict in the region, but we will take all necessary actions to defend the United States, our interests and our people, and we will respond when we choose, where we choose and how we choose.” Although Iran has denied involvement, Austin said that “how much Iran knew or didn’t know, we don’t know. But it really doesn’t matter because Iran sponsors these groups”. Since the onset of the Israel-Gaza war, the Pentagon has been ramping up its military presence in the region. In mid-December, the US reportedly had 19 US warships in the region. Austin gave orders for the Ford  – the Navy’s newest aircraft carrier – and its strike group to sail to the eastern Mediterranean on October 8, a day after the attack by Hamas that set off the war. The Ford was sent back to the US on January 17, as the US “re-evaluate[d] its global force requirements,” the US Navy’s sixth fleet announced in a statement. With the Ford’s departure, the USS Eisenhower is the US aircraft carrier in the region. Austin also addressed the actions of the Houthis, who say they are targeting Israel-linked ships in the Red Sea in protest over Israel’soffensive in Gaza. The Houthi attacks on shippinghave disruptedinternational commerce along a route that accounts for about 15 percent of the world’s shipping traffic and 12 percent of global trade.  Austin said: “[They] continue to do some things that are very irresponsible and illegal and so our goal is to make sure that we continue to take away capability from the Houthis to do what they’ve been doing.” When asked by Al Jazeera if he had done enough to pressure Israel to avoid killing civilians in Gaza, where the death toll has surpassed27,000since October, Austin said: “We talked to them [Israel] about that weeks ago, and they said they were going to do that, and they are doing that, but I will continue to emphasise – and I know Secretary Blinken and President Biden will continue to emphasise – the importance of addressing the issue of the Palestinian people. “It’s critical and you know, we’re doing more, but we’re not doing enough,” he added. Since the war between Israel and Hamas broke out on October 7, Iranian-backed groups have struck US bases in Iraq and Syria at least 166 times with rockets, missiles and one-way attack drones, drawing about half a dozen US counterstrikes on group facilities in both countries. The Houthis first launched missiles and drones at southern Israel – also in protest over the war on Gaza – in October and, as Tel Aviv continued to resist international calls for a ceasefire, they significantlyramped up their strikes. The US military also has also carried out air strikes targeting Houthi rebels in Yemen. However, while Tehran has said it supports the Houthis politically, it denies sending the group weapons. “The [Houthi] resistance has its own tools… and acts in accordance with its own decisions and capabilities,” Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Ali Bagherisaid in December. For the past few days, the US has hinted that strikes against Iranian targets are imminent. The threat of retaliation for Sunday’s drone strike on the US base in Jordan has prompted some groups to announce they are stopping hostilities. But, as late as Thursday according to US Central Command, Yemen’s Houthi rebels were still attacking vessels and had fired a ballistic missile at a Liberian-flagged container ship in the Red Sea. The Houthis did not claim responsibility for that assault, however. Both Iran and the US have previously said they wish to avoid escalating the military fallout of Israel’s war on Gaza. While Iran seems reluctant to be drawn into the conflict over Gaza, Hossein Salami, the commander-in-chief of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), has warned that Tehran will respond to any US strikes. But, quoting unnamed sources, Reuters also reported on Thursday that the IRGC have scaled back the deployment of senior officers in Syria following Israeli air strikes in an attempt to avoid being dragged directly into the conflict.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/2/us-to-hit-back-against-iran-whom-will-it-strike
Turkey arrests seven suspected of selling information to Israel’s Mossad,Turkey has warned Israel of ‘serious consequences’ if it tries to hunt down Hamas members inside its borders.,"Police in Turkey have arrested seven people on suspicion of selling information to Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency related to tracking and monitoring local targets. The suspects were taken into custody in a joint operation of police and Turkey’s National Intelligence Organisation (MIT) following raids in Istanbul and the Aegean province of Izmir, state news agency Anadolu reported on Friday. They are believed to have attempted to monitor and photograph the targets, place tracking devices on them and gain other information for Mossad, state broadcaster TRT reported quoting unnamed security sources. Ankara has previously warned Israel of “serious consequences” if it tries to hunt down members of the Palestinian group Hamas living outside Palestinian territories, including in Turkey. The head of Israel’s domestic Shin Bet security agency said in December that his organisation was prepared to target Hamas anywhere, including in Lebanon, Turkey and Qatar. MIT had determined that Mossad was using private detectives to follow its targets, according to TRT. Mossad is alleged to have recruited Palestinian and Syrian nationals in Turkey as part of an operation against foreigners living in the country. Turkey, unlike its Western allies, does not classify Hamas as a “terrorist” organisation. Turkish PresidentRecep Tayyip Erdoganhas condemned Israel for itswar in Gazaand has repeatedly criticised Western countries for supporting Tel Aviv’s campaign. Last month,34 peoplewere detained by Turkish police on suspicion of spying for Israel. They were accused of planning to carry out activities, including surveillance and “pursuing, assaulting and kidnapping” foreign nationals living in Turkey. At the time, Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said most of the suspects were charged with committing “political or military espionage” on behalf of Israeli intelligence. Following the January 2 arrests, Anadolu cited a prosecution document as saying the operation targeted “Palestinian nationals and their families … within the scope of the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/2/turkey-arrests-seven-suspected-of-selling-information-to-israels-mossad

"US approves plan for strikes on Iran-linked targets in Iraq, Syria: Report",The US has said its military response could be multitiered and take place over several days.,"The United States has reportedlyapproved a planto attack Iran-linked targets in Iraq and Syria in retaliation for the killing of three soldiers five days ago. US broadcaster CBS News reported on Thursday that the White House has approved the targeting of Iranian personnel and facilities inside the two countries in response to thedrone attack on Sundayat theTower 22 basenear the border between Syria and Jordan. It did not provide any further details but said, quoting unnamed US officials, that weather will be a major factor in the timing of the strikes as Washington purportedly wants better visibility to avoid targeting civilians. On Friday, Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi said his country will “respond strongly” to anyone who bullies it. “We will not start any war but if anyone wants to bully us they will receive a strong response,” Raisi said. “Before, when they [the Americans] wanted to talk to us, they said the military option is ‘on the table’. Now they say they have no intention of a conflict with Iran.” Tehran’s military power has not and will not pose a threat to any country in the region, the president said in a televised speech, adding that Iran’s strength only creates security for the countries around it. Iran has denied involvement in the drone strike in Jordan. The attack on the US base was claimed by the umbrella group of US and Israel-opposed armed factions called the Islamic Resistance in Iraq. It marked the first time an American soldier was killed since the start ofIsrael’s war on Gaza. Iran-aligned groups have launched hundreds of attacks on US bases in Iraq and Syria in recent years, but their attacks have only intensified since the start of the war on Gaza and the unwavering US support for it despite international calls for a ceasefire. The Iraqi group is a member of the “axis of resistance” that is backed by Tehran across the region, but Iran maintains that members of the axisdecide and act independentlyand do not take orders from it.  US President Joe Biden has promised a response, which has yet to come five days after the attack. US officials have said their strikes could take place over several days, have multiple targets, and be “sustained over time”. Both Iran and the US have said they wish to avoid escalating the military fallout of Israel’s war, which has spread to include Israel’s border fighting with Lebanon’s Hezbollah andYemen’s Houthi attackson Red Sea shipping and US and United Kingdom vessels. But Hossein Salami, the commander-in-chief of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), has warned that Tehran would respond to any US strikes. Reports have also suggested that Tehran and Washington have exchanged messages since the Syria-Jordan border strike, with Iran seriously warning against any attacks on its soil. Hawkish Republican officials in the US have called fordirect strikes on Iran, something that is likely to spread the scope of the war. In January 2020, after the US assassinated Iran’s top general Qassem Soleimani in Iraq, Iran launched missiles at a US base in Iraq which injured dozens of soldiers but did not kill anyone. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq said Wednesday it would “suspend” military operations against US forces to prevent further embarrassment for the Iraqi government. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Washington would watch for actions rather than words. The pro-Iran al-Nujaba movement said on Friday it would press on with attacks on US forces in the Middle East until its demands are met for US troops to leave Iraq and for an end to Israel’s war on Gaza. A US air strike in early January had killed a senior commander of al-Nujaba. Biden is expected at the Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on Friday to oversee the transfer of the remains of the three soldiers.

US imposes sanctions on four Israeli settlers over West Bank violence,White House says settler violence in occupied West Bank threatens US ‘national security and foreign policy interests’.,"Washington, DC –The United States has imposed sanctions on several Israeli settlers for attacking Palestinian communities in the occupied West Bank, accusing them of undermining stability and security in Israel and the Palestinian territories. The announcement on Thursday comes amid increasing pressure on President Joe Biden over hisunwavering supportfor Israel’s war on Gaza as he campaigns for re-election in November. The sanctions target David Chai Chasdai, Einan Tanjil and Yinon Levi, who are accused of assaulting and intimidating Palestinians. They also target Shalom Zickerman, who is accused of assaulting Israeli activists. The sanctions will freeze the individuals’ assets in the US and restrict financial dealings with them. Earlier, Axios reported that the Biden administration hadconsidered sanctioning ultranationalist government ministersItamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, but decided against the move. “There are no plans to target with sanctions Israeli government officials at this time,” White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Thursday, adding that the US informed the Israeli government before announcing the sanctions. The White House also announced a new decree to penalise perpetrators of “extremist settler violence” in the West Bank. US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said in a statement that settler violence “poses a grave threat to peace, security, and stability in the West Bank, Israel, and the Middle East region, and threatens the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States”. The executive order coincides with Biden’s visit on Thursday to Michigan, a Midwestern swing state that is home to a largeArab American community.    Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared to reject the US move, saying that the overwhelming majority of West Bank settlers are “law-abiding citizens”. “Israel acts against all Israelis who break the law, everywhere; therefore, exceptional measures are unnecessary,” his office said in a statement. Reporting from Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, Al Jazeera’s Charles Stratford cited Palestinians as saying that Israeli authorities do not hold settlers accountable for attacks. “In many, many incidents, we see settlers acting with either the tacit support or the actual physical support of the Israeli military in these attacks,” Stratford said. The announcement comes as the Biden administration continues to workto secure $14bnin additional aid to the Israeli government, whose forces often accompany and protect settlers during their attacks on Palestinians. Israeli authorities rarely prosecute suspects in violence against Palestinians. Last month, Israeli settlers and an off-duty police officer fatally shot 17-year-old Palestinian AmericanTawfiq Ajaqin the West Bank, according to his family. The Biden administration has called for an investigation into the case, but Israeli authorities have not made any arrests in the killing of the US teenager. Raids by Israeli settlers and soldiers against West Bank towns and villages have increased since the outbreak of the war on Gaza on October 7, killing hundreds of Palestinians.    “This [executive order] will allow the United States to issue financial sanctions against those directing or participating in certain actions, including acts or threats of violence against civilians, intimidating civilians to cause them to leave their homes, destroying or seizing property, or engaging in terrorist activity in the West Bank,” Sullivan said. In the same statement, the US national security adviser emphasised Washington’s support for what he called “Israel’s right to defend itself”. Despite growing calls for a ceasefire globally, andmounting evidenceof Israeli abuses, the Biden administration has pushed on with its support for the war on Gaza, arguing that Hamas must be eliminated. Washington says it has been in discussions with Israel to minimise civilian casualties and allow more aid into Gaza. But Biden has so far resisted calls to use his administration’s assistance to Israel as leverage to pressure the US ally to end rights violations against Palestinians. Israeli leaders – includingNetanyahu– have been openly defying the Biden administration in their vocal rejection of the establishment of a Palestinian state. “Good that Biden will impose targeted sanctions on Israeli settlers who attack Palestinians,” human rights advocate Kenneth Roth wrote in a social media post. “Now how about conditioning [or stopping] military aid and arms sales to Israel until it stops bombing and besieging Palestinian civilians in Gaza.”    The Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), an advocacy group, also played down the significance of the sanctions, saying that Biden should penalise Israeli officials responsible for settler violence and end US support for the war on Gaza. “It makes no sense for the Biden administration to oppose killing Palestinian civilians in the West Bank while enabling the killing of Palestinian civilians in Gaza,” CAIR said in a statement. For his part, Abed Ayoub, executive director at the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), called the sanctions “empty”, saying that they are far from groundbreaking. Ayoub said the White House sees the sanctions as a “safe way” to appeal to some voters who are angry over Biden’s backing for the war on Gaza. “That’s the intent of all of this. That’s why it was released today during Biden’s trip to Michigan,” Ayoub told Al Jazeera. He added that targeting a few individual settlers risks normalising the broader settlement movement and called for stricter measures to ensure accountability. “We know that many of these settlers are American. Open those settlers up the civil and criminal liability in the US,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/1/us-imposes-sanctions-on-four-israeli-settlers-over-west-bank
Tunisian opposition leader Rached Ghannouchi sentenced to three years,Ghannouchi’s Ennahda Party is accused of receiving foreign funds as President Kais Saied continues crackdown on opposition.,"A Tunisian court has sentenced opposition leaderRached Ghannouchito three years in prison over accusations that his Ennahda Party received foreign contributions, official news agency Tunis Afrique Press (TAP) reported, amid an escalating crackdown on dissent in the North African country. The trial court, which specialises in financial corruption, also fined Ennahda $1.1m for receiving foreign funds, TAP said on Thursday. Ghannouchi’s son-in-law Rafik Abdessalem, a former foreign minister, was sentenced to three years in jail as well. Ennahda rejected the accusations against the party, Ghannouchi and Abdessalem, describing the sentence as part of the “steam of injustices” that the group and other “democratic forces” in Tunisia are facing. “Ennahda has never received foreign funding, and its only bank account is under the inspection of all the judicial and financial institutions,” the group said in a statement, vowing to continue to work to defend democracy. A former speaker of the Tunisian parliament, Ghannouchi, 82, was arrested last year and sentencedto one yearin jail on separate charges of incitement. Rights groups previously denounced Ghannouchi’s detention, accusing the government of PresidentKais Saiedof repressing political opposition. Last year’s sentence was handed to Ghannouchi in absentia because he refused to appear before the court, arguing that the charges against him were political. “Tunisian authorities are increasingly using repressive, vaguely-worded laws as a pretext for repression and to arrest, investigate and in some cases prosecute dissidents and opposition figures,” Amnesty International said in 2023. “The sentencing of Rashed Ghannouchi shows a growing crackdown on human rights and opposition and a deeply worrying pattern.” Over the past years, Tunisian authorities have arrested several prominent opposition figures as Saied pushed to consolidate power. Elected in 2019, Saied – a former law professor – froze the Tunisian parliament in 2021 andsubsequently dissolvedthe legislature to rule by decree. Tunisia heldlegislative electionsin late 2022 that were mired by low turnout amid an opposition boycott. Earlier that year, Saied successfully pushed aconstitutional referendumthat expanded the powers of the presidency. Critics have decried Saied’s power grabas a “coup”that risked bringing the country back to the authoritarianism of the pre-2011 uprising that toppled longtime Tunisian leader Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. “Since his power grab, Saied largely undermined the independence of the judiciary in an effort to subjugate judges and prosecutors to the executive branch,” Human Rights Watch says in a fact sheet about Tunisia. “The authorities have escalated their crackdown on political opponents and perceived critics for their peaceful activism or public criticism of the president, the security forces, or other officials. They have stepped up arbitrary arrests, travel bans, and prosecutions, sometimes in military courts.” But Saied has said that his policies aim to fight corruption and incompetence in the government. Ennahda had emerged as one of Tunisia’s largest parties after the 2011 uprising, and Ghannouchi led a power-sharing agreement with late President Beji Caid Essebsi to transition the country to democracy. Last year, the Tunisian government closed downEnnahda’s headquartersin Tunis.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/1/tunisian-opposition-leader-rached-ghannouchi-sentenced-to-three-years
"New cancer cases to soar 77 percent by 2050, WHO predicts","There were an estimated 20 million new cancer cases in 2022, with more than 35 million new cases predicted by 2050.","The number of new cancer cases globally will reach 35 million in 2050, 77 percent higher than the figure in 2022, according to predictions from the World Health Organization’s cancer agency. Asurveyconducted by the WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) cited tobacco, alcohol, obesity and air pollution as key factors in the predicted rise. “Over 35 million new cancer cases are predicted in 2050,” the IARC said in a statement, a 77 percent increase from the some 20 million cases diagnosed in 2022. “Certainly the new estimates highlight the scale of cancer today and indeed the growing burden of cancer that is predicted over the next years and decades,” Freddie Bray, head of cancer surveillance at the IARC, told Al Jazeera on Thursday. There were an estimated 9.7 million cancer deaths in 2022, the IARC said in the statement alongside its biannual report based on data from 185 countries and 36 cancers. Around one in five people develop cancer in their lifetimes, with one in nine men and one in 12 women dying from the disease, it added. “The rapidly-growing global cancer burden reflects both population ageing and growth, as well as changes to people’s exposure to risk factors, several of which are associated with socioeconomic development. Tobacco, alcohol and obesity are key factors behind the increasing incidence of cancer, with air pollution still a key driver of environmental risk factors,” the IARC said. The IARC also highlighted that the threat of cancer varies depending on where a patient lives. The most-developed countries are expected to record the greatest increases in case numbers, with an additional 4.8 million new cases predicted in 2050 compared with 2022 estimates, the agency said. But in terms of percentages, countries on the low end of the Human Development Index (HDI) – used by the United Nations as a marker of societal and economic development – will see the greatest proportional increase, up 142 percent. Meanwhile, countries in the medium range are predicted to record a 99-percent increase, it said. “One of the biggest challenges we are seeing is the proportional increases in the cancer burden are going to be most striking in the lower income, lower human development countries,” Bray told Al Jazeera. “They are going to see a projected increase of well over doubling of the burden by 2050. “And these are very much the countries that currently are ill-equipped to really deal with the cancer problem. And it’s only going to get bigger and there are going to be more patients in cancer hospitals in the future.” Bray said that although there are more than 100 different cancer types, the top five cancers account for about 50 percent of cases. “Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide … particularly in men, whereas breast cancer is certainly the most common cancer in women,” he said. The IARC also said different types of cancer were now increasingly affecting populations as lifestyles change. For example, colorectal cancer is now the third most common cancer and second in terms of deaths. Colorectal cancer is linked particularly to age as well as lifestyle factors like obesity, smoking and alcohol use. “There should be a lot more investment in the early diagnosis and screening [of cancers]. There should be a lot more investment in preventing the disease,” as well as in palliative care for people who are suffering, Bray said.

UN experts condemn ‘disturbing’ attacks on journalists in Gaza,Officials suggest the targeting of journalists may be a ‘deliberate strategy by Israeli forces’ to silence reporting.,"United Nations experts have condemned the deadly attacks onjournalists and media workers in Gaza, calling on Israel to allow journalists to enter the besieged territory and to ensure their protection. In a statement released on Thursday, the experts described the war on Gaza as the “most dangerous conflict for journalists in recent history”. “We have received disturbing reports that, despite being clearly identifiable in jackets and helmets marked ‘press’ or travelling in well-marked press vehicles, journalists have come under attack, which would seem to indicate that the killings, injury, and detention are a deliberate strategy by Israeli forces to obstruct the media and silence critical reporting,” they said. The experts included Irene Khan, UN rapporteur on free expression; Francesca Albanese, UN rapporteur on Palestine; and Morris Tidball-Binz, UN rapporteur on extrajudicial killings.    Citing UN reports, the statement said more than 122 journalists andmedia workershave been killed in Gaza since the outbreak of the war. Four Israeli journalists were killed during the October 7 attack, and three Lebanese journalists have been killed in Israeli shelling. “We pay special tribute to the courage and resilience of journalists and media workers in Gaza who continue to put their own lives on the line every day in the course of duty, while also enduring enormous hardship and tragic loss of colleagues, friends and families in one of the bloodiest, most ruthless conflicts of our times,” the experts said. The UN officials underscored the case of Al Jazeera’s Gaza bureau chief Wael Dahdouh, whosewife Amna, son Mahmoud, daughter Sham and grandson Adamwere killed in an Israeli air raid in October. Dahdouh was later wounded in an Israeli drone attack that killed his colleague, Al Jazeera cameramanSamer Abudaqa. Last month, his eldest son,Hamza– a journalist who worked with Al Jazeera – was killed in an Israeli attack alongside fellow journalist Mustafa Thuraya. “Journalists are entitled to protection as civilians under international humanitarian law. Targeted attacks and killings of journalists are war crimes,” the UN experts said. They called for impartial investigations into the killing of journalists. Press freedom groups have warned about the apparent targeting of journalists in Gaza.    Beyond the killing of journalists, media workers across the occupied Palestinian territories have been subject to increased attacks and crackdowns by Israel over the past few months. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, a New York-based watchdog, 25 journalists have been arrested in Israel and the Palestinian territories since October 7. Others suffered “assaults, threats, cyberattacks and censorship”, the group says. Attacks on journalists in Gaza come amid the broader violence against the Palestinian territory. UN officials and aid groups have said that the conflict has been one of the most destructive in modern times. Israel has killed more than 27,000 Palestinians since October 7, flattening much of the territory as it pushes on with its military offensive. “The wholesale destruction of Gaza and the number ofcivilian casualtiesin such a short period are totally unprecedented during my mandate,” UN chief Antonio Guterres said last month.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/1/un-experts-condemn-disturbing-attacks-on-journalists-in-gaza
What is UNRWA and why is it important for Palestinians?,"The UN agency, which supports six million Palestinian refugees, is the main humanitarian provider in Gaza under Israeli bombardment.","The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), which is the main humanitarian agency in Gaza, has been facing an unprecedented funding crisis after its main international donors led by the United States cut its funding over “terror” allegations. The UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini has dubbed the steps to suspend funding an “additional collective punishment” for Palestinians already reeling from nearly four months of non-stop Israeli bombardment. The termination of aid came swiftly after Israel accused 12 UNRWA staff of involvement in the October 7 Hamas attack inside Israel. The UN has taken action against UNRWA staff linked to the attack, but has voiced its opposition to the defunding. “As the war in Gaza is being pursued unabated, and at the time the International Court of Justice calls for more humanitarian assistance, it is the time to reinforce and not to weaken UNRWA,” Lazzarini said in a statement on Thursday. “If the funding remains suspended, we will most likely be forced to shut down our operations by end of February not only in Gaza but also across the region.” The Palestinians have accused Israel of falsifying information to tarnish UNRWA in Gaza, which employs 13,000 people, who run schools, healthcare clinics and other essential services. Experts have said the Israeli allegations remain unverified. UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said on Tuesday that Israel has not yet shared the intelligence dossier with the UN. Yasmine Ahmed, the UK director of Human Rights Watch (HRW), told Al Jazeera that HRW is not aware that the UN, or in any of the states that fund UNRWA, have seen any written documentation of evidence that establishes what has been alleged by Israel. “That is not to say that that has not been provided,” she added. Ahmed said that HRW has asked the UK government what written evidence they saw of the allegations that led them to suspend the funding. Here is more about the UNRWA and how critical it is to Palestinians, particularly in Gaza. UNRWA was created by the UN General Assembly on December 8, 1949, to provide basic support including food, healthcare and education to tens of thousands of Palestinian refugees. More than 700,000 Palestinians were forcefully displaced leading up to Israel’s creation in 1948, which Palestinians remember asthe Nakba,or “the catastrophe”. The UNRWA operations are spread across the occupied West Bank – including East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan.    UNRWA supports some six million Palestinian refugees who live within and outside Palestine. It is like a quasi-state providing direct services, such as schools, primary health centres and other social services. It also provides loans to Palestinians. However, it does not run refugee camps, as the maintenance of law and order and security are not part of its mandate. UNRWA operates separately from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which was also established in 1949. While UNHCR provides temporary protection and assistance to refugees, it does not have a mandate over Palestinian refugees within the UNRWA fields of operations. Although it provides humanitarian aid to Palestinians, the UNRWA body does not have a mandate to resettle Palestine refugees, which Israel opposes. In 2021, about 545,000 children were enrolled in UNRWA schools; Social Safety Net Programme (SSNP) assistance reached 398,044 beneficiaries; and 1.7 million received critical humanitarian aid.  UNRWA helps Palestinians in multiple ways, providing them with multiple resources. Since Israel launched its war on Gaza onOctober 7, approximately a million Palestinians from Gaza, or nearly 45 percent of the enclave’s population, have been sheltering in UNRWA schools, clinics and other public buildings. UNRWA schools and buildings operate beyond capacity to provide shelter to internally displaced Palestinians who have very limited safe spaces to go to. Nearly the entire population in Gaza now relies on UNRWA for basic necessities, including food, water and hygiene supplies. The UN agency employs thousands of Palestinians in its schools, healthcare centres and other social programmes providing much-needed employment opportunities to Palestinians living under Israeli occupation for the past seven decades. More than 30,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, West Bank and in vast refugee camps in neighbouring Arab countries work for the UNRWA. Its services in Gaza have increased in importance since 2005, when Israel and Egypt imposed a blockade causing an economic collapse with one of the highest unemployment rates in the world. In December 2023, the International Labour Organisation and the Palestinian Statistics Bureau determined that at least 66 percent of employment was lost in Gaza since the war broke. UNRWA helps curb the unemployment gap among Palestinians by providing them with employment. In 2022, the UNRWA’s top government donors were the US, Germany, the European Union, Sweden, Norway, Japan, France, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland and Turkey.  The US, Germany and Switzerland havesuspended fundingto UNRWA following the allegations. The European Union (EU) announced on Monday that it would review whether it could continue to fund UNRWA in light of the allegations. However, the body does not foresee any additional funding for the organisation until the end of February. Norway, one of the top donors, urged fellow donor countries to reflect on the wider consequences of the funding cuts. “UNWRA is a vital lifeline for 1.5 million refugees in Gaza. Now more than ever, the agency needs international support. To avoid collectively punishing millions of people, we need to distinguish between what individuals may have done and what UNRWA stands for,” Espen Barth Eide, the Norwegian foreign minister, told Reuters on Wednesday.  Now that UNRWA’s biggest donors have frozen aid to it, there is a dire starvation threat to Palestinians in and outside of Gaza. “It’s difficult to imagine that Gazans will survive this crisis without UNRWA,” said Thomas White, director of UNRWA Affairs in Gaza and UN deputy humanitarian coordinator for the occupied Palestinian territory. “Rafah has become a sea of people fleeing bombardments,” he said, referring to the relentless Israeli bombing that has destroyed more than 70 percent of the houses in Gaza and displaced nearly two million people. Israel has long advocated for the dismantling of UNRWA, arguing that its mission is obsolete. On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed that UNRWA is “perforated with Hamas”. Netanyahu’s accusations against UNRWA have not been backed by facts. His assertion that UNRWA has been infiltrated by Hamas has been questioned because the UN agency shares the list of its staff with Israel. “Every year, UNRWA shares its list of staff with the host countries where it works,” said Stephane Dujarric. “For the work that it does in Gaza and the West Bank, UNRWA shares the list of staff with both the Palestinian Authority and with the Israeli government, as the occupying power for those areas.” Israel has long sought to end UNRWA, arguing that the UN body “perpetuated” the issue of Palestinian refugees because it allows Palestinians totransfer refugee statusacross generations and Israel has refused to accept the right of return to these refugees. Israel’s recent allegations towards UNRWA employees surfaced the same day as the ICJ’s interim ruling ordering Israel to prevent genocidal acts and scale up aid to Gaza. “I don’t think it is coincidental that these allegations came out immediately after the ICJ ruling,” said Diana Buttu, a Palestinian legal expert in international law. “It is designed to deflect from the ICJ ruling and focus the attention on UNRWA and to undermine any attempts to hold Israel accountable or stop the genocide.” Former UK Ambassador to Uzbekistan Craig Murray wrote that accusations against the 12 UNRWA staff members “provide a propaganda counter-narrative to the ICJ judgment, and to reduce the credibility of UNRWA’s evidence before the court”. Incredible. The BBC just led their news with an 8 minute long segment on the unevidenced allegations of UNRWA staff involvement with Hamas.Far greater coverage than they gave to the ICJ interim ruling that Israel is plausibly committing genocide.The BBC is an utter disgrace. — Craig Murray (@CraigMurrayOrg)January 28, 2024  Israel also wants to eliminate UNRWA to force Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank to migrate elsewhere out of desperation, according to Zaid Amali, a UNRWA cardholder and a civil society activist in the West Bank. There is evidence that Israel has consistently tried to forcefully displace Palestinians, aside from the long history of state-backedsettlersdisplacing Palestinians from the West Bank and East Jerusalem, Israeli ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich haverecently reiteratedideas for Palestinians “voluntarily migrating” out of Gaza, an euphemism for forced displacement. “This step of targeting UNRWA feeds into this overall goal of displacing more Palestinians [from their land] in order to build more illegal settlements,” hetoldAl Jazeera.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/1/what-is-unrwa-and-why-it-is-important-for-palestinians
Tunisia’s Saied wants to make the central bank fill the budget deficit,"By borrowing billions from the central bank to shore up the budget, the president could well worsen Tunisia’s economic woes.","Tunisian President Kais Saied is preparing to seek direct financing for the government’s budget from the Central Bank of Tunisia in a move analysts say could worsen the financial difficulties the country has been experiencing since before its 2011 revolution. Shortfalls in the budget have already resulted in the absence of state-subsidised goods like flour, rice and coffee from supermarket shelves as inflation pushes the prices of other goods beyond the reach of many households. With gaps in last year’s budget as well as a 10.6-billion-dinar (about $3.4bn) shortfall in the current year, the state is looking to compel the Central Bank to purchase government bonds as a way to raise direct funding. Government proposals were discussed by the parliament’s finance committee on Wednesday with what are understood to be instructions to fast-track its passage to parliament next week, where it can be voted upon during its plenary session. “Tunisia has run out of credit,” Hamza Meddeb of the Carnegie Middle East Center said. “Its negotiations for a further loan with the International Monetary Fund [IMF] appear stalled. There are no new payments coming from the European Union for its part in helping curb the flow of irregular migrants and no sign of financial help coming from elsewhere. “Tunisia needs cash immediately. It can’t wait,” he said. The legislation – if passed, as looks likely – would threaten the bank’s independence and, by devaluing its own currency, risks triggering a wave of inflation that its outgoing governor, Marouan Abassi, previously likened to that of Venezuela, where percentile increases in the cost of goods and services are now measured in the hundreds. The Central Bank authorised a brief raid on its reserves in 2020 and released 2.8 billion dinars (roughly $900m) under exceptional legislation to help combat the spread of COVID-19. At the time, international bodies, including the IMF were happy to waive the implications of the move, given circumstances that were, by any measure, unprecedented. The Central Bank has remained a respected pillar of the Tunisian state, retaining broad control over interest rates, helping mitigate the worst effects of the country’s economic decline and proving vital in maintaining the confidence of international financial backers, such as the IMF and World Bank. “Central banks … rely upon their independence,” economist, Aram Belhaj from the University of Carthage said. In addition to their critical role in helping control inflation by setting interest rates, they also tie the hands of politicians, Belhaj explained. “If you have politicians with unrestricted powers, they will use the central bank to finance expenditures, possibly funding electoral objectives. Therefore, the independence of the central bank is crucial. It effectively limits political pressure,” he said. While the current legislation does not explicitly mark the end of the bank’s independence, it does undermine a 2016 law that separates the state from the central bank and is the subject of sporadic presidential criticism. “The new legislation is not part of a broader approach that would allow the Central Bank to integrate [with the economy] or become more involved in growth and development issues,” Belhaj said. “It’s just a modification that allows the government to obtain an advance of 7 billion Tunisian dinars [$2.24bn] – which is an incredibly large amount –  to finance the budget deficit,” he said. Tunisia had been in negotiations with the IMF for a further $1.9bn bailout. However, what looked to have been a finalised deal was rejected by Tunisia in April when Saied rejected the body’s “foreign diktats” intended to curb spending on subsidies and government salaries – said to be, per capita, among the highest in the world. “This speaks as much about desperation as anything else. It tells us that the state didn’t have any other options. They needed capital, and they needed it immediately. All other options would have required negotiations and time,” Meddeb said. “Moreover, we don’t even know which funds the government is drawing upon, and that’s critical. If it seeks to access the bank’s foreign reserves, it risks Tunisia’s devaluation of the dinar. If it accesses our domestic reserves, we’re essentially printing our own money to pay our bills. “Neither makes Tunisia a particularly attractive option to investors or backers.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/1/tunisias-saied-wants-to-make-the-central-bank-fill-the-budget-deficit
"Journalists, activists targeted in Jordan with Israeli-made Pegasus spyware",Report by Access Now says hackers used the malware to break into smartphones of dozens of people in Jordan.,"The mobile phones of more than 30 people in Jordan, including journalists, lawyers and activists, were hacked with theIsraeli-made Pegasus spywareover several years, a new investigation has found. The joint investigation, conducted by the Access Now internet advocacy group, the Citizen Lab rights group and other partners, highlighted on Thursday at least 35 cases of people who were targeted with the software, which is made by Israel’sNSO Group. Most of the cases dated from 2020 to late 2023. “We believe this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the use of Pegasus spyware in Jordan, and that the true number of victims is likely much higher,” Access Now said. While its report refrained from accusing Jordan’s government of deploying the spyware, it signalled that its use coincided with a dialling up of repression of “citizens’ rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly”. The Jordanian government had no immediate comment on the report. Pegasus, which can seize control of a phone’s microphone and camera and access documents, made headlines when a2021 leaksuggested there were about 50,000 potential victims of the malware around the world, many of them dissidents, journalists and activists. Those targeted in Jordan include two Human Rights Watch employees: Adam Coogle, deputy director for Middle East and North Africa, and Hiba Zayadin, senior researcher for Jordan and Syria. Both had received threat notifications from Apple in August that state-sponsored attackers had attempted to compromise their iPhones. Access Now said Coogle’s phone was hacked in October 2022, just two weeks after the publication of a report documenting the persecution of citizens organising peaceful political dissent. According to the report, many of those targeted had either worked on or covered a monthlong teachers’ strike in 2019, which prompted the authorities to arrest hundreds of teachers and dissolve their union. The report also said about half of those found to have been targeted – 16 in all – were journalists or media workers. Among them was Daoud Kuttab, a Palestinian-American journalist, who had his phone hacked three times in 2022 and 2023 and faced a further seven failed attempts. He said most journalists working in the Middle East expect their phones to be tapped, adding he had learned not to click on links in messages purporting to be from legitimate contacts. “In the past, it was only people overhearing what you say, but Pegasus is much more intrusive,” he was quoted as saying by The Associated Press news agency, expressing fears that bad actors could get access to his contacts. “I don’t want to burn my contacts, I don’t want to hurt them,” he said. NSO Group faces multiple lawsuits from Apple and others, but it continues to sell its products to governments around the world, claiming that it sells the spyware only to vetted intelligence and law enforcement agencies in the interests of peace. But cybersecurity researchers who have tracked its use in 45 countries have documented dozens of cases of politically motivated abuse of the spyware – from Mexico to Thailand and Poland to Saudi Arabia. In 2021, the United Statesblacklisted NSO Group, accusing it of developing and supplying the spyware to foreign governments “that used these tools to maliciously” target a range of actors, including journalists and activists. Access Now’s regional policy director Marwa Fatafta said there was generally no oversight of companies offering such spying software, allowing the surveillance sector to continue its “secretive and shady” manner of business. “Governments are feverishly purchasing their technologies to spy on their citizens and to crack down on civil society,” Fatafta said. The NGO reiterated its call for an outright ban on any spyware that enables rights abuses.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/1/journalists-activists-targeted-in-jordan-with-israeli-made-pegasus-spyware
Palestinians demand international inquiry after mass grave found in Gaza,"Bodies of Palestinian detainees who were handcuffed, blindfolded discovered in plastic bags near northern Gaza school.","Palestinian authorities have demanded an international investigation after a mass grave was found in Gaza with the decomposing bodies of Palestinian detainees who were blindfolded and handcuffed. At least 30 bodies were found in “black plastic bags” near the Hamad school in northern Gaza, with Palestinian officials accusing Israeli soldiers of killing the civilians “execution-style”. The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs called for an international investigation on Wednesday into what it described as Israeli “massacres”, demanding that a team visit Gaza “to find out the truth and dimensions of the genocide to which our people are exposed”. Witnesses told Al Jazeera that the deceased were blindfolded, tortured and killed before being placed in the bags. “As we were cleaning, we came across a pile of rubble inside the schoolyard. We were shocked to find out that the dozens of dead bodies were buried under this pile,” one witness told  Al Jazeera. “The moment we opened the black plastic bags, we found the bodies, already decomposed. They were blindfolded, legs and hands tied,” the witness added. “The plastic cuffs were used on their hands and legs and cloths straps around their eyes and heads.” Hamas said human rights organisations should “document” the mass grave.    “This heinous crime and others committed by the neo-Nazis against our Palestinian people will remain a curse that haunts them, and the day will come when they will be held accountable for their brutality and crimes that exceed the most horrific violations known to humanity in our modern era,” the Palestinian armed group said in a statement on Telegram. Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from Rafah in southern Gaza, said the “condition of these bodies ranges from severely decomposed to mere skeletal remains … making it hard to identify them”. “But people still come to the site, searching for closure in this place of tragedy,” he added. Palestinian human rights lawyer Diana Buttu told Al Jazeera on Thursday that this incident was “preciselywhy Israel was taken to the ICJ“. Buttu added that the discovery of the mass grave was “clearly a war crime” and urged that it must be investigated. The International Court of Justice has ordered Israel to take“all measures within its power”to avoid Palestinian casualties and acts that could amount to “genocide”. The Foreign Ministry said the discovery of the mass grave was evidence of the forms of “genocide committedby the occupation forces against our people in the Gaza Strip without accountability or oversight”.    Palestinian detainees are routinely abused by Israeli forces in the enclave, subjected to weeks of imprisonment in unknown locations, beatings and verbal abuse. Last month, a United Nations human rights official called for an end toIsrael’s mistreatment of Palestinian detaineesand said he had met men who had been held for weeks and were beaten and blindfolded. “These are men who were detained by the Israeli security forces in unknown locations for between 30 to 55 days,” Ajith Sunghay, a UN human rights representative, told reporters by video link from Gaza, who met released detainees in the enclave. “There are reports of men who are subsequently released, but only in diapers without any adequate clothing in this cold weather,” he said, adding that it was not clear why they were made to wear diapers but that “they were clearly visibly shocked and even shaken when I met them”. Several videos shared by the Israeli army since the war began show hundreds of Palestinian men stripped to their underwear, sitting outdoors in the cold, sometimes blindfolded. In a few videos, women and children were also seen. Much of the densely populated Gaza Strip has been destroyed after four months of intense Israeli bombardments and ground offensive. Gaza’s health authorities have said at least 26,900 Palestinians have been killed since the war began on October 7, following Hamas attacks in Israel that killed at least 1,139 people.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/1/palestinians-demand-international-inquiry-after-mass-grave-found-in-gaza

US military targets 10 Houthi drones in new Yemen strikes,The Iran-aligned rebel group has warned of more attacks against US and British warships.,"The United States military has carried out new strikes against 10 drones belonging to the Iran-alignedHouthirebels in Yemen as well as a ground control centre. On Thursday,US forcestargeted a “Houthi UAV ground control station and 10 Houthi one-way UAVs” that “presented an imminent threat to merchant vessels and the US Navy ships in the region”, the US military’s Central Command (CENTCOM) said in a statement referring to unmanned aerial vehicles. “This action will protect freedom of navigation and make international waters safer and more secure for US Navy vessels and merchant vessels,” it added. CENTCOM Self-Defense Strike Against Houthi UAVs and Ground Control Stationpic.twitter.com/9LUKQS2HEB — U.S. Central Command (@CENTCOM)February 1, 2024  The group said on Wednesday that all US and British warships participatingin “aggression” against Yemenare targets, heightening concerns over the escalating tensions in the region as well as the increased disruption to world trade. CENTCOM said earlier that the USS Carney had shot down an antiship ballistic missile fired by the Houthis and downed three Iranian drones less than an hour later. It did not specify if they were surveillance drones or attack drones. The Houthis said on Wednesday that their naval forces carried out an operation hitting an “American merchant ship” in the Gulf of Aden hours after firing missiles at the US Navy destroyer Gravely.    While the United States and Iran have avoided direct confrontation, the US has recently launched strikes on the Houthis and other Iranian-linked groups in the Middle East. On Wednesday, CENTCOM said forces had destroyed a Houthi surface-to-air missile that posed a threat to “US aircraft”, in a marked difference from past air raids that have focused on the group’s ability to affect global shipping in the Red Sea. The Houthis, who control the most populous parts of Yemen, began targeting Israeli-linked vessels in the Red Sea in November in what they say is an act of solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza and in support of Hamas. US andBritish forceshave responded to the attacks by striking the Houthis, who have since declared US and British interests as legitimate targets. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with his British counterpart, Defence Secretary Grant Shapps, to discuss the situation in the Red Sea and the “international action to hold the Houthis accountable for their illegal and reckless attacks on vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden”, the US Department of State said on Wednesday. The US has set up a multinational naval task force to help protect Red Sea shipping from the Houthis’ repeated attacks on the busy waterways that carry up to 12 percent of global trade.

Nearly eight million people displaced by war in Sudan: UN,UN reports figures nine months into a new round of war that has left the country devastated.,"Nine months into a bloody war, nearly eight million people have been forced from their homes in Sudan, the United Nations says, calling for urgent additional support to cope with the crisis. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees reported the alarming figure on Wednesday as High Commissioner Filippo Grandi concluded a visit to Ethiopia, to which many of the displaced people have fled. The UNHCR said it is facing a chronic shortfall in needed funds. Since April 2023, more than 100,000 people have crossed into Ethiopia from Sudan, including close to 47,000 refugees and asylum seekers. About 50,000 Sudanese refugees were already in the country. Grandi called for “urgent and additional support to meet their needs” as he inspected the efforts of the Ethiopian government and the UNHCR to assist. Five other neighbouring countries have also received huge numbers of Sudanese refugees. More than half a million people have fled to Chad since April. On average, 1,500 people cross daily into South Sudan. The latest wave of violence in the 20-year conflict has left nearly half of Sudan’s 49 million people requiring aid. The UN reports that 12,000 people had been killed by the end of 2023, but the actual death toll is believed to be higher. Sudanplunged into chaoslast April when long-simmering tensions between the military, led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitaryRapid Support Forces,headed by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, erupted into street battles in the capital, Khartoum, and other areas. The violence has extended from an earlier conflict that began in 2003, when rebels from the territory’s ethnic sub-Saharan African community launched an armed rebellion, accusing the Arab-dominated government in Khartoum of discrimination and neglect. The government, under then-President Omar al-Bashir, responded with aerial bombings and unleashed the militia group Popular Defence Forces, also known as the Janjaweed, which is accused of mass killings and rapes. Up to 300,000 people were killed and 2.7 million were driven from their homes. Internationally-brokered deals and peacekeeping forces have struggled to subdue the violence over the last two decades. According to a report by the UN agency International Organization for Migration last year, approximatelythree million of the displacedare originally from Khartoum, the epicentre of the conflict. For months now, the RSF has controlled most of the city, making life impossible for locals, contributing to reducing entire neighbourhoods to rubble by embedding its fighters in residential areas, which are then indiscriminately shelled and bombed by the army. While millions have fled the city, some are too poor to leave, while others have stayed behind, fearing that the RSF will confiscate and loot their homes if they flee. Ethiopia hosts one of the largest refugee and internally displaced populations globally, the UN notes. As the third largest refugee-hosting country in Africa, it is currently home to nearly one million displaced people – mainly from South Sudan, Somalia, Eritrea, and Sudan. An estimated 3.5 million Ethiopians are internally displaced. At the end of last year, UNHCR’s programmes in Ethiopia were less than half-funded, with just 36 percent of the $431m needed. In 2024, the overall requirements for UNHCR’s response in Ethiopia totals $426m.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/31/nearly-eight-million-people-displaced-by-war-in-sudan-un
Houthis threaten more attacks against Western warships,"Unbowed after joint US-UK attacks on Yemen, the Iran-backed group warns of continued attacks in Red Sea.","Yemen’s Houthi militia has stated it plans more attacks on United States and British warships. The Iran-aligned group’s statement, released on Wednesday, said all US and British warships participating in “aggression” against Yemen are targets. The statement stoked concern over the simmering tensions in the region as well as increased disruption to world trade. TheHouthis, who control the most populous parts of Yemen, have launched drones and missiles at shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden since November 19. The group said the attacks are a response toIsrael’s military operationsin Gaza. The US and Britain have struck back at Houthi targets in Yemen as they patrol the Red Sea in a naval coalition that has swapped numerous attacks with the Yemeni group. On Tuesday, the Houthis fired missiles at the US warship USS Gravely. US Central Command said its forces had shot down an antiship cruise missile. On Wednesday, the US said its forces destroyed a surface-to-air missile which was prepared to launch. “U.S. forces identified the missile in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen and determined that it presented an imminent threat to U.S. aircraft,” Central Command said. The Houthi attacks have added a global economic element to the turmoil emanating from the war in Gaza. Several shipping companies have suspended transits through the Red Sea, which is accessed from the Gulf of Aden, instead taking much longer and costlier journeys around Africa to avoid being attacked. The situation has sent shipping and insurance costs soaring, raising fears of a renewedcost-of-living crisis. The Houthis said they will persist with their military operations until a ceasefire is agreed in the Gaza Strip and food and medicine are allowed into the enclave to ease a humanitarian crisis. They insist they are prepared to dig in for the long haul. On Tuesday, Mohamed al-Atifi, commander of the Houthi forces, said: “We are prepared for a long-term confrontation with the forces of tyranny. The Americans, the British and those who coordinated with them must realise the power of the sovereign Yemeni decision and that there is no debate or dispute over it.” In response to the attacks, the US government redesignated the militia as“specially designated global terrorists”, and amid the threat of extended shipping disruptions, the European Union’s foreign minister Josep Borrell said on Wednesday that the bloc aims to launch its own Red Sea naval mission by the middle of February. The 26-member union refused to join the US coalition established in December due to concerns of some states about operating under Washington’s control. Borrell said defence ministers should decide on Wednesday, a day ahead of a European Council meeting, on which country will lead the effort, as well as outlining where the mission would be headquartered, who would participate and with what assets.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/31/houthis-threaten-more-strikes-on-us-and-british-warships

Kataib Hezbollah announces halt of attacks on US forces,Iraq-based group seeks to de-escalate as Washington mulls response to deadly Jordan strike.,"Iran-backed Kataib Hezbollah has announced the suspension of hostile operations against US troops as Washington ponders its response to adeadly drone attackthat killed three of its soldiers. The group’s attempt to de-escalate late on Tuesday, which it said was motivated by a desire not to “embarrass” the Iraqi government, was met with some scepticism in the United States. The Pentagon alleges that there have been three further attacks since the attack in Jordan on January 28. However, the White House has indicated that it is pondering a “tiered response” to Sunday’s attack. Speaking on Tuesday in Washington, DC, Bidentied the attacks to Iran. “I do hold them responsible in the sense that they’re supplying the weapons to the people who did it,” he said. However, he specified he did not want “a wider war” in the region. However, Al Jazeera correspondent Patty Culhane, reporting from Washington, DC, said Republican hawks were calling for strikes inside Iran. “For months, this administration has been saying the biggest concern they have is that this will lead to a wider war, and it seems fairly clear that striking inside of Iran would make it more likely rather than less,” she said. Iran has responded with its own hawkish rhetoric. On Wednesday, a statement from Hossein Salami, chief of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, reiterated threats that Tehran will respond in kind should the US take any action against it. “We hear threats coming from American officials, we tell them that they have already tested us and we now know one another, no threat will be left unanswered,” he said, according to the semi-official Tasnim news agency. Kataib Hezbollah is the most powerful element in a group called the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, which has claimed more than 150 attacks on US forces in Iraq and Syria since October 7. The US has so far responded to that campaign by conducting air raids and imposing sanctions against Iran-backed groups in Iraq, particularly Kataib Hezbollah. In its statement on Tuesday, Kataib Hezbollah’s Secretary-General Abu Hussein al-Hamidawi noted that many of its allies, in particular Iran, “often object to the pressure and escalation against the American occupation forces in Iraq and Syria”. Al Jazeera’s Mahmoud Abdelwahed said the statement aimed to “alleviate or reduce the burden, the pressure that the government in Iraq has been facing since … the beginning of these attacks”. The Iraqi government, he said, has been engaged in talks with US military officials to find mechanisms guaranteeing the withdrawal of US and coalition troops from the country. In the face of Biden’s caution over the US response to the attack in Jordan,hawkish members of the Republican Partyhave gone into overdrive as they appeal for more direct military action against Iran. Senator Lindsey Graham called on the Biden administration to “strike targets of significance inside Iran, not only as reprisal for the killing of our forces but as deterrence against future aggression”. Roger Wicker, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, called for “striking directly against Iranian targets and its leadership”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/31/kataib-hezbollah-says-it-suspends-attacks-on-us-forces
‘Frog being boiled’: US troop deaths in Jordan incite Republican Iran hawks,Political rhetoric heats up as Biden says he has decided on response to deadly drone attack blamed on Iran-aligned group.,"Republican lawmakers in the United States have amplified their calls for President Joe Biden to take decisive action against Iran after adrone attackkilled three US soldiers along the Jordan-Syria border. But foreign policy experts and advocates fear the political pressure may send the US down anincreasingly dangerouspath towards direct confrontation with Iran. “I think it’s really scary how far the rhetoric has come and what that means for the decisions that policymakers will make,” said Jamal Abdi, the president of the National Iranian American Council (NIAC). “It really does feel like the frog being boiled in the water situation,” he said, referring to the allegory of an amphibian unaware it is being cooked in slowly warming water. For his part,Biden has promisedthe US will “hold all those responsible to account at a time and in a manner [of] our choosing”. On Tuesday, he told reporters he had decided how to proceed, without providing further information.    Speaking to reporters on Monday, White House National Security spokesperson John Kirby maintained the US is not seeking direct confrontation with Iran. He also did not link Iran directly to the attack. Nevertheless, Kirby said the US would respond appropriately to the “Iran-backed group” responsible for the deaths. Department of Defense spokesperson Sabrina Singh, meanwhile, told reporters the attack “has the footprints” of the Iran-aligned Kataib Hezbollah group — but that the agency’s assessment remained ongoing. “We don’t seek a war with Iran. We don’t seek to widen this conflict,” Singh said. “We have said and we will continue to call out the fact that Iran does fund and equip these groups and provide them the capabilities that they use to attack our service members, whether it be Iraq, Syria or Jordan.” On Tuesday, Kataib Hezbollah released a statement saying it had suspended its attacks against the US. Pentagon spokesperson Pat Ryder also reiterated the administration’s stance on Tuesday, saying that the US had repeatedly “called on the Iranian proxy groups to stop their attacks. They have not, and so, we will respond in a time and manner of our choosing.” US military bases have faced more than 160 attacks sinceIsrael’s war in Gazabegan on October 7, but the drone attack on Sunday marked the first time US personnel have been killed. That fact has kicked hawkish members of the Republican Party into overdrive, as they appeal for more direct military action against Iran. Senator Lindsey Graham, for instance, called on the Biden administration to “strike targets of significance inside Iran, not only as reprisal for the killing of our forces but as deterrence against future aggression”. Senator Tom Cotton likewise pushed for “devastating military retaliation against Iran’s terrorist forces, both in Iran and across the Middle East”. Other right-wing figures have also chimed in, including Roger Wicker, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, who called for “striking directly against Iranian targets and its leadership”.    Stephen Miles, the president of Win Without War, a group that advocates for progressive US foreign policy, described the reaction as the equivalent of a knee-jerk. He quipped that some Republicans call for bombing Iran when they “think they lose their keys”. He considers the latest Republican appeals as adding fuel to an already hazardous situation. The Biden administration, he explained, already pursues a strategy of retaliatory strikes on groups that receive support from Iran in Iraq and Syria, as well as the Houthis in Yemen. That, in turn, could ratchet tensions over the Gaza conflict into a regional war. “I think, a lot of times, people think of these situations as big ‘set piece’ wars where the US makes the decision to intervene, and we pre-position all these troops and all these assets and go to war,” Miles told Al Jazeera. “The far more likely path … is that these kinds of tit-for-tat retaliatory strikes have the potential to really grow far beyond that.” “It doesn’t matter if folks in Washington or Tehran might not want a broader regional war,” he added. “These things can take on take on a life of their own.” Trita Parsi, the executive vice president of the Quincy Institute, a think tank, said the Republicans calling for direct retaliation against Iran have fallen into two camps: some “truly want war”, while others are simply attacking Biden’s perceived vulnerability during an election year. For the latter camp, a hawkish approach can pay dividends regardless of whether Biden acts. “They can push Biden to take military action, which I think they understand is not going to work out well,” he said. “Or Biden will not strike Iran, and then they will attack him for being weak. So they see this as a win-win from a political standpoint.” The death of US troops has already brought Biden’s Iran policy to the fore of the 2024 presidential race. Republican presidential frontrunner and former President Donald Trump has seized on the moment, saying the attack “would never have happened” if he were in the White House. He has described his approach as “peace through strength”. But critics have pointed out that the Trump administration’sdecision to assassinateIranian General Qassem Soleimani in Iraq on January 3, 2020, brought the two countries to the brink of war. Since then, US bases in the Middle East have been regularly targeted, sometimes in explicit retaliation for the assassination. Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley has also called for “surgical strikes” on Iranian assets and officials outside Iran. “There is this message being trotted out in an election year that somehow Trump was really tough on Iran, and that was beneficial, and Biden has been weak,” said the National Iranian American Council’s Abdi, whose group has long pushed for diplomatic solutions to the tense relations between the US and Iran.    Abdi added that some Republicans have already sought to connect the attack with Biden’s wider Iran policy, which has largely resembled Trump’s, despite pledges to take a more diplomacy-forward approach. But there could be a “political imperative” for Biden to “take retaliatory action that would be regarded as stronger than what the United States has done thus far”, according to Brian Finucane, a senior US adviser at Crisis Group, a think tank that seeks to prevent and resolve conflict. “The emphasis seems to be on avenging the US soldiers who were killed yesterday,” he said. “It’s notable that the loudest voices in Congress are not those calling for restraint or calling into question the legal authority for the US to be engaged in these conflicts with Iran-backed groups in Iraq and Syria, saying nothing of the conflict with the Houthis.” For his part, Parsi at the Quincy Institute called Biden’s predicament — and the risks of further escalation — “predictable”. Biden’s continued support for Israel andrefusal to call for a ceasefirein Gaza has inflamed tensions in the Middle East and created fodder for those seeking direct confrontation with Iran, he explained. “Biden should have been more cautious from the outset,” Parsi said. “We would not have this escalation that we have today had there been a ceasefire much earlier.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/30/frog-being-boiled-us-troop-deaths-in-jordan-incite-republican-iran-hawks
Iran summons British ambassador as tensions soar,"The UK has accused Iran-backed groups of attacking a US base in Jordan, and imposed sanctions on a network linked to Iran.","Iran summoned the British ambassador to Tehran to protest against the “baseless accusations” and sanctions by London. “Following the continuation of the British regime’s accusations against the Islamic Republic of Iran, Simon Shercliff, the British ambassador in Tehran, was summoned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs … and was informed of our country’s strong protest”, the IRNA state news agency said on Tuesday. While the statement did not explain the accusation against the United Kingdom, it said the director general of Western Europe at the Iranian foreign ministry, Majid Nili Ahmadabadi, criticised the British government and said its actions were another “destructive and unconstructive” act towards Iran. “This is a bitter historical irony that a country that is the founder and supporter of organised terrorist groups, drug trafficking, and criminal gangs wants to make accusations against the Islamic Republic of Iran and its loyal and honest forces, who are at the forefront of fighting organised crimes,” the official, cited by IRNA, said. The summons came after the UK announced sanctionson Iranian officialsit said were involved in threats to kill journalists on British soil and others it said were part of international criminal gangs linked to Tehran. The UK has also accused Iranian-linked groups of being behind a deadly attack on US troops in Jordan. British Foreign Secretary David Cameron condemned the “attacks by Iran-aligned militia groups against US forces” and urged “Iran to de-escalate in the region”. However, Iran denied the accusation that it had any links to the Jordan strike that killed three US personnel and that it was not looking for an “expansion” of the tensions in the Middle East.  “As we have clearly stated before, the resistance groups in the region are responding [to] the war crimes and genocide of the child-killing Zionist [Israeli] regime and … they do not take orders from the Islamic Republic of Iran”, Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Nasser Kanaani was cited as saying by IRNA on Monday. “These groups decide and act based on their own principles and priorities, as well as the interests of their country and people.” US President Joe Biden told reporters on Tuesday that he had made a decision on responding to the attacks in Jordan and said he holds Iran “responsible, in the sense that they’re supplying the weapons to the people who did it”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/30/iran-summons-british-ambassador-as-tensions-soar
Hamas studying three-phase Gaza truce plan as Israeli hardliners warn PM,"Hamas says the proposal involves three stages, including the release of hostages held by the group and Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.","Hamas has confirmed that it is studying a three-phase proposal for a truce in Gaza, while hardline members of the Israeli government have threatened to collapse the coalition if any deal is not to their liking. The Palestinian group’s political leader Ismail Haniyeh confirmed on Tuesday that he is studying theproposal, thrashed out in Paris over the weekend, to halt the war and enable the exchange of Israeli and Palestinian prisoners. Haniyeh said in a statement that the group is “open to discussing any serious and practical initiatives or ideas, provided that they lead to a comprehensive cessation of aggression”. Hamas also said that the plan must ensure the “complete withdrawal of the occupation forces from the Gaza Strip”. The group’s leadership, he said, had received an invitation to Cairo to reach an “integrated vision” on the framework agreement. In a statement sent to Reuters, Hamas said the proposal involved three stages. The plan has been sent to Gaza to obtain the opinion of Hamas leaders there. “The Hamas leadership will meet to discuss the paper and express its final opinion on it,” the statement said. Sources told the news agency that the first phase would consist of a pause in fighting and the release of elderly, civilian women and children hostages. Major deliveries of food and medicine to Gaza, facing a ruinous humanitarian crisis, would resume. The second phase would see the releases of female Israeli soldiers and another increase in aid deliveries and restoration of utility services to Gaza. The third phase would see the release of the bodies of deceased Israeli troops in exchange for Palestinian prisoners freed, two sources said. The Hamas statement said the second phase would also involve the release of male military recruits. “Military operations on both sides will stop during the three stages,” it said. The number of Palestinian prisoners to be released is to be left to the negotiation process “at every stage, with the Israeli side preparing to release those with high sentences,” it said. The ultimate aim of this phased approach is the end of the war and the release of  male soldiers held captive in Gaza in exchange for Israel’s release of additional Palestinian prisoners held in jail. If Hamas does agree to the framework proposal it could still take days or weeks to settle logistical details of the truce and the release of hostages and prisoners, an official told Reuters. Qatar’s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, said the framework discussed in Paris is based on elements of an initial proposal made by Israel and a counterproposal made by Hamas. “We tried to blend things together to come up with some sort of reasonable ground that brings everybody together,” he said at Washington’s Atlantic Council think tank on Monday. He added that “good progress” was made on a possible deal during meetings between intelligence officials from Egypt, Israel and the United States over the weekend. The Qatari prime minister noted that Hamas has previously demanded a permanent ceasefire as a precondition to enter negotiations. However, he suggested that there is hope its stance may have shifted. “I believe we moved from that place to a place that potentially might lead to a ceasefire permanently in the future,” he said. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad group in Gaza said it will not engage in any understandings regarding Israeli hostages without ensuring a comprehensive ceasefire and the withdrawal of the Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip, the group’s secretary general Ziad al-Nakhala said in a statement on Tuesday. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday said Israel would continue its war in Gaza until “absolute victory” over Hamas. He ruled out releasing “thousands” of Palestinian prisoners as part of any deal to halt the fighting and said the army would not withdraw from Gaza. “I would like to make it clear… We will not withdraw the IDF [army] from the Gaza Strip and we will not release thousands of terrorists. None of this will happen,” he said in an address at Eli settlement in the occupied West Bank. Netanyahu is under significant pressure from the families of the remaining captives held by Hamas to reach a deal to secure their release. Hamas killed at least 1,139 people in Israel and took about 240 captives on October 7, according to Israeli figures. However, Netanyahu is also being pushed to continue the war by hardline coalition partners in his government. Commenting on the reported truce negotiations earlier on Tuesday, far-right Israeli Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir appeared to suggest that a deal with Hamas would trigger a government collapse. “Reckless deal = Government split,” Ben-Gvir wrote on X. עסקה מופקרת = פירוק הממשלה — איתמר בן גביר (@itamarbengvir)January 30, 2024  The national security minister is known for his inflammatory commentary on the conflict. However, his Jewish Power (Otzma Yehudit) party is a major player in Israel’s ruling coalition. Al Jazeera’s Mohammed Jamjoom, reporting from Tel Aviv, said anonymous Israeli officials confirmed that the government signed off to a deal that was presented to Hamas. This includes a pause in fighting and the release of Israeli captives in Gaza in exchange for thousands of Palestinian prisoners. Jamjoom said that while right wing government members were against the deal, Yair Lapid, Israel’s opposition leader and former prime minister, said he would support the government if it meant bringing the captives homes. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was also expected to land in Israel on Saturday for his sixth trip to the region since the war started to discuss post-war scenarios in Gaza, Jamjoom reported. The proposals were circulated to Hamas as fighting intensified in Gaza. Heavy Israeli strikes and urban combat across the besieged enclave killed 128 more people overnight, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. An Israeli ‘hit squad’ alsokilled three menthat it labelled as “terrorists” in an undercover operation at a hospital in the occupied West Bank. “The world must put pressure on the occupation to stop these massacres and war crimes, including the policy of torture to which our people are exposed in the areas of the West Bank, executions and arrests,” said Haniyeh. Amidst the uptick in fighting, Israel has charged that around a dozen staff of theUnited Nations agency for Palestinian refugees(UNRWA) took part in the October 7 attack, leading key donor countries including the United States and Germany to suspend funding. Haniyeh said that the decision of countries to suspend contributions was a “clear violation” of last week’sInternational Court of Justiceinterim ruling, which called for increasing humanitarian aid to Gaza. Countries cutting aid support Israel’s “occupation through starvation and siege”, the Hamas chief asserted.  ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/30/hamas-studying-ceasefire-plan

Israeli forces kill three Palestinians in West Bank hospital raid,Hospital says the men were ‘assassinated’. Israel says they belonged to a ‘Hamas terrorist cell’.,"Israeli forces disguised as medical staff and civilians have shot dead three Palestinians inside a hospital in the city of Jenin in the occupied West Bank. The killings were carried out by undercover operatives while the men were sleeping at Ibn Sina Hospital, according to statements issued by the Palestinian Ministry of Health and the Israeli army on Tuesday. “This morning three young men were martyred by the bullets of the occupation [Israeli] forces who stormed the Ibn Sina Hospital in Jenin and shot them,” the Ministry of Health in Ramallah said. The Israeli army said its troops had “neutralised” the men, who were hiding in the hospital and belonged to a “Hamas terrorist cell”. Security camera footage circulated online appeared to show about a dozen undercover personnel, including three in women’s clothing and two dressed as medical staff, pacing through a corridor of the hospital with assault rifles. The Israeli military identified one of the men killed as Mohammad Jalamneh, 27, who it claimed was planning an imminent attack and had been transferring weapons and ammunition to other members. The two other men killed, brothers Basil and Mohammad Ghazawi, were hiding inside the hospital and were involved in attacks, the military alleged. “A gun was found on a wanted person, which was confiscated by the forces,” the army statement added. Al Jazeera’s Charles Stratford, reporting from Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, said: “One can only imagine the terror of the patients and staff at the hospital in Jenin.” “It’s just another example of how determined the Israeli army is to keep up raids as it targets armed resistance fighters across the occupied Palestinian territory,” he added. Hamas said in a statement that the Israeli army’s “crimes will not go unanswered”, adding that the killings are a “continuation of the occupation’s ongoing crimes against our people from Gaza to Jenin”.    One of the men, Basil Ghazawi, was injured and in bed when he was killed, said the Palestinian armed group. Basil was injured by missile fragments following an Israeli drone attack on October 25 targeting a group of men near the Jenin camp cemetery and had been receiving treatment at the hospital for three months, according to Al Jazeera sources. Hamas confirmed that Jalamneh was one of its members. The Jenin Brigade, which includes a number of Palestinian armed resistance groups, said in a statement that two of the three men were members of Islamic Jihad. Jalamneh’s father Walid told Al Jazeera from Jenin that the path his son took was the “path of the honorable – of the free.” “The path that my son Mohammad took, many of our sons have gone through before him. He was not alone; they found no other way to deal with this occupation, other than with firepower, because this occupation and enemy does not deal with us, even our children, except with firepower,” said Walid. “They tried to achieve “peace” for tens of years. I want to ask those who are betting on “peace,” does this enemy want peace? Tens of years of negotiations, while the occupation is stealing more land, killing thousands of Palestinians, insisting to keep the Palestinian people under occupation, in front of the world’s eyes, because they consider themselves to be above the law,” he continued. The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned “in the strongest terms the occupation forces’ assassination of the three young men”. Thousands of Palestinians thronged the streets of Jenin as the funeral ceremony for the three men was underway. They were to be buried at a cemetery in the Jenin refugee camp. The mother of the Ghazawi brothers said the two were loved by everyone. “The last time I saw them was yesterday night … I was in the hospital,” she said in a video shot by local media, adding that she went home as Mohammad said he would stay with Basil. “I was still waking up this morning when I heard that special forces raided the hospital … They were killed while they were asleep,” the mother said. Ahmad Shawish, a friend of Mohammed, said he was a “very kind” person. “Mohammad was very loved,” Shawish told Al Jazeera from Jenin. “He would not let anyone get upset from him. If anyone of his friends or family were bothered, he would apologize and make things right even if it wasn’t his fault,” continued Shawish.    According to the medical staff one of the three Palestinians killed in the hospital was being treated for an injury received during a previous army raid months ago, Al Jazeera’s Stratford reported. “The Israeli army often surrounds and in some instances has attacked the three Palestinian hospitals in Jenin during nightly raids on the city,” he said. “But this is the first time they have entered a civilian medical facility in what seems to have been a well-planned, targeted assassination operation that Palestinian authorities are calling another violation of international law,” he added. Al Jazeera’s Rory Challands, reporting from occupied East Jerusalem, said that assailants were dressed as doctors, nurses and even civilians. “This unit comprised Israeli police and army personnel. They went up to the third floor of the hospital and shot three young Palestinians dead,” he said. “It does not look like there was any attempt to arrest these men. They were killed as they were sleeping,” he added. Violent clashes were reported in the area surrounding the hospital.  Since the beginning ofIsrael’s war on Gaza, Israeli forces have carried out raids and arrests in the occupiedWest Bankon a daily basis. Hundreds of people have beenkilled and arrestedsince Hamas’s October 7 attacks on Israel, in which about 1,140 people were killed and some 240 taken captive. Approximately 100 of thecaptives were returnedto Israel under a truce deal last November in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. At least 26,637 people have been killed and 65,387 wounded in Israeli attacks on Gaza.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/30/israel-troops-kill-three-palestinians-in-west-bank-hospital-ministry
ICC accuses Sudan and rebels of Darfur war crimes,Karim Khan moving ahead with investigation into atrocities committed in latest flare-up in 20-year conflict.,"Sudan’s army and its rival paramilitary force are committing war crimes in Darfur, the International Criminal Court’s (ICC) chief prosecutor has said. Karim Khan launched a war crimes investigation into the renewed conflict in July. On Monday, he reported to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) that he had “grounds to believe” crimes established under the Rome Statute are being committed in therestive western region. The situation is Darfur is “dire by any metric”,@IntlCrimCourtProsecutor@KarimKhanQCtold the UN Security Council, urging ambassadors not to lose sight of the individual human stories amid the millions affected by the brutal crimes and war Our story ➡️https://t.co/OBjGVloYxVpic.twitter.com/iPdiDh2dXc — UN News (@UN_News_Centre)January 29, 2024  The situation in Darfur is “dire by any metric”, he told the UNSC. The Rome Statute established the ICC in 2002 to investigate the world’s worst atrocities, including war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and crimes of aggression. “We are collecting a very significant body of material, information and evidence that is relevant to those particular crimes,” Khan said. Fighting broke out between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the paramilitaryRapid Support Forces(RSF) in April last year, the latest flare-up in a conflict that has been simmering for more than 20 years. The latest wave of violence has left nearly half of Sudan’s 49 million people requiring aid, with more than 7.5 million displaced. The UN reports that 12,000 people had been killed by the end of 2023, but the actual death toll is believed to be higher.  Khan, who recently visited refugee camps in neighbouring Chad that hold tens of thousands of refugees from Darfur, spoke of fears Darfur would become “the forgotten atrocity”. He urged Sudan’s military-led government to provide ICC investigators with multiple-entry visas and respond to 35 requests for assistance. Sudan plunged intochaoslast April when long-simmering tensions between the military, led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the RSF, commanded by Mohamed Hamdan “Hemedti” Dagalo, erupted into street battles in the capital, Khartoum, and other areas. The violence has extended from the earlier conflict that began in 2003, when rebels from the territory’s ethnic sub-Saharan African community launched an armed rebellion, accusing the Arab-dominated government in Khartoum of discrimination and neglect. The government, under then-President Omar al-Bashir, responded with aerial bombings and unleashed the militia group Popular Defence Forces, also known as the Janjaweed, which is accused of mass killings and rapes. Up to 300,000 people were killed and 2.7 million were driven from their homes. Internationally-brokered deals and peacekeeping forces have struggled to subdue the violence over the last two decades. In 2005, the UNSC referred the situation in Darfur to the ICC. Khan has said the court still has a mandate under that resolution to investigate crimes in the region. The prosecutor warned that the world must face “an ugly and inescapable truth” relating to its failure regarding the earlier conflict. “The failure of the international community to execute the warrants that have been issued by independent judges of the ICC has invigorated the climate of impunity and the outbreak of violence that commenced in April that continues today,” he said. “Without justice for past atrocities, the inescapable truth is that we condemn the current generation, and if we do nothing now, we condemn future generations to suffering the same fate,” Khan said. Responding to the claims, Sudan’s UN Ambassador Al-Harith Idriss al-Harith Mohamed insisted that the government had cooperated with the prosecutor’s office and was waiting for a visit from Khan. He accused the ICC of not taking into consideration its “strategic engagement and the operational realities on the ground”. Mohamed said the RSF “militia” is committing large-scale, systematic attacks which aim “to force ethnic cleansing and identity killing” of Darfur’s Masalit ethnic community. He said it is up to the prosecutor to determine if this amounts to genocide. The Sudanese ambassador said the armed forces do not call for war but are compelled to defend the country. He claimed that the military spares no effort to minimise collateral damage and comply with the laws of war. Last April, the first ICC trial to deal with atrocities by Sudanese government-backed forces in Darfur began in The Hague, Netherlands. The defendant, Popular Defence Forces leader Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-Al-Rahman – also known as Ali Kushayb – pleaded not guilty to 31 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Khan said he was pleased to report to the council that there has been “progress” in the ICC cases against former President al-Bashir and two senior government security officials during the 2003 Darfur conflict, Abdel-Rahim Muhammad Hussein and Ahmed Haroun. “We’ve received evidence that further strengthens those particular cases,” Khan said. The three have never been turned over to the ICC, and their whereabouts during the current conflict in Sudan remain unknown.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/30/icc-prosecutor-says-warring-parties-committing-crimes-in-darfur
"Qatar PM says ‘good progress’ in Gaza truce, captives negotiations","Doha says intelligence officials from Egypt, Israel and the US are working to secure a Gaza truce and the release of captives.","Qatar’s prime minister has said “good progress” was made during a meeting between intelligence officials from Egypt, Israel and the United States over the weekend to discuss a possible deal to secure a truce in the Israel-Hamas war and the release of captives held by Palestinian groups in Gaza. Spy chiefs from the three countries, which have been leading negotiations on agreements to pause fighting since the start of the war on October 7, met over the weekend in the French capital Paris. The sides discussed a potential deal that would include a phased truce that would see women and children released first and humanitarian aid entering the besieged Gaza Strip, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim al Thani confirmed on Monday. “We are hoping to relay this proposal to Hamas and to get them to a place where they engage positively and constructively in the process,” the prime minister said during an event hosted by the Atlantic Council in Washington, DC, the US. Qatar’s prime minister also said that Hamas had demanded a permanent ceasefire as a precondition to enter negotiations. “I believe we moved from that place to a place that potentially might lead to a ceasefire permanently in the future,” he said. Al Thani said that talks are “in a much better place than where we were a few weeks ago”. Around 240 people were taken hostage by Hamas on October 7 after the group’s fighters launched a surprise attack from Gaza on southern Israel, killing at least 1,139 people, according to Israeli figures. Israel responded with a devastating bombardment and ground invasion of Gaza, killing more than 26,600 people, according to Palestinian health officials. Qatar and the US led negotiations of a previous weeklong truce in late November that saw more than 100 captives released by Palestinian groups in Gaza and more than 200 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons released in exchange. Since then, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been under increasing pressure on multiple fronts, as families of the captives call for a deal to secure the return of their loved ones, as members of his far-right ruling coalition push for an escalation of the war, and as key ally the US has criticised Israel over thecivilian death tollin Gaza. Last week,Netanyahu rejected a proposal by Hamas to end the warand release captives in exchange for withdrawing Israeli forces, releasing prisoners and accepting the armed group’s governance of Gaza. The Israeli prime minister said that accepting Hamas’s conditions would mean leaving the armed group “intact” and that Israel’s soldiers had “fallen in vain”. He has often said that only a maximum pressure campaign would spur the group to release all the captives. The Qatari prime minister noted that his country is not “a superpower that can impose something on a party,” in response to earlier claims by Netanyahu that Qatar has failed to use its leverage to pressure Hamas. Doha hosts Hamas’s political office and is the main residence of senior political official Ismail Haniyeh. “We are using our good offices to connect, bridge gaps, to come up with some alternatives. And this way has worked,” he said, referring to previous mediations facilitated by Qatar.

"Israeli intelligence accuses UNRWA staff of kidnap, seizing body",Israeli intelligence dossier alleges that a dozen UN agency employees were involved in the October 7 attack on Israel.,"An Israeli intelligence document that prompted several countries to halt funds for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) includes allegations that some staff took part in abductions and killings during the Hamas-led attack against Israel on October 7. The Israeli dossier alleges that some 190 UNRWA employees, including teachers, have doubled as Hamas or Islamic Jihad fighters, the Reuters news agency reported. Palestinian officials have accused Israel of falsifying information to tarnish UNRWA. The UN has fired nine of the accused workers, condemned “the abhorrent alleged acts” and launchedan investigationinto the allegations. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres met the head of internal investigations at the world body to ensure an inquiry into the allegations “will be done swiftly and as efficiently as possible,” a UN spokesperson said on Monday. Hamas launched a surprise attack on southern Israel on October 7, killing at least 1,139 people and taking 240 others captive, according to Israeli figures. Israel responded to the attack with a devastating bombardment, siege and ground invasion of Gaza. More than 26,600 people have been killed in the Israeli assault on Gaza, according to Palestinian authorities, and vast areas of the territory have been reduced to rubble. The Israeli document listed 12 people, their alleged roles in the October 7 attack, job descriptions and photos. The findings detailed in the document could not be independently confirmed. The dossier said of the 12 workers, nine were teachers and one a social worker. Seven of the employees were accused of crossing into Israel on October 7. Of those, one was accused of taking part in a kidnapping, another of helping to abduct the body of a dead soldier and three others of participating in the attacks. One was accused of arming himself with an anti-tank missile the night before the attack, while the document claimed another took photos of a female hostage. Ten were listed as having ties to Hamas and one to the Islamic Jihad militant group. Two of the 12 have been killed, according to the document. The UN previously said one person was still being identified.    The allegations against UNRWA staffers ledseveral donor countries to freeze fundsfor the agency. UNRWA provides crucial day-to-day assistance for 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza who are living through a dire humanitarian catastrophe amid the Israeli assault. The agency said on Monday that it would not be able to continue operations in Gaza and across the region beyond the end of February if funding were not resumed. More than 10 countries, including major donors the United States, United Kingdom and Germany, have halted their funding to the agency. Some donor countries have said they would continue to fund UNRWA, while others have urged donors to resume their cooperation. Saudi Arabia urged the agency’s supporters to “carry out their role in supporting the humanitarian tasks toward Palestinian refugees”. Lebanon called the suspension of funding a “historic mistake”, and Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani said UNRWA should not be punished over claims against individual staff members. Since the war began, most Palestinians in Gaza have come to depend on the agency’s programmes for “sheer survival”, including food and shelter, UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini has said.    The allegations have stoked long-standing tensions between Israel and UNRWA. Israel says Hamas uses the agency’s facilities to store weapons and launch attacks. UNRWA says it does not knowingly tolerate such behaviour and has internal safeguards to prevent abuses and discipline any wrongdoing. Even before the latest allegations, Lazzarini had announced that he was ordering an external review of the agency’s operations and its safeguards. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said he had cancelled a Wednesday meeting between Israeli officials and Lazzarini, and called on the UNRWA head to resign.

"US, Britain announce sanctions on network that targeted critics of Iran",,"The United States and the United Kingdom have imposed sanctions on a network of people who targeted Iranian opposition activists for assassination under Iran’s orders, the US Treasury Department has said. The US Treasury said the network was directed by Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security and put sanctions on 11 people connected to it, including Iranian narcotics trafficker Naji Ibrahim Sharifi-Zindashti. “The Iranian regime’s continued efforts to target dissidents and activists demonstrate the regime’s deep insecurity and attempt to expand Iran’s domestic repression internationally,” said Brian Nelson, Treasury’s undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence. There was no immediate comment from Iran. The Treasury said that the network, led by Sharifi-Zindashti, had carried out assassinations and kidnappings across several jurisdictions to silence perceived critics of Tehran. The Treasury action freezes any US assets of those targeted and generally bans Americans from dealing with them. The Treasury said that in 2021 the network had recruited a Canadian national and British Columbia-based Hells Angels Outlaw Motorcycle Group member, Damion Patrick John Ryan, to assassinate individuals in the US who fled Iran. Ryan also allegedly recruited Canadian national and Hells Angels affiliate Adam Richard Pearson to carry out the murders, the Treasury said. Both are currently imprisoned abroad on unrelated charges. The sanctions come amid soaring tensions in the Middle East. The US and UK accused Iran-backed groups earlier on Monday of a drone attack in Jordan near the border with Syria that killed three US military personnel. Britain imposed sanctions on Iranian officials it said were involved in threats to kill journalists on British soil and others it said were part of international criminal gangs linked to Tehran. The UK Foreign Office said it would “sanction seven individuals and one organisation, including senior Iranian officials and members of organised criminal gangs who collaborate with the regime.” “The Iranian regime and the criminal gangs who operate on its behalf pose an unacceptable threat to the UK’s security,” British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said in a statement. “The UK and US have sent a clear message – we will not tolerate this threat,” he added.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/29/us-britain-announce-sanctions-on-network-that-targeted-critics-of-iran
Two vessels freed following Somali pirate hijackings,The rise in pirate activity off Somalia suggests the impact of the Gaza war continues to spread across the region.,"One Sri Lankan and one Iranian vessel are reported to have been freed following hijackings by Somali pirates. Seychelles forces rescued a Sri Lankan fishing boat on Monday, according to President Wavel Ramkalawan’s office. Meanwhile, the Indian Navy said it had freed an Iranian-flagged fishing vessel. The attacks on the vessels “by armed Somali pirates”, according to the Seychelles statement, raise further concerns over security in the region’s waters. Amid the war in Gaza, Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels have waged acampaigntargeting ships in the Red Sea. “Seychellois special military forces boarded the boat with utmost courage to take complete control of the vessel and rescue our Sri Lankan brothers,” the presidency said in the statement. Sri Lanka had earlier reported that diplomats were talking with Somali authorities trying to ascertain the whereabouts of a fishing vessel and its six crew members. The apparent abduction had come two weeks after Sri Lanka said it would join the US-led operation to protect merchant vessels sailing in the Red Sea against the Houthi attacks. Meanwhile, the Indian Navy announced that it had freed an Iranian fishing vessel hijacked off the coast of Somalia. “The fishing vessel had been boarded by pirates and the crew taken as hostages,” Indian Navy spokesman Commander Vivek Madhwal said, naming the vessel as the Iranian-flagged Iman. An Indian naval warship had “ensured the successful release of all 17 crew members along with the boat,” he added.    The suspected hijackings in waters off Somalia have raised concerns that Somali pirates have resumed activity, a decade after they caused chaos in international shipping. The hijacking of the Sri Lankan vessel occurred in international waters about 840 nautical miles (1,555km) east of Somalia, 1,100 nautical miles (2,040km) from Sri Lanka and north of Seychelles, Sri Lankan Navy spokesman Captain Gayan Wickramasuriya said. Two to three armed men had arrived in a 23m (75-foot) vessel, boarded the fishing trawler, fired shots apparently to warn away other fishing boats nearby, and taken away the fishing trawler and the fishermen, said Susantha Kahawatta, a top official in Sri Lanka’s Fisheries Department. Kahawatta added that all details of the abduction were provided by fishermen in the other trawlers, and they identified the attackers as Somali. Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels have launched scores of attacks in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden in response to Israel’s war in Gaza against the Palestinian militant group Hamas. International naval forces previously patrolling the Gulf of Aden have diverted north into the Red Sea in a bid to halt the attacks. That has sparkedfearsthat Somali pirates could seek to exploit the vacuum. A first successful case of Somali piracy since 2017 was recorded in December.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/29/somali-pirates-suspected-of-hijacking-a-sri-lankan-fishing-boat-with-6-crew
"What is Tower 22, the Jordan-based US outpost targeted in a drone strike?","An Iran-linked group claims attack on the US outpost, raising fears of Israel’s war on Gaza spilling over into regional conflict.","The United States military announced on Sunday that three US soldiers were killed and at least 34 were wounded in adrone attacktargeting Tower 22, a remote logistics outpost near the Jordan-Syrian border. The attack has elicited a strong reaction from Washington with President Joe Biden pledging to hold the attackers to account. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group of Iran-backed armed groups in the region, claimed the attacks, saying it was in response to US support to Israel’s war on Gaza, which has killed more than 26,000 people. Here is what we know about the drone strike and the attack site: Tower 22, which houses a small US logistics outpost, is located in Jordan’s northeast close to the borders with Iraq and Syria. Public information about the outpost is limited. However, according to media reports, Tower 22 serves as a supply hub for the nearby US garrison ofal-Tanflocated across the border in Syria. At least 350 US Army and Air Force soldiers are also stationed there. It is unclear what type of weapons are kept at the outpost and the nature of air defences used. Since the beginning ofSyria’s war in 2011, Washington has spent hundreds of millions of dollars tohelp Ammanset up an elaborate surveillance system known as the Border Security Programme to stem infiltration by armed fighters from Syria and Iraq. Al-Tanf, located on the Baghdad-Damascus highway, had been key in the fight against the ISIL (ISIS) armed group and has assumed a role as part of a US strategy to contain Iran’s military build-up in eastern Syria. Currently about 2,500 US troops are stationed in Iraq while 900 deployed in north-east Syria. Jordan has a close security pact with the US and is one of the few regional allies who hold extensive exercises with American troops. Jordan’s army is one of the largest recipients of Washington’s foreign military financing.  The killing of three US service members in an overnight drone strike is the first since Israel launched its brutal military campaign in Gaza on October 7, which has killed more than 26,000 people and triggered responses from regional armed groups. The unmanned aerial strike targeted the living quarters in Tower 22 wounding 34 soldiers, some of whom sustained minor cuts or brain trauma, according to media reports. The US military said that at least eight of the wounded soldiers were flown out of Jordan for treatment. Experts have raised questions about why the outpost’s air defences failed to detect the drone. The identity of the soldiers killed in the attack has not been released yet. President Bidensaid he will hold those responsible to account. “While we are still gathering the facts of this attack, we know it was carried out by radical Iran-backed militant groups operating in Syria and Iraq,”Bidensaid in a statement. Iran has denied it was behind the attack. “Iran had no connection and had nothing to do with the attack on the US base,” Tehran’s mission to the United Nations said in astatement on Mondaypublished by the state news agency IRNA. “There is a conflict between US forces and resistance groups in the region, which reciprocate retaliatory attacks.” Jordan condemned the “terrorist attack” and said it was cooperating with ally Washington to secure its frontier and “fight terrorism” on Sunday. Former US PresidentDonald Trumpalso condemned the attack, blaming it on the Biden administration: “This brazen attack on the United States is yet another horrific and tragic consequence of Joe Biden’s weakness and surrender.” US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell, as well as Senator Roger Wicke, all attributed the attack to Iran. Democratic leaders including Chuck Schumer, Jacky Rosen and Hakeem Jeffries also voiced in favour of holding those responsible accountable. Heartbroken and outraged by the death of three U.S. service members and the wounding of many others during the horrific terrorist attack in the Middle East. Praying hard for all affected. Every single malignant actor responsible must be held accountable. — Hakeem Jeffries (@RepJeffries)January 28, 2024  Israel’s Foreign Affairs Minister Israel Katz said: “We stand united in our values and battle against a common enemy. Their sacrifice will always be remembered. Rest in peace. Wishing a speedy recovery to the injured.” Egypt’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs also released a statement, affirming the country’s “strong condemnation of any terrorist acts that threaten the security and stability of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, expressing full solidarity with Jordan in this delicate situation”. The latest attack comes amid anincreasing risk of spilloverof the Gaza war as tensions rise and spread in the region. The US-based, non-profit think tank, Institute for the Study of War,reportedthat Iran-backed militias have launched over 170 attacks targeting US bases in Iraq and Syria since Israel’s war on Gaza in the wake of the deadly Hamas attack on October 7. On January 21, the US Central Command said that Iranian-backed groups attacked theAin al-Assad airbasein Iraq. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq has claimed responsibility for dozens of attacks against bases housing US troops in Iraq and Syria. The group said on Sunday that it will continue its attacks as a response to “the massacres committed by the Zionist entity [Israel] against our people in Gaza” on the “strongholds of the enemies.” Israel has been dragged to the International Court of Justice by South Africa over the accusations of genocide committed in Gaza.

On Monday, the Houthis said they launched a rocket at US warship Lewis B Puller as it sailed through the Gulf of Aden a day earlier. Those attacks have disrupted one of the busiest shipping routes in the world. The groups – a part of the so-called “axis of resistance” – have targeted Washington for its military support to Israel in its war on Gaza. Reporting from Tehran, Al Jazeera’s Resul Serdar saidIran does not want a regional escalation. “The Iranian officials know a direct military confrontation with Israel also means a war with the US which could be a deadly one for Iran,” he said. While Washington has maintained its official stance that it is not at war in the region, it has been retaliating against the Iran-backed groups in Iraq and Syria and carrying out strikes against Yemen’s Houthi military capabilities. Colin Clarke, senior research fellow at the Soufan Group, told Al Jazeera that these attacks show that there was a “regional war”. “There is no denying that. US troops have been killed and the US will respond forcefully whether that is in Iran proper or against the Iranian proxies in the various countries where they operate,” he told Al Jazeera.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/29/what-is-tower-22-the-jordan-based-us-outpost-targeted-in-a-drone-strike
"Dozens killed as violence flares in region disputed by Sudan, South Sudan",It was the deadliest incident in a spate of attacks since 2021 in the oil-rich Abyei border region.,"Dozens are reported to have been killed in attacks in a disputed region between Sudan and South Sudan. Overall, 52 people, including women and children, died in the Abyei region during the weekend, local officials said on Monday. Both Sudan and South Sudan claim the oil-rich region along their shared border. Bulis Koch, the information minister for Abyei, reported that armed youth from South Sudan’s Warrap state carried out raids into neighbouring Abyei on Saturday. It was the deadliest incident in a spate of attacks since 2021 related to the boundary dispute. As well as those killed, 64 people were wounded in the attack. A Ghanaian peacekeeper from the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA) was killed when its base in Agok town was attacked amid the violence, the UN force said on Sunday. “Because of the current dire security situation at hand, which has created fears and panic, we have imposed a curfew,” Koch said. Tensions have soared amidrecent clashes in Abyeibetween rival factions of the Dinka ethnic group related to the location of an administrative boundary that is a source of significant tax revenues. Koch said Dinka youth from Warrap and the forces of a rebel leader from the Nuer ethnic group carried out the attacks against Dinkas and Nuers in Abyei. Hundreds of civilians are now sheltering at a UNISFA base. William Wol, Warrap state’s information minister, said his government would coordinate a joint investigation with the Abyei administration to look into the deadly incident.    Between 2013 and 2018, civil war in South Sudan killed thousands as fighting flared between Dinkas and Nuers. Clashes between various armed groups have continued to kill and displace large numbers of civilians, especially after South Sudan deployed troops to Abyei last March. The Abyei region’s ownership status wasleft unresolvedafter South Sudan became independent from Sudan in 2011. An African Union panel proposed a referendum for the oil-rich territory but there was disagreement over who could vote.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/29/52-people-killed-in-attack-in-disputed-region-between-sudan-and-south-sudan
Israeli ministers join gathering calling for resettlement of Gaza,The far-right conference urges the government to set up new Jewish settlements in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.,"Several members of the Israeli government joined a far-right conference calling for the resettlement of the Gaza Strip and occupied West Bank. The conference, organised by the right-wing Nahala organisation on Sunday night and dubbed “Settlement Brings Security and Victory”, called for new Jewish settlements to be built in the Palestinian territories. The call of the politicians and activists gathering in occupied East Jerusalem came amid international pressure on Israel to confirm it would respect Palestinian statehood after its war on Gaza ends. Israel withdrew its military and settlers from the Gaza Strip in 2005 after a 38-year occupation. Debate is ongoing over who will run the enclave following the end of the war that started after the October 7 Hamas attacks on Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel does not intend to maintain a permanent presence again but insists that Israel will maintain security control for an indefinite period. Israel’s international partners, led by the United States, have said a two-state solution is the only way that would guarantee security for both sides. Netanyahu, facing significant political pressure, is resisting, although he has not presented a clear plan of what his government envisages for the future. Israel’s Channel 12 reported that 12 ministers from Netanyahu’s Likud party attended the conference. His far-right coalition partners, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, reiterated calls for Palestinians to be removed from Gaza. Smotrich said many of the children who were evacuated had returned as soldiers to fight in a war with Hamas. He said he stood against the government’s decision to evacuate Jewish settlements from Gaza in the past. “We knew what that would bring and we tried to prevent it,” Smotrich said in a speech. “Without settlements, there is no security.” The crowd roared with enthusiastic chants to rebuild the settlements. Ben-Gvir said he had protested against the evacuation of Jewish settlements from Gaza and warned it would bring “rockets upon Sderot” and “rockets upon Ashkelon” in southern Israel. “We yelled and we warned,” Ben-Gvir said. “If [we] don’t want another October 7, we need to return home and control the land.” “There is no way to win that war without the rebuild[ing] of Gush Katif and the Gaza Strip. It should be flourished with Jewish villages and Jewish cities,” Moshe Feiglin, a former member of Knesset, said at the conference. “That’s the only way to win this bloody war. And Israel cannot afford not to win that war,” he added. Some Israeli politicians condemned the meeting, and the participation of government ministers. Gadi Eisenkot, a former army chief of staff and a current member of the Knesset and Netanyahu’s war cabinet, said that the meeting would “sharpen divisions over that which brings us together” at a time when Israeli soldiers are “fighting shoulder to shoulder in a war with unparalleled justification”. Education Minister Yoav Kisch told Israeli Army Radio that the timing of the conference was off. “It’s not right to get into this conversation now,” he said. “We need to focus the discourse on unity for our troops.” The Jewish settlements that have spread throughout the occupied West Bank are classified asillegalby international law and humanitarian groups. They are also often the cause of clashes between armed settlers and Palestinians. Human rights groups and many governments frequentlycondemnarmed settlerviolencetargeting Palestinians. Israel’sexpansionistsettlement policy also hinders the envisaged future of a two-state solution. “In this conference, 12 Israeli ministers participated, including members of Netanyahu’s Likud party, additionally, 15 members of the Israeli Knesset participated, so it’s not a joke,” Mariam Barghouti, Palestinian-American activist and researcher, told Al Jazeera in an interview. “These are the people who are making policy in Israel, and these are the people who were calling for the ethnic cleansing of Gaza, complete ethnic cleansing of the people of Gaza.”    The Palestinian Authority (PA) condemned the conference, saying it reflects the leanings of the Israeli right to destabilise the region. “The colonial meeting in Jerusalem poses a blatant challenge to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) decision, accompanied by public incitement to forcibly displace Palestinians,” the Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriate said in a statement, referring to last week’s ICJ verdict that called on Israel to prevent “genocide” in Gaza. US news website Axios, quoting unnamed informed sources, reported on Monday that senior national security officials from Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt and the PA secretly met in Riyadh to discuss post-war Gaza. The meeting apparently called on the PA to revitalise its political leadership in Gaza, which is currently run by Hamas. The gathering, on which Israel and the US were reportedly briefed, illustrates the growing support of Arab states for a solution centred on the relatively moderate PA taking control following a post-war transition period. Saudi Arabia’s national security adviser said at the meeting that the kingdom is still interested in moving forward with normalisation with Israel in return for steps that would create a path towards a Palestinian state, even if such a state is not established immediately. Israel’s war on Gazahas killed more than 26,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, destroyed vast swaths of the enclave, and displaced nearly 85 percent of the territory’s people. The October 7 Hamas attack in southern Israel killed about 1,140 people and fighters took about 250 captives, according to Israel. About 100 of them were returned in a deal with Hamas last November in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/29/israeli-ministers-join-gathering-calling-for-rebuilding-settlements-in-gaza
Iranian FM in Pakistan to mend ties following mutual air strikes,Tehran and Islamabad have moved to de-escalate amid high concern that the Gaza war could spill out across region.,"Iran’s foreign minister arrived in Pakistan as the two countries seek to calm tensions, which have risen amid the conflict in Gaza. Hossein Amirabdollahian landed in Islamabad before dawn on Monday for “in-depth talks” with Pakistani counterpart, Jalil Abbas Jilani, Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. Tehran and Islamabad are seeking to calm relations after carrying out tit-for-tat air strikes on each other’s territories earlier this month. The attacks, which each country claimed targeted terrorists in border regions and killed at least 11 people, came as Israel’s bombardment of Gazaescalated tensionacross the region. However, the elevated threat of a full-blown conflict appeared to send Islamabad and Tehran scrambling to pull back and rebuild diplomatic relations. The two ministers insisted following their meeting that close relations between Pakistan and Iran are an important source of stability for the region, and resolved to expand political and security cooperation. Both spoke of respect for one another’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. The pair agreed to confront the “menace of terrorism” together, especially in the mountainous region on their shared border, which was the location of both air strikes. They also pledged to lift the regions economically. Iran’s Amirabdollahian added that “terrorists” in the border areas are supported by third countries. He did not offer any details on the claim. Western countries accuse Tehran of supporting several groups that they designate as terrorist. Iran’s foreign minister is also set to meet Pakistan’s caretaker Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar during his visit. Amirabdollahian said that Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi will visit Pakistan soon, adding that a date was yet be determined.    Iran and Pakistan have long beenwary of armed groupsin their borderlands, and it is thought that internal political pressures, as well as the spillover of Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza, helped push them over the edge. Tension reached a nadir on January 17, when Iran struck a target in Pakistan’s southwestern Balochistan province. Tehran said it was a hideout for anti-Iran armed group Jaish al-Adl (the Army of Justice). Pakistan said two children were killed and three others were injured. Islamabad, in retaliation, recalled its ambassador from Tehran. Two days later it launched an air strike against what it alleges were hideouts of armed groups in Iran’s Sistan-Baluchestan province. Pakistan said it targeted Baloch groups with separatist aims, in an attack that killed at least nine people. The attacks sent concern spiking regarding a regional escalation of the Gaza war. Iran and Pakistan,however, quickly made a joint decision tode-escalate tensionsand resume diplomatic links, with their respective ambassadors returning to their posts and Amirabdollahian’s visit arranged. During his trip, the Iranian official will also discuss Saturday’skilling of nine Pakistani labourersby gunmen in Iran’s Sistan-Baluchestan province, which Islamabad called “horrifying and despicable”. The families of the victims rallied on Sunday to demand their bodies be brought home. Pakistan has said that arrangements are being made with Iran’s help.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/29/irans-top-diplomat-visits-pakistan-to-ease-tensions-after-joint-strikes
Iran executes four convicted of Israeli bomb plot,The defendants were accused of plotting a bomb attack on a factory making military equipment.,"Iran has executed four men it says were linked to an Israeli intelligence operation. The death sentences were carried out on Monday after the Supreme Court rejected appeals, according to Iranian state media. The quartet was accused of planning a bomb attack ordered by Israel’s Mossad agency. “The death sentence of four members of a group affiliated with the Zionist spy organisation … was carried out this morning,” the Iranian judiciary’s website Mizan Online reported. Hengaw, a Norway-based Kurdish rights group, accused Iranian authorities of an unfair trial. “Throughout the trial, the prisoners were denied their basic rights to legal representation, visits and even communication with theirfamilies,” Hengaw wrote in a statement cited by the dpa news agency. The confessions of the men, who it identified as Kurds, were forced under torture, the group alleged. Credible source close to the families of the four executed Kurdish political prisoners revealed to Hengaw that Pejman Fatehi, Mohsen Mazloum, Vafa Azarbar, and Mohammad Faramarzi, throughout their detention for over 18 months, were denied the opportunity to meet with anyone…pic.twitter.com/YQVt0oUFWg — Hengaw Organization for Human Rights (@Hengaw_English)January 29, 2024  The men were convicted of illegally entering Iran from Iraq’s northern Kurdish region to attack a factory in the central city of Isfahan that produces equipment for the Ministry of Defence and Armed Forces Logistics. The operation was planned for summer 2022 but was averted by Iranian intelligence. Iran and Israel are longtime foes. They are currently locked in a row over Iran’s nuclear programme. Israel accuses Iran of backing armed groups, such as Hamas and Hezbollah, with which it is fighting. Iran says Israel has carried out a number of killings of Iranian officials and scientists, accusations that Tel Aviv neither confirms nor denies. Iran executes more people per year than any other country except China, according to Amnesty, and usually does so by hanging. In late December, itput to deaththree men and one woman convicted for alleged links to Mossad. Last week, Mohammed Ghobadlou, an Iranian man sentenced for his participation in antigovernment protests in late 2022 wasexecuted. Critics said the defendant had suffered from mental health issues. “We are alarmed by reports of unfair trial proceedings in the case of Mr Ghobadlou, as well as in other cases, which fell far short of due process and fair trial standards required by international human rights law by which Iran is bound,” experts from UN’s human rights agency after the sentence was carried out. “We are dismayed by the unprecedented rise in executions in Iran and note that at least 834 people were executed in 2023, including 8 people associated with the nationwide protests,” the experts said. “We urge the Iranian government to stop this horrific wave of executions.” United Nations human rights chief Volker Turk said last year that Iran had an“abominable” track recordof executions, with an average of more than 10 people hanged each week.

"Two brothers shot by Israeli forces in Khan Younis, white flag ignored","The Barbakh family followed Israeli army orders to evacuate, only to have two of their sons die in a hail of bullets.","Khan Younis, Gaza– “Amal” in Arabic means hope, the kind of name given to a new neighbourhood to encourage people to move there and dream of their families growing up there. But last week, what weak glimmers of hope the Barbakh family had that they would make it out of al-Amal alive were quickly dashed when Israeli sniper fire took the lives of two of their sons. The two boys were waving a white flag. Al Jazeera’s Sanad verification agency has investigated the crime in which 13-year-old Nahedh and 20-year-old Ramez Barbakh were shot to death by sniper fire. On the morning of Wednesday, January 24, the Barbakhs were getting ready to leave al-Amal, west of Khan Younis, and move further south as they had been ordered to do by the leaflets dropping on their neighbourhood since the day before and by announcements by Avichay Adraee, the Arabic-language spokesman for the Israeli army. “We didn’t know what to do,” the boys’ mother Islam told Al Jazeera. “In the beginning, we weren’t even sure about these evacuation orders because we hadn’t seen them ourselves. We were trying to lay low in our house and keep everybody safe. “But finally we realised that we would have to go and started trying to come up with a plan. My husband and sons thought maybe we could break a rear wall and go out that way, because we could hear that there was firing outside.” Eventually, though, the couple decided that the best way would be the most direct: they would walk out of their house with a white flag and make their way to al-Mawasi as directed. #عاجل🔴🔴 الى سكان منطقة خان يونس في أحياء النصر، الأمل، مركز المدينة والمخيم (المعسكر) في بلوكات 107-112: من أجل سلامتكم عليكم الانتقال فورًا إلى المنطقة الإنسانية في المواصي عن طريق شارع البحرpic.twitter.com/K4MtDeKMSR — افيخاي ادرعي (@AvichayAdraee)January 24, 2024  Translation: #URGENT to the residents of Khan Younis in the neighbourhoods of al-Nasser, al-Amal, town centre and the camp, in blocks 107-112: For your own safety, you must move immediately to the humanitarian zone in al-Mawasi via the coastal road. “I called Nahedh over,” said Mohamed-Adel, their father. “I gave him a white cloth to wave above his head as a white flag. I thought, there’s no way anybody would want to hurt a child or would be scared of a child.” As the rest of the family was bundling together the last of their belongings that they thought they could take with them, Nahedh took a few cautious steps out of the front door, waving his white flag overhead and walking cautiously out to the corner so he could look at the main road to see which way his family should go. According to what the family told Al Jazeera, as Nahedh took a few steps out of the door, he was shot in the legs and fell to the ground. His father called to him from within the house’s doorway, coaxing his little boy to get up just a little bit and try to get back into the house. When Nahedh got up to try to make it back into the house, he was shot twice more, in the back and in the head. His brother Ahmed, 18, told Al Jazeera that the shooting was coming from the direction of al-Katiba about 400 metres [1,312 feet] away, an area where Sanad was able to confirm Israeli military activity on the day in question. Seeing what had happened to his little brother, Ramez ran out of the house to try to pull him out of harm’s way. He was shot in the heart and fell on his stricken brother, white flag and all. Islam was unable to comprehend what had befallen her family, paralysed with anguish as she looked out of her window at her two sons lying crumpled on the road. “I kept hoping that they were still alive, that there was some breath in them,” she said. “I couldn’t think of anything other than ‘I want my children, I want my children.’ “I’m not sure how I stayed inside the house, but all I remember is screaming out of the window at anyone I saw on the other side of the street, asking them to help, to do anything. “They didn’t do anything, they couldn’t. Whenever I called out to someone, my husband and sons would shush me any way they could. They were there to kill people,” she continued. The family could not approach the bodies of Nahedh and Ramez and eventually had to flee the neighbourhood without knowing what became of them. “They were just there, in the street, all day,” said Islam. “When we left we couldn’t remove their bodies nor could we even stop to check on them. There was constant shooting.” Only one photo survives of that crime. It was snapped by Ahmed, the boys’ brother, who told Al Jazeera he “took a photo of my murdered brothers so I never forget them, and to document this crime that was committed, the crime of shooting a child who is carrying a white flag and then shooting his brother who rushes out to save him”. The Sanad investigation pinpointed the exact location where Ramez and Nahedh were targeted by Israeli snipers, near the Harun ar-Rashid school in al-Amal, also known as “Block 109” on the map the Israeli army released of Gaza. According to the testimonies, the boys were shot at about 10:30am on January 24 and Ahmed managed to take a photo of their bodies between 1 and 1:30pm, based on the shadows in the photo. In the photo of the slain brothers, bloodstains are apparent on the white flag Nahedh was carrying. The family never got to evacuate all together. Instead, they grieved for their children while breaking through their home’s wall to cross other streets and houses, running from one sheltered spot to another until they reached the coastal road in Khan Younis. To date, they know nothing about the bodies of Nahedh and Ramez.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/29/two-brothers-shot-by-israeli-forces-in-khan-younis-white-flag-ignored
Iran denies involvement in drone attack that killed 3 US soldiers in Jordan,Tehran says it has ‘no connection’ to attack on logistics support base near Jordan-Syria border.,"Iran has denied involvement in adrone attack in Jordanthat killed three US military personnel and injured dozens of others, state media has reported. US President Joe Biden and UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron have blamed Iran-backed groups for Sunday’s attack near the border with Syria. “As we have clearly stated before, the resistance groups in the region are responding [to] the war crimes and genocide of the child-killing Zionist regime and… they do not take orders from the Islamic Republic of Iran,” Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Nasser Kanaani was quoted saying by IRNA on Monday. “These groups decide and act based on their own principles and priorities as well as the interests of their country and people.” Kanaani said claims of Iranian involvement were motivated by “specific political goals to reverse the realities of the region” and were “influenced by third parties, including the child-killing Zionist regime”. Iran’s mission to the United Nations also said in a statement carried by IRNA that Tehran had “no connection and had nothing to do” with the attack, which it blamed on “conflict between US forces and resistance groups in the region”. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella organisation of Iran-backed armed groups, has claimed responsibility for the attack. The drone strike on Tower 22, a logistics support base, marked the first loss of American life by enemy fire since the start of the war in Gaza. Biden, who has staunchly backed Israel’s war in Gaza, condemned the “despicable and wholly unjust attack” and has vowed to hold all those responsible “to account at a time and in a manner [of] our choosing”. Washington has accused Iranian-backed groups of carrying out dozens of attacks on US military installations in Iraq and Syria since the start of the war.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/29/chk_irandeniesinvolvement-in-drone-attack-that-killed-3-us-troops-in-jordan
Australia’s pro-Palestinian activists to continue targeting Israeli ships,A blockade eventually broken up by police stopped the Israeli-owned ZIM Ganges from reaching a Melbourne port for days.,"Melbourne, Australia– Ports have emerged as the centre of pro-Palestine rallies in Australia as protesters target Israeli ships, and vessels alleged to have links with the country. Last week, dozens of people attempted to stop the ZIM Ganges container ship from reaching the Port of Melbourne, with police eventually deploying pepper spray to break up the blockade against a backdrop of shipping containers and cranes, the familiar symbols of a global industrialised world. Dozens were arrested after the picket blocked access to the wharf and forced the Victorian International Container Terminal (VICT) to close. Voluntary legal observers (MALS) who were accompanying the protesters say they were met by about 200 police, some of whom were on horseback. Tasnim Mahmoud Sammak of the community organisation Free Palestine Melbourne was at the blockade, which lasted for four days. “I have family in Gaza and they have nowhere to go in the bombarded prison it has become,” she said. Sofia Sabbagh, a prolific Melbourne-based Palestinian artist, was also there for the final showdown. “They circled us forming lines, intimidating us,” she told Al Jazeera, saying the group complied with a request to move on to avoid arrest. The legal observers say the crowd was not threatening and people were just chanting. “Once we were on public property, police pushed us away from our medical supplies and gear, pulling one person out of a wheelchair and pushing over a lot of other people, pepper spraying over 20 people,” Sabbagh added. “I was traumatised seeing a person being dragged out of their wheelchair.” Victoria Police said the use of pepper spray was in response to the “dynamic nature” of the blockade and the threat of “aggressive” protesters. After the dozen or so arrests, the exhausted enclave of activists descended onto Sandridge Beach. There, Declan Furber Gillick, a representative from the revolutionary group the Black People’s Union gave an impassioned final speech calling for the continued disruption of the military-industrial complex through the use of “peaceful, people-powered, revolutionary tactics” before the group disbanded and went home. The blockade was established at the port on the afternoon of January 19, a few hours before the ZIM Ganges, which sails under the Portuguese flag, was scheduled to dock in Melbourne, Australia’s second-biggest city. ZIM shipping was founded in 1945 as part of Israel’s quest for statehood, initially helping Holocaust survivors travel to the new state of Israel. Now one of the world’s largest container shipping companies, ZIM has drawn protests since Chief Executive Eli Glickman promised to fulfil all of Israel’s needs after the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on October 7 andIsrael’s declaration of war on Gaza. Port Melbourne handles about 8,850 containers a day and is Australia’s largest commercial port. The protests had “effectively halted operations” for almost four days, VICT said in a press release after the police ended the picket. The ragtag gang of activists worked in shifts, blocking six consecutive shifts of port workers from entering the terminal and forcing the ZIM Ganges to anchor in the bay until it was finally able to enter the port at about midnight on January 21. The blockade was originally organised by a group called Unionists for Palestine (U4P) but, as the days went by, attracted wider interest. By January 20, it had become a broad coalition of Palestinian, First Nations and antiwar groups. U4P member Fiona Healey said the picket was aimed at disrupting the company’s supply chain as it continued to “support and supply an apartheid regime”. This was reiterated by fellow community organiser John Smith. “We targeted the port of Melbourne in solidarity with Palestinians call to disrupt all companies complicit with the ongoing genocide in Gaza – and that includes ZIM shipping,” Smith said. Maritime Union Australia (MUA) members, such as dock workers, were advised not to cross the picket due to health and safety concerns. Many dock workers, who would have been escorted onto the terminal by police, refused to cross the picket line. An online fundraiser raised more than 25,000 Australian dollars ($16,469) for the workers, who were initially not paid for the days they did not work, but the money was redirected to Gaza relief efforts after the union secured pay for the dock workers. Ben Hjorth from U4P told Al Jazeera that the movement was linked to a broader “anti-war” cause within the Australian trade union movement. He referenced NelsonMandela’s 1990 speechin Melbourne, thanking Australian workers for leading the world in boycotting ships to apartheid-era South Africa. Hjorth cited those radical but successful MUA industrial actions as a source of inspiration, adding: “Sometimes you have to break the law to change it.” VICT Chief Executive Bruno Porchietto told Australian media outlet Channel 7 that the four-day picket had probably cost the port about “50,000 containers”, and Victoria “millions of dollars”. But the state’s treasurer, Tim Pallas, downplayed the blockade’s financial impact, saying the brief protest would only “minimally affect” the economy in the long run. As the ZIM Ganges finally came into the dock, some protesters were following it online through the vesselfinder.com tracking site. They say the ship disabled its GPS tracking as it came into port, noting the two tug boats accompanying it did not, leaving a gap where the ZIM Ganges was. “This is highly unusual behaviour,” said U4P’s Hjorth. Under Australian maritime law, ships can only disable their GPS tracking for safety and security reasons. Since the protests, other ships have been able to dock in Melbourne without disruption. But the threat of action remains.    Hjorth said the group aims to disrupt Israeli supply chains until there is a “permanent ceasefire in Gaza and an end to the occupation”. On Monday, the ZIM Ganges was due to arrive in Sydney, where protesters held a rally last November targeting another ZIM vessel. The shipping line’s schedule shows it is also due to travel further up the eastern coast to Brisbane.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/29/australias-pro-palestinian-activists-to-continue-targeting-israeli-ships
UK says it thwarted Houthis’ drone attack in the Red Sea,"UK says Houthis attacked British military vessel in the Red Sea, resulting in no damage and no injuries.","A UK vessel shot down a Houthi drone in the Red Sea, the United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defence has said, as tensions in the Middle East soar amid the ongoing war in Gaza. “Yesterday HMS Diamond successfully repelled a drone attack from the Iranian-backed Houthis in the Red Sea,” read a statement from the ministry published on Sunday on X. “Diamond destroyed a drone targeting her, with no injuries or damage sustained to Diamond or her crew,” it added. There was no immediate comment from the Houthis. The Yemen-based group previously pledged to target Israel-linked vessels in the region as part of an effort to pressure the country’s government to end its bombardment of Gaza and allow more humanitarian aid supplies into the coastal Palestinian enclave. Gaza has been under heavy bombardment by Israeli forces since October 7, when Hamas fighters stormed communities in southern Israel, killing at least 1,139 people and taking about 240 others captive, according to Israeli officials. At least 26,400 people in Gaza have been killed in the Israeli assault since, according to Palestinian authorities in the territory. Houthi attacks in the Red Sea have caused major disruption to global commerce as the area is a key artery for maritime trade. Some of the world’s largest shipping companies have suspended operations in the region, instead sending their cargo vessels on a longer route around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, slowing trade between Asia and Europe. In response to the Houthi strikes on dozens of commercial vessels, the UK and United Stateslaunched multiple air raidstargeting Houthi military positions, including missile depots and launcher sites, in Yemen. The US alsore-designated the Houthis as a “terrorist” organisation. US President Joe Biden had delisted the group in 2021. The Houthis responded to the strikes by expanding the threat to any US and UK-linked vessels in the region. The Houthi have seized large swathes of northern Yemen since launching an offensive against the government in 2014. The war forced internationally recognised Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and his cabinet to relocate to the southern port city of Aden, while it also triggered a brutal air bombing campaign led by Saudi Arabia. A truce has been in place since April 2022 as talks progressed between the Houthis and Riyadh over a permanent ceasefire.

"Three US service members killed in Jordan drone attack, Biden says","The US military says three killed, at least 34 others injured in the attack on US forces in northeastern Jordan.","Three US service members have been killed and at least 34 others wounded in a drone attack in northeast Jordan near the Syrian border, the United States military has said. “While we are still gathering the facts of this attack, we know it was carried out by radical Iran-backed militant groups operating in Syria and Iraq,” President Joe Biden said in a statement on Sunday. He said the US “will hold all those responsible to account at a time and in a manner [of] our choosing”.  The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group of Iran-backed armed groups, claimed attacks targeting three bases, including one on the Jordan-Syria border. Jordan condemned on Sunday the “terrorist attack” on a military advance post just inside its border with Syria and said it was cooperating with Washington to secure its frontier. In the first official statement on the attack, US ally Jordan said it was working with Washington to “fight terrorism”. Earlier, Jordanian state television quoted Muhannad Mubaidin, a spokesperson for Jordan’s government, as saying the attack happened outside of the kingdom across the border in Syria. The deaths are the first for US troops in the Middle East since Israel’s war on Gaza began on October 7. The attack comes amid soaring tensions in the region, where Israel continues its war on Gaza in response to an attack by the Palestinian group Hamas in southern Israel that killed at least 1,139 people, according to Israeli authorities. Israel’s subsequent assault on Gaza has killed more than 26,400 people, according to Palestinian officials in the besieged territory. Fears have grown about the possibility of a regional conflagration amidattacks from Yemen’s Houthi rebelson Red Sea shipping and near-daily rounds ofcross-border fire between Israeland the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah. In recent weeks, Iran-backed armed groups haveintensified their attackson US military bases in Iraq and neighbouring Syria in response to the Israeli military campaign in the Gaza Strip. The Iran-backed groups have called their strikes as retaliation for Washington’s support for the Israeli war on Gaza and say they aim to push US forces out of the region. The US in recent months has struck targets in Iraq, Syria and Yemen to respond to attacks on American forces in the region and to deter Iranian-backed Houthi rebels from continuing to threaten commercial shipping in the Red Sea.    Reporting from Tehran, Al Jazeera’s Resul Serdar said there have been more than 100 attacks on US military installations in the Middle East since Israel launched its assault on Gaza. “Iran’s position so far … has been quite clear. They say that these attacks are not conducted and planned by Iran. They say that Iran has allies across the region. However, these allies also make decisions based on their own decisions,” he said. “Iranians do not want a regional escalation. The Iranian officials know a direct military confrontation with Israel also means a war with the US which could be a deadly one for Iran.” Colin Clarke, senior research fellow at the Soufan Group, told Al Jazeera that these attacks show that there was a “regional war”. “There is no denying that. US troops have been killed and the US will respond forcefully whether that is in Iran proper or against the Iranian proxies in the various countries where they operate,” he said. “Iran can choose to distance itself as much as it wants, but it funds, trains and equips these groups … The Biden administration will be under immense pressure to show the US is not going to sit back and watch its troops being killed by these Iranian-backed groups.” “The question now becomes what shape this response will take,” Clarke said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/28/three-us-service-members-killed-in-jordan-drone-attack-biden-says
"Which countries have cut funding to UNRWA, and why?","The UN urges continued funding to UNRWA’s ‘lifesaving’ aid in Gaza, after several Western countries cut aid to the agency.","The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), considered a lifeline for two million people in the besieged enclave, has suffered funding cuts after several of its staff were accused by Israel of involvement in the October 7 Hamas attack. The UN on Saturday said that it had terminated nine out of 12 staff over the allegations and vowed to hold its employees accountable, but expressed its shock at the swift funding cut by several Western countries amid a humanitarian disaster in Gaza, which has been devastated by nearly four months of Israel’s aerial and ground war. “It would be immensely irresponsible to sanction an Agency and an entire community it serves because of allegations of criminal acts against some individuals, especially at a time of war, displacement and political crises in the region,” Philippe Lazzarini, UNRWA chief, said in a statement on Saturday. The UN and Palestinian officials havecalled for continued fundingfor the agency’s “crucial work” since the announcement of the claims on Friday. Here is what you need to know about the controversy.  The acronym stands for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. It was established in 1949 to cater to tens of thousands of Palestinians ethnically cleansed from their homes by Jewish militias from areas that currently form part of Israel. The UN agency operates in the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza, as well as in Jordan, Lebanon and Syria – the neighbouring countries where the Palestinian refugees took shelter after their violent expulsion known as the Nakba or catastrophe. According to its website, the UN agency supports the relief and human development of Palestinian refugees, working in a number of areas. Examples of these fields are primary and vocational education, primary healthcare, relief and social services, infrastructure and camp improvement, microfinance, and emergency response. The agency is funded almost entirely by voluntary contributions apart from a limited subsidy from the UN, which is used exclusively for administrative costs, according to UNRWA.  The work of UNRWA could not be carried out without sustained contributions from countries worldwide and the European Union, which represented 94.9 percent of all contributions in 2022, the agency says. In 2022, 44.3 percent of the agency’s total pledges, or $1.17bn, came from the EU member states, who contributed $520.3m, including funds allocated by the institution via the European Commission. The United States, Germany, the EU and Sweden were the largest individual donors in the year in question, contributing 61.4 percent of the agency’s overall funding in total. Chris Gunness, a former UNRWA spokesman, said the UN agency has weeks only before it runs out of money for its crucial aid work to save Palestinian lives in Gaza. More than 26,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel launched its offensive on October 7. “My message to the Arab world, particularly to the Gulf, is where are you? Because they’re making billions each day on oil revenues. A tiny fraction of those oil revenues would see UNRWA’s financial problems disappear overnight. This unconscionable gap inflicted by these Western countries would be filled very quickly,” Gunness told Al Jazeera. “Some of the most desperate people in the Middle East are now facing starvation, they’re facing famine, and the Arab states need to step up to the plate.”    The UNRWA said on Friday that the Israeli authorities have provided the agency with information about the alleged involvement of several UNRWA employees in the October 7 attack. Lazzarini, the head of the UNRWA, said that he immediately terminated the contracts of these staff members and launched an investigation to establish the truth without delay. The US Department of State said it was extremely troubled by the allegations, which it said pertained to 12 UNRWA employees. The UN agency has long been under attack from Israel. On Saturday, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz called on Lazzarini to quit his post.    “Mr Lazzarini please resign,” Katz wrote on social media platform X in response to the UNRWA chief’s warning over the consequences of funding cuts. Gunness, the former UNRWA spokesman, said there is a “coordinated political attack” on the UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees. “The Israelis have said they cannot win the war on Gaza unless UNRWA is disbanded. So what clearer signal do you want?” he told Al Jazeera on Sunday.  The UNRWA is the largest humanitarian actor in Gaza and some 3,000 of its core staff out of 13,000 in Gaza continue to report to work despite the war, according to the agency. UNRWA’s Lazzarinisaidtwo million people out of about 2.3 million population in Gaza depend on the agency’s humanitarian operation. “I am shocked such decisions are taken based on alleged behavior of a few individuals and as the war continues, needs are deepening & famine looms,” the UNRWA chief posted on X. “Palestinians in Gaza did not need this additional collective punishment. This stains all of us.” The UN official added that the agency runs shelters for over one million people and provides food and primary healthcare even at theheight of the hostilities. Meanwhile, UN chief Antonio Guterres said that the tens of thousands of people who work for the UNRWA, many in some of the most dangerous situations, should not be penalised because of the recent allegations. “The dire needs of the desperate populations they serve must be met,” he said. UNRWA lifesaving assistance is about to end following countries decisions to cut their funding to the Agency. Our humanitarian operation, on which 2 million people depend as a lifeline in Gaza, is collapsing. I am shocked such decisions are taken based on alleged behavior of a… — Philippe Lazzarini (@UNLazzarini)January 27, 2024  The wave of suspensions of funding started with the US on Friday, right after the investigation was announced. Canada, Australia, Britain, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, Japan, Austria and Romania joined Washington as of Monday. Meanwhile, the French foreign ministry announced that France has not planned a new payment to fund UNRWA in the first quarter of 2024, but would decide when the time comes what action to take in conjunction with the United Nations and its main donors. The European Union (EU) announced on Monday that it would review whether it could continue to fund UNRWA in light of the allegations. The EU’s executive arm, the European Commission announced that the body does not foresee any additional funding for the organisation until the end of February. Ireland and Norway, however, expressed continued support for UNRWA, saying the agency does crucial work to help Palestinians displaced and in desperate need of assistance in Gaza. “We need to distinguish between what individuals may have done, and what UNRWA stands for,” a statement by Norway’s government said, adding the organisation’s tens of thousands of employees in Gaza, the West Bank, and the region play a “crucial role” in distributing aid, saving lives, and safeguarding basic needs and rights. Irish Foreign Minister Micheal Martin wrote on X: “Ireland has no plans to suspend funding for UNRWA’s vital Gaza work.” Spanish daily, El País, reported on Monday that Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares said Spain would continue funding UNRWA. He asserted that while Spain is closely following the investigation into Israel’s claims, the accused are 12 individuals out of a total of around 30,000 UNRWA employees.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/28/which-countries-have-cut-funding-to-unrwa-and-why
Iran launches three satellites amid rising tensions with Western powers,"The satellites will be used to test communication and geopositioning technology, as well as the efficacy of delivering cargoes to space, Iran said.","Iran has successfully launched three satellites for the first time using its carrier rocket developed by the Ministry of Defence and Armed Forces Logistics, state media reported, a milestone the West fears will boost Tehran’s ballistic missile programme. The satellites were sent to a minimum orbit of 450km (280 miles) on Sunday. One satellite weighing 32kg (71 pounds) and two nano-satellites of less than 10kg each were propelled using the Simorgh (Phoenix) satellite carrier rocket. The nano-satellites, named Kayhan-2 and Hatef-1, will be used to test narrowband communication and geopositioning technology, state media said. The larger satellite, named Mahda and built by the Iranian Space Agency, will aim to test the accuracy of the Simorgh rocket in delivering multiple cargoes to space. The Simorgh rocket has had multiple failures in the past. An analysis by The Associated Press news agency of the footage of the launch showed that it took place at the Imam Khomeini Space Center in Iran’s rural Semnan province. “The roar of the Simorgh [rocket] resonated in our country’s sky and infinite space,” said Abbas Rasooli, a state TV reporter, in the video. The launch comes amid heightened tensions in the wider Middle East over Israel’s continued war on the Gaza Strip, sparking fears of a regional conflict. Iran-linked groups in Yemen, Syria, Iraq and Lebanon have carried out attacks against US and Israeli interests in solidarity with Palestinians. More than 26,000 Palestinians have been killed in nearly four months of Israeli bombardment.    Earlier this month, Iran launched its Sorayya satellite with a rocket built by the country’s military Revolutionary Guards, which Europe believes Iran will use to develop long-range ballistic missiles. Iran on Saturday dismissed that condemnation, saying it has a right topeaceful technological advancementin the aerospace field. Meanwhile, the US intelligence community’s 2023 worldwide threat assessment said the development of satellite launch vehicles makes Iran one step closer to developing the missiles and cited the Simorgh as a possible dual-use rocket. Under former President Hassan Rouhani, Iran slowed its space programme to ease tensions with the West, but under President Ebrahim Raisi, the programme has pushed forward. The United States has previously said Iran’s satellite launches defy a UN Security Council resolution and called on Tehran to undertake no activity involving ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. UN sanctions related to Iran’s ballistic missile programme expired last October. Since the US withdrew from the nuclear deal in 2018, Iran has boosted its uranium enrichment to near weapons-grade, though US intelligence agencies and others assess Tehran has not begun actively seeking a nuclear weapon. Tehran maintains that its nuclear programme is for civilian purposes.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/28/iran-launches-three-satellites-amid-rising-tensions-with-western-powers
UNRWA fund cuts by the West ‘collective punishment’ against Palestinians,The UN chief joins head of UNRWA calling on Western donor countries for ‘continuity’ in Gaza agency operations.,"The decision to suspend aid to the UN Palestinian refugee agency by several Western countries is a “collective punishment”, the head of the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) has said, as the UN chief Antonio Guterres joined him in urging donor nations to maintain much-needed Gaza aid. UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said he was shocked such decisions were taken as “famine looms” in Gaza, which has been devastated by nearly four months of relentless Israeli bombardment that has killed more than 26,000 people. The agency, with its 13,000 employees in Gaza, is the main organisation aiding Gaza’s population amid the humanitarian disaster. More than two million of the besieged enclave’s 2.3 million people depend on the UNRWA for “sheer survival”, including food and shelter, Lazzarini said, warning this lifeline can “collapse any time now”. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also joined Lazzarini’s call on Sunday, pleading for donor states to continue supporting the UN agency that runs aid operations in Gaza. “The dire needs of the desperate populations they serve must be met.” Guterres said that the UN employees involved in acts of “terror” will be held accountable but added that “the tens of thousands of men and women who work for UNRWA, many in some of the most dangerous situations for humanitarian workers, should not be penalised”. About 1,100 people, mostly civilians, were killed in the wake of the Hamas attack and about 240 captives were taken. Nine out of 12 UNRWA staff members accused of involvement in the October 7 Hamas attack inside Israel have been terminated, according to the UN chief. One was confirmed dead and the identities of the other two were being clarified, he said. “The Secretariat is ready to cooperate with a competent authority able to prosecute the individuals in line with the Secretariat’s normal procedures for such cooperation.” The UN on Friday said it wasinvestigatingseveral agency employees over the allegations. But Israel has continued to attack the UN agency, with Foreign Minister Israel Katz calling for Lazzarini’s resignation on Saturday. Top Palestinian officials and Hamas havecriticised the decisionwhich they said “entails great political and humanitarian relief risks”. “At this particular time and in light of the continuing aggression against the Palestinian people, we need the maximum support for this international organization and not stopping support and assistance to it,” Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Secretary-General Hussein al-Sheikh wrote on X, urging the countries to “immediately reverse their decision”. Chris Gunness, a former UNRWA spokesman, says there is a “coordinated political attack” on the UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees. “The Israelis have said they cannot win the war on Gaza unless UNRWA is disbanded. So what clearer signal do you want?” he told Al Jazeera. UNRWA lifesaving assistance is about to end following countries decisions to cut their funding to the Agency. Our humanitarian operation, on which 2 million people depend as a lifeline in Gaza, is collapsing. I am shocked such decisions are taken based on alleged behavior of a… — Philippe Lazzarini (@UNLazzarini)January 27, 2024  The United States, which said 12 agency employees were under investigation, immediately suspended funding, followed byseveral other countries, including Britain, Germany, Canada, Australia, the Netherlands, Finland, Switzerland and Italy. On Sunday, the French foreign ministryannouncedthat Paris has not planned any new payments to support UNRWA for the first quarter of this year and will decide when the time comes what action to take in conjunction with the UN and its other main donors. European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell highlighted that the 27-member bloc would “assess further steps and draw lessons based on the result of the full and comprehensive investigation”. “While I understand their concerns – I was myself horrified by these accusations – I strongly appeal to the governments that have suspended their contributions to, at least, guarantee the continuity of UNRWA’s operations,” Guterres said. Meanwhile, there are reports that US negotiators were making progress on a potential agreement under which Israel would pause military operations against Hamas for two months in exchange for the release of more than 100 captives. Al Jazeera could not independently verify the reports. CIA director Bill Burns is expected to meet with Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency David Barnea, Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and Egyptian intelligence chief Abbas Kamel in France on Sunday for talks centred on the captive negotiations.

Rare health institutions function in the enclave with low capacity and the UNRWA establishments, mostly schools, have been widely used as shelters by displaced people. Gunness, the former UNRWA chief, said the UN agency only has weeks before it runs out of money for its crucial aid work to save Palestinian lives in Gaza. “My message to the Arab world, particularly to the Gulf, is where are you? Because they’re making billions each day on oil revenues. A tiny fraction of those oil revenues would see UNRWA’s financial problems disappear overnight. This unconscionable gap inflicted by these Western countries would be filled very quickly,” Gunness told Al Jazeera. “Some of the most desperate people in the Middle East are now facing starvation, they’re facing famine, and the Arab states need to step up to the plate.” Meanwhile, Israel has continued to pound the central and southern parts of Khan Younis, with Gaza’s Ministry of Health reporting the killing of 174 Palestinians in the past 24 hours. Nasser Hospital, the biggest healthcare facility in southern Gaza, has been under Israeli siege for the past five days and is on the brink of collapse. Doctors at the hospital are warning it will not be able to function for much longer due to a lack of supplies.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/28/unrwa-fund-cuts-by-the-west-collective-punishment-against-palestinians

"US, Iraq begin formal talks on winding down US-led military coalition","Currently, there are about 2,500 US troops still deployed in Iraq as part of the coalition formed in 2014 to help defeat ISIL.","The United States and Iraq have held a first round of talks on the future of US and other foreign troops in the country, with Baghdad expecting discussions to lead to a timeline for reducing their presence. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani as well as top-ranking officials from both the Iraqi armed forces and the US-led coalition met in Baghdad on Saturday. The joint commission began “the commencement of the first round of bilateral dialogue between Iraq and the United States of America to end the Coalition in Iraq”, Al-Sudani’s office said in a statement. “Military experts will oversee ending the military mission of the Global Coalition against Daesh [ISIL], a decade after its initiation and after its successful achievement of its mission in partnership with Iraqi security and military forces,” it added. Currently, there are about 2,500 US troops still deployed in Iraq as part of the coalition that was formed in 2014 to help the Iraqi government defeat ISIL. The US says its aims to set up a committee to negotiate the terms of the mission’s end were first discussed last year. But as Israel’s war on Gaza ramps up, US forces in Iraq and Syria have faced frequent attacks by Iran-allied groups, resulting in US retaliatory attacks and Iraqi complaints of US “aggression” against its territory. Since ISIL lost its hold on Iraq, officials have called for the withdrawal of coalition forces, especially after a US air strike in January 2020 killed Iranian top commander Qassem Soleimani and Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis outside Baghdad airport. Iraqi officials have complained that the US attacks violate its sovereignty. OnThursday, Washington said it agreed with Baghdad on the launch of “expert working groups of military and defence professionals” as part of the joint commission. The three working groups would investigate “the level of threat posed by ISIS [ISIL], operational and environmental requirements, and strengthening the growing capabilities of the Iraqi security forces”, al-Sudani’s office said. US Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrin Singh also acknowledged that the US military footprint in the Arab country “will certainly be part of the conversations as it goes forward”. While the US has said the decision to discuss withdrawal from Iraq was decided upon before October 7, ISIL in Iraq took credit for the decision and said in a statement that it “proves that the Americans only understand the language of force” and promised to continue its attacks.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/27/us-iraq-begin-formal-talks-on-withdrawing-us-led-military-coalition
Gunmen kill nine Pakistani nationals in southeastern Iran,The shootings come as Tehran and Islamabad work to normalise ties after recent tit-for-tat attacks.,"Gunmen have killed nine Pakistanis in a restive southeastern border area of Iran, Pakistan has said, amid efforts by the two countries to mend ties after recent tit-for-tat attacks. “Deeply shocked by horrifying killing of 9 Pakistanis in Saravan. Embassy will extend full support to bereaved families,” the Pakistani ambassador to Tehran, Muhammad Mudassir Tipi, said on the social media platform X on Saturday. “We called upon Iran to extend full cooperation in the matter.” Earlier in the day, Iran’s semi-official Mehr News Agency reported the attack in Saravan in Sistan-Baluchestan province. It identified the dead only as foreign nationals and said no individuals or groups had claimed responsibility for the shootings. The province’s deputy governor, Alireza Marhamati, told official news agency IRNA that according to survivors of the incident, “three armed people shot at the foreigners after entering their residence and fled the scene”. He confirmed the toll of nine deaths and said three others were wounded. The Baluch rights group Haalvash said on its website that the victims were Pakistani labourers who lived at a car repair shop where they worked. Calling the attack a “terrorist incident”, Pakistan’s foreign ministry said it was in touch with Iranian authorities and had asked Tehran to investigate the incident. “It is a horrifying and despicable incident and we condemn it unequivocally,” Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said following the news. “We are in touch with Iranian authorities and have underscored the need to immediately investigate the incident and hold to account those involved in this heinous crime.” The shootings occurred ahead of a planned visit on Monday to Pakistan by Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani condemned the attack. “Iran and Pakistan won’t allow enemies to damage the brotherly ties between the two countries,” he said in a statement. Iranian state media said the Pakistani and Iranian ambassadors were returning to their postings after being recalled when the neighbouring countries exchanged missile attacks last week aimed at what each said were armed group targets. “The Iran-Pakistan border creates an opportunity for economic exchanges … and must be protected against any insecurity,” Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi told Ambassador Mudassir Tipi as he received his credentials on Saturday, according to Iranian state media reports. Sistan-Baluchistan, one of the few mainly Sunni Muslim provinces in Shia-dominated Iran, has seen persistent unrest involving cross-border drug-smuggling gangs, rebels from the Baluchi ethnic minority, and armed groups. On January 18, Pakistan launched air raids on “militant targets” in Iran, two days after Iran had launched attacks on its territory. Tehran said it had targeted Jaish al-Adl, a group that carried out a spate of deadly attacks in Iran in recent months. Formed in 2012, the group is blacklisted by Iran as a “terrorist” organisation. The Iranian attacks, which Pakistan said killed at least two children, drew a sharp rebuke from Islamabad, which recalled its ambassador from Tehran and blocked Iran’s envoy from returning to Islamabad. Tehran also summoned Islamabad’s charge d’affaires over Pakistan’s attacks, which had left at least nine people dead. The two countries, however, announced last Monday that they had decided tode-escalateand resumed diplomatic missions with the two ambassadors returning to their posts.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/27/gunmen-kill-nine-pakistani-nationals-in-southeastern-iran
Palestinians condemn suspension of UNRWA funding by Western nations,"Australia, Germany, UK, US and others halt support after Israel accused UNRWA staff of involvement in Hamas’s October 7 attacks.","Top Palestinian officials and Hamas have criticised the decision by nearly a dozen Western countries to suspend funding to the United Nations relief agency for Palestinians and called for an immediate reversal of the move, which entails “great” risk. The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) earlier said it hadopened an investigationafter Israel alleged that some of its employees were involved in the October 7 attacks that triggered the current conflict. This has prompted at least 10 Western countries to withdraw or temporarily pause funding to the agency, a move the head of UNRWA called “shocking”. “Suspension of funds threatens humanitarian work in the region, especially in Gaza,” UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini said in a statement late on Saturday, urging countries who have frozen funding to “reconsider their decisions” as Gaza faces the risk of mass starvation. Earlier, Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Secretary General Hussein al-Sheikh said the countries’ decision “entails great political and humanitarian relief risks”. “At this particular time and in light of the continuing aggression against the Palestinian people, we need the maximum support for this international organization and not stopping support and assistance to it,” he wrote on X, urging the countries to “immediately reverse their decision”.

European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the 27-member bloc would “assess further steps and draw lessons based on the result of the full and comprehensive investigation”. Ireland and Norway, however, expressed continued support for UNRWA, saying the agency does crucial work to help Palestinians displaced and in desperate need of assistance in Gaza. Hamas on Saturday slammed Israeli “threats” against the agency, after Israel accused several UNRWA staff of involvement in Hamas’s October 7 attacks in southern Israel that the authorities there said killed about 1,140 people. “We ask the UN and the international organisations to not cave into the threats and blackmail” from Israel, Hamas’s press office said in a post on Telegram. On Friday, UNRWA said it had fired several employees and that it had opened an investigation into the allegations. “The Israeli authorities have provided UNRWA with information about the alleged involvement of several UNRWA employees in the horrific attacks on Israel on October 7,” Lazzarini said. “To protect the agency’s ability to deliver humanitarian assistance, I have taken the decision to immediately terminate the contracts of these staff members and launch an investigation in order to establish the truth without delay.” He did not disclose the number of employees nor the nature of their alleged involvement but said that “any UNRWA employee who was involved in acts of terror” would be held accountable, including through criminal prosecution. Soon after that on Friday, the US announced it was halting funding to UNRWA because of the allegations against what it said were 12 employees who “may have been involved” in the Hamas attack. Canada’s International Development Minister Ahmed Hussen also said on Friday that Ottawa had “temporarily paused” additional funding while UNRWA conducts a thorough investigation.    On Saturday, the UK said it had joined the US in “temporarily pausing” future financial aid for UNRWA, which is funded almost entirely by voluntary contributions from UN member countries. “The UK is appalled by allegations that UNRWA staff were involved in the 7 October attack against Israel, a heinous act of terrorism that the UK Government has repeatedly condemned,” the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said in a statement. Italy’s Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said his country was joining its allies and cutting its support for the agency. “Allied countries have taken a similar decision. We are committed to providing humanitarian aid to the Palestinian population while protecting Israel’s security,” he posted on X. Australia’s Foreign Minister Penny Wong said she was “deeply concerned” by the allegations against UNRWA but welcomed the agency’s investigation. “We are speaking with partners and will temporarily pause disbursement of recent funding,” she wrote on X. The Dutch minister for trade and development, Geoffrey van Leeuwen, announced a freeze in funding while the investigation is ongoing. “The accusation is that the attack was committed on October 7 with UN money, with our money,” he told public broadcaster NOS on Saturday. Germany’s Foreign Office also paused funding, saying: “Until the end of the investigation, Germany, in coordination with other donor countries, will temporarily not approve any new funds for UNRWA in Gaza.” Israel has praised the countries that have halted their support to the UN agency, saying it wants to completely stop its operations after the war on Gaza has ended.

UNRWA was founded in the wake of the creation of the state of Israel in 1948 to provide hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees who were forcibly displaced with education, healthcare, social services and jobs. It started operations in 1950. The cash-strapped agency today supports nearly 6 million Palestinians in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, as well as in neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. The agency’s shelters in Gaza have also been repeatedly targeted by Israeli missiles during the war, despite pleas for safe passages to deliver humanitarian aid. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has pledged to conduct an “urgent and comprehensive independent review of UNRWA” in the aftermath of Israel’s allegations.

UN Security Council to discuss ICJ ruling in Israel genocide case,Top UN court ordered Israel to prevent acts of genocide against Palestinians but didn’t call for a ceasefire.,"The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is to meet next week over the decision by the global body’s top court calling for Israel to prevent genocidal acts in Gaza. The meeting scheduled for Wednesday was called by Algeria, whose Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it would give a “binding effect to the pronouncement of the International Court of Justice on the provisional measures imposed on the Israeli occupation”. The ICJ on FridaysaidIsrael must prevent genocidal acts in its war with Hamas and allow aid into Gaza, but stopped short of calling for an end to the fighting. Thedecision“gives the clear message that in order to do all the things that they are asking for, you need a ceasefire for it to happen”, said Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian ambassador to the UN. Algeria, the Arab representative on the council, requested the meeting late on Friday after a closed-door discussion of the UN’s 22-member Arab group. “So fasten your seat belts,” Mansour said, hinting that the Arab group would push for a halt in the fighting. Al Jazeera’s Gabriel Elizondo, reporting from the UN in New York, said diplomatic sources indicated that the proposal by Algeria is likely to call for an immediate truce. “All eyes now turn to the Security Council,” he said, adding that the country’s move is highly anticipated.    The UNSC, long divided on the Israeli-Palestinian issue, has only agreed to two resolutions since the October 7 Hamas attacks that led to Israel’smassive offensiveon the Gaza Strip. In December, it demanded aid deliveries “at scale” to Gaza’s besieged population, while Israel’s ally, the United States, has kept out calls for a ceasefire despite international pressure. Hamas’s October 7 attacks killed about 1,140 people in Israel, according to authorities. Palestinian fighters also seized about 250 people and Israel says 132 of them remain in Gaza, including the bodies of at least 28 of them. Israel has promised to crush Hamas and launched a military offensive that the Ministry of Health in Gaza says has killed at least 26,257 people, about 70 percent of them women and children. The ICJ, based in The Hague, while refraining from ordering an immediate halt to the almost four-month-old war, said Israel must do everything to “prevent the commission of all acts within the scope” of the 1948 UN Genocide Convention. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahurejectedthe ICJ ruling and said his country will continue to defend itself and its citizens while adhering to international law.

"‘Israel’s supporters have been put on notice’, say experts on ICJ verdict","But ultimately, only Israel has the power to stop the bombardment of Gaza.","The interim orders issued by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to Israel amid its war on Gaza on Friday are significant, but their immediate implications are “limited” say some experts. On Friday, the ICJ issued its preliminary ruling in a case filed by South Africa in December, which accuses Israel of carrying out genocide in the Palestinian enclave of Gaza. After rejecting Israel’s petition to throw out the case, the ICJ issued provisional instructions to Israel to allow aid into Gaza while taking all measures within its power to prevent acts of genocide. Moreover, Israel must preserve evidence of all its actions within Gaza and report back to the ICJ within a month, it said. The ICJ also noted its grave concern over the fate of the Israelis taken captive by Hamas during its raid into Israel on October 7 and called for their immediate release. While South Africa has claimed that those instructions implicitly translate as a call for an immediate ceasefire, Israel has pointed to the absence of that specific wording and has confirmed that it will continue its three-month-long campaign against Gaza. “Really, the only body that can stop Israel’s bombardment of Gaza is Israel,” said Gerry Simpson, professor of law at the London School of Economics. “However, this does make it even more difficult for [Israeli Prime Minister] Benjamin Netanyahu to confidently claim to be defending the West and the rules-based order.” While a final ruling may still take years, the court has found that South Africa’s charges of genocide contain merit, and cannot, therefore, be dismissed as baseless by Israel and its international backers. Critically, the ruling raises the possibility that Tel Aviv’s allies in Washington, London and the European Union could even face the prospect of being implicated in having aided and abetted genocide at some future date. Friday’s judgement will also likely carry implications beyond those specified in court, Simpson said. “This also speaks to how the public sees the war. No matter where you get your information, there’s always the suspicion of bias in the reporting. This preliminary judgement offers something different. This is a judicial verdict based on a good faith reading of the facts.” Interpretations of the court’s findings are already polarising much of the political community. While South African Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor hailed it as little short of a triumph, others appeared less delighted. Speaking after the verdict, Netanyahu claimed the court had “justly rejected the outrageous demand” to deprive Israel of what he termed its “basic right to defend itself” by ordering a halt in the fighting. Nevertheless, he continued: “The mere claim that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians is not only false, it’s outrageous, and the willingness of the court to even discuss this is a disgrace that will not be erased for generations.” Israeli right-wing National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir was more direct, simply tweeting “Hague Shmague“. So far, more than 26,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed during Israel’s war on Gaza while thousands more are lost under the rubble and presumed dead. In addition, some 64,500 people have been injured by Israeli attacks on the densely populated Gaza Strip, the Hamas-run Ministry of Health said this week. While Israel’s emphasis that no specific mention was made of a ceasefire was predictable, other items were less likely to feature in Tel Israel’s public account of the judgement. “The way that South Africa and others will interpret the order is also that Israel’s supporters have basically been put on notice,” Antonios Tzanakopoulos, professor of public international law at Oxford University, said. “The ICJ has found that the case of genocide is at least plausible. Therefore, if third-party states continue to provide Israel with money and weapons, they now do so knowing they may be aiding and abetting genocide, which all signatories of the convention are prevented from doing,” he said. Though it stopped short of accusing Israel of committing genocide, Italy halted all shipments of weapons to Israel after the October 7 Hamas attacks, Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani announced a week ago. “This is what we mean by enforcement,” Tzanakopoulos said. “States aren’t physical things. You can’t send them to prison. But the kind of pressure that judgements like this bring, and the actions of states like Italy, make it more difficult to cooperate with Israel,” he said. Under the terms of the 1948 Genocide Convention, all states have a binding obligation not only to refrain from complicity in genocide but also to prevent it, Katherine Iliopoulos, legal adviser for the MENA programme at the International Commission of Jurists, said. “I think we can infer from the provisional measures imposed that the Court considers there to be a serious risk of genocide in Gaza. This is important because it puts all states on formal notice of this risk, which triggers their duty to take concrete steps to prevent genocide, including by ceasing arms sales and exports and other assistance that could facilitate genocidal acts,” she said. Iliopoulos pointed to the actions of legal groups already under way, such as those in Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, to prevent the export of weapons from their countries to Israel on the basis that they might be used to commit international crimes in Gaza. “Today’s ruling will add to such pressure on these and other countries to immediately stop arms exports to Israel,” she said. A definitive ruling in South Africa’s case of genocide against Israel may take years. Moreover, as past preliminary judgements have shown, compliance remains an issue. The 2022 ruling against Myanmar over its persecution of the Rohingya minority achieved only a partial change in tack, the United Nationsnotedin August. Moreover, the same year, the ICJ’s judgement against Russia following its invasion of Ukraine was simply shrugged off. However, this is the first case against a state so closely tied to Western powers, one whose existence to a large part relies upon their provision of arms and diplomatic cover. To what degree those states may now risk legal hazard could help determine the shape and duration of the war.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/27/israels-supporters-have-been-put-on-notice-say-experts-on-icj-verdict
US military destroys Houthi antiship missile after oil tanker attack,US says missile presented an ‘imminent threat’ to merchant ship and US Navy vessels in the region.,"The United States military says it destroyed a Houthi antiship missile in Yemen that was aimed into the Red Sea and ready to launch after the Iran-aligned group attacked a British oil tanker in the Gulf of Aden. The missile “presented an imminent threat to merchant vessels and the US Navy ships in the region”, the US Central Command said on Saturday in a statement on X.

U.S. Forces…pic.twitter.com/UcHqDiyT1I — U.S. Central Command (@CENTCOM)January 27, 2024  The US attack followed a strike by the Houthi rebels on a British fuel tanker on Friday evening. The Marlin Luanda, owned by the Singapore-based Trafigura trading firm, was damaged but no injuries were reported and the US Navy ship USS Carney was providing assistance, the US military said. “We are pleased to confirm that all crew on board the Marlin Luanda are safe and the fire in the cargo tank has been fully extinguished. The vessel is now sailing towards a safe harbour,” Trafigura said in an update. Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree, in a televised statement, claimed responsibility for the attack, saying its forces will continue to attack ships in the Red Sea until Israel’s “aggression” against Palestinians in Gaza stops.    Al Masirah, a Houthi-run satellite news channel, reported on Saturday that the US and the United Kingdom launched two air raids that hit the port of Ras Issa, Yemen’s main oil export terminal, in Hodeidah province. Houthi attacks have so far been concentrated in the narrow strait of Bab el-Mandeb, which connects the Gulf of Aden to the Red Sea. Approximately 50 ships sail through the strait daily, heading to and from the Suez Canal – a key artery for global maritime trade. Some of the world’s largest shipping companies have suspended operations in the region, instead sending their vessels on the longer route around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, slowing trade between Asia and Europe.  The US and the UK have launchedmultiple rounds of air raidssince the Houthi attacks began targeting missile depots and launcher sites in Yemen. Since the air strike campaign began, the rebels say they will target US and UK ships as well. On Wednesday, two US-flagged ships carrying cargo for its defence and state departments came under attack by the Houthis, forcing an escorting US Navy warship to shoot some of the projectiles down.

US approves sale of F-16 fighter jets to Turkey,The $23bn deal was finalised after Turkey’s parliament ratified Sweden’s long-delayed NATO membership.,"The United States has approved the sale of F-16 fighter jets to Turkey after the Turkish parliament this weekratifiedSweden’s NATO membership. The US Department of State notified Congress of the $23bn agreement to sell the warplanes to NATO ally Turkey on Friday night, along with a companion $8.6bn sale of advanced F-35 fighter jets to Greece, also an ally in the Western military bloc. The department’s notification came hours after Turkey deposited its “instrument of ratification” for Sweden’s accession to NATO with Washington, which is the repository for alliance documents and after several key members of Congress lifted their objections. The sale to Turkey includes 40 Lockheed Martin F-16s and equipment to modernise 79 of its existing F-16 fleet. Greece will get 40 F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighters and related equipment. Turkey has long sought to upgrade its F-16 fleet and requested the jets in October 2021, but its delay in approving Sweden’s NATO bid became an obstacle to winning congressional approval. Ankara had made its ratification of Sweden’s membership contingent on the approval of the sale of the new planes.    President Joe Biden’s administration had supported the sale, but several lawmakers had expressed objections due to Turkey’s human rights record. “My approval of Turkey’s request to purchase F-16 aircraft has been contingent on Turkish approval of Sweden’s NATO membership. But make no mistake: This was not a decision I came to lightly,” said Democratic Senator Ben Cardin, chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, one of four key committees that needs to approve arms transfers. “I look forward to beginning this new chapter in our relationship with Turkey, expanding the NATO alliance, and working with our global allies in standing up to ongoing Russian aggression against its peaceful neighbours,” he said. Congress has 15 days to object to the sale, after which it is considered final. Ankara had delayed its approval of Sweden’s NATO membership for more than a year, ostensibly because it believed Stockholm did not take Turkey’s national security concerns seriously enough, including its fight against Kurdish fighters and other groups it considers to be security threats. The delays had frustrated the US and other NATO allies, almost all of which had been swift to accept Sweden andFinlandinto the alliance after the Nordic states dropped their longstanding military neutrality followingRussia’s invasion of Ukrainein February 2022. Finland became the alliance’s 31st member in April. All eyes are now onHungary, which is the only NATO member holding up Sweden’s bid.

ICJ ruling in Gaza genocide case renews calls to end Israel arms transfers,Advocates urge countries to suspend arms sales to Israel after top UN court says risk of genocide in Gaza plausible.,"Rights advocates and legal experts have welcomed theInternational Court of Justice’s (ICJ) decisionordering Israel to take “all measures within its power” to prevent acts that could amount to genocide against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. While it stopped short of explicitly demanding a ceasefire, the top court of the United Nations on Friday acknowledged there is a plausible risk of genocide in the bombarded Palestinian enclave and refused to dismissthe casebrought by South Africa. “It’s a huge defeat for Israel — one of the biggest defeats … in the past 75 years,” said Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN), a think tank in Washington, DC. But the ruling “goes beyond Israel” alone, Jarrar told Al Jazeera, as it highlights countries’ legal and political obligations to take action to prevent the alleged genocide unfolding in Gaza. The ICJ’s decision in The Hague also spurred renewed calls to suspend weapons transfers to the Israeli government, which advocates say amount to complicity and violate international law. That includes arms shipments from the United States, Israel’s foremost backer. “It’s a watershed moment where the United States government is put on notice that they cannot continue their blank-cheque policies with Israel,” Jarrar said. “The US can’t and should not continue its arms transfers with Israel now.”    The US provides at least $3.8bn in military aid to Israel annually. For years, rights advocates and a growing number of US lawmakers have called on Washington tocondition that assistanceon Israel’s human rights record and international law. However, US President Joe Biden has rejected those efforts while bolstering assistance to the Israeli government. AfterIsrael began the Gaza waron October 7, following an attack by Hamas that killed more than 1,100 people in southern Israel, the Biden administration sent a request to Congress to approve a $14bn foreign aid package for Israel, the bulk of which would be military assistance. The US government also twicebypassed Congressto provide thousands of artillery shells to the country as it continued to bombard Gaza. Israeli attacks have killed more than 26,000 Palestinians to date and decimated the coastal territory. Yet, despite reports andinvestigationsthat showed US weapons were used in Israeli bombings that killed Palestinian civilians in Gaza, attempts to pressure Washington to end the transfers ordeterminewhether the arms are being deployed in rights abuses have failed. “We have been telling the Biden administration that this is not just a goodwill gesture” to end the transfer of weapons to Israel, said DAWN’s Jarrar, explaining that Washington has obligations under international and US law. “This is something that they have to think about very seriously because the United States as a government is implicated in these war crimes, and US officials are also implicated,” Jarrar said. “They have to take today’s order [from the ICJ] very seriously.”    Rights groups havecalledon all UN member-states to suspend their transfers of weapons that “can be used to commit violations of international humanitarian and human rights law” in Gaza. Among other countries, Canada and the United Kingdom faced growing pressure on Friday following the ICJ’s decision. Both nations are state parties to the Arms Trade Treaty, a UN pact that seeks to regulate the flow of weapons globally and prevent them from being used in violations of international law and human rights. It prohibits parties from greenlighting arms transfers “if [they have] knowledge at the time of authorization that the arms or items would be used in the commission of genocide, crimes against humanity, grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949, attacks directed against civilian objects or civilians protected as such, or other war crimes”. The UK has licensed more than 474 million pounds ($602m) worth of military exports to Israel since 2015, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW), and it “provides approximately 15% of the components in the F-35 stealth bomber aircraft currently being used in Gaza”. Pressed on UK arms exports to Israel in November, Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said the country’s “defence exports to Israel are relatively small — just 42 million pounds [$53m] last year”. The weapons also “go through a very strict criteria before anything is exported”, Shapps said, according to a parliamentary transcript. But on Friday, Yasmine Ahmed, the UK director at HRW, said the ICJ’s provisional order should push the UK government to “halt arms exports to Israel with immediate effect”. “There is NO question,” she wrote on social media. “The Court found a plausible risk of genocide & the UK has an obligation to prevent genocide & not be complicit.” There is NO question. In light of the provisional measures judgment@CIJ_ICJ, the 🇬🇧 must halt arms exports to Israel with immediate effect@David_Cameron@KemiBadenoch The Court found a plausible risk of genocide & the UK has an obligation to prevent genocide & not be complicit — Yasmine Ahmed (@YasmineAhmed001)January 26, 2024  That obligation stems from the UN’s 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide — commonly known as the Genocide Convention. The US, the UK and Canada are among 153 countries that are parties to the treaty. It confirms “that genocide, whether committed in time of peace or in time of war, is a crime under international law which they undertake to prevent and to punish”. South Africa invoked this “obligation to prevent genocide” when it brought its case to the ICJ, andthe court on Fridayrecognised that it had standing under the Genocide Convention. The treaty also states that “complicity in genocide” is punishable. “If you’re supplying arms to a country where you know the arms may be used for criminal purposes, then you may become complicit in those crimes,” said Geoffrey Nice, a UK lawyer who led the prosecution of Slobodan Milosevic at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. “And it’s very hard not to become complicit after a certain stage of knowing is reached and after a certain stage of conduct continues,” Nice told Al Jazeera in a television interview on Friday. “Arms suppliers would have to be very, very careful – and some may simply decide it’s not worth the risk of being brought into a humiliating, serious, possible investigation for crime.”    Most countries also have their own regulations around weapons exports. For example, Canada’s Export and Import Permits Act obliges the minister of foreign affairs to “deny exports and brokering permit applications for military goods and technology … if there is a substantial risk that the items would undermine peace and security”. The minister should also deny exports if they “could be used to commit or facilitate serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights laws” or in “serious acts of gender-based violence or serious acts of violence against women and children”. Last year, Canada exported 21.3 million Canadian dollars ($15.7m) worth of weapons to Israel. Canadian antiwar group Project Ploughshares said in a recent report that Canada-made components transferred to the US also eventually end up being supplied to the Israeli military, including components used in F-35 aircraft. “Because the vast majority of Canadian military exports to the United States are neither regulated nor reported, exact volumes and values of these exports are not available to the public and remain unknown,” the report said.    Michael Bueckert, vice president of the advocacy group Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East, said Canada has been sending weapons to Israel “for many years despite significant human rights violations and war crimes”. But the gravity of those transfers has increased significantly after the ICJ’s decision, he said. “There’s just no other option from the perspective of preventing Canada’s complicity in potential genocide; Canada must cancel all exports and suspend the arms trade completely to make sure that it’s not aiding or abetting those grave crimes,” Bueckert told Al Jazeera. “There’s no such thing as safe exports of military goods from a human rights perspective in the context of possible genocide. Canada has to go above and beyond to make sure that it’s not contributing in any way.” Global Affairs Canada did not immediately respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment on the calls to end arms transfers to Israel.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/27/icj-ruling-in-gaza-genocide-case-renews-calls-to-end-israel-arms-transfers
‘Can’t stop’: US teen’s family seeks elusive justice in West Bank killing,"US has been accused of failing to hold Israel accountable for the killings of its citizens, despite mounting pressure.","The trip was meant to be a homecoming: a chance for Tawfiq Ajaq, a 17-year-old born and raised in the United States, to connect with his Palestinian roots. Instead, his family’s ancestral village of al-Mazra’a ash-Sharqiya became hisfinal resting place. On January 19, Palestinian officials say Ajaq was fatally shot after an off-duty Israeli police officer and an Israeli settler opened fire. Ajaq is one of the latest victims of the soaring violence perpetrated by Israeli security forces and settlers in the occupied West Bank, following a Hamas attack in southern Israel last year. His uncle Mohammad Abdeljabbar told Al Jazeera that his family holds out hope that some justice may yet be served. They seek any recourse that could “avoid this happening again in the future, whether or not they’re a US citizen, so nobody else is killed unjustifiably”, Abdeljabbar said. The family has also called on the US to “put enough pressure on Israel” to see that through. Still, he acknowledged that justice for Americans killed in the Palestinian territories is often nonexistent, with the US historically unwilling to assert leverage over its “ironclad ally”. Already, he said, “we feel abandoned by our government”. Ajaq‘s family had settled near New Orleans in the southern state of Louisiana in the early 1990s. There, they built a sprawling family business that included real estate and sneaker shops. For most of his life, Ajaq lived just blocks from his father’s seven siblings and more than 40 cousins. He loved watching American football, attending New Orleans Saints games and indulging in the city’s renowned culinary offerings. A high-performing student, Ajaq planned to follow his older brother to the University of New Orleans, Abdeljabbar said. Ajaq was still wavering over what he wanted to study: business or engineering. At 32 years old, Abdeljabbar was closest in age to Ajaq of all his aunts and uncles. He remembers the teen as “just a funny, goofy kid”. “He was just a kid you could never take serious, always laughing, joking, smiling,” Abdeljabbar said. Ajaq often enjoyed summers in the West Bank, his family’s ancestral homeland, but last year, before the war in Gaza erupted, his parents decided it was time for the children to spend more time there. They hoped a year or two would allow the kids to “get in touch with our ancestors, to learn more about the culture, the language and the way of living out there”, Abdeljabbar explained. “Tawfiq was very excited for it. He loved it. He loved the lifestyle,” he continued. “It’s kind of paradise. Apart from the violence and the wars going on, it’s still a beautiful lifestyle.” But the occupied Palestinian territories have never seen the level of violence that they have in recent months. On October 7, tensions flared when the Palestinian group Hamas launched an attack on southern Israel, killing an estimated 1,200 people. Israel responded by declaring war and opening a bombing campaign against Gaza, a small Palestinian enclave nestled against the Mediterranean Sea. To date, more than 26,000 Palestinians have beenkilled in Gaza, most of them women and children. Rights groups have said the Israeli operation bears the hallmarks of a genocide. The occupied West Bank also experienced itsdeadliest yearon record, amid near-daily Israeli raids and settler attacks, particularly in the wake of October 7. In 2023, at least 532 Palestinians were killed in the territory, according to local authorities. The United Nations human rights office said approximately 300 of those deaths took place after the war began. Between October 7 and December 27, Israeli security forces killed at least 291 Palestinians in the territory, and settlers killed eight. The losses include at least 79 children under the age of 18. So far in 2024, more than 50 Palestinians have been killed in the occupied West Bank, Ajaq among them, according to Palestinian authorities. According toAjaq‘s family and Defense for Children International-Palestine (DCI-P), a West Bank-based human rights monitor, the teen had been in a truck with a friend near a highway when shots rang out. The gunfire was coming from an Israeli settler in a vehicle about 100 metres (328 feet) away. Ajaq and his friend attempted to drive away. The gunman followed. Then an Israeli military vehicle “appeared from the opposite direction” and began shooting from a distance of about 50 to 70 metres (164 to 230 feet), according to documentation collected by DCI-P.    As Ajaq lay bleeding, DCI-P said Israeli forces prevented emergency responders from reaching him for about 15 minutes. An ambulance then transported him to a hospital in Silwad, where he was pronounced dead from a gunshot wound to the head. It remains unclear which gunman fired the killing shot. Israeli police told the Associated Press (AP) and other media that both an off-duty police officer and a civilian had opened fire, and they had begun an investigation. The police also claimed they were targeting individuals “believed to be throwing rocks along Highway 60”, according to the AP. The family has rejected the allegations, saying Ajaq and his friend were planning to have a barbecue. Israel’s national police and military did not respond to a request from Al Jazeera for an update on the investigation. In a chilling video of the truck Ajaq was killed in, provided to Al Jazeera by his family, bullet holes can be seen in the back window. Blood was pooled on the floor. Earlier this week, the US State Departmentcalled on Israelto conduct “an urgent investigation to determine the circumstances” of the killing, adding the agency was “devastated”. Officials from the US office of Palestinian affairs also visitedAjaq‘s family and promised to pressure Israel “to do a full and transparent investigation and bring the killer to justice”, Abdeljabbar told Al Jazeera. On Thursday, Congress member Rashida Tlaib pushed the US State Department to launch its own investigation “into the murder of another American by the Israeli government”. “Tawfiq deserved to grow old,” she wrote on X. “The collective punishment of an entire people must end”. But historically, the US has been reticent to hold Israel, its ally, accountable for the killing of its citizens abroad, according to Josh Reubner, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University who focuses on the US-Israel relationship. “Israel has killed and gravely injured many US citizens over the past two decades,” he said. But the lack of “accountability emboldened Israel to continue to kill US citizens with impunity”. Reubner cited several examples. In 2003, peace activist Rachel Corrie was crushed to death by an Israeli soldier driving a Caterpillar bulldozer. And in 2010, Turkish American teen Furkan Dogan “was executed at point-blank range by Israeli naval commandoes on board a ship in international waters attempting to deliver humanitarian aid to the blockaded Gaza Strip in 2010”. More recently, in 2022, Palestinian American Omar Assad “was dragged out of his car and beaten by soldiers, leading to a fatal heart attack in 2022”, Reubner said. That same year, Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, a US citizen, was shot to death while reporting. After initially denying culpability, an Israeli investigation determined that Abu Akleh was fatally shot by an Israeli sniper. It deemed the killing an accident and said no one would be punished. “In each of these cases, the US called for an investigation and accountability. However, Israeli investigations were hollow and no one has been held accountable for these killings,” Reubner said. Abdeljabbar,Ajaq‘s uncle, said the family was reminded of Abu Akleh’s death in their own grief. “With Shireen Abu Akleh, we know she was killed by a sniper. Her killer was never brought to justice,” Abdeljabbar said. “It’s disappointing that a country as great as ours, as powerful as ours, can’t have another country bring justice for the killing of their own citizens.” Israel is the largest recipient globally of US foreign military assistance and receivesaidwithout conditions for its use. However, the US has laws and policies in place meant to prevent the transfer of arms to governments shown to abuse human rights. The Leahy Law(PDF), for example, prohibits the US from “using funds for assistance to units of foreign security forces where there is credible information implicating that unit in the commission of gross violations of human rights [GVHRs]”.    Israel currently faces allegations of human rights abuses for its ongoing military campaign in Gaza. Observers have also accused the Israeli government of emboldening and offering protection to Israelis who haveset up illegal settlementsacross the occupied West Bank. The war in Gaza has placed unprecedented scrutiny on the US’s support for Israel, with the Center for Constitutional Rightstaking the government to courton behalf of Palestinians killed in Gaza. Abdeljabbar said it has been difficult to reconcile the US government’s policies with the personal tragedy he now faces. “If you think about it, my tax dollars, Tawfiq’s dad’s tax dollars, helped pay to support the government that killed him.” But despite the situation, he has not given up hope that someone will be held accountable for his nephew’s killing. “We can’t stop,” he said. “We have to keep pressure until justice for Tawfiq is served.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/27/cant-stop-us-teens-family-seeks-elusive-justice-in-west-bank-killing
US court hears civil case accusing Biden of ‘complicity’ in Gaza ‘genocide’,Plaintiffs want the federal court to urge the US to use its influence to get Israel to end its hostilities in Gaza.,"A civil case accusing United States President Joe Biden and other senior US officials of being complicit in Israel’s “genocide” in Gaza has begun at a federal court in California. Lawyers representing Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, attended Friday’s proceedings along with the plaintiffs who accuse them of “failure to prevent and complicity in the Israeli government’s unfolding genocide”. The Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), a US civil liberties group, filed the lawsuit on behalf of the human rights organisation, Defence for Children – Palestine; Al-Haq, a Palestinian human rights group based in the occupied West Bank; and eight Palestinians and US citizens with relatives in Gaza. During Friday’s hearing, the court heard from lawyers, activists and organisers, including doctors in Gaza, about the situation that Palestinians have been facing for nearly four months. I’m inside the US federal court where Palestinian plaintiffs are suing Biden, Blinken & Austin for failure to prevent -& complicity in – Israel’s ongoing genocide in Gaza It’s unprecedented that the case made it this far. Palestinians w family in Gaza will testify soon@ajpluspic.twitter.com/F5CUNAKGUD — Dena Takruri (@Dena)January 26, 2024  Since the war began on October 7, more than 26,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s bombardment of Gaza following a Hamas attack on Israel that killed about 1,100 people there. The CCR complaint was firstfiledin November last year and said Biden, Blinken and Austin “have not only been failing to uphold the country’s obligation to prevent a genocide but have enabled the conditions for its development by providing unconditional military and diplomatic support [to Israel]”. The CCR is asking the court to “declare that defendants have violated their duty under customary international law, as part of federal common law, to take all measures within their power to prevent Israel from committing genocide against the Palestinian people of Gaza”. The group is also calling for the US to use its influence over Israel to end the hostilities against Palestinians in Gaza. Al Jazeera’s Rob Reynolds, reporting from the court in Oakland on Friday, said the CCR is arguing that by providing weapons to Israel, the US’s support violates the 1948 Genocide Convention. In response, the lawyers for the Biden administration “are focusing on a very narrow legal argument”, he said. “They are saying the court does not have the authority to rule on this. They’re citing what is called the political doctrine, and it has to do with the separation of powers in the United States,” Reynolds said.    He explained that lawyers are arguing that the conduct of foreign policy, diplomacy, military activities and the relations between allies are in the “political purview of the executive branch, in other words, the president and the cabinet” and, therefore, not amenable to judicial action by other branches of power that make up the US government. The judge appeared to also question his authority in the case, Reynolds said. “This is really the fundamental question, whether he’s got the authority to rule on this, but the judge did open the proceedings by a litany of just describing the plight of Palestinians in Gaza,” our correspondent said. Earlier on Friday, theInternational Court of Justice (ICJ)ordered Israel to take all measures possible to prevent acts of genocide against Gaza and to do more to help civilians. Still, it failed to call for a ceasefire, which South Africa, who presented the case to the ICJ, had called for.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/26/us-court-hears-civil-case-accusing-biden-of-complicity-in-gaza
Who is Julia Sebutinde? The judge against all ICJ rulings in Israel’s case,ICJ Judge Sebutinde voted against emergency measures requested by South Africa against Israel over its war on Gaza.,"The United Nations’ top courtordered Israelon Friday to do all it can to prevent death, destruction and any acts of genocide in its military offensive in Gaza, but stopped short of ordering a ceasefire. South Africa alleged that Israel’s campaign in Gaza amounted to genocide in the case and had asked the court to order Israel to halt the operation. In the anticipateddecision, madeby a panel of 17 judges, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered six so-called provisional measures to protect Palestinians in Gaza. Those measures were approved by an overwhelming majority of the judges. An Israeli judge voted in favour of two of the six. But Uganda’s Judge, Julia Sebuntinde, was the only judge who votedagainst all of them. Here is what is known about her, and why she voted the way she did: Born in February 1954, Sebutinde is a Ugandan judge serving her second term at the ICJ. She has been a judge at the court since March 2021. She is the first African woman to sit on the international court. According to the Institute for African Women in Law, Sebutinde comes from a modest family and she was born during a period when Uganda was actively fighting for independence from the British Colonial office. Sebutinde attended Lake Victoria Primary School in Entebbe, Uganda. After finishing primary school, she went to Gayaza High School. She later pursued her degree at Makerere University and received a bachelor of laws degree in 1977, at the age of 23. Later, as part of her education in 1990, at the age of 36, she went to Scotland where she earned a master of laws degree with distinction from the University of Edinburgh. In 2009, the same university honoured her with a doctorate of laws, recognising her contributions to legal and judicial service. Before being elected to the ICJ, Sebutinde was a judge of the Special Court for Sierra Leone. She was appointed to that position in 2007. Throughout her professional career, Sebutinde has been no stranger to controversies. In February 2011, Sebutinde was one of three presiding judges in the trial of former Liberian President Charles Taylor for war crimes committed in Sierra Leone. The Special Court found Taylorguiltyon 11 accounts, including war crimes, crimes against humanity, terrorism, murder, rape and the use of child soldiers, resulting in a 50-year prison sentence. On February 8, London barrister Courtenay Griffiths, who represented Taylor, walked out of proceedings after judges declined to accept a written summary of his client’s defence at the end of his trial. On February 28, a disciplinary hearing to censure Griffiths was indefinitely adjourned because Sebutinde declined to be present, withdrawing “on principle”. This decision came after her earlier dissent from the order requiring Griffiths to apologise or face disciplinary action. Fast forward to 2024, Sebutinde once again captured headlines, this time for being the only judge who voted againstall measuressought by South Africa in its genocide case against Israel. In a dissenting opinion, Sebutinde stated the following: “In my respectful dissenting opinion the dispute between the State of Israel and the people of Palestine is essentially and historically a political one.” “It is not a legal dispute susceptible to judicial settlement by the Court,” she added. She also said that South Africa didn’t demonstrate that the acts allegedly committed by Israel were “committed with the necessary genocidal intent, and that as a result, they are capable of falling within the scope of the Genocide Convention”. Experts argued that Sebutinde failed to conduct a thorough assessment of the situation. “I think what the dissenting opinion gets wrong is that genocide is not a political dispute, it’s a legal matter. Both South Africa and Israel signed the Genocide Convention in 1948 and accept the jurisdiction over breaches of the Genocide Convention and failure to prevent genocide,” Mark Kersten, assistant professor at the University of the Fraser Valley focusing on human rights law, told Al Jazeera. “You cannot simply say this is something for history, this is something for politics. Of course, history and politics play a role,” he added. The ambassador of Uganda to the United Nations also expressed a different opinion. “Justice Sebutinde ruling at the International Court of Justice does not represent the Government of Uganda’s position on the situation in Palestine,” he said in a statement on Twitter. Justice Sebutinde ruling at the International Court of Justice does not represent the Government of Uganda’s position on the situation in Palestine. She has previously voted against Uganda’s case on DRC.

UNRWA probes employees over suspected involvement in October 7 attack,The US has paused funding to the UN agency after Israel said some of its staff were allegedly involved in the attacks.,"The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees says it has opened an investigation into some employees Israel alleges were involved in the October 7 attacks, and that it has severed ties with those staff members. “The Israeli authorities have provided UNRWA with information about the alleged involvement of several UNRWA employees in the horrific attacks on Israel on October 7,” Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner-general of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), said on Friday. “To protect the agency’s ability to deliver humanitarian assistance, I have taken the decision to immediately terminate the contracts of these staff members and launch an investigation in order to establish the truth without delay.” Lazzarini did not disclose the number of employees allegedly involved in the attacks, nor the nature of their alleged involvement. He said, however, that “any UNRWA employee who was involved in acts of terror” would be held accountable, including through criminal prosecution. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was “horrified by this news”, according to his spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric. He added that the UN chief had asked Lazzarini to conduct a probe to ensure any UNRWA employee guilty of abetting the October 7 attacks be terminated and referred for potential criminal prosecution. The US Department of State said it was troubled by the allegations, which it said pertained to 12 UNRWA employees. It said it would provide no additional funding to the agency until the allegations were addressed. “The Department of State has temporarily paused additional funding for UNRWA while we review these allegations and the steps the United Nations is taking to address them,” spokesperson Matthew Miller said. European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a statement that the 27-member bloc would “assess further steps and draw lessons based on the result of the full and comprehensive investigation”. UNRWA, whose biggest donors in 2022 included the US, Germany and the EU, has repeatedly said its capacity to render humanitarian assistance to people in Gaza is on the verge of collapse. Established in 1949 following the first Arab-Israeli war, the agency provides services including schooling, primary healthcare and humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. Since the onset of the war on Gaza, Israeli authorities, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, have accused it of fuelling anti-Israeli incitement – allegations it denies. UNRWA says it has provided aid to desperate people in Gaza and used its facilities to shelter those fleeing Israeli attacks. The agency’s shelters have also been repeatedly targeted by Israeli missiles during the war, despite pleas for safe passages to deliver humanitarian aid and assistance.

"What has the ICJ ordered Israel to do on Gaza war, and what’s next?","The court did not order a ceasefire, but effectively put Israel on notice over the war.","The International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued Israel with six orders in relation to its bombardment of Gaza on Friday, but stopped short of calling for a full ceasefire. The emergency measures were announced as the court begins its deliberations on South Africa’s genocide case against Israel, for which it heard evidence earlier this month. South Africa has described Israel’s actions in Gaza as genocide but Israel has rejected the allegation, claiming that its activities in Gaza stem from “self-defence”, and are necessary to root out Hamas. It has added that the war cannot end until that goal has been achieved. In a 45-minute judgement at the court in the Hague on Friday, presiding judge Joan Donoghue rejected Israel’s claim that the court lacks jurisdiction to hear South Africa’s case against it. Israel said that South Africa failed to adequately communicate with Tel Aviv about the case before filing the application, as is required by the court’s own rules. However, the court rejected this argument, stating that South Africa had made a complaint to the Israeli embassy in Pretoria, to which Israel had clearly responded. Therefore a “dispute” over the interpretation of the law relating to genocide exists. South Africa has clear standing to submit its case, the court ruled. South Africa had also requested nine emergency measures be taken against Israel by the court. The ICJ directed Israel to implement six. Israel’s war on Gaza has already killed more than 26,000 Palestinians in the besieged enclave. Israel’s blockade on the strip has also severely restricted access to food, water, fuel and medical support. Here is what you need to knowabout the ruling, its impact, and what might happen next. The ICJ confirmed that it does have jurisdiction to hear the case submitted by South Africa and issued six emergency orders to Israel, as follows: Measure approved by a vote of 15-2. Dissenting judges: Judge Julia Sebutinde of Uganda and the Israeli representative, Judge Aharon Barak. Measure approved by a vote of 15-2. Dissenting judges: Judge Sebutinde of Uganda and the Israeli representative, Judge Barak. Measure approved by a vote of 16-1. Dissenting judge: Judge Sebutinde of Uganda. Measure approved by a vote of 16-1. Dissenting judge: Judge Sebutinde of Uganda. Measure approved by a vote of 15-2. Dissenting judges: Judge Sebutinde of Uganda and the Israeli representative, Judge Barak. Measure approved by a vote of 15-2. Dissenting judges: Judge Sebutinde of Uganda and the Israeli representative, Judge Barak. South Africa’s 84-page lawsuit, filed on December 29, 2023, accused Israel of violating the 1948 Genocide Convention in the war on Gaza that began on October 7, 2023. South Africa asked the court to order Israel to: As members of the United Nations, both South Africa and Israel are bound by the court’s rulings and cannot appeal a decision. However, the ICJ itself does not have any mechanism to enforce its orders. South Africa or other nations could also go to the UN Security Council (UNSC), where member states would be asked to vote to require Israel to abide by the emergency measures ordered by the ICJ. On previous occasions since the war on Gaza began, the US has used its power of veto to block resolutions calling for a ceasefire and for accountability of its close ally, Israel. However, experts say that Washington’s veto of an ICJ-approved decisioncould damageand undermine US President Joe Biden’s calls for others – including rivals like China and Russia – to uphold the international rules-based order. “This could make a real difference for the US administration and certainly a pose real dilemma for it,” James Bays, Al Jazeera English’s diplomatic editor said, reporting from The Hague. If the UNSC passes a resolution requiring Israel to abide by the orders of the ICJ, it would have the power to takepunitive actionagainst Israel. Past examples of this have included economic or trade sanctions, arms embargoes and travel bans. The UN charter also allows the Council to go a step further and intervene with force. Anexample of thiswas the 1991 US-led military alliance that was created to counter the invasion of Kuwait by the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein. Experts believe it is highly unlikely that the US will allow the Security Council to take any such step against Israel. Neve Gordon, professor of international law at Queen Mary University of London, added that countries, such as the US, would now have to seriously rethink using a veto or even normalisation of diplomatic ties with Israel. “It’s a new ballgame now, where the highest court in the world is saying, prima facie [on first impression], Israel is committing genocide”, he said. Friday’s ruling was just an interim ruling to address the emergency measures requested by South Africa. Israel is required to submit its report on the actions it is taking to fulfil the above emergency orders by February 26 – one month from Friday’s ruling. South Africa will then be given the chance to respond to this report. The court will then assess the report and additional information on Gaza’s on-ground realities. It could conclude that Israel is not abiding by the first provisions and impose new ones. The court will then also move forward with additional hearings and deliberations on the evidence presented to the court earlier this month by South Africa supporting its accusations against Israel, and of Israel’s defence. The judges will individually evaluate South Africa’s key claims in relation to genocide in Gaza, and the court’s eventual ruling will be determined by a majority. The court said its decision to move forward with the case was based on its conclusion that South Africa’s evidence alleging genocide by Israel could not be ruled out “prima facie”. Gordon said that this is “major”. Experts have itcould bethree or four years before a judgement is passed. Also called the World Court, the ICJ is a UN civil court that adjudicates disputes between countries. It is distinct from the International Criminal Court (ICC), which prosecutes individuals for war crimes. The ICJ comprises 15 judges who are appointed for terms of nine years through elections at the UN General Assembly (UNGA) and the Security Council (UNSC). For this case, they are joined by two special representative judges – Deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke from South Africa and Supreme Court President Aharon Barak from Israel. Judges are supposed to be impartial but in the past,some have votedin line with their countries’ politics. For instance, when Ukraine approached the ICJ seeking provisional measures against Russia, including an order that the Kremlin halt its war, 13 out of 15 judges voted in favour of Kyiv’s request. The only two who did not were the judges from Russia and China. On Friday, the only two judges who dissented from all or some of the measures imposed by the court were Judge Julia Sebutinde of Uganda, who voted against all of the orders, and Judge Aharon Barak, who voted against four of the six orders. Judge Sebutinde released her dissenting opinion, in which she argued that she did not agree that Israel had shown “intent” to commit genocide and, therefore, the case did not fall within the remit of the ICJ. Although the ICJ stipulated that Israel must abide by the 1948 Genocide Convention, it stopped short of calling for a ceasefire or suspension of hostilities. “I see no way that Israel can abide by the other provisional measures without stopping its hostilities,” said Gordon, noting that steps like increased humanitarian aid would require a ceasefire. Previous reports have shown that broken roads and continued Israeli bombardment have obstructed aid from being effectively disbursed in the enclave. Additionally, the provisional measure calling to punish those who incite genocide in Gaza would likely not apply to members of Israel’s Knesset, as they have parliamentary immunity. The Knesset would have to vote to revoke a member’s immunity before punishing them, which Gordon says is unlikely considering the majority of them support Israel’s war on Gaza. Nonetheless, Israel would have to try and punish non-parliamentarians, including troops and commentators, for statements that call for the mass killing of Palestinians. Furthermore, the court made special reference to comments made by three senior Israeli officials which it deemed to show genocidal intent. Gordon said that the court’s reference to these statements made by officials, including Israeli President Izaac Herzog, was “extremely important”. It showed that the court “clearly” disagrees with Israeli interpretations that such comments are sporadic and have no causal relation with the country’s military operations, he said. Neil Sammonds, senior campaigner on Palestine at the human rights group, War on Want, said it would be difficult to enforce the measures ordered by the court, however. “This leaves everything in Israel’s hands. There are no specifics about how Israel should bring in more aid and Netanyahu has already said Israel will not abide by the court’s ruling.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/26/what-has-the-icj-ordered-israel-to-do-on-gaza-war-and-whats-next
World reacts to ICJ interim ruling in Gaza genocide case against Israel,"Ruling on South Africa’s requests, top UN court orders Israel to take all measures to prevent acts of genocide but does not call for ceasefire.","The International Court of Justice (ICJ)delivered its interim rulingon the emergency measures requested by South Africa in its genocide case against Israel over its war in Gaza. The top United Nations court in The Hague on Friday did not order a ceasefire in Gaza but told Israel to take measures to prevent and punish direct incitement of genocide in the besieged enclave. ICJ President Joan Donoghue noted that the court had found sufficient evidence of dispute for the genocide case and said it would not throw it out. Israel has also been ordered to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza and has been asked to report back to the court within a month about how it is upholding the court’s orders. Here are some global reactions: Palestine’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates welcomed the ruling, saying it is an “important reminder” that no state is above the law. Foreign Minister Riyadh Malikinotedthat Israel failed to persuade the court that it was not violating the 1948 Genocide Convention. “The ICJ judges saw through Israel’s politicisation, deflection, and outright lies. They assessed the facts and the law and ordered provisional measures that recognised the gravity of the situation on the ground and the veracity of South Africa’s application,” he said. “Palestine calls on all states to ensure respect for the order of the International Court of Justice, including by Israel.” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu slammed the ruling as “outrageous”. In a video message shortly after the court order, he said Israel is fighting a “just war like no other”, adding that it will continue to defend itself and its citizens while adhering to international law.    Far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir mocked the ICJ, writing on X: “Hague shmague”. The South African governmentcalledthe ruling a “decisive victory” for international law and said it hoped Israel would not act to frustrate the application of the court’s orders. The ruling marked a significant milestone in the search for justice for the Palestinian people, the government said, adding that South Africa will continue to act within global institutions to protect the rights of the Palestinians in Gaza. Outside the ICJ headquarters in The Hague, Naledi Pandor, South Africa’s minister of international relations, told reporters that Israel will have to halt fighting in Gaza if it wants to adhere to the court’s orders. “How do you provide aid and water without a ceasefire,” Pandor asked. “If you read the order, by implication, a ceasefire must happen.”    Hamas hailed the court’s “important” ruling, saying it “contributes to isolating Israel”. “The [International] Court of Justice’s decision is an important development which contributes to isolating Israel and exposing its crimes in Gaza,” it said in a statement. The US said the ICJ ruling was consistent with Washington’s view that Israel has the right to take action, in accordance with international law, to ensure the October 7 attack cannot be repeated. “We continue to believe that allegations of genocide are unfounded and note the court did not make a finding about genocide or call for a ceasefire in its ruling and that it called for the unconditional, immediate release of all hostages being held by Hamas,” a State Department spokesperson said. Palestinians in Gaza said theywere devastatedby the court’s decision not to order Israel to cease its near-four-month bombardment and ground invasion of the enclave. Ahmed al-Naffar, 54, who was intently following the court’s announcement in central Gaza’s Deir el-Balah, told Al Jazeera: “Although I don’t trust the international community, I had a small glimmer of hope that the court would rule on a ceasefire in Gaza,” later adding that “the court is a failure”. Displaced Palestinian Mohammad al-Minawi, 45, shared a similar view. “I am not optimistic … Unfortunately, no one can stop Israel,” he told Al Jazeera.    Lubna Farhat, a member of the Ramallah city council, told Al Jazeera she was somewhat disappointed by the decision but acknowledged it was a historic moment. “We are very grateful and thankful for South Africa for filing this case, but what Palestinians aspired for was an immediate ceasefire,” Farhat said, adding that it was disheartening that the court did not call for an end to Israel’s military operations so humanitarian aid could be allowed into Gaza. She said the ruling would only “escalate” settler attacks in the occupied West Bank and increase the attackers’ sense of impunity. Welcoming the interim ruling, Qatar said Israel must adopt all measures to stop committing acts under the Genocide Convention in its war against Gaza. It said in a statement that Qatar considers the ruling a humanitarian win and a victory for the rule of law and international justice. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Egypt was looking forward to the ICJ “demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, as the court ruled in similar cases”, stressing the need to respect and implement the court’s decisions. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan welcomed the ruling, saying he hoped it would halt attacks against civilians. “We hope that Israel’s attacks against women, children and the elderly will come to an end,” Erdogan said, and called the ruling “valuable”. Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian called for Israeli authorities to be “brought to justice” after the ruling, according to Iranian state media reports. Amirabdollahian also congratulated South Africa and the Palestinian people on the “success” at the ICJ. “Today, the officials of the fake Israeli regime are the most hated people in the world’s public opinion who must be brought to justice immediately for committing genocide and unprecedented war crimes against Palestinians,” he wrote on X. “I must emphasise that the White House’s all-around support for the crimes of the Zionists will also never be forgotten and is considered and followed up by public opinion,” Amirabdollahian added. Saudi Arabia expressed approval for the emergency measures recommended by the ICJ. A statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the kingdom reiterated “its categorical rejection of the Israeli occupation’s practices and violations of the United Nations Convention on genocide”. A spokesperson for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said while the government respects “the role and independence of the ICJ”, it has “considerable concerns about this case, which is not helpful in the goal of achieving a sustainable ceasefire”. “Israel has the right to defend itself against Hamas”, the spokesperson told Al Jazeera, adding that “our view is that Israel’s actions in Gaza cannot be described as a genocide, which is why we thought South Africa’s decision to bring the case was wrong and provocative”. The UK welcomed the court’s call for the immediate release of captives and the need to get more aid into Gaza. “We are clear that an immediate pause is necessary to get aid in and hostages out, and then we want to build towards a sustainable, permanent ceasefire, without a return to the fighting.” “Malaysia has been vindicated in her call for Israel to be held accountable for the atrocities, crimes against humanity, and genocide committed on the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, following the landmark ruling by the International Court of Justice 26 January 2024,” the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. Malaysia said it looked forward to the upcoming proceedings in the case and reiterated its calls for Palestine to be admitted as a full member of the UN and recognised as a state based on the pre-1967 borders. Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said in a statement: “Our support for the ICJ does not mean that we accept the premise of the case brought by South Africa. It is for the ICJ to make a final decision on the case, which it has not done today.” “Canada will continue to support Israel’s right to exist and defend itself, in accordance with international law,” Joly said. “Canada continues to support urgent international efforts towards a sustainable ceasefire. This cannot be one-sided. Hamas must release all hostages, stop using Palestinian civilians as human shields, and lay down its arms,” she said. Diana Buttu, a Palestinian-Canadian lawyer and former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organization, slammed Canada’s response, posting on social media: “Awful statement by Canada re ICJ. Included in it are racist Israeli talking points [re: ‘human shields’] with the added touch of demanding more humanitarian supplies. Disgusting.” Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez called on the parties to implement the interim measures the court decreed. “We will continue to advocate for peace and an end to the war, the release of hostages, access to humanitarian aid and the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, so that both nations can coexist in peace and security,” Sanchez said in a post on X. Spain’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, European Union and Cooperation said: “Once again, Spain reiterates its call for an immediate ceasefire, the unconditional release of the hostages, immediate and regular humanitarian access and the need to move towards establishing the two-state solution.” Micheal Martin, the Irish minister for foreign affairs,welcomedthe court’s orders, which he said were “final and binding”. He added that Ireland expects Israel to implement the court’s orders “in good faith and as a matter of urgency”. “Bringing about an end to this conflict and to the death and destruction in Gaza is a priority that must be pursued on all fronts – political, diplomatic, humanitarian and legal,” he added in a statement. Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf said in a post on X that the ICJ order is “clear”. “The killing and destruction in Gaza must stop. Urgent humanitarian assistance must be provided to prevent more suffering. Hostages must be released immediately,” he said. “With such death and destruction, we will continue to call for an immediate ceasefire.” It called on Israel to comply with the court’s ruling and allow immediate delivery of humanitarian assistance to Palestinians. Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock refrained from openly criticising Israel’s military offensive but underlined that it must obey its international obligations. “The International Court of Justice did not rule on the merits of the case but ordered provisional measures in interim proceedings. These are binding under international law. Nevertheless, Israel must also comply with them,” Baerbock said. The Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs said it is deeply committed to respecting international law, and reaffirmed its confidence in and support for the ICJ. “Orders of the International Court of Justice are binding on the parties and they must comply with them. The European Union expects their full, immediate and effective implementation,” the European Commission said in a statement. Lawmakers from The Left in the European Parliament party called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. They noted that while the court has ordered Israel to “take all measures within its power” to prevent and punish acts of genocide in Gaza, complying with the order “means an unconditional, immediate and permanent ceasefire now”. The European Parliament’s Socialists and Democrats Group pledged “full support to the role and work of the ICJ and primacy of the UN Charter and International Law”. In a post on X, the group’s president, Iratxe Garcia Perez, said it is “now crucial that Israel fully complies with the interim ruling, implements without delay necessary measures regarding the Genocide Convention and the Gaza humanitarian situation and all hostages are released by Hamas”. It said the ruling was important and “Israel must comply with key ICJ ruling ordering it do all in its power to prevent genocide against Palestinians in Gaza”. “Today’s decision is an authoritative reminder of the crucial role of international law in preventing genocide and protecting all victims of atrocity crimes. It sends a clear message that the world will not stand by in silence as Israel pursues a ruthless military campaign to decimate the population of the Gaza Strip and unleash death, horror and suffering against Palestinians on an unprecedented scale,” Agnes Callamard, secretary-general of the rights group, said. Balkees Jarrah, associate international justice director at HRW, described the ruling as a “landmark decision that puts Israel and its allies on notice that immediate action is needed to prevent genocide and further atrocities” against the people of Gaza. “Lives hang in the balance, and governments need to urgently use their leverage to ensure that the order is enforced. The scale and gravity of civilian suffering in Gaza driven by Israeli war crimes demands nothing less,” Jarrah said. She noted that the court’s “clear and binding orders raise the stakes for Israel’s allies to back up their stated commitment to a global rules-based order by helping ensure compliance with this watershed ruling”. Kenneth Roth, HRW’s former executive director, said in a post on X that it was “noteworthy” that even the Israeli judge, Aharon Barak, joined the court “on the points of preventing and punishing incitement to genocidal acts and allowing enough humanitarian aid to stop severe deprivation”. The Belgian government called on Israel to “fully implement” ICJ’s court order. “Belgium takes note of the order of the International Court of Justice on the request for the indication of provisional measures. We call upon Israel to fully implement the provisional measures of the Court’s order,” Prime Minister Alexander De Croo, said in a statement on X . De Croo said that Belgium will “closely follow” the proceedings by the ICJ. “In the meantime, we call upon all parties to the conflict in Gaza to respect an immediate ceasefire, respect International Humanitarian Law and grant permanent and unimpeded humanitarian access, for all hostages to be immediately and unconditionally released and to work towards a two- state solution,” he added.

ICJ rules Israel must prevent acts of genocide in Gaza: Key takeaways,The International Court of Justice hand down a highly anticipated ruling in South Africa’s case against Israel over genocidal acts in Gaza.,"The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has delivered its highly anticipated interim ruling in South Africa’s case against Israel over alleged genocidal acts in Gaza. Here are thehighlightsof the provisional measures ordered on Friday by the court in a case that has drawn global interest: The World Court ordered Israel to take action to prevent acts of genocide as it wages war against the Hamas group in the Gaza Strip. In the ruling, 15 of the 17 judges on the ICJ voted for emergency measures that covered most of what South African had asked for, with the notable exception of ordering a halt to Israeli military action in Gaza. Israel’s military operation has laid waste to much of the densely populated enclave and killed more than 26,000 Palestinians in nearly four months, according to Gaza health authorities. The war has now carried on for more than 100 days since Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, killing 1,139 people and taking 240 captive. The court stopped short of calling for an immediate ceasefire. Less than two years ago in March 2022, it had ordered Russia to halt its war on Ukraine after Kyiv took Moscow to the ICJ. On Friday, the ICJ refrained from repeating the interim measures it had ordered against Russia — which Moscow has ignored. South African Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor, who was at the court when the judges delivered their ruling, said she had been “hoping” for the provisional measures to include the order of a ceasefire. But Pandor also argued that she did not see how Israel could implement the measures directed by the ICJ without a ceasefire.  Israel had insisted in its arguments this month that the ICJ did not have jurisdiction in the case. But on Friday, Judge Joan Donoghue, the president of the ICJ, said the court had concluded that it could rule on the matter and specifically that it could order provisional measures. She highlighted South Africa’s prior public statements suggesting that Israel might have violated its commitments under the 1948 Genocide Convention. Additionally, Donoghue pointed out that Israel has consistently rejected any allegations of genocide in Gaza. She highlighted the opposing positions held by the involved parties to underline that a dispute exists between the two parties. Donoghue said that, based on the evidence presented, some of the acts and omissions by Israel and its officials seem to fall within the scope of the Genocide Convention. The court also warned Israel to “take all measures in its power to prevent” acts that could fall under the Genocide Convention, set up as the world grappled with the horrors of the Holocaust. It also said Israel should “prevent and punish” any incitement to genocide. South Africa has accused Israel of “genocidal” acts intended to cause the “destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group”. It had urged the court to order Israel to “immediately suspend” its military operations in Gaza and allow humanitarian aid to reach civilians there. The judges ruled that Israel must report to the court within a month on what it is doing to uphold the order to take all measures within its power to prevent acts of genocide in Gaza. Donoghue said the ruling creates international legal obligations for Israel.    The court also ruled Israel must promptly implement “immediate and effective” measures to guarantee the delivery of urgently required humanitarian aid and basic services to Gaza. Hamas, which has governed Gaza for the past 16 years, hailed the court’s “important” ruling, saying it “contributes to isolating Israel”. “The [International] Court of Justice’s decision is an important development which contributes to isolating Israel and exposing its crimes in Gaza,” it said in a statement.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/26/icj-rules-israel-must-prevent-acts-of-genocide-in-gaza-key-takeaways
ICJ orders Israel to prevent acts of genocide in Gaza,"Provisional court ruling calls for emergency measures, says Israel must ‘prevent and punish’ incitement to commit genocide.","The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has ordered Israel to take action to prevent acts of genocide in Gaza and provide humanitarian aid to Palestinians, though it did not call on it to immediately stop its military campaign. The court did not rule at this stage on the core of the case brought by South Africa – whether genocide has occurred in Gaza – but an overwhelming majority of its 17 judges presiding over the case voted on Friday foremergency measures to be implemented. Delivering its interim ruling, the court ordered six provisional measures. It said Israel must take all steps within its power to prevent the commission of acts within the scope of Article 2 of the 1948 Genocide Convention. Israel must also prevent its troops from committing genocidal acts, prevent incitement to commit genocide, allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza, and take effective measures to ensure the preservation of evidence related to allegations under the Genocide Convention. The ruling also called for Israel to report to the court in one month on its steps to implement the measures. The court did not order a cessation of hostilities in Gaza, where Israel’s military action has killed more than 26,000 Palestinians since the war began on October 7. But it did urge Israel to bring more measures to protect Palestinians, which it called a protected group under the Genocide Convention. Delivering the judgement, Court President Joan E Donoghue said there is sufficient evidence of dispute for the genocide case to proceed, and that the ICJ has the jurisdiction to rule on the matter. In the meantime, until a final ruling is delivered, she said the court was “of the view that Israel must take measures within its power to prevent and punish the direct and public incitement to commit genocide”.    Fifteen of the 17 judges voted for all the emergency measures to be implemented. Uganda’s Julia Sebutinde was the only judge to vote against all the measures. Israeli judge Aharon Barak, one of the judges sitting at The Hague, said, “Although I am convinced there is no plausibility of genocide,” he voted for two of the measures. He said he joined the majority “in the hope that the measure will help to decrease tensions and discourage damaging rhetoric”. Barak added he voted in favour of the measure on getting aid to Gaza in the hope that it “will alleviate the consequences of the armed conflict for the most vulnerable”. Thomas Macmanus, a law professor at Queen Mary University in London, told Al Jazeera he was not surprised that the court did not ask for a ceasefire because, in a way, it would “render Israel defenceless against an attack, and that’s not really within the purview of the court in this case”. “But what they are asking … they asked to stop the killing,” he said. “Maybe not a total cessation of hostility, and maybe now Israel can have very targeted counterterrorism operations, but they cannot continue with the attack on Gaza as we have seen over the last hundred or more days,” he added. South Africa hailed the decision and called it a “decisive victory” for international law. “South Africa sincerely hopes that Israel will not act to frustrate the application of this Order, as it has publicly threatened to do, but that it will instead act to comply with it fully, as it is bound to do,” South Africa’s Department of International Relations and Cooperation said in a statement. Palestinian Minister of Foreign Affairs Riyadh Maliki issued a statement on the ruling and welcomed the order, calling it an “important reminder” that no one is above the law. “It breaks Israel’s entrenched culture of criminality and impunity, which has characterised its decades-long occupation, dispossession, persecution, and apartheid in Palestine,” he said. Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told the Reuters news agency that the ruling was a significant development that contributed to isolating Israel and exposing its crimes in Gaza. “We call for forcing the occupation to implement the court’s decisions,” he added. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu slammed the ruling and reiterated that Israel had an “inherent right to defend itself” and that the “vile attempt” to deny this right was “blatant discrimination against the Jewish state”. While the ICJ’s decisions are final and cannot be appealed, the court also cannot enforce the measures.

What the ICJ’s interim ruling means for Israel’s war on Gaza,"The ICJ’s provisional measures stop short of calling for a ceasefire, but could make the war harder for Israel to wage, say experts.","The International Court of Justice on Friday issued a series of provisional measures that require Israel to comply with the 1948 Genocide Convention, allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza and act against those who issue genocidal statements. The World Court’s interim ruling, in a case brought by South Africa accusing Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, stopped short of ordering Israel to pause or stop its devastating war on Gaza, which has killed more than 26,000 Palestinians in the enclave since October 7. But it rejected Israel’s contention that the court did not have the jurisdiction to direct provisional measures and iterated that its findings were binding. The Palestinian Authority welcomed the ruling. “The ICJ ruling is an important reminder that no state is above the law or beyond the reach of justice,” Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyadh Maliki said in a statement. “It breaks Israel’s entrenched culture of criminality and impunity, which has characterised its decades-long occupation, dispossession, persecution, and apartheid in Palestine.” While the court itself does not have the power to enforce the interim ruling, or indeed the final verdict it delivers in the case, its directives on Friday could influence the war in Gaza, said analysts. Pressure has been mounting on Israel and its American backers in recent weeks, as global calls for a ceasefire continue to pick up steam. Friday’s ruling does not determine whether Israel is committing genocide, as South Africa has alleged. But Judge Joan Donahue, the current president of the ICJ, said while announcing the provisional measures that the court had concluded that the “catastrophic situation” in Gaza could get much worse by the time it delivers its final verdict, necessitating provisional measures. “The ruling sends a strong message to Israel that the court views the situation as very serious and that Israel should do what it can to perform restraint in carrying out its military campaign,” said Michael Becker, an assistant professor of international human rights law at Trinity College in Dublin who also served as an associate legal officer at the International Court of Justice in The Hague from 2010 to 2014. The ICJ in its provisional measures did not order Israel to stop its military campaign in Gaza. South Africa had requested such a cease-and-desist directive in its request for provisional measures, citing the prospect of genocide in Gaza. The court had ordered Russia to halt its war in Ukraine in March 2022, a month after it had launched an invasion of Ukraine, though Moscow has ignored that ruling. So, Israel would not be in violation of the ICJ’s Friday directives in continuing with a war that it insists it will pursue until it has decimated Hamas, the Palestinian armed group that attacked southern Israel on October 7, killing nearly 1,200 people and abducting 240 others. Yet, the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will likely be under greater scrutiny than ever over the actions of its soldiers in Gaza and the statements of its leaders and generals. Israel is required, under the ICJ’s ruling, to submit a report within a month showing that it is complying with the provisional measures. South Africa will have the chance to pick holes in Israel’s claims. When South Africa filed its case at the ICJ in late December, Israeli officials dismissed it as “lies” and accused the South Africans of “hypocrisy”. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that Israel would not be swayed by any ruling. “We will restore security to both the south and the north,” Netanyahuwroteon the platform known as X, formerly Twitter, from the official account of the Israeli Prime Minister. “Nobody will stop us – not The Hague, not the axis of evil and not anybody else.” But even if Israel decides not to abide by the ICJ’s ruling, there will be pressure on its international backers. “Israeli politicians have already said that they’re going to ignore the ICJ order,” Mark Lattimer, the executive director of Ceasefire Centre for Civilian Rights, told Al Jazeera. “It is much harder for, particularly, the US and European states including the UK, to ignore the order because they have a much stronger record of holding or supporting the International Court of Justice.” Legal experts expect Israel’s allies in the West, including the US, to respect the ICJ’s ruling. To fail to do so would have serious repercussions. It would undermine the “credibility of the rules-based international order that the US claims to uphold”, Lattimer said. He added that it would also “entrench a growing divide” between the US and Western countries versus states in the Global South which view those claims of “upholding global order” with scepticism. While the ruling itself does not call for a ceasefire, it could make it harder for Israel’s allies to continue to stonewall global efforts to bring the war to a halt. “The ICJ ruling puts a lot more pressure on the US and other Western allies to move on a ceasefire resolution,” Zaha Hassan, a human rights lawyer and a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told Al Jazeera. “It makes it a lot harder for the US, along with Israel, to make the case to Western governments that are still very much concerned with international legitimacy, to maintain the idea that Israel is acting within the constraints of international law in Gaza and that it’s acting in self-defence.” Some evidence suggests that Israel knows this, too. Soon after South Africa announced that it would bring a case before the ICJ, Israel’s tactics on the ground started to change, experts said. There was “a rush to wipe out any possibility for a Palestinian return to the north of Gaza”, Hassan said, pointing to controlled bombings of universities and hospitals. “Once you have hospitals taken out, you make it impossible for people in war to stay. That’s a part of a strategy to force Palestinian population transfer and permanent displacement.” But this may be an acknowledgement that the time Israel has to carry out its military campaign is running out. “There needs to be enough international pressure to essentially create more incentives for a negotiated ceasefire,” Lattimer said. “The ICJ order is a major contribution.” The US, in particular, has provided military aid that Israel is reliant on to continue to wage war. President Joe Biden circumvented US Congresstwice in less than a monthto greenlight emergency weapons sales to Israel. The Biden administration claims it has asked Israel to protect civilian life but that has not shielded it from heavy criticism, including internally, for failing to convince Israel to hold higher regard for innocent lives in Gaza. “This administration is concerned with the growing number of members of Congress, particularly moderate Democrats in the Senate who are raising red flags about the misuse of US weapons and the potential for US complicity if they continue to send unconditional supplies to Israel,” Hassan said. The ICJ ruling could add steam to the push for a ceasefire in Gaza and for the US to insist on a higher level of accountability when it comes to Israeli military action. “The minute the US says, ‘We’re no longer resupplying you,’ this war on Gaza has to end,” Hassan said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/26/what-the-icjs-interim-ruling-means-for-israels-war-on-gaza
US warned Iran of terror threat ahead of twin suicide bombings in Kerman,ISIL (ISIS) claimed responsibility for the attack in the southeastern city that killed nearly 100 people and wounded scores.,"The United States government had privately warned Iran that ISIL (ISIS) was preparing to carry out a terrorist attack ahead of the coordinated suicide bombings that killed nearly 100 people in the southeastern city of Kerman. The confidential alert came after the US acquired intelligence that ISIL’s affiliate in Afghanistan was plotting to attack Iran, a US official said on Thursday. “The US government followed a longstanding ‘duty to warn’ policy that has been implemented across administrations to warn governments against potential lethal threats,” said the official, who requested anonymity. “We provide these warnings in part because we do not want to see innocent lives lost in terror attacks.” On January 3,two suicide bombingsin Kerman were carried out during a memorial for slain commander Qassem Soleimani, killed in a US drone attack in 2020. Soleimani, the head of the elite Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), was killed in a strike in Iraq ordered by then-US President Donald Trump. The ISIL armed group claimed responsibility on January 4 for the attack in Kerman, about 820km (510 miles) southeast of the capital, Tehran.    After the bombings, at least 35 people were arrested across the country, Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence said. Authorities said they had identified the alleged ringleader as a Tajik national known by his alias Abdollah Tajiki. He had entered Iran in mid-December by crossing the southeastern border and left two days before the attack after making the bombs, according to a statement from the ministry. Iranian forces subsequently struck targetsin Iraq and Syria, allegedly linked to ISIL. The IRGC said the targets hit included the alleged headquarters of the Israeli spy agency Mossad in Erbil, capital of Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdish region. Tehran frequently alleges that both Israel and the US support anti-Iran armed groups involved in past attacks. In 2022, ISIL claimed responsibility for an attack on an Iranian Shia shrine that killed 15 people. Earlier attacks attributed to ISIL include 2017 twin bombings targeting Iran’s parliament and the mausoleum of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the republic. Violence has flared across the Middle East since Hamas’sOctober 7 attackson Israel and the subsequent bombardment of Gaza by Israeli forces, which has now killed more than 26,000 Palestinians. The US accuses Iran of backing the Palestinian group Hamas, Yemen’s Houthi rebels, Lebanese Hezbollah and armed groups in Iraq. Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East programme at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington, DC, said the US warning may reflect a wider desire in Washington to seek dialogue with Tehran despite recent attacks by Iranian-backed proxies on US, Israeli and other Western interests. “This is an olive branch,” Alterman told the Reuters news agency, adding that US President Joe Biden’s administration came into office believing dialogue between Washington and Tehran could benefit both sides. The Biden administration has so far failed to revive the2015 accordreached between Tehran and world powers limiting Iran’s nuclear activities in exchange for lifting sanctions. The US unilaterally withdrew from the deal in 2018 under Trump, who maintained the deal was not doing enough, and imposed its harshest sanctions on Iran, which remain in effect.

"Qatar PM to meet Israel, US intel chiefs on new Gaza captives deal","CIA, Mossad heads to meet in Europe with Qatar officials to broker second captives-for-prisoners exchange and truce.","The director of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and his Israeli counterpart are to meet with Qatari officials to broker a potential second deal to secure the release of captives being held in Gaza and a pause in hostilities. The CIA’s William Burns and Mossad chief David Barnea will meet with Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani in Europe over the weekend, sources informed on the talks told Al Jazeera. US President Joe Biden’s administration has been actively working to secure the release ofabout 130 captivesstill being held by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups. Any new agreement between Israel and Hamas would also aim to bring about the longest cessation of hostilities since the war erupted in October, officials told The Washington Post, which first reported Burns’s travel. Egypt’s intelligence chief Abbas Kamel will also join the meeting. The key mediators are attempting to narrow the differences between Israel and Hamas on the duration of the truce and the number of captives to be released in exchange for Palestinians detained by Israel, according to Al Jazeera sources. Qatar, along with Egypt, has engaged in negotiations to mediate a truce in Gaza and ensure the entry of humanitarian aid into the besieged enclave. In November, it helped secure a weeklong pause in fighting in which more than 100 captives were released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.    White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters that the CIA chief has been “involved in helping us with the hostage deal that was in place and trying to help us pursue another one”. US ally Israel has vowed to eradicate Hamas, unleashing a torrent of attacks by air, land and sea that have flattened most of the Gaza Strip and killed at least26,083 peopleand injured more than 64,000, Palestinian health officials say. Al Jazeera’s Hoda Abdel-Hamid, reporting from Tel Aviv on leaks in Israeli media about a two-month ceasefire, said serious disagreements remain over any prospective Israel-Hamas deal. “The Israeli public is not given the full picture, because there are still many sticking points. Hamas has said over and over that it won’t agree to any deal unless it leads to a permanent ceasefire and an end to the war,” Abdel-Hamid said over the reported agreement that could see one Israeli captive freed in exchange for 100 Palestinian detainees taken from the occupied West Bank and Gaza. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled out any political settlement that would lead to the formation of a Palestinian state, and ending the war until Hamas is eradicated. Israel has proposed a 60-day pause in the fighting during which more than 100 captives would be released in phases, beginning with civilian women and children, the Reuters news agency reported. That would be followed by the release of civilian men, female soldiers and the remains of captives who died after being abducted by Hamas, according to the source quoted by Reuters. Such a plan would be at odds with Hamas’s last proposal demanding an end to the war, international guarantees that it would not start anew and the release of all detainees held by Israel, including those who participated in its October 7 attack on Israel. Al Jazeera’s Stefanie Dekker, reporting from occupied East Jerusalem, said that while apermanent ceasefirewas a “real sticking point”, news about the meeting suggests there seems to be some momentum towards reaching an agreement on other issues. “This is the first time that there seems to be some hope that possibly both sides can come to some form of understanding since the ceasefire collapsed at the beginning of December,” she added. Dekker said Netanyahu was under a lot of pressure domestically to do more to bring the captives home, including pressure fromtheir families. “The message from the families is very simple: Strike a deal. Whatever it takes,” she added.   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/26/qatar-pm-to-meet-israel-us-intel-chiefs-on-new-gaza-captives-deal
Has Israel realised that it can’t ‘eradicate’ Hamas?,"Israel vowed to eradicate Hamas, but now the group has resurfaced in northern Gaza after 112 days of war.","In early January, Israel announced that it was withdrawing some of its forces from northern Gaza after “dismantling” Hamas’s military activities in the region. Three months had passed since the start of its war on Gaza, more than 20,000 Palestinians had been killed and Israel had increasingly turned its attention to central and southern Gaza, here it has surrounded and targeted the city of Khan Younis in particular. But on January 16, Hamas launched 25 rockets from the northern Gaza strip at the southern Israeli city of Netivot. While no civilians were killed, the attack punched holes in the Israeli claim that it was on its way to destroying Hamas, even after more than 100 days of war. Since Hamas’s deadly attack on Israeli communities and military outposts on October 7, in which 1,139 people were killed, the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that it wants to “eradicate” the Palestinian armed group. At the time, many analysts warned that destroying the group was an unrealistic aim that would only compound the costs imposed on Gaza’s civilian population. Now, the fresh signs of Hamas regaining the ability to target Israel from northern Gaza further bolster those predictions. “I think [the rocket attacks] sends a message to Israelis at large that their goal at eradicating Hamas is failing,” said Omar H Rahman, an expert on Israel-Palestine with the Middle East Council on Global Affairs think tank. “If you can still fire rockets and if you can still attack troops – in the north of all places where Israel has laid siege for 112 days – then [the war aim of destroying Hamas] is failing,” he told Al Jazeera. Israel has vowed to destroyHamas’s vast tunnel networkunder Gaza. But so far, Israel has failed to substantially impede the movement of Hamas fighters underground, according to Oren Ziv, an Israeli commentator and a journalist with +972 magazine, a publication based in Tel Aviv. “I would estimate that Israel doesn’t have the full picture of where the tunnels connect from and how. And the fact we still see attacks from northern Gaza means that the tunnel system is still operating,” Ziv told Al Jazeera. According to Israeli military officials, as well as previous statements by Palestinians in Gaza and official statements by Hamas, the tunnels in the Gaza Strip are hundreds of kilometres long. For decades, they have been used to smuggle all sorts of civilian supplies, as well as weapons from Egypt. Hamas has used the tunnels for other means, including to ambush Israeli troops in Gaza and hide many of the 240 captives its fighters captured on October 7. Many of the captives were released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners during a short pause in fighting brokered in November. Israel believes that about 100 captives remain inside the tunnels and estimates that 25 have been killed in captivity – possibly as a result of its own heavy and indiscriminate bombardment of the Gaza Strip. Despite the danger that Israel’s war tactics pose to the captives, the Israeli military has tried to blow up a number of tunnels in Gaza and flood some with water from the Mediterranean. But released captives fear that this strategy could drown the Israelis still down there, according to conversations between them and Netanyahu, which were leaked to the press. “The Israeli government continues to oversell what it can accomplish through military means. It said that it can release Israeli hostages through military means, but with the exception of one hostage that has not proven to be the case,” said Hugh Lovatt, an expert on Israel-Palestine relations with the European Council on Foreign Relations. “Military action has actually killed hostages,” he told Al Jazeera. Despite the ordeal captives face, Palestinian civilians have borne the brunt of Israel’s loosely defined and unrealistic war aims, said Lovatt. He said that Israel claims to have killed 9,000 Hamas fighters out of a total of more than25,000 Palestinianskilled in the enclave, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. However, 70 percent of the victims are believed to be women and children. “My feeling is that Israel is treating every dead male [in Gaza] as Hamas,” Lovatt told Al Jazeera. Lovatt said he doubted the Israeli figure of 9,000 Hamas fighters killed so far. But “even if we take that number as accurate”, he said, that still leaves the vast majority of the armed group’s personnel alive and ready to fight. According to the CIA, Hamas has about 35,000 fighters in Gaza alone, Lovatt pointed out. “That shows there are still a lot of fighters in Gaza that will outlast Israel’s military operations.” While analysts agreed that Hamas won’t be “eradicated”, they acknowledged that the group’s military capabilities have been downgraded and risk being further reduced. But they stressed that Israel’s war tactics will ultimately embolden – not destroy – Hamas. “Israel is capable of reducing Hamas’ military capacity, but its collective punishment on Gaza’s civilian population is feeding the generational drivers of resistance in every way possible,” Rahman, from the Middle East Council for Global Affairs, told Al Jazeera. “And when it comes to capacity, that is one thing that can always be rebuilt.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/26/israel-hamas-resurface-north-gaza
Families of Israeli captives deny leaking Netanyahu Qatar tape,"In leaked audio, Israeli PM is heard criticising Doha in its role in negotiating the release of captives held by Hamas.","Families of Israelis held captive in Gaza have said denied they were behind the leak of audio in which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticised Qatar’s role in talks with Hamas over the release of the captives. “All conversations that take place in meetings with the Prime Minister are recorded by his office and his associates present at the meeting,” Haim Rubinstein, a spokesperson for the families, said on Thursday in a statement cited on Israeli media. “The families participating in the meeting had their phones taken at the entrance,” he said, adding that the leak was a “grave issue that indicates a loss of control”. His comment came a day after the prime minister’s office blamed one of the family members for the leak. Israeli media outlet Walla on Thurdsay reported that the prime minister’s office doubled down on blaming the families, saying that it has evidence in the form of a text message from one of their members present at the meeting. “The girl next to me had a phone, it’s a shame I didn’t tip her off,” the message reads, according to Walla. In the audio that triggered the controversy, which was aired on Tuesday by Israeli Channel 12, Netanyahu is heard saying that Qatar’s involvement in the release of captives was “problematic”. He also blamed Qatar for financing Hamas and said he was upset at a decision by the United States to extend the presence of a military base in the Gulf state. Majed Al-Ansari, the spokesperson for Qatar’s foreign ministry, responded to the remarks sayinghe was “appalled”. About 240 people were taken captive by Hamas fighters as they launched an unprecedented attack into southern Israel on October 7, killing at least 1,139 people, according to an Al Jazeera tally based on Israeli statistics. Israel responded with a devastating bombardment and ground invasion of Gaza, which has displaced more than 80 percent of the population and reduced much of the territory to rubble. Palestinian officials say at least 25,700 people have been killed and more than 63,000 wounded in the Israeli assault. Followinglengthy negotiations led by Qatarand the US, more than 100 of those captured were freed in late November in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails as Israel and Hamas observed a weeklong truce. The Gulf state remains involved in talks aimed at securing a new deal for the release of roughly 130 captives still being held by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups. Al-Ansari said Netanyahu’s leaked comments were detrimental to those efforts. “If the reported remarks are found to be true, the Israeli prime minister would only be obstructing and undermining the mediation process, for reasons that appear to serve his political career instead of prioritising saving innocent lives, including Israeli hostages,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/25/families-of-israeli-captives-deny-leaking-natanyahu-qatar-tape
Hamas blasts Israel’s plan to create buffer zone in Gaza as a ‘crime’,Israel is reportedly working to establish a 1km-wide ‘security belt’ around the Gaza Strip amid disapproval from the US and criticism from international experts.,"Israel’s efforts to create a buffer zone along its border withGazaconstitute a “crime” and act of “blatant aggression” against the Palestinian people, Hamas official Osama Hamdan has said, following media reports suggesting such a plan is under way. Hamdan, who is based in Lebanon, told reporters on Thursday that Israel was “looking to establish a security belt along the borders of the Strip by levelling entire residential blocks and by bulldozing farms and civilian infrastructure”. “This is a crime and a blatant aggression against our land and our holy places,” he said, adding that “our people and our resistance will foil these attempts.” Hamdan called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “delusional” and said Gaza would become the “cemetery” of his plans. He also blasted the United States for “feeding” the Israeli military machine and for its complicity in crimes against Gaza. Israel’s media on Wednesday reported that its military was aiming to create an informal buffer zone about a kilometre (half a mile) wide to prevent attackers from reaching Israeli communities near Gaza. Two TV channels ran footage showing what appeared to be a controlled demolition of several structures on the Gaza side of the border, which the broadcasters said was done in the area of an attack thatkilled 24 Israeli soldierson Monday, inflicting the military’s biggest loss of life in a single attack since October 7. Satellite images from Planet Labs PBC taken last Saturday, a day before the attack, appeared to show the uniform destruction of buildings and agricultural fields in the area. Military spokespeople have not used the term “buffer zone”, but say troops are uprooting infrastructure near the border to provide security for Israeli communities on the other side. The general secretary of the Palestinian National Initiative party, Mustafa Barghouti, said the real intention behind such a move is to diminish Gaza’s size. If executed, Barghouti told Al Jazeera, it could only be perceived as an act of “ethnic cleansing” while also signalling a recognition of the failure of Israel’s military goals in Gaza.    Geoffrey Nice, a former United Nations war crimes prosecutor, told Al Jazeera Israel has no grounds legally to create a “buffer zone” in Gaza by destroying Palestinian homes and confiscating agricultural land. “If you want to a demilitarised zone that you’re going to fill with landmines, why not have it on the Israeli side and stop people crossing it?” he asked. “What they’re proposing, effectively and in anyone’s interpretation, is occupation.” He noted the fertile farmland Israel is eyeing to take over is “crucial to Gaza’s economy”. “But the process has already started. A large number of buildings have already been flattened. It is unjustified, by any view, under international law,” said Nice, proposing sanctions by powerful nations against Israel to stop the landgrab. The US, which has staunchly supported what it says is Israel’s right to self-defence, said it is opposed to any attempt by Israel to shrink Gaza’s territory or to occupy it militarily. The US and much of the international community have proposed a post-war plan that includes the creation of a Palestinian state as part of atwo-state solutionto the conflict, a possibility that Netanyahu rejected. Barghouti said that if the US was serious about its opposition to the buffer zone, it would tell Israel to stop its attacks on Gaza. “The United States is a participant, unfortunately, in this war, and as long as they don’t support a ceasefire, they become the participant in the war crimes that are happening in Gaza,” he said. Al Jazeera’s Kimberly Halkett, reporting from Washington DC, said Israeli plans to create a buffer zone in Gaza are not going down well at the White House. “This is just another example of a growing rift between the [US President Joe] Biden administration and the Israeli government,” she said. “There is some scope for a transitional arrangement on a buffer zone, but the worry… is that historically, transitional arrangements have become permanent.”   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/25/hamas-blasts-israels-plan-to-create-buffer-zone-in-gaza-as-a-crime
Why is Canada asking Palestinians to list scars on Gaza visa applications?,Canada’s new temporary visa programme boasts strict requirements for Palestinians hoping to flee Israel’s war in Gaza.,"Montreal, Canada –Abdallah Alhamadni knows the clock is ticking. Every day, the 51-year-old Palestinian father of three checks to see whether his efforts to bring his relatives in Gaza to safety have advanced. But Alhamadni, a Canadian permanent resident who lives in Milton, Ontario, says he is stuck in a dangerous waiting game, as Israel continues to wage war on the Gaza Strip. “We feel paralysed, depressed, frustrated, crying,” he told Al Jazeera. “Sometimes we feel we need to be strong to support them because we are the only hope for them. It’s a lot of things coming together, and we are alone.” Originally from theJabalia refugee campin northern Gaza, Alhamadni is trying to bring 61 relatives, including 27 children, to Canada through a new temporary visa programme for Palestinians affected by Israel’s military offensive. Unveiled last month,the schemeallows Canadian citizens and permanent residents to apply to bring extended family members from Gaza to the country, where they will be granted a temporary residency visa for up to three years. But the process has prompted criticism from applicants and human rights advocates. Alhamadni called it confusing and time-consuming. Gaza remains under heavy Israeli fire and faces regular electricity and internet outages, so Alhamadni has struggled to reach his relatives and obtain the information necessary to complete the applications. The amount of personal details Palestinians are being asked to provide has also come under scrutiny, with Canadian immigration lawyers saying the process goes beyond what is typically required. One form (PDF) asks people to provide a detailed employment history going back to age 16, as well as links to social media accounts and a list of all their in-laws. It also asks applicants to detail any scars or injuries that required medical attention, including how they sustained them. “They are putting all [these] impossible conditions on top of our heads,” said Alhamadni, who told Al Jazeera that his relatives have been displaced multiple times since the war in Gaza began. “I’m trying [to do] whatever I can.” Marc Miller, Canada’s minister of immigration, refugees and citizenship, announced the opening of the temporary resident visa programme on January 9, three months after the war in Gaza began. The move came amid public calls for the Canadian government to do more to help residents of the besieged enclave.At least 25,900 Palestinianshave been killed in Israel’s bombardment of Gaza since the start of the war on October 7. Top United Nations officials have repeatedly called for a ceasefire as the territory reels from the mass displacement of its residents, a crippled healthcare system, and a lack of water, food and other humanitarian supplies. “The situation on the ground in Gaza is challenging and volatile,” Miller said in astatementannouncing the Canadian visa programme. “These new measures provide a humanitarian pathway to safety and recognize the importance of keeping families together given the ongoing crisis.” But Ottawa faced immediate criticism when it revealed it only planned to issue up to 1,000 temporary visas to Palestinians from Gaza — a cap that rights advocates said was too low. Millerlater saidthere was no strict limit on the number of applications that would be accepted. In an email to Al Jazeera, a spokesperson for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) said the programme “expires once 1,000 applications have been accepted into processing or one year after the public policy comes into effect, whichever comes first”.    “IRCC continues to be flexible as we assess the situation, including the volumes of applications received and the ability to facilitate eligible family members to leave Gaza and reach a safe third country,” the spokesman said. As of January 16, Canada was processing 144 applications, though none had been finalised, the spokesman added. The government also said there is no guarantee that applicants will be able to leave Gaza, which is under a strict Israeli siege. Egypt has also limited departures through the Rafah crossing at Gaza’s southern border, as part of a long-running blockade. “If people are able to leave Gaza, the security assessment will be completed in the third county where IRCC will be able to collect biometrics,” the IRCC spokesperson said. “IRCC will then finalize the [temporary resident visa] application and render a decision on whether [the] individual is approved to come to Canada.” According to Naseem Mithoowani, an immigration lawyer in Toronto, the Canadian government has failed to provide adequate information and clear communication about the visa programme, fuelling confusion in the Palestinian community. “People are anxious about the cap and whether that’s going to be expanded; how applications are being assessed in terms of their place in the queue; [and] why some people getting further ahead than others despite applying at the same time,” Mithoowani told Al Jazeera. “There’s a lack of transparency around the process itself.” She said Palestinian Canadians have also expressed concern about some of the programme requirements, including being able to provide financial support for their relatives from Gaza. They also have asked who will see the information provided in the applications and whether it will be shared with other countries. “The Palestinian community has lost a lot of trust in our government, and so that’s part of, I think, the increased anxiety levels or the increased need for communication in this particular case,” Mithoowani said.    Yameena Ansari, an immigration and refugee lawyer in Calgary, also said that, while the programme initially provided a “ray of hope” for many Palestinians in Canada, “their hopes were quickly dashed” when they understood its limited scope and requirements. “We have been informed that these very invasive questions that are being asked are coming from Canada. They’re not coming from Israel or Egypt,” she told Al Jazeera. Security checks are an ordinary part of the immigration process, Ansari explained. But “the idea of throwing that many forms at people who are trying to flee a crisis” is unfathomable. “Something that is never lost on me … is the cruelty of forms,” Ansari said. “We can be cruel to people in bureaucratic, administrative ways.” She also pointed out that what may appear to be a small barrier to applying could be insurmountable for someone grappling with violence and displacement. When asked about the outcry over the visa application’s questions, the IRCC spokesman told Al Jazeera that Canada is employing a “multi-stage security screening approach” to the Gaza visa programme. “This is part of a standard practice in crisis response situations where IRCC does not have a presence on the ground to initiate initial screening and collection of biometrics, as we did with Afghanistan,” the spokesman said. “The additional background information established in the form allows us to collect enhanced biographic information to begin conducting security screening while the applicant is still in Gaza.” Miller, Canada’s immigration minister, also has pointed to security concerns to justify the questions. “These are details that we need. We do not know who these people are; they are not Canadians, they are not permanent residents,”he told CBClast week. “Anyone that has any experience immigrating to Canada knows that there are a lot of intrusive questions, and coming to Canada — to be quite frank — is not a right. I think we do, on the other hand, have an obligation in this humanitarian catastrophe to do something,” Miller said. “A lot of sympathy for the people that have to go through this — I can’t imagine the situation they’re in. But we do need assurances about who we are getting out, and those details I do concede often can be intrusive.”    However, Julia Sande, a human rights law and policy campaigner at Amnesty International Canada, drew a contrast between Canada’s response to Israel’s war in Gaza and its reaction to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Just weeks after the war in Ukraine began in 2022, Ottawalauncheda special immigration pathway to allow Ukrainians and their immediate family members — including those without any ties to Canada — to seek safety in the country. There was no cap on the number of applicants. Some fees and other procedures were waived, and more than 210,000 Ukrainians have since arrived in Canada through the scheme, according togovernment figures. “The programme for Ukrainians fleeing was something, I guess, unusual when you compare it to Canada’s programmes historically, but it was wonderful,” Sande said. “It showed that Canada is more than capable of opening its arms and welcoming people fleeing dangerous situations.” Yet in the case of Gaza, Sande pointed out that the Canadian government has erected additional barriers for Palestinians “knowing that they’re fleeing abominable levels of suffering”. “On what basis are we treating civilians in Gaza differently? What assumptions are being made about them?” Sande asked. The process, she said, raises concerns about racism and the prospect that “Gazans are being painted as a security threat”. “The requirement to explain scars when you’re a population that’s been subjected to relentless bombardment, which Canada itself may be contributing to through itsarms exports to Israel— it’s absurd, it’s unconscionable,” she said. For Alhamadni, the wait drags on. His family’s visa requests remain in the early stages of the application process, and Alhamadni continues to be consumed with fear that the visas may be issued too late, if they’re issued at all. “My family is the [whole] world. My family is everything for me,” he said. “I can’t wait for a minute. In a minute, something will happen. One bomb will come.” Yet despite the hurdles, Alhamadni — who israising moneyto help pay for his relatives’ visa applications and their journeys to Canada — stressed that he has not lost hope. “I believe one day that we’ll have our freedom,” he told Al Jazeera. “One day the light will come. One day we’ll see a better future.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/25/why-is-canada-asking-palestinians-to-list-scars-on-gaza-visa-applications
US and Iraq agree to start talks to end presence of US-led coalition,US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin says talks will take place as part of a military commission that was agreed upon in August 2023.,"The United States and Iraq have agreed to start talks on the future of the US-led military coalition in Iraq with the aim of setting a timetable for a phased withdrawal of troops and the coalition’s end, both governments have announced. The US has had a continuous presence in Iraq since its 2003 invasion. US combat forces left in 2011, but thousands of troops returned in 2014 to help the Iraqi government defeat ISIL (ISIS). In the years since, the presence of US forces, who have remained there to conduct counter-ISIL missions and training, has been a lightning rod for an increasingly influential faction of Iran-aligned militias and politicians in Iraq. Iraq’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a statement on Thursday said Baghdad aims to “formulate a specific and clear timetable that specifies the duration of the presence of international coalition advisors in Iraq” and to “initiate the gradual and deliberate reduction of its advisors on Iraqi soil”, eventually leading to the end of the coalition mission. It added that Iraq is committed to ensuring the “safety of the international coalition’s advisors during the negotiation period in all parts of the country” and to “maintaining stability and preventing escalation”. US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said in a statement that the discussions will take place as part of a higher military commission that was agreed upon in August 2023 – before the outbreak ofIsrael’s war on Gazaon October 7 rocked the region – and will discuss the “transition to an enduring bilateral security partnership between Iraq and the United States”.     Iraq’s government says ISIL is defeated and the coalition’s job is over, but it is keen to explore establishing bilateral relations with coalition members, including military cooperation in training and equipment. Iraq also says the coalition’s presence has become a magnet for instability amid near-daily attacks by Iran-backed armed groups on bases housing the forces and US retaliatory strikes, escalating since the Israeli war in Gaza started. US and Iraqi officials say the process is expected to take many months if not longer, with the outcome unclear and no withdrawal of US forces imminent. Washington fears that a fast withdrawal may create a security vacuum that could be filled by archrival Iran or ISIL, which maintains sleeper cells in desert areas and has continued low-level attacks despite holding no territory.

"US, UK sanction senior Houthis as rebels say Red Sea attacks will continue",The Yemeni group says it will continue targeting Israel-linked commercial vessels until aid reaches Palestinians in Gaza.,"The United States and United Kingdom have issued new sanctions on leaders ofYemen’s Houthis, as the group pledges to continue itsattacks on Israel-linked commercial vesselsuntil aid reaches Palestinians in Gaza. The sanctions, announced on Thursday, target four key Houthi officials over their roles supporting or directing attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea, the US and UK said. “The Houthis’ persistent terrorist attacks on merchant vessels and their civilian crews … threaten to disrupt international supply chains and the freedom of navigation, which is critical to global security, stability, and prosperity,” Brian Nelson, the US Treasury’s undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in a statement. “Today’s joint action with the United Kingdom demonstrates our collective action to leverage all authorities to stop these attacks.” Those sanctioned were Houthi Defence Minister Mohamed Nasser al-Atifi; commander of Houthi naval forces Muhammad Fadl Abd al-Nabi; coastal defence forces chief Muhammad Ali al-Qadiri; and Muhammed Ahmad al-Talibi, who the two governments described as the Houthi forces’ director of procurement. The UK said the four men were involved in acts which “threaten the peace, security and stability of Yemen”. British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said in a statement that the restrictions “reinforce our clear message to the Houthis in recent weeks”, promising to target those behind the “unacceptable and illegal actions” against shipping.    The sanctions have come as Houthi leader Abdel-Malek al-Houthi promised to continue the attacks that have disrupted international commerce in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. “Our country will continue its operations until food and medicine reach the people of Gaza,” al-Houthi said in a televised speech on Thursday. Since November, the Houthis have carried out dozens of attacks on commercial vessels they have said were linked to Israel. They said the operations were meant to pressure Israel into stopping its war on Gaza. The group’s leader added that US and British military action in Yemen conducted in response to the Houthi attacks would not affect their “will and determination”. On Monday, anew round of attackstargeted a Houthi underground storage site as well as missile and surveillance capabilities used by the Iran-aligned group against Red Sea shipping. The Houthi attacks have disrupted international commerce along a route that accounts for about 15 percent of the world’s shipping traffic. Several shipping companies have redirected their vessels around the southern tip of Africa, delaying delivery times and adding a further 3,000-3,500 nautical miles (6,000km) to their route. The US alsore-designatedthe Houthis as “Specially Designated Global Terrorists” (SDGTs) earlier this month, a designation attributed to those who are considered to “threaten the security of the US”. In response to the designation and the US and British attacks against targets in Yemen, hundreds of thousands of people havetaken to the streetsof Yemen’s capital Sanaa and other cities to protest and to show support for Palestinians in Gaza.

Qatar ‘appalled’ at alleged Netanyahu criticism of mediation in Gaza war,"After reports of leaked recording, Qatar says attributed remarks show Israeli PM ‘obstructing mediation efforts’ and ‘prioritising’ his career.","Qatar has rebuked Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after he allegedly criticised the Gulf country’s role as a mediator in theGaza waras “problematic” in a leaked recording. At a meeting this week with thefamilies of captivesbeing held in Gaza, Netanyahu blamed Qatar for financing Hamas and said he was upset at a decision by the United States to extend the presence of a military base in the Gulf state, according to Israeli news outlet Channel 12. “These remarks if validated, are irresponsible and destructive to the efforts to save innocent lives, but are not surprising,” Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Majed al-Ansari said in a post on X on Wednesday. We are appalled by the alleged remarks attributed to the Israeli Prime Minister in various media reports about Qatar’s mediation role. These remarks if validated, are irresponsible and destructive to the efforts to save innocent lives, but are not surprising.For months, and… — د. ماجد محمد الأنصاري Dr. Majed Al Ansari (@majedalansari)January 24, 2024  Qatar, along with Egypt, has repeatedly engaged in negotiations to broker atruce in Gazaand ensure the entry of humanitarian aid into the besieged enclave. In November, it helped secure a weeklong pause in fighting in which more than100 captiveswere released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. The Gulf state remains involved in talks aimed at securing a new deal for the release of roughly 130 captives still being held by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups. Al-Ansari said Netanyahu’s leaked comments were detrimental to those efforts. “If the reported remarks are found to be true, the Israeli PM would only be obstructing and undermining the mediation process, for reasons that appear to serve his political career instead of prioritizing saving innocent lives, including Israeli hostages,” he said. Netanyahu, in his reportedly leaked remarks, told the families of the captives that he had intentionally not thanked Qatar for its mediation efforts, claiming it could put more pressure on Hamas. “You don’t hear me thanking Qatar … who are essentially no different from the United Nations or Red Cross, and even more problematic. I have no illusions with regards to them,” Netanyahu purportedly said in the recording obtained by Channel 12. “They have the means to put pressure [on Hamas]. And why? Because they finance them,” Netanyahu said. Al Jazeera’s Stefanie Dekker, reporting from occupied East Jerusalem, said any leak from Netanyahu’s office “isn’t usually by chance” and “is usually done for a political reason – what that is you can only question”. Netanyahuis under a lot of pressure from “all sides”, domestically and internationally, and “from people on the streets … to do more to bring back the captives”, Dekker said on Thursday.    Hassan Barari, a professor at Qatar University, told Al Jazeera that the Israeli prime minister’s alleged criticism of Qatar’s mediation efforts reflects frustration over his failures in the war. “Qatar has stepped in many times, and Qatar has succeeded in mediating between Israelis and Hamas,” Barari said, calling the comments a sign of “desperation”. “Netanyahu wants everyone to do things his own way. He fails on the battleground, he fails to convince his own people that he’s doing the right thing, and he wants to blame others and pass the buck for his failures on the Qataris,” he added. Qatar, which has hosted the political leadership of Hamas, has in recent years sent millions of dollars in aid to the Hamas-run Gaza Stripin cooperationwith the Israeli government “to try and keep the situation there from exploding … because of the restrictions and blockade”, Dekker reported. Israel imposed a blockade on the Gaza Strip in 2007, limiting and controlling the flow of people and goods into and out of the coastal territory. Responding to al-Ansari’s comments, Israel’s ultranationalist, far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich accused Qatar of supporting “terrorism”. “Qatar is a country that supports terrorism and finances terrorism. She [Qatar] is the patron of Hamas and is largely responsible for the massacre committed by Hamas of Israeli citizens,” Smotrich wrote on X. Members of Netanyahu’s far-right ruling coalition have been pushing for an escalation of the war on Gaza, and the prime minister this weekrejected a proposalby Hamas to end the conflict and release captives in exchange for withdrawing Israeli forces, releasing prisoners and accepting the armed group’s governance of Gaza. Palestinian officials say at least 25,700 people have been killed and more than 63,000 wounded in Israeli attacks on Gaza since October 7, when an attack by Hamas inside Israel killed some 1,140 people.

Israel-Gaza war spillover risk: Mapping recent strikes in Middle East,Experts warn that the Israeli war on Gaza may spill over into a regional conflict amid multiple strikes in several countries.,"As Israel’swaron Gaza pushes on in its fourth month, fears of regional escalation are growing, with multiple nations and armed groups targeting each other’s territories and common waters, and the United States boosting its military assets in the region. Last week, Iran launched attacks in Syria and Iraq after members of its elite forces were killed in the Syrian capital Damascus allegedly in Israeli attacks, while the US along with the United Kingdom have carried out several attacks against the Houthis in Yemen. Tens of thousands of people have been displaced in Lebanon and Israel due to an exchange of fires between Israeli forces and Hezbollah fighters on their border. Last week, tit-for-tat attacks between Iran and Pakistan threatened to open a new military front, but diplomacy helped cool the tempers, for now. Here is what you need to know about the military hostilities that have broken out in the region since the start of Israel’swar on Gaza on October 7. The Iran-backedHouthi groupin Yemen has been targeting commercial and military ships linked to Israel in the Red Sea as a response to Israel’s war in Gaza. Houthi officials have demanded that Israel stop the war and allow humanitarian aid to enter the Palestinian enclave. The group’s first attack occurred on November 19, 2023, when theytook overa cargo ship called the Galaxy Leader, which records suggest is owned by an Israeli businessman.  Houthi targeting of commercial ships has promptedmultipleshipping companies tosuspend operationsin the Red Sea, instead embarking on a longer and costlier journey around the African continent. In response, the US, Israel’s closest ally, has carried out severalattacks inHouthi-controlled regions of Yemen. Early on Wednesday, the US military carried out more strikes targeting Houthi anti-ship missiles. Almost daily cross-borderartillery firingand drone attacks between Israeli forces and Hezbollah fighters threaten to open another front in Israel’s war. Tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border have been forced to flee their homes. TheLebanese armed grouphas said its attacks are an act of resistance in solidarity with the 2.3 million people in Gaza who are besieged and undergoing daily Israeli bombardment that has killed more than 25,000 people. Warning Hezbollah against crossborder attacks, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said his country will turn Beirut into Gaza. Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah has not declared all-out war against Israel, but said his forces arenot afraidof getting involved in one. Israeli attacks on southern Lebanon have killed more than 200 Hezbollah fighters, journalists, and civilians while also internally displacing more than 80,000 people from the area, the United Nations reported in December. At least 15 Israelis have been killed in Hezbollah strikes. Israel has launched repeated air raids on Syria since its war on Gaza, reigniting tensions between the two countries. It claims its attacks are a response to threats from Syrian military positions and Iran-linked infrastructure. Tehran is the main military backer of PresidentBashar al-Assadin the war that erupted in 2011. The attacks have primarily targeted the capital city, Damascus, and Aleppo. Last Saturday, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said five of its “military advisers” were killed in anair raidon a residential building in Damascus. Razi Moussavi, asenior adviserin the IRGC, was previously killed in an Israeli attack outside Damascus. The two countries have been engaged in repeated military confrontations since Israel was first established in 1948. Israel still occupies Syria’s Golan Heights, which it captured in the 1967 war.  Iraq has criticised Iran after the Revolutionary Guard hit what they called an Israeli espionage centre in the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region. The event prompted Baghdad to recall its ambassador to Tehran, while Iran insisted the attack was intended to deter threats from Israeli spies. Prior to this, Iran-backed groups have carried out numerous attacks on US military bases in Iraq and Syria. The US has retaliated,targeting and killing the commanderof an Iraqi armed group on January 4. The incident prompted Iraq to reconsider hosting international troops. The United States on Tuesday carried out strikes in western Iraq against three targets linked to Kataib Hezbollah, an Iran-backed armed group.  More than 85 percent of Gaza’s people have been displaced since Israel launched its brutal war on October 7 in the wake of Hamas’s attack inside Israel. Israeli attacks have targeted schools, hospitals and residential buildings, almost completely destroying civilian infrastructure. UN agencies say people are facing a famine-like situation as Israel has rebuffed calls for a ceasefire. Hamas’s surprise attack killed at least 1,139 people, according to an Al Jazeera tally based on official Israeli statistics.  Hamas had also taken about 240 people captive. More than 100 were released during a four-day truce between Israel and Hamas in November. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) targeted the Jaish al-Adl armed group in Panjgur, Pakistan’s Balochistan province, leading to Pakistani retaliation against armed Baloch separatists in Iran’s Sistan-Baluchestan province. This resulted in a rapid deterioration of diplomatic relations, with ambassadors withdrawn. However, both countries then engaged in de-escalation efforts, with ambassadors returning to their posts by January 26.  Experts warnthat if Israel’s war on Gaza does not end, the conflict could spill over, bringing in new players. “Without a ceasefire in Gaza, it’s hard to see how this gets better. And I think the simmering pot is now boiling over, and it’s just going to get worse and worse as time goes on. It’s really a very dangerous moment,” Hassan El-Tayyab, legislative director for Middle East policy at Friends Committee on National Legislation, a Quaker advocacy group in Washington, DC,told Al Jazeeraearlier this month. US foreign policy also seems set on continuing its military activity, after President Joe Bidenpledged last weekthat US attacks would continue in spite of their failure to deter Houthi attacks in the Red Sea. Iran’s entanglement in several of the confrontations has also deepened worries that it could serve as a hub for regional conflict, particularly with its links to armed groups outside its own borders. Western and regional authorities, as well as analysts, generally agree that Iran aims to steer clear of a direct military clash with the US or Israel. However, the country appears open to employing its proxies to engage and divert the attention of the military forces of these adversaries within the region. The primary risk of escalation arises from a potentially misguided attack either executed by Iran and its proxies or by the US and its allies.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/25/israel-gaza-war-spillover-risk-mapping-recent-strikes-in-middle-east
"Turkey, Iran agree on need for regional stability amid Israel’s war on Gaza",The war in Gaza topped the agenda as Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Iran’s Ebrahim Raisi met in Ankara.,"Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says he and his Iranian counterpart have agreed to avoid steps that could threaten Middle East stability, during a visit to Ankara by Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi. At a news conference after the meeting on Wednesday, Erdogan said the pair had discussed ending Israel’s “inhumane” attacks on Gaza and the imperative for fair and lasting peace in the region. “We agreed on the importance of refraining from steps that will further threaten the security and stability of our region,” he said, adding that they had also agreed to continue cooperation against cross-border threats. Al Jazeera’s Sinem Koseoglu, reporting from Ankara, said the main agenda of the meeting was Israel’s ongoing war on Gaza. “No one expects the two leaders to stop what’s going on in Gaza, but at least what they aim is to contain the escalation, the growing crisis in region, especially in Yemen, in the Red Sea areas,” Koseoglu said. “President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi said that they are committed to the fight against terrorism,” she added. Turkey, which has been vocal in its condemnation of Israel’s attacks on Gaza, has called for an immediate ceasefire and backed legal steps for Israel to be tried for genocide. However, Ankara has maintained its commercial ties with Israel, prompting criticism at home and in Iran. Iran leads what it calls the “axis of resistance” that includes Hamas, Yemen’s Houthis, and other Shia Muslim groups in the region that have confronted Israel and its Western allies. In a sign that the war on Gaza threatens to spill over into the wider region, the United States and United Kingdom have struck targets in Yemen in response to Houthi attacks on ships in the Red Sea. The Houthis have said their attacks in the busy waterway are aimed at ships with links to Israel and they will continue as long as the war on Gaza continues. Erdogan has condemned the US and UK’s attacks on Yemen and called them a disproportionate use of force. Raisi accused the US of supporting what he referred to as Israel’s crimes against Palestinians in Gaza and repeated his call for Muslim nations to cut ties with the “Zionist regime”. “What is happening in Palestine and Gaza is a crime against humanity … and the United States and the West are supporting these crimes,” he said on Wednesday. “Cutting economic and political ties with this regime can certainly have an impact on the Zionist regime to end its crimes.” Turkey and Iran have had complicated ties due to several issues, including the Syrian civil war. Ankara-backed rebels have attempted to oust Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad, while Tehran supported his government. Recently, Turkey has taken steps to improve ties with Damascus.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/24/turkey-iran-agree-on-need-for-regional-stability-amid-israels-war-on-gaza
UAE denies sending weapons to Sudan’s RSF paramilitary: Report,An Emirati official tells the Financial Times that the Gulf country ‘does not take sides’ in war in Sudan.,"The United Arab Emirates has denied arming the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in its war against the Sudanese army, the Financial Times has reported, after a leaked UN report said it had “credible” evidence that the Gulf country was providing military support to the paramilitary group. According to the UN document, evidence suggest that the UAE had sent weapons to the RSF “several times per week” via Amdjarass in northern Chad. The UAE “does not take sides in the current conflict,” an Emirati official on Wednesday told the British newspaper. The country had “consistently called for de-escalation, a sustainable ceasefire and the initiation of diplomatic dialogue” in Sudan, the source was cited as saying. The UN report, which has not been published yet, was compiled by experts for the UN Security Council. In a letter to the monitors, the UAE said 122 flights had delivered humanitarian aid to Amdjarass to help Sudanese fleeing the war. Last week, a UAE official told Reuters that it extended an invitation to the UN monitors to visit a field hospital in Amdjarass “to learn firsthand about the humanitarian efforts undertaken by the UAE to help alleviate suffering caused by the current conflict”.    The RSF, led by Mohamad Hamdan Dagalo, has been engaged in a brutal war against the country’s army, headed by Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, for more than nine months. The war has left about half of Sudan’s 49 million people in need of aid, and more than 7.5 million have fled their homes, according to the UN. Dagalo controls most of Sudan’s western region Darfur and parts of the capital Khartoum. The RSF has recently also taken control of Wad Madani, one of Sudan’s major cities. The paramilitary group has been accused, along with Arab armed groups, of killing up to 15,000 non-Arabs from the Masalit tribe in attacks that “may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity,” read the report. The RSF has previously denied the accusations and said any of its soldiers found to be involved would face justice. “The attacks were planned, coordinated, and executed by RSF and their allied Arab militias,” the sanctions monitors wrote in their annual report to the 15-member Security Council. In December, the United States formally determined that warring parties in Sudan committed war crimes and that the RSF and allied militias had also committed crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing. The UN report said that “complex financial networks established by RSF before and during the war enabled it to acquire weapons, pay salaries, fund media campaigns, lobby, and buy the support of other political and armed groups”. It added that the paramilitary group used proceeds from its pre-war gold business to create a network of as many as 50 companies in several industries. Since the war started “most of the gold, which was previously exported to UAE, was now smuggled to Egypt,” the monitors said. The new firepower acquired by the RSF “had a massive impact on the balance of forces, both in Darfur and other regions of Sudan,” the report found. The European Council (EC)imposed sanctions on six companiesfor their alleged involvement in financing and arming both warring sides. Among the companies sanctioned were three controlled by the Sudanese army, including the Defense Industries System conglomerate, which Brussels said had estimated revenues of $2bn in 2020. The other three companies sanctioned were involved in procuring military equipmentfor the RSF. The war has left nearly half of Sudan’s 49 million people needing aid: More than 7.5 million people have fled their homes, making Sudan the biggest displacement crisis globally, and hunger is rising.

Will a US court order Biden to stop ‘complicity’ in Gaza genocide?,Lawsuit asks court to order President Joe Biden to end US assistance to Israel that enables alleged genocide in Gaza.,"Shawan Jabarin wants to know when it will be enough: When will the death toll in Gaza be high enough for United States President Joe Biden to end his unequivocal military and diplomatic support for Israel? “How many Palestinian civilians have to be killed until he says, ‘This number is enough’? How many? Two million Palestinians? One million? 700,000? It [would be] good if he can tell us which number wakes up his human conscience.” Jabarin, the general director of the Palestinian human rights group Al-Haq, said Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip would not be possible without US support. TheIsraeli military campaignhas killed more than 25,000 Palestinians, and United Nations officials and other experts have repeatedly warned of a risk of genocide. Yet, since the war began in early October, the Biden administration hasbypassed Congressto greenlight arms sales to Israel and blocked efforts to secure a ceasefire. That’s why Al-Haq, alongside two other advocacy groups and individual Palestinians affected by the war, filed a lawsuit in the US late last year accusing Biden and other senior US leaders of being complicit in genocide. The first hearing inthe caseis set for January 26 in a federal court in California. “Without American support — militarily, politically — nothing like [this could have] happened,” Jabarin told Al Jazeera in a phone interview from Ramallah. “The US are not complicit indirectly. No, directly. They are helping to commission a genocide in Gaza.”    Filed in mid-November, the lawsuit (PDF) accuses the Biden administration of failing to meet its responsibilities under international and domestic law topreventgenocide. The 1948 Genocide Convention, which the US ratified, states that “genocide, whether committed in time of peace or in time of war, is a crime under international law which [state parties]undertake to preventand to punish”. It also outlines that “complicity in genocide” is a punishable act. Additionally, the obligations to prevent and punish genocide have been recognised as being part of “customary international law” — atermthat refers to “a general practice accepted as law”. Drawing from those statutes, the lawsuit alleges “the United States has been obligated, from the time it learned of the specter of a genocide of the Palestinian people, to exercise its clear and considerable influence on Israel to prevent this grave crime from unfolding”. The complaint names three defendants: Biden, Secretary of StateAntony Blinkenand Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. It claims they “have not only been failing to uphold the country’s obligation to prevent a genocide, but have enabled the conditions for its development”. The lawsuit also emphasises that US leaders were fully aware of Israel’s “genocidal” objectives. “Dehumanising” remarks by senior Israeli officials, including Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, demonstrated a clear intent to pursue the “erasure and destruction of Palestinians”, it explained. Gallant, for instance,called Palestinians“human animals” when he ordered the total siege of Gaza in early October. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also said, “The enemy will pay an unprecedented price,” before ordering Palestinians to “get out” of Gaza.    “Those statements were not mere rhetoric. Israeli officials said what they meant and [they] do what they say,” said Katherine Gallagher, a senior staff lawyer at the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), one of the organisations involved in the case. “States that have the ability to influence a country that is at serious risk of — if not already — committing genocide have to take all measures within [their] power to prevent [it],” she told Al Jazeera. “And the United States did not do that. Instead, it offered unconditional military support, financial support, anddiplomatic cover and supportfor Israel’s ongoing genocidal campaign.” Gallagher explained that the plaintiffs are asking a district court to declare that the US has breached its obligations to prevent genocide. They are also requesting a preliminary injunction ordering officials to “take all measures within their power” to fulfil its legal responsibilities. “That would mean cutting off and ceasing the military support for the genocide,” she said. But the Biden administration has asked that the lawsuit be thrown out. In a December filing (PDF), it argued the court is being asked to “intrude into areas committed to the political branches of the government and violate constitutional separation of powers”. Since foreign policy is decided by the executive branch, not the courts, the lawsuit “should be dismissed as nonjusticiable”, the filing said. Oona Hathaway, a law professor at Yale University Law School, explained that this argument — known as the political question doctrine — is commonly used in foreign affairs cases, including challenges to theuse of US military forceabroad. “I think there is a good chance that a court will decide that this [US complicity in genocide case] is barred by the political question doctrine,” Hathaway told Al Jazeera. “I will say, I am myself really not a fan of the political question doctrine because I think that it means that legal violations often go unaddressed,” she said. “The truth of the matter is that, if the courts won’t address the possible legal violations, the chance that Congress is likely to do so is extremely slim.” Hathaway questioned whether the federal court would allow the claim to move to the merits stage, where parties present why their arguments should win. But even if that does not happen, Hathaway said the plaintiffs are likely hoping “to start a conversation” and bring attention to the situation in Gaza. “I think it’s part of raising the visibility of these concerns and ensuring that lawmakers and the American public are aware that there [are] potential legal obligations on the United States, not just on Israel, that are relevant to this conflict.”    For their part, the plaintiffs have rejected the government’s use of the political question doctrine. “This is not a case about run-of-the-mill policy decisions by the executive branch,” said Gallagher. “This is a case about compliance with the law, and no one, including the president of the United States, can be empowered to commit or fail to prevent genocide.” “There are a lot of big legal issues here,” she continued. “Yes, it’s about upholding obligations of international law, but not in the abstract. It’s really in an effort to try and save lives and stop this genocide.” Jabarin at Al-Haq said he hoped the federal court would rule in their favour, calling the case “unprecedented”. “This is important, I think, for the American system, the judiciary. And this is important for the victims and for everyone who does believe in the rule of law … and peace and justice and dignity.”   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/24/will-a-us-court-order-biden-to-stop-complicity-in-gaza-genocide
ICJ to decide on emergency measures in Israel-Gaza genocide case on Friday,The World Court will decide whether to order emergency measures relating to Israel’s military action in Gaza.,"The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has said it will announce on Friday whether it will order emergency measures against Israel after South Africafiled a caseaccusing Israel of genocide in its assault on Gaza. The United Nations’ top court said in a statement on Wednesday that the 17-judge panel will announce its response to South Africa’s requests in court on January 26 at 12:00 GMT. South Africa’s Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor will travel to The Hague to be present at the court as it delivers its announcement, a government spokesperson said, according to Reuters. The ICJ will not deal with the main question of whether Israel is committinggenocideon Friday, but will look at possible emergency measures requested by South Africa to restrain Israel’s actions. Earlier this month, in two days ofhearings, South Africa asked the ICJ, also known as the World Court, to order an emergency suspension of Israel’s devastating military campaign in the Palestinian enclave. It argued that provisional measures are necessary “to protect against further, severe and irreparable harm to the rights of the Palestinian people under the Genocide Convention, which continue to be violated with impunity”. South Africa filed nine injunctions to the court. Among them are the demand for an order that would direct Israel to suspend all military operations in Gaza, as well as a separate one that would direct Israel to facilitate and not impede the delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza. “How the court addresses these two requests, if it decides to indicate provisional measures at all, is what to really look out for on Friday,” Michael Becker, a former legal officer at the ICJ, told Al Jazeera. The court is not bound to order exactly the actions South Africa requested but can formulate the provisional measures it deems most appropriate. Such measures are intended to prevent a dispute from getting worse while the court looks at the full case, which could take several years. The ICJ’s deliberations are a painstaking process, involving detailed written submissions followed by oral arguments and counter-arguments by the team of top legal counsels representing each state. Experts say a ruling in the case could take three to four years. In the meantime, provisional measures could be granted provided that South Africa did enough to show that claims under the genocide convention are plausible and that the Palestinian population in Gaza faces a real and imminent risk of irreparable harm. Looking ahead to Friday’s public sitting, Becker said the court was likely to weigh in on Israel’s military operation but did not believe the court would order a halt to the Israeli assault. “I’m not convinced that they will be willing to go as far as South Africa has asked them to go – the suspension of military activities,” the legal expert and lecturer at Trinity College in Dublin said. He added that the ICJ would also likely reiterate the position expressed by the United Nations in itsDecember resolutionand instruct Israel to ensure that any military operation is conducted in accordance with international law and that the delivery of humanitarian aid is not hampered. Rulings by the ICJ are legally binding and without appeal, but the court has no way to enforce them. If it grants some or all of South Africa’s eight requests for so-called provisional measures, it is unclear whether Israel will comply. Israeldismissed the genocide allegationsas “grossly distorted” and said it had a right to defend itself from Hamas, the Palestinian group that led a surprise attack on Israel on October 7, killing at least 1,139 people and seizing around 240 others has hostages, according to Israeli officials. Israel says it is targeting Hamas in Gaza, not Palestinian civilians. Since October, more than 25,700 people have been killed in the Israeli assault, mostly women and children, according to Palestinian authorities in Gaza. While Israel often boycotts international tribunals and UN investigations, saying they are unfair and biased, the country sent a high-level legal team to two days of hearings earlier this month. Any court order to halt operations would be a major blow to the country’s international standing. The European Union has been silent on the matter, but Israel has seen support from its number-one backer and weapons supplier, the United States.

Several killed in Israeli attack on UN shelter housing 800 in southern Gaza,UNRWA official fears ‘mass casualties’ after Israeli tank shelling on one of its facilities in Khan Younis.,"Several people have been killed after a United Nations shelter inGaza‘s southern city of Khan Younis was shelled by Israeli forces, the Gaza head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees has said. “Two tank rounds hit building that shelters 800 people – reports now 9 dead and 75 injured,” Thomas White, the Gaza director of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), said on the social media platform X. Update – attack on Khan Younis Training Centre this afternoon – two tank rounds hit building that shelters 800 people – reports now 9 dead and 75 injured@UNRWAand@WHOteam trying to reach the centre – agreed upon route with Israeli Army blocked with earth bank#Gaza — Thomas White (@TomWhiteGaza)January 24, 2024  In a separate post earlier on Wednesday, White said the training centre sheltering displaced families had been set ablaze. The number of victims is expected to rise, as the UN official said the incident had likely caused “mass casualties”. UNRWA spokesman Adnan Abu Hasna, based in Rafah, told Al Jazeera the UN has been trying to send ambulances to the site in coordination with the Israeli army. He said no warning had been issued by the Israeli military prior to the attack. The agency has not been able to access the compound for the past 48 hours due to the presence of Israeli tanks in the area, Abu Hasna said, describing the situation as “very dangerous”. “We tried to coordinate the exit of the IDPs [internally displaced persons] there but did not succeed unfortunately,” he added. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of UNRWA, condemned the attack on the shelter as “a blatant disregard of basic rules of war”. “The compound is a clearly marked UN facility & its coordinates were shared with Israeli authorities as we do for all our facilities,” hewrotein a post on X, saying the number of those killed is likely higher. US State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said the attack was “incredibly concerning”. “We deplore today’s attack on UNRWA’s training centre,” he said. “Civilians must be protected and the protected nature of UN facilities must be respected.” Israel has continued intense attacks on Khan Younis, targeting medical facilities, among others. Some 660 attacks on health institutions have been recorded in Gaza. Gaza’s Ministry of Health on Wednesday said the Israeli army isolated the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis after it wasencircledand ground troops engaged in close-quarter combat with Hamas fighters. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) also wrote on X that the Israeli army surrounded its headquarters and the El Amal Hospital in the southern city, enforcing restrictions on movement to and from the medical facility. Khan Younis was once designated a “safe zone” for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who evacuated from the northern parts and Gaza City at the start of the war. Israeli soldiers on Monday advanced for the first time intoal-Mawasi districtnear the Mediterranean coast west of Khan Younis. Asmaa Abu Khudair, a Palestinian woman displaced from al-Mawasi to Rafah, said she fled the intense bombardment in the area after the building next to hers was attacked by the Israeli military. “Their aircraft started firing. All of a sudden, balls of fire started to fall on us,” she told Al Jazeera. “The whole area was in flames, fire everywhere. We started running, I pulled out one of my daughters, but my other daughter I couldn’t find.” Abu Khudair said the flames grew bigger and she had to flee without her missing daughter. “Do you understand when I say fire?”, she said in tears. “I lost my daughter. My husband was in his brother’s tent.” “The following day, their bodies were recovered, totally charred,” she added. At least 25,700 people have been killed and 63,740 wounded in Israeli attacks on Gaza since the war began on October 7.

How Israel has destroyed Gaza’s schools and universities,All schools in Gaza have been shut and no university has survived Israel military’s more than 100 days of onslaught.,"Grade five and six students at the Rosary Sister’s School in Gaza were supposed to sit for a science test on October 9, 2023, two days after Israel launched its devastating military assault on Gaza. But they never got to sit the test. The school along with its library and theatre was destroyed by the Israeli army on November 4, according toRuwaida Amer, who taught science at the private school. Hundreds of schools, including those run by the UN, in the besieged Palestinian enclave have been bombed, and students and teachers killed, in more than100 daysof Israeli bombardment that has ravaged educational infrastructure and caused mental trauma to thousands of beleaguered students. January 24 marks the sixth International Day of Education as proclaimed by the UN General Assembly, but tens of thousands of Gaza students cannot go to schools, which are lying in ruins. Here’s a look at how the war has taken a toll on Gaza’s education infrastructure: More than 40 percent of schools (288) in Gaza are run by the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), while the rest are either directly operated by the Palestinian Authority or privately managed. All of them are currently shut as more than 85 percent of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have been displaced amid continued Israeli ground and air offensive that has killed more than 25,000 people, including 10,000 children. According to UNRWA data from 2018, Gaza had 737 schools. At least 9,367 teachers work in the 288 UNRWA schools. How many children are out of school in Gaza?No Gaza student has been able to attend school since November 6, 2023, when the Ministry of Education suspended the 2023-2024 school year due to the war that has seen indiscriminate targeting of residential areas, including offices and schools.Israel has defended itself, saying it was battling Hamas fighters but rights groups say Tel Aviv has made little efforts to protect civilians. OCHA reported on October 27, 2023 that there were more than 625,000 pupils and more than 22,500 teachers in Gaza.  Up to 280 government schools and 65 UNRWA-run schools have been destroyed or damaged, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Education. Ninety percent of Palestinian Authority schools have been subject to direct or indirect damage. About 29 percent of school buildings are out of service after being demolished or severely damaged. Save the Children’s director for Palestine, Jason Lee, said in October: “Attacks on civilian infrastructure, including schools and hospitals where children are seeking refuge, are beyond unconscionable. This war is eroding humanity and is spiralling out of control.” It’s the same story with private schools. “It was a painful first month because schools were directly targeted,” said Amer. At least 133 schools are being used as shelter for internally displaced Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. These schools are sheltering far more people than their capacity as more than 1.9 million people have been displaced. Israel has attacked multiple schools serving as shelters, killing displaced Palestinians. In November 2023, Israeli forces attacked the UNRWA-runAl Fakhoura school, killing at least 15 people. A week after that, at least 25 people were killed inAl-Buraq school. In December 2023, several were killed in attacks onShadia Abu Ghazala School. It is not just schools that have borne the brunt of the Israeli onslaught. Centres of higher education, including universities, have been completely paralysed. Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that 12 higher education institutions in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed, completely disrupting university education. Geneva-based independent Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor said that Israel systemically destroyed every university in Gaza in stages. The first stage included the bombing of the Islamic and Al-Azhar universities, the monitor said in astatementissued on Saturday.  Israa University, located in the south of Gaza city, was demolished by Israeli forces, as evident from a video released by Israeli media on January 17. The university authorities said Israel occupied and used the campus as a military base and detention facility for months before destroying it.    Additionally, the Israeli army has killed 94 university professors, Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor said. The monitor deemed the Israeli destruction of schools an “intentional destruction of Palestinian cultural and historical properties”. “The targeted academics studied and taught across a variety of academic disciplines, and many of their ideas served as cornerstones of academic research in the Gaza Strip’s universities,” the monitor said in a statement. Euro-Med said that it would be very difficult to return to academics post-war in the wake of the shear scale of the destruction of life and properties. Palestinians have one of the highest literacy rates in the world, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics in 2018. Palestinian graduates have ended up performing high in fields such as mathematics, engineering and business. Up to 4,327 students have been killed and 7,819 others have been injured as of January 16, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Education, which added that 231 teachers and administrators were also killed.  It is uncertain when students in Gaza would be back in school as Israel’s war continues. It will likely take months, even years, to repair all damaged school buildings. There are plans to launch e-learning for Gaza school students. Teaching, however, would be delivered from the occupied West Bank, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Education. The e-learning model would be difficult to apply to Gaza, where telecommunications blackouts are common and students and teachers do not have access to stable electricity and internet. Moreover, most people have been forced to flee their homes and shelter at refugee camps. “It is impossible for there to be e-learning. There is no shelter, no internet and no suitable conditions,” Amer, the science teacher from Gaza, said. Meanwhile, schools and universities in the occupied West Bank are already shifting to an e-learning model with online classes as raids and settler violence have dramatically risen since October 7. This includes 55 schools located in the West Bank’s “seam zone” – an area separated from the rest of the occupied West Bank by Israel’s separation wall. The occupied West Bank has been reeling from rising settler and Israeli forces attacks, with at least 371 Palestinians killed by Israeli forces and settlers since October 7. Since her school was forced to shut down, Amer has met some of her students in public or spoken to them online. Three of her students have been killed in the war and some of them have lost their homes. The students in Gaza, she said, need psychological support for the trauma they suffer due to the war. “I want to support them psychologically, but the circumstances they are living in are difficult,” she said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/24/how-israel-has-destroyed-gazas-schools-and-universities
"UN, UK push Israel on role of two-state solution in ending Gaza war",PM Netanyahu’s rejection of Palestinian statehood is attracting pushback.,"The United Nations and the United Kingdom say a two-state solution is key to bringing peace in the Israel-Palestine conflict as international pushback against Israel’s rejection of Palestinian statehood grows. The UK’s foreign minister said on Wednesday as he set off for a tour of the Middle East that he would highlight Britain’s long-term support for a two-state solution. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday insisted that denying Palestinian statehood would prolong the war in the Gaza Strip. The statements reflect global concern after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week said heopposesan independent Palestinian state and his country needs full security control over the Palestinian territories. Speaking at a UN Security Council meeting, Guterres called Israel’s rejection of a two-state solution “unacceptable”. “This refusal and the denial of the right to statehood to the Palestinian people would indefinitely prolong a conflict that has become a major threat to global peace and security,” Guterres warned. Such an outcome “would exacerbate polarisation and embolden extremists everywhere”, he added.    British Foreign Secretary David Cameron was also set to address the topic as he embarked on a visit to the Middle East. Cameron will arrive on Wednesday in Israel, the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said ina statement. Visits are also scheduled in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Qatar and Turkey in hopes of achieving a “sustainable ceasefire” in Gaza. In the West Bank, Cameron will meet Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and highlight Britain’s long-term support for a two-state solution “so that Israelis and Palestinians can live side-by-side in peace”, the Foreign Office said. The US, Israel’s most important ally, has also said that there is no way to solve Israel’s long-term security challenges and rebuild Gaza without Palestinian statehood. Earlier this week, the European Union’s top diplomatinsistedon a two-state solution to the conflict, saying Israel’s plan to destroy the Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza is not working. “No one wants to see this conflict go on a moment longer than necessary,” Cameron stated. “An immediate pause is now necessary to get aid in and hostages out. The situation is desperate.” Cameron said he was looking to chart a course “to move from that pause to a sustainable, permanent ceasefire without a return to hostilities”. “Such a plan would require Hamas to agree to the release of all hostages, Hamas to no longer be in charge of Gaza launching rocket attacks at Israel, and an agreement in place for the Palestinian Authority to return to Gaza in order to provide governance and services and, increasingly, security,” the former prime minister asserted.    According to the Foreign Office, Cameron will also urge Israel to open more crossing points to allow aid deliveries into Gaza, including the Israeli port at Ashdod and the Karem Abu Salem crossing (known as Kerem Shalom in Hebrew), and demand that water, fuel and electricity supplies be restored to the coastal enclave. Israel unleashedits latest war in Gazaafter Hamas attacks inside Israel on October 7. According to the Gaza Ministry of Health, at least, 25,700 Palestinians, the majority of them women and children, have been killed in the conflict. Most of Gaza’s 2.3 million people are displaced, causing a humanitarian disaster.

"US carries out new strikes on Houthi missiles in Yemen, Iraq sites","US military says Houthi antiship missiles destroyed, hit targets in Iraq linked to armed groups aligned with Iran.","The United States military launched new strikes in Yemen against Houthi antiship missiles and facilities in Iraq targeting Iran-backed armed groups it says were behind missile and drone attacks on US troops in Iraq and Syria. The strikes in Yemen, which took place at 2:30am on Wednesday (23:30 GMT on Tuesday) are thelatest attacksagainst the Iran-aligned group which has been attacking shipping in the Red Sea and has warned it would not stop. “US forces identified the missiles in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen and determined that they presented an imminent threat to merchant vessels and the US Navy ships in the region,” the military’s Central Command said, adding that two missiles were destroyed in “self-defence”. TheHouthis, who control the most populous parts of Yemen and support Hamas, say their attacks are in solidarity with Palestinians amidIsrael’s relentlessbombardment of the Gaza Strip.

U.S.…pic.twitter.com/l3CMPrDx92 — U.S. Central Command (@CENTCOM)January 24, 2024  The Palestinian health ministry says more than 25,000 peoplehave been killedand more than 63,000 wounded in Israeli attacks on Gaza following Hamas’s assault in Israel on October 7, which Israeli officials say killed 1,139 people. Since the US and its allies started attacking Houthi military sites on January 11, the Pentagon says it has destroyed or degraded more than 25 missile launch and deployment facilities, more than 20 missiles, while also hitting drones, coastal radar, the group’s air surveillance capabilities and weapons storage areas. Separately on Wednesday, the US targeted sites used by Iran-backed armed groups in Iraq, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin announced, days after US troops in the country were attacked. On Saturday, four US personnel suffered traumatic brain injuries after the Ain al-Asad airbase in western Iraq was hit by multiple ballistic missiles and rockets allegedly fired by Iranian-backed militants. “US military forces conducted necessary and proportionate strikes on three facilities used by the Iranian-backed Kataib Hezbollah militia group and other Iran-affiliated groups in Iraq,” Austin said in astatement. “These precision strikes are in direct response to a series of escalatory attacks against US and Coalition personnel in Iraq and Syria by Iranian-sponsored militias,” he noted. Kataib Hezbollah military spokesperson Jaafar al-Husseini said in a post on X that the group would continue to target “enemy bases” until the end of Israel’s siege in Gaza and singled out US support for Israel’s campaign. Iraqi sources said at least two people were killed and two wounded in the latest strikes in Jurf al-Sakhar, south of the capital Baghdad, as well as in the al-Qaim area on the border with Syria. Iraq’s army said the US attack harmed “security and stability” in the country. “This unacceptable act undermines years of cooperation, blatantly violates Iraq’s sovereignty, and leads to an irresponsible escalation at a time when the region faces the danger of expanding conflict over the immoral war of extermination that the Palestinian people are facing,” Major General Yahya Rasool was quoted by the Iraqi News Agency as saying. A senior Iraqi official said that US air raids “do not help bring calm”. “The US side should pile on pressure for a halt to the [Israeli] offensive in Gaza rather than targeting and bombing the bases of an Iraqi national body,” Qasim al-Araji, national security adviser, said in a post on X. He was referring to the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), also known as Hashd al-Shaabi, an alliance of Iran-aligned former paramilitary groups now integrated with Iraq’s armed forces. Iraq has also condemned previous such attacks, with Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani calling for US-led coalition troops in the country to leave.    Meanwhile, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday that the US has asked China to urge Iran to rein in the Houthi rebels, but has seen little sign of help from Beijing. Washington has repeatedly raised the matter with top Chinese officials in the past three months, it said. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also raised the issue with his Chinese counterpart, the report said, adding that US officials believe there was little evidence that China had put any pressure on Iran to restrain the Houthis beyond a mild statement Beijing issued last week.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/24/us-carries-out-new-strikes-on-houthi-missiles-in-yemen-iraq-sites
How Israel controls $188m of Palestinian money every month,Palestinian tax revenue destined for Gaza has been frozen by Israel since November – here’s what’s happening now.,"On Sunday, Israel approved aplanto send taxes earmarked for Gaza to Norway instead of the Palestinian Authority (PA), which exercises limited self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Since November, taxes that would ordinarily be sent to Gaza have been frozen by the Israeli government. Under the terms of a deal reached in the 1990s, Israel collects tax on behalf of the Palestinians and makes monthly transfers to the PA pending the approval of the Ministry of Finance. While the PA was ousted from the Gaza Strip in 2007, many of its public sector employees in the enclave kept their jobs and continued to be paid with transferred tax revenues. Weeks after the Hamas attack on southern Israel on October 7, Israel took the decision to withhold payments earmarked for those employees in the Gaza Strip on the grounds that they could fall into the hands of Hamas. Now, Israel says it will instead send the frozen funds to Norway. “The frozen funds will not be transferred to the Palestinian Authority, but will remain in the hands of a third country,” the Israeli prime minister’s office said in a statement released on Sunday. The system by which taxes and customs duties are collected by Israel on behalf of the PA and transferred to the authority on a monthly basis was agreed in a 1994 accord. Known as the Paris Protocol, the accord was meant to manage the economic relationship between Israel and the Palestinian territories it occupied until a final peace settlement was reached between the two states. Approved in the wake of the optimism generated by theOslo Accords, which were publicly ratified by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at the White House in September 1993, this protocol was supposed to end within five years. However, 30 years later, the financial settlement continues to give the Israeli state what the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has called “a disproportionate influence on the collection of Palestinian fiscal revenue, leading to deficiencies in the structure and collection of customs duties resulting from direct and indirect importing into Palestine”. The tax revenues collected by Israel on behalf of the PA amount to around $188m each month, and account for 64 percent of the authority’s total revenue. A large portion of this is used to pay the salaries of the estimated 150,000 PA employees working in the West Bank and Gaza, despite it having no jurisdiction over the Strip. On November 3, the Israel security cabinet voted to withhold a total of $275m in Palestinian tax revenues, including cash collected for prior months that was still with Tel Aviv. “The PA is not clear about how much of the tax revenues go to Gaza – it’s a black box,” Rabeh Morrar, director of research at the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute-MAS, told Al Jazeera. “Sometimes they say 30 percent, sometimes 40, sometimes 50.” Under terms set by Israel’s cabinet on Sunday, the monthly tax revenue previously allocated to PA staff in Gaza will instead be transferred to a Norwegian-based trust account. However, that money cannot be released by the fund to pay workers in Gaza without permission from Israel. The only member of the Israeli government to oppose plans to send the funds to Norway was far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who insisted that the initiative “does not guarantee that the money will not reach the Nazis from Gaza”. The Israeli state has often used its control of the PA’s tax revenues as a means to blackmail and punish the authority. In January 2023, for instance, the newly-formed Israeli government – seen as the most far-right coalition government in the country’s history – decided to withhold $39m in tax revenues from the PA following the authority’s decision to ask the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to rule on the legality of Israel’s decades-long occupation. “Israeli blackmailing of our tax revenues will not stop us from continuing our political and diplomatic struggle,” said Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh at the time after Israel’s security cabinet had earlier described the PA’s ICJ move as a “decision to wage political and legal war against the State of Israel”. “The PA owes billions in internal debt to local banks, hospitals, medical companies and the private sector,” said Morrar. “There are also debts [owed], for example, for privately owned buildings rented out by the government. They have not been able to pay those back.” In 2021, thePA’s financial crisis, exacerbated by Israel’s periodic refusal to pay the PA its total tax revenue share pre-October 7, prompted it to reduce all salaries by 25 percent. Since November, when Israel decided to freeze funds earmarked for Gaza, the PA has refused to accept any money at all in protest. Against the backdrop of Israel’s continued bombardment of the Gaza Strip, which has killed more than 25,000 Palestinians since October 7, and as a result of its decision to refuse Israel’s terms, the PA has not been able to pay employee salaries for a month and a half. While some reports have emerged that the PA may be about to relent and agree to receive partial payments from Israel, which would release some much-needed funds to many of its cash-strapped staff, the occupied West Bank remains at the mercy of Israeli diktats. Indeed, Israel suspended the work permits of some 130,000 day workers from the occupied West Bank after the war began. And a total of 355 Palestinians have been killed in the territory, including in occupied East Jerusalem, by Israeli forces and Israeli settlers since October 7.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/23/why-is-israel-sending-palestinian-taxes-to-norway
Why has Belgium vowed to back the ICJ’s verdict on Gaza ‘genocide’?,"Unlike other European nations, Belgium has said it would support the international court’s decisions on South Africa’s case against Israel.","As the world anticipates a preliminary verdict from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) onSouth Africa’s genocide caseagainst Israel, leaders in the European Union remain divided on how to interpret the decision. Shortly after the two-day hearing at the world’s top court in the Hague earlier this month, where South Africatoldthe ICJ that Israel’s actions in the Gaza strip violated the UN’s 1948 Genocide Convention, Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic – staunch allies of Israel – rejected these claims. Hungary condemned the case, while Berlin declared that it would intervene on Israel’s behalf at the ICJ. Last week, France, which is home to Europe’s largest Muslim and Jewish minorities and has been in the headlines for banning pro-Palestine protests since October 7, chimed in, saying Paris also does not support the ICJ case against Israel. “To accuse the Jewish state of genocide is to cross a moral threshold,” said French Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne. Other EU nations have remained silent on the court case. Slovenia is an exception, having announced its support for another ICJ case against Israel regarding Palestinian rights. And, among the bloc’s more outspoken critics of Israel’s military conduct in Palestine, Ireland has adopted a cautious stance. In Spain, the minority left-wing Sumar party in the coalition government backed South Africa’s case. Last week, in Belgium, socialist politician Caroline Gennez, minister of development cooperation and urban policy, said the country would support to the ICJ’s decision. “If the International Court of Justice calls on Israel to cease its military campaign in Gaza, our country will fully support it,” she said in a social media post. At a news conference in Brussels on Friday, Ludivine Dedonder, defence minister, reiterated: “Today, the Belgian government is speaking out in favour of an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the unimpeded delivery of humanitarian aid, and support for the ICJ.” Satisfied: Belgium reaffirms full support for@CIJ_ICJin this case. If the International Court of Justice calls on#Israelto cease its military campaign in#Gaza, our country will fully support it.pic.twitter.com/k2AAOro3o1 — Caroline Gennez (@carogennez)January 19, 2024  The prevailing European view since October 7 has been that Israel has a right to self-defence against the Palestinian group Hamas, as long as it stays within the boundaries of international law. But as the latest escalation of the Israel-Palestine conflict rages on, some Belgian leaders have been more openly critical of Israel’s actions as the Palestinian death toll mounts. After Hamas attacked southern Israel in early October, killing 1,139 people, Israeli forces have bombarded Gaza, the densely populated Strip Hamas governs with a pre-war population of 2.2 million people. During air attacks and as part of its ground invasion, the Israeli army has killed more than 25,000 people, among them many women and children, and stands accused of widespread atrocities. In November, the Belgian government, a coalition of seven political parties, said 5 million euros ($5.4m) from the federal government will be used to support the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague to investigate possible war crimes in Israel and Gaza. Brigitte Herremans, a postdoctoral researcher at the Human Rights Centre at the University of Gent in Belgium, told Al Jazeera the tiny European country traditionally adopts strong positions on international law with regard to the Middle East conflict. “Observers would say that it also has to do with Belgium’s own history of being occupied historically by foreign powers,” she added. During both world wars, Belgium was under German occupation. Herremans said that Belgium’s stance today is similar to its previous positions on other foreign policy issues, such as the Iraq war. “In general, we always saw Belgium somehow stick to a position that the acquisition of territory by force wasn’t accepted,” she said. But Marc Botenga, of Belgium’s leftist Workers’ Party and an EU lawmaker, said the government’s support to the ICJ is still limited. “If you look closely at their statement there is no active attitude to actually support the South African case against Israel. The government just says they will support whatever decision the ICJ takes, which is logical since all member states of the United Nations are supposed to support the institution’s court,” Bottenga told Al Jazeera. “However we have to commend the Belgian public for this stance which other EU nations have not really taken.” Large protests in different Belgian cities have played a role in pressuring the government to call for a ceasefire in Gaza, he said. Meanwhile, Belgium has declared its participation in the EU Red Sea Mission againstYemen’s Houthis,the Iran-linked group which says its recent attacks on ships linked to Israel or its allies are aimed at pressuring officials to stop the onslaught of Gaza. “That’s not the kind of stance we want,” Bottega said of Belgium’s participation. Herremans said that since Belgium currently holds the presidency of the Council of the European Union – a decision-making body in which ministers coordinate policies and adopt laws – his country is responsible for developing consensus. “Belgium has to take into account the position of staunch pro-Israeli countries, so [it] might have to be more cautious and less vocal on international law. But it will not take a fundamentally different position from what it always has,” she said. Historically, Belgium has shownsolidaritytowards Palestine while also supporting Israel. At the UN in 2012, it voted in favour of giving Palestine “non-member” observer status. Last year, it supported a UN resolution ordering the ICJ to investigate the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories. But discussing the Israeli-Palestinian issue in the Parliament can be difficult, because of diverse views between political parties in the Flanders in the north, Wallonia in the south, and the Brussels region. Some Belgian sources told Al Jazeera that of the seven coalition partners, the progressives – Greens and Social Democrats – believe concrete measures have to be taken to ensure international law is applied in the Gaza Strip and the occupied West Bank with regard to the ICJ case. In recent months, the Flemish Liberal Party of Prime Minister De Croo and Flemish Christian-Democrats have also toughened their stance on the situation in Palestine. InNovember, the premier described Israel’s campaign in Gaza as “disproportionate” as he condemned the army’s bombing of Gaza refugee camps. But the French-speaking Liberal Party, to which the foreign affairs minister belongs, has traditionally been pro-Israel. Looking ahead, Belgium heads to the polls in June, which could end up shifting the country’s stance if a new government comes into power. Fourat Ben Chikha, vice president of the senate, the federal parliament’s upper house, told Al Jazeera that even if the current coalition changes, as an international community, de-escalation and respect for human rights and international law should be every Belgian government’s priority. Willem Staes, senior Middle East adviser at 11.11.11, a Belgian international solidarity organisation which lobbies Belgian and European governments to uphold human rights, said that regardless of the Belgian government’s composition, foreign policy has traditionally focused on fighting against impunity and promoting accountability. “The current government is consequently applying this logic and leading the way at EU level. So providing support to the ICJ and the ICC, or calling for a permanent ceasefire, is not about being ‘pro-Palestinian’ or ‘anti-Israel’,” Staes told Al Jazeera. “It’s about common sense and choosing the only logical side, which is the side of international law. The fact that this is considered ‘radical’ by some tells you everything you need to know about the state of European politics.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/23/why-has-belgium-vowed-to-back-the-icjs-verdict-on-gaza-genocide
Israeli military ‘encircles’ Khan Younis after 24 soldiers killed in Gaza,"Nasser and El Amal hospitals under intense Israeli bombardment, endangering patients, staff and displaced Palestinians.","The Israeli military says its ground forces have “encircled” the city of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip after 24 of its soldiers were killed in the enclave in its largest single-day toll in the three-month war. “Over the past day, troops carried out an extensive operation during which they encircledKhan Younisand deepened the operation in the area,” the military said in a statement on Tuesday, calling the city a stronghold of the Palestinian armed group Hamas. “Ground troops engaged in close-quarters combat, directed [air] strikes and used intelligence to coordinate fire, resulting in the elimination of dozens of terrorists,” it said of the attacks on Gaza’s second-largest city.    Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Rafah in southern Gaza, said the Israeli army’s operations would only deepen the humanitarian crisis in the city, which has been reeling “from an extreme shortage of food, water and medical supplies”. Khan Younis was “designated as a safe zone for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who evacuated from the northern parts and Gaza City at the start of the war”, Mahmoud said, adding that it“is now a scene of much suffering and devastation”. Israeli forces killed at least 65 people in attacks on Khan Younis on Monday, according to medical sources. Palestinian officials said at least 25,490 people have been killed and 63,000 wounded in Israeli attacks on Gaza since October 7. The death toll from Hamas’s attacks in southern Israel stands at 1,139. Gaza’s Ministry of Health saidNasser Hospital and El Amal City Hospitalin Khan Younis, among the few partially functioning hospitals in the territory, were under “extreme danger” from Israeli bombardment. “The buildings of the Nasser Medical Complex are exposed to shrapnel, endangering the lives of patients, staff and displaced people,” the ministry said on its Telegram channel on Tuesday. “The Israeli occupation places Nasser Medical Complex and El Amal Hospital in Khan Younis in extreme danger,” it said, calling for “urgent intervention” to safeguard both facilities. 🚨Urgent : Continued gunfire from the Israeli drones targets anyone moving around Al-Amal Hospital. PRCS ambulances are unable to reach the injured in Khan Younis governorate.#NotATarget❌#Gaza#IHL — PRCS (@PalestineRCS)January 23, 2024  The Palestine Red Crescent Society, which operates El Amal Hospital, on Tuesday said Israeli drones were targeting anyone moving around the facility. It said its ambulances were unable to reach the injured and a civilian was killed by Israeli gunfire at the entrance of the hospital, noting “gunfire and repeated targeting of displaced individuals” in posts on X. Leo Cans, the head of mission for Palestine with the international medical charity Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontieres, or MSF), said about 20 percent of healthcare workers were still working in Nasser Hospital with most having to flee for their own safety and that of their families. “This is a strategy that has been used by the Israeli military to scare people, to terrorise the healthcare workers for them to leave without having to shut down the hospital,” Cans told Al Jazeera. The Israeli military has repeatedly asserted that Hamas fighters operate in and around hospitals, which medical staff and Palestinian health officials have denied. An Israeli military spokesperson said 21 soldiers were killed on Monday in an explosion in central Gaza when two buildings they had mined for demolition collapsed after Palestinian fighters fired grenades at a nearby tank. Three soldiers were killed in a separate attack on Monday in southern Gaza, taking the total killed in a single day to 24. At least 217 soldiers have been killed since the ground offensive began. “Yesterday, we experienced one of our most difficult days since the war erupted,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday. “In the name of our heroes, for the sake of our lives, we will not stop fighting until absolute victory.” Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said the war would determine Israel’s future “for decades to come”. “The fall of the fighters is a requirement to achieve the goals of the war,” he said. The day’s death toll comes at a time when Israel is beginning to see stirrings of discontent with Netanyahu’s war strategy. Last week, a member of Netanyahu’s war cabinet, former military chief of staff Gadi Eisenkot, whose soldier son was killed in the ground offensive in Gaza, said the campaign had yet to achieve its aims of dismantling Hamas and there was no hope offreeing the captives held in Gazain a military operation.

Today I sent an invitation letter to Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson@SwedishPMfor a visit to Hungary to negotiate on Sweden’s NATO accession. — Orbán Viktor (@PM_ViktorOrban)January 23, 2024  Finland became the 31st memberof the alliance last April. Its membership roughly doubled the length of NATO’s border with Russia and substantially strengthened the defences of three small Baltic nations that joined the bloc following the Soviet Union’s collapse. Sweden and Finland pursued a policy of military non-alignment during the Cold War-era confrontation between Russia and the United States. However,Russia’s bloody invasionof its western neighbour upturned geopolitical calculations. Erdogan’s resistance to Sweden’s NATO accession reflected his more nuanced stance towards Moscow. Ankara has profited from maintaining – and even expanding – trade with Russia while at the same time supplying Ukraine with drones and other essential arms. Erdogan has also been one of the few NATO leaders to hold regular meetings and phone conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Turkish media reported that Putin could make his first wartime visit to Turkey next month.    Erdogan’s objections to Sweden’s bid initially focused on Stockholm’s perceived acceptance of Kurdish groups that Ankara views as “terrorists”. Sweden has responded by tightening its antiterrorism legislation and taking other security steps demanded by Erdogan over the members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which the European Union and the United States also list as a “terrorist” group. Sweden and NATO members Finland, Canada and the Netherlands also took steps to relax Turkey’s arms export policies. The Turkish parliament’s foreign affairs committeeapproved the Swedish bidlast month after Erdoganforwardedit to parliament in October. However, Erdogan has sincedemanded that the US followthrough on its pledge to deliver a batch of F-16 fighter jets for Turkey’s ageing air force. Erdogan last month discussed his demands by telephone with US President Joe Biden. US officials argued that Turkey’s request could win the required congressional approval if Sweden’s NATO accession goes through – a position reaffirmed by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken during a visit to Istanbul this month. “We have not parsed words about how ready we are for Sweden to formally join the alliance,” said US Department of State deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel after news emerged that Turkey was finally ready to ratify the Swedish candidacy. “We have long felt that [Sweden] has met its commitment and we look forward to this process moving forward.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/23/turkeys-parliament-set-to-vote-on-swedens-nato-bid-this-week-reports
Iran executes 2022 protester for murder,"Human rights advocates criticise Mohammad Ghobadlou’s conviction, saying he did not get a fair trial.","Iran has executed a man who ran over and killed a policeman, and injured five other people, during nationwide protests in 2022. Mohammad Ghobadlou was executed on Tuesday, according to the judiciary’s Mizan news agency. However, human rights advocates criticised his conviction, saying he did not get a fair trial. “After being upheld by the Supreme Court, the death penalty against defendant Mohammad Ghobadlou has been implemented early this morning,” Mizan reported. The policeman was killed amid the huge protests that followed thedeath in police custody of Mahsa Amini, a Kurdish-Iranian woman who was arrested for violating Iran’s strict dress code for women. Ghobadlou was initially sentenced to death in November 2022 after being convicted of “corruption on earth” for attacking police in Tehran with a car. The Supreme Court granted him a stay of execution in February 2023, and later ordered consideration of his mental health, according to Mehr news agency. Mizan reported on Tuesday that the Supreme Court had upheld the death sentence, which was carried out under Iran’s Islamic law of retribution. Hundreds died during the 2022 protests, including dozens of security personnel, and thousands were arrested over what officials labelled as foreign-instigated “riots”. Ghobadlou is the eighth personexecuted after being convicted of murderor other violence against security forces during the demonstrations.    However, human rights group Amnesty International said the 22-year-old’s right to a fair trial was violated, and his bipolar condition was not taken into consideration by the judicial system. “Ghobadlou received two death sentences after grossly unfair sham trials marred by torture-tainted ‘confessions’ and failure to order rigorous mental health assessments despite his mental disability,” Amnesty said. However, Mizan said claims of mental disability were wrong. Ghobadlou, it noted, had allegedly rejected the suggestion during his trial. Earlier this month, dozens of people, including Ghobadlou’s family,demonstrated in front of a prisonin the Iranian city of Karaj against his sentencing as well as that of another young man. “My child is sick, he has a medical file, but they don’t want to accept,” Ghobadlou’s mother shouted in one video of the event at that time, which was verified by Al Jazeera. Iran executes more people per year than any other country except China, according to Amnesty, and usually does so by hanging.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/23/iran-executes-man-for-killing-policeman-five-others-during-2022-protests
Israel reportedly pushing deal to release captives without ending war,"A US envoy is visiting Egypt, Qatar to try to broker the deal as pressure rises on Tel Aviv to bring captives home.","Israel is reported to have readied a proposal for a two-month truce that aims to secure the release of captives held by Hamas and other groups but without ending the war in Gaza. US and Israeli press reported late on Monday that Israel is optimistic that it could conclude a deal with the help of the US. The plan comes against a backdrop of intensified combat in southern Gaza as well asincreasing pressureon the Israeli government to find a deal to bring the captives home. US website Axios quoted Israeli officials as saying that the proposal has been presented to Hamas through Qatari and Egyptian mediators. It includes a two-month truce during which all Israeli detainees in Gaza will be released. Israel’s Channel 13 reported that the principles of the deal consist of three to four stages of captive release. Meanwhile, the Israeli military would withdraw from some areas of the enclave, but without ending the war. US Middle East envoy Brett McGurk is in Cairo and is expected to travel across the region for “active” discussions on a possible hostage release deal. White House spokesperson John Kirby said Washington would support a longer humanitarian pause in Gaza to ensure the release and for aid to be brought in. “The conversations are very sober and serious about trying to get another hostage deal in place,” Kirby told a regular White House briefing, adding that the discussions included how long of a pause would be needed to get the hostages out. Qatar also said mediation efforts were ongoing. “We are engaged in serious negotiations and discussions between the two sides of the crisis in Gaza,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari told a press conference in Doha. “Mediation efforts between the Palestinians and Israel are still ongoing and will not stop, regardless of the circumstances on the ground,” he added. Reporting from occupied East Jerusalem, Al Jazeera’s Stefanie Dekker said that the proposal included plans to release captives in phases, starting with women and those over 60. A second phase would see a handover of female soldiers and men deemed as non-soldiers by Hamas. The third phase would include male soldiers and bodies remaining inside Gaza. Meanwhile, Israeli soldiers could be redeployed away from some urban areas to allow Palestinians to return home. “Of course, the question is what do they have to return to,” said Dekker. In Israel, the families of the captives have been applying increasing pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree a deal. Amid the ongoing bombardment of Gaza, they worry that time is running out to bring their relatives home alive. On Monday, dozens of relativesstormeda parliamentary committee meeting, demanding that the government seek a deal to win their loved ones’ release. A weeklong truce in November saw the release of about 100 of the 240 or so captives taken into Gaza on October 7 when Hamas launched a surprise attack inside Israel. Efforts to put another pause or even ceasefire in place have been stuttering since. But Israel is facing mounting impatience as it ignores calls to scale back its onslaught. The EU on Monday gave Israel’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz short shrift as he pitched the construction of an artificial island in the Mediterranean near the Gaza coast as a hub for the enclave’s commercial relations with the rest of the world. But facing political pressure and demands from hardline coalition partners, Netanyahu has repeatedly vowed to press ahead with the offensive until Hamas is crushed. The reports of the truce negotiations come amid an intensification of fighting in southern Gaza, with the hundreds of civilian casualties adding to the death toll in the enclave, which local authorities now say tops 25,000. The Palestine Red Crescent Society said early on Tuesday that its headquarters in Khan Younis had been shelled. Writing on X, the NGO said that the shelling coincided with “intense gunfire from Israeli drones, resulting in injuries among internally displaced individuals who sought safety on our premises”. UN agencies and aid groups have sounded the alarm about the growing threat of disease and famine in Gaza, where 1.7 million people are estimated to have been displaced from their homes. That makes a cessation of fighting ever more urgent, and there will be hope that alongside the pressure from the families, recent troop losses could give added momentum to efforts towards dialling down the conflict. On Tuesday, the Israeli military reported it lost at least 21 soldiers in one of the deadliest attacks on its troops since the war began three months ago.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/23/israel-outlines-new-truce-proposal
EU sanctions six companies accused of ‘undermining stability’ in Sudan,European Council says the firms sanctioned are linked to weapons procurement and manufacturing in war-ravaged country.,"The European Council (EC) has imposed sanctions on six companies for their alleged involvement in financing and arming the warring Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The six entities wereresponsiblefor “supporting activities undermining the stability and political transition of Sudan”, the EC said in a statement on Monday. Among the companies sanctioned were three controlled by the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), including the Defense Industries System conglomerate, which Brussels said had estimated revenues of $2bn in 2020. The other three companies sanctioned were involved in procuring military equipmentfor the RSF. The Sudanese army and the RSFhave been fighting since mid-Aprilin a war that has killed more than 12,000 people and which the United Nations says has displaced 7.5 million. “The entities listed are subject to asset freezes. The provision of funds or economic resources, directly or indirectly, to them or for their benefit is prohibited,” the EC said.    “The EU remains deeply concerned about the humanitarian situation in Sudan and reaffirms its steadfast support for, and solidarity with, the Sudanese people,” it added. The bloc is mirroring steps taken by the United States, which in June imposed thefirst sanctionsrelated to the conflict in Sudan by targeting two firms associated with the SAF and the RSF. The UK followed by takingsimilar measuresagainst businesses linked to Sudanese military groups. In November, the European Union condemned an escalation of violence inSudan’s Darfur region, warning of the danger of another genocide after the conflict there between 2003 and 2008 killed some 300,000 people and displaced more than two million. The fighting has continued to escalate despite international attempts to forge a lasting ceasefire. On Saturday, Sudan’s governmentsuspended its membershipin the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), the East African regional bloc that has tried to broker talks between the country’s warring parties. The conflict broke out over an internationally backed plan to merge the RSF into the army and begin a transition towards elections. The army and the RSF had shared power after longtime ruler Omar al-Bashir was toppled in a popular uprising in 2019. The two sides had also jointly staged a coup in 2021 that upended efforts to steer Sudan towards democracy. Throughout the current war, both the army and the RSF have been accused of war crimes, including the indiscriminate shelling of residential areas, torture and arbitrary detention of civilians.

US demands ‘urgent’ Israeli probe into Palestinian-American child’s death,US calls for a quick investigation into the killing of 17-year-old Tawfiq Ajaq in the occupied West Bank.,"The United States has urged Israel to launch an investigation into the death of Tawfiq Ajaq, a 17-year-old Palestinian-American who Palestinian authorities say was killed by Israeli troops in the occupied West Bank. At a press briefing in Washington, DC on Monday, US State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel told reporters that the US is “devastated about the killing” and is continuing “to engage closely with the Government of Israel to ascertain as much information as possible”. “We have called for an urgent investigation to determine the circumstance of his death,” Patel said. He added that the head of the US Office of Palestinian Affairs had visited Ajaq’s family to offer condolences and would continue assisting them together with the US Embassy in Jerusalem. Ajaq was born in Gretna, Louisiana, near New Orleans, and was brought to the West Bank by his parents last year. Ajaq’s relative, Joe Abdel Qaki, said Tawfiq and a friend werehaving a barbecue in a village fieldwhen he was shot. Speaking at his son’s funeral on Saturday, Tawfiq’s father, Hafez Ajaq, said Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank were “killer machines”. Israeli police have said they received a report on Friday regarding a “firearm discharge, ostensibly involving an off-duty law enforcement officer, a soldier and a civilian”. Police did not identify who fired the shot, though they said the shooting targeted people “purportedly engaged in rock-throwing activities along Highway 60″, the main north-south thoroughfare in the occupied West Bank. “This is not the first time Defense for Children Palestine hasn’t been able to confirm whether a settler or soldier killed a child. One aids and abets the other,” Miranda Cleland, an advocacy officer with Defense for Children Palestine, said in a post on X.

"US, UK strike eight Houthi targets over Red Sea shipping attacks","A Houthi underground storage site, as well as missile and surveillance capabilities, among targets in latest strikes.","The United States and the United Kingdom launched a new round of strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen as the Iran-aligned armed group continues to target commercial shipping in the Red Sea. A joint statement from the two countries said they had carried out eight strikes on Monday night, with support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands, targeting a Houthi underground storage site as well as missile and surveillance capabilities. “These precision strikes are intended to disrupt and degrade the capabilities that the Houthis use to threaten global trade and the lives of innocent mariners,” it said. The Houthis have said the attacks are in response toIsrael’s war in Gazaand to show their support for the Palestinians. The group that controls much of Yemen has attacked dozens of ships in the major waterway since November, disrupting international maritime trade and raising concern about the impact on the global economy. The UK’s Ministry of Defence said the Houthis have conducted more than 30 attacks on international shipping since mid-November. It said the attacks on Houthi sites were to hold the group “accountable for their illegal and unjustifiable attacks on mariners and commercial shipping” as well as to “de-escalate tensions and restore stability in the Red Sea”. Monday’s strikes came after the Houthis claimed to have conducted a successful attack on the US military cargo ship Ocean Jazz in the Gulf of Aden. US Naval Forces Central Command described the claims as “patently false” and said it had “maintained constant communications with M/V Ocean Jazz throughout its safe transit”. The Houthis did not say when or precisely where the attack took place, or if any damage was caused. UK maritime security firm Ambrey said the vessel named by the Houthis on Monday had been contracted by the US military.    British Foreign Minister David Cameron on Tuesday promised to keep hampering the group’s ability to attack shipping. “What we have done again is send the clearest possible message that we will continue to degrade their ability to carry out these attacks while sending the clearest possible message that we back our words and our warnings with action,” Cameron said. “Since we last took action 10 days ago, there have been over 12 attacks on shipping by the Houthis. These attacks are illegal. They are unacceptable.” Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree vowed revenge for the strikes, saying on X: “These attacks will not go unanswered and unpunished.” An unnamed US military official told The Associated Press news agency that between 25 and 30 munitions were dropped during the joint strikes and that multiple Houthi targets were hit. He said the attack destroyed advanced weapons in an underground storage facility, adding that it was the first time such advanced weapons were targeted in Yemen.    The US and UK militarieslaunched attacks against Houthi forceson January 11, a day after the United Nations Security Council condemned the rebel group’s attacks on Red Sea shipping anddemanded they stop. On November 19, the Houthisseizedthe Japanese-operated Galaxy Leader and took it to the port of Hodeidah. The ship’s 25-strong multinational crew, many of them from the Philippines, have been held since. So far, Houthi activity has been concentrated in the narrow strait of Bab el-Mandeb, which connects the Gulf of Aden to the Red Sea. Approximately 50 ships sail through the strait daily, heading to and from the Suez Canal – a key artery for global maritime trade. Some of the world’s largest shipping companies have suspended operations in the region, instead sending their vessels on the longer route around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa slowing trade between Asia and Europe.

Dutch court convicts Syrian pro-government fighter of war crimes,"Mustafa A, 35, is sentenced to 12 years in prison for war crimes in Syria by a district court in The Hague.","A district court in The Hague has convicted a former member of a Syrian pro-government armed group for complicity in torture and illegal arrest in Syria and sentenced him to 12 years in prison. Judges ruled on Monday that the 35-year-old man, identified in court only as Mustafa A, was involved in the arrest of a man in 2012 in Syria. He later handed the man over to Syrian Air Force intelligence officials who ran a prison where he was tortured. The court said the defendant was a leading member of the Liwa al-Quds, or the Jerusalem Brigade, an armed group comprised mostly of Palestinian refugees living in Syria and founded during the early years of Syria’s more than 12-year war. Mustafa was convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity for complicity in torture, inhumane treatment and illegal arrest and for membership of a criminal organisation. Arrested in 2022, he had been living in the Netherlands since 2020 and had applied for asylum there. During the trial’s first session in early November, judges quoted witnesses who said he was involved in their violent arrests and gave details of beatings and torture they endured in prison. Back then, despite being asked numerous times for a reaction to the declarations and excerpts from his own police interviews and intercepted phone calls, Mustafa invoked his right to remain silent at every turn. Monday’s judgement marks the first time aDutch court has convicted someone for crimescommitted while fighting on the side of President Bashar al-Assad’s government during the war in Syria. There have been a handful ofsimilar convictions in Germany. In recent years, Dutch courts have issued war crime convictions to several Syrian nationals who were members of opposition militias and other armed groups in Syria.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/22/dutch-court-convicts-syrian-fighter-on-war-crimes-charges
Families of hostages storm Israeli parliament meeting,The demonstration signals growing anger over the fate of the hostages in the fourth month of the Gaza war.,"Relatives of Israelis being held hostage in Gaza by Hamas have stormed a parliamentary committee session in Jerusalem, demanding lawmakers do more to free their loved ones. The action by a group of around 20 relatives on Monday illustrated the growing anger over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s refusal to agree to a deal with the Palestinian group as the Gaza war grinds through a fourth month. One woman held up pictures of three family members who were among the 253 people seized in the cross-border Hamas rampage of October 7 that triggered the massiveIsraeli operationin the enclave. Around 100 of the hostages were released during a week-long truce in November. Some 130 remain held in Gaza. “Just one I’d like to get back alive, one out of three!” the woman protester cried after pushing into the Knesset Finance Committee discussion. Other protesters, clad in black T-shirts, held up signs reading: “You will not sit here while they die there.” “Release them now, now, now!” they chanted. US, Qatari and Egyptian efforts at mediation seem far from reconciling the two sides. Netanyahu has insisted that Israel will continue its campaign until Hamas is destroyed. The Palestinian group demands that Israel withdraw and free all of the thousands of Palestinians from its prisons for Israeli captives to be released. The fate of the hostages – 27 of whom Tel Aviv says have died in captivity – has riveted Israel. However, the relatives fear that war fatigue could soften that focus. Demonstrations that initially promoted national unity have become more aggressive. Parliament ushers, often quick to eject hecklers or protesters, stood by during the ruckus in the Knesset Finance Committee. One lawmaker covered her face with her hands. Panel chairman Moshe Gafni, head of an ultra-Orthodox Jewish party in Netanyahu’s coalition, stood up, called a halt to the economic briefing under way and sought to calm the protester. “Redeeming captives is the most important precept in Judaism, especially in this case, where there is an urgency to preserving life,” he said, but added: “Quitting the coalition would not achieve anything.” The anger of the families has not been confined to official buildings. Relatives and supporters of the hostages once again rallied near Netanyahu’s residence in West Jerusalem on Sunday night. “We are asking our government to listen, to sit down at the negotiating table and decide whether to accept this agreement or any other that would suit Israel,” said Gilad Korenbloom, whose son is a hostage in Gaza. Jon Polin, father of a hostage, said Israelis serve their country and in return “we expect the government to ensure our safety”. “We are asking the government to play its part, to propose an agreement, to bring it to a successful conclusion and to bring the remaining hostages back alive,” Polin said. Demonstrators have also been camping outside Netanyahu’s coastal home as well as the Knesset building, some demanding a unilateral end to the war or an election that might topple the hard-right government. On Sunday, Netanyahurejectedconditions presented by Hamas to end the war and release hostages that would include Israel’s complete withdrawal and leaving Hamas in power in Gaza. Following that, the Hostages and Missing Persons Families Forum demanded that Netanyahu “clearly state that we will not abandon civilians, soldiers, and others kidnapped in the October debacle”. “If the prime minister decides to sacrifice the hostages, he should show leadership and honestly share his position with the Israeli public,” it said in a statement.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/22/gaza-hostages-relatives-storm-israeli-parliament-as-protests-intensify
Hospitals cut off as Israel batters southern Gaza,"With bombing from all sides and in areas including hospitals and universities, there is no safe corridor for people to escape.","Israeli shells have battered Khan Younis, cutting off two hospitals as the city in southern Gaza saw the bloodiest fighting since the New Year. Tanks closed in on Al-Amal Hospital and Al-Khair Hospital on Monday, part of an Israeli offensive that began last week to take control of Khan Younis, with Israel saying the city is now the main headquarters of the Palestinian group Hamas. The bombardment marks a revitalised Israeli offensive in the war, which began on October 7 when Hamas attacked Israel, killing some 1,139 people. Israel’s retaliation haskilled 25,295 Palestinians since. Residents told AFP that it was the most intense bombing they had witnessed since the war began. The fighting around the hospitals has made the provision of medical care difficult and halted most ambulance services, cutting the wounded off from medical care. Attack drones have targeted hospitals and Al-Aqsa University, the enclave’s largest, as the area is bombed by land, air and sea, with no safe corridor for people to escape, said Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Rafah in southern Gaza. Israeli ground troops were also assaulting residential buildings, he added.    The city, under heavy bombardment for over a month, was once designated a “safe zone” by Israel, with thousands having fled there from the north. “Now it’s just a scene of devastation and suffering as Israeli forces push deeper into the city,” Mahmoud said. The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) reported that its ambulance centre had been attacked, preventing first responders from reaching the wounded. The rescue agency also said it had lost contact with its staff at its Khan Younis main base. 🚨Urgent: PRCS ambulances unable to reach the wounded in Khan Yunis.

Health officials said at least 20 dead bodies had arrived overnight when the hospital was still accessible. “The occupation has overnight launched an unprecedented ground and air war on Khan Younis. People are trapped near Mawasi, people are trapped in Al-Amal Hospital, in Al-Aqsa University. People are carrying the dead and wounded on donkey carts,” said a medic inside Nasser Hospital. Gaza Ministry of Health spokesperson Ashraf Al-Qudra said that dozens of dead and wounded were trapped in areas targeted by Israeli troops. “The Israeli occupation is preventing ambulance vehicles from moving to recover bodies of martyrs and the wounded from western Khan Younis,” he said. It seems there’s little chance that the fighting will ease in the near future. Israel’s Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said on Monday that military operations will not only continue, but will be expanded. The majority of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents are now caged in two towns, Deir el-Balah and Rafah, just north and south of Khan Younis respectively. Around 85 percent of the territory’s population has been displaced, with thousands sheltering in United Nations-run camps in squalid conditions, with disease and hunger rife. “Very dark days ahead as the situation gets worse by the hour,” said Mahmoud.

Iran and Pakistan rebuilding diplomatic ties following tit-for-tat strikes,Islamabad and Tehran’s detente should help soothe some concerns of regional escalation from the war in Gaza.,"Iran and Pakistan have announced that they will resume diplomatic relations after recently swapping air strikes. The two Islamic republics will return recalled ambassadors on January 26, they said in a joint statement issued on Monday, with Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian to visit his counterpart three days later. The announcement signals efforts to rebuild ties following thetit-for-tat missile attackson one another’s border regions last week that saw relations nosedive and tensions spike. The mutual strikes, the highest-profile cross-border intrusions in recent years, targeted what both sides called “terrorist” groups in the regions around their mutual border. Iran’s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) hit the Jaish al-Adl armed group’s locations in the town of Panjgur in Pakistan’s Balochistan province late on Tuesday.Pakistan retaliated by bombinghideouts of armed Baloch separatists in the Sistan-Baluchestan province of Iran early on Thursday. Both regions are restive, mineral-rich and largely underdeveloped. The attacks saw a swift and sharp deterioration in diplomatic relations between Islamabad and Tehran, with ambassadors withdrawn, official ties severed, and rhetoric raised in tone. They also helped spread global alarm, with concern already high that Israel’s continuing bombardment of Gaza risks sparking a regional conflagration.  United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged the two countries to “exercise maximum restraint to avoid a further escalation of tensions”. Violence has flared across the Middle East since Hamas’s October 7 attacks on Israel and the subsequent bombardment of Gaza by Israeli forces, which has now killed more than 25,000 Palestinians. Fighting and air attacks have become regular in recent weeks in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and the Red Sea. However, the two countries moved quickly to calm the situation, pledging to “de-escalate” and seek good neighbourly relations. “Following [a] telephone conversation between the foreign ministers of Pakistan and the Islamic Republic of Iran, it has been mutually agreed that ambassadors of both countries may return to their respective posts by January 26, 2024,” said the statement.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/22/iran-and-pakistan-rebuilding-diplomatic-ties-following-tit-for-tat-strikes
‘Let’s talk about it’: EU’s Borrell presses Israel on two-state solution,EU foreign policy chief says Israel’s plan to destroy Hamas in Gaza is not working as bloc’s foreign ministers meet.,"The European Union’s foreign policy chief has insisted on a two-state solution in the Israel-Palestine conflict, saying Israel’s plan to destroy the Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza is not working. Ahead of talks with Israeli and Palestinian top diplomats, Josep Borrell on Monday said Israel cannot build peace “only by military means” as he echoed the United Nations’ condemnation of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s “unacceptable”rejection of callsfor a Palestinian state after the war in Gaza. “What we want to do is to build a two-state solution. So let’s talk about it,” Borrell said. “Which are the other solutions they have in mind? To make all the Palestinians leave? To kill off them?” The bloc’s 27 foreign ministers are set to hold separate meetings with their counterparts from Israel, the Palestinian Authority and key Arab states in Brussels on Monday as the violence in the Gaza Strip continues.    German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock also backed Borrell, saying atwo-state solutionis the “only solution” to the conflict and would allow for the peaceful coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians. “All those who say they don’t want to hear about such a solution have not brought any alternative”, she added, while also calling for an urgent “humanitarian pause” to what has been described by several governments and rights groups as a genocidal campaign in Gaza. Netanyahu on Sunday reaffirmed a hard line against any Palestinian state, saying it would pose “an existential danger” to Israel. Referring to Israel’s objective in its devastating three-month-old war in Gaza, Borrell told reporters: “To say that destruction of Hamas is the aim is one-sided, because it means that it will be up to Israel to decide when they think [Hamas] has become weak enough. We can’t go on working like this.” Israel’s massiveaerial and ground offensivein small, densely populated Gaza has killed more than 25,000 Palestinians, according to authorities, and displaced most of its 2.3 million people from their homes.    Israel says the war could go on for “many months” and it would not rest until Hamas was eradicated, all Israeli captives freed and Gaza posed no more security threat. The war in Gaza hasplunged the Middle East into fresh turmoil and sparked fears of a broader conflict. Ahead of the Brussels meeting, the EU’s diplomatic service sent a discussion paper to its 27 member countries, suggesting a roadmap to peace in the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict. At the heart of the plan is a call for a “preparatory peace conference” to be organised by the EU, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the League of Arab States, with the United States and United Nations also invited to be conveners of the gathering. An internal document, seen by multiple news agencies, says if Israelis or Palestinians declined to take part, the two parties would be consulted at every step of the talks as delegates sought to draw up a peace plan.

"Netanyahu rejects Hamas deal to end war, release captives",Israeli leader says soldiers will have ‘fallen in vain’ if he accepts Palestinian group’s terms to end the war.,"Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected a proposal by Hamas to end the war and release captives in exchange for withdrawing Israeli forces, releasing prisoners and accepting the armed group’s governance of Gaza. Netanyahu, who is under growing domestic pressure to bring the captives home, said that accepting Hamas’s conditions would mean leaving the armed group “intact” and that Israel’s soldiers had “fallen in vain”. “I reject outright the terms of surrender of the monsters of Hamas,” Netanyahu said on Sunday. “If we accept this, we won’t be able to guarantee the safety of our citizens. We will not be able to bring evacuees home safely and the next October 7 will only be a matter of time,”  the Israeli leader added. Netanyahu earlier repeated his opposition to an independent Palestinian state, insisting hewould not compromiseon “full Israeli security control over the entire area in the west of Jordan”. Netanyahu is under pressure on multiple fronts, as families of the captives call for a deal to secure the return of their loved ones, members of his far-right ruling coalition push for an escalation of the war, and growing differences cloud relations with the administration of United States President Joe Biden. On Sunday evening, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum began a protest outside the Israeli leader’s private home in Jerusalem, pledging not to leave until he agrees to a deal on the captives’ release. “If the prime minister decides to sacrifice the hostages, he should show leadership and honestly share his position with the Israeli public,” the group said in a statement. Al Jazeera’s Hamdah Salhut, reporting from occupied East Jerusalem, said that the protesters feel they are not being seen or heard by their government. “They feel neglected and forgotten,” Salhut said. “You also have dissent from within the war cabinet – with one member saying that perhaps a total defeat of Hamas is not a realistic goal for the government to be aiming for and that there should also be elections held, so that the public can show their confidence in the government.” Hamas freed more than 100 captives in exchange for the release of 240 Palestinian prisoners as part of a brief truce brokered in late November by Egypt, Qatar and the US. Hamas is still holding 136 people in captivity, according to Israeli officials. At least 25,105 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel declared its intention to eliminate Hamas in response to the group’s October 7 attacks. Hamas on Sunday released a report describing the attack on southern Israel as “a necessary step and a normal response” while admitting “faults” in its execution.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/22/netanyahu-rejects-hamas-deal-to-end-war-release-captives
Egypt’s el-Sisi says Cairo will not allow any threat to Somalia,El-Sisi’s comments come amid dispute between Somalia and Ethiopia over the latter’s deal with Somaliland.,"Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has said Cairo stands shoulder to shoulder with Somalia and has slammed Ethiopia’s agreement with Somaliland to obtain access to the sea and establish a marine force base. “Egypt will not allow anyone to threaten Somalia or affect its security,” el-Sisi said, speaking at a news conference with visiting Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud. “Do not try Egypt, or try to threaten its brothers especially if they ask it to intervene,” he said. Somaliland, a region strategically located by the Gulf of Aden, broke away from Somalia in 1991 as the country collapsed into a civil conflict. The region has maintained its own government despite a lack of international recognition. OnJanuary 1, in a memorandum, Ethiopia said it would consider recognising Somaliland’s independence in return for the port access. It would lease 20km (12 miles) of coastland around the port of Berbera, on the Gulf of Aden, for 50 years for military and commercial purposes. Ethiopia’s current main port for maritime exports is in the neighbouring country of Djibouti. Sheikh Mohamud, the president of Somalia,rejectedthe deal as a violation of international law and said: “We will not stand idly by and watch our sovereignty being compromised.” He arrived in Egypt over the weekend to rally support for his government. Besides meeting President el-Sisi, he met with Arab League chief Ahmed Aboul Gheit and Al-Azhar Mosque’s Grand Imam, Sheikh Ahmed al-Tayeb. “My message to Ethiopia is that … trying to seize a piece of land to control it is something no one will agree to,” el-Sisi said, noting cooperation on development was a better strategy. On Sunday, Ethiopia rejected criticism from Egypt over the deal, saying it was merely a commercial agreement aimed at securing access to the sea and not an attempt to annex land. “It isn’t annexation or assumption of sovereignty over the territory of any state,” Redwan Hussien, national security adviser to the prime minister of Ethiopia, said in a post on X. Ethiopia’s commitment for peace and security in Somalia has been demonstrated through the blood and sweat of its precious sons and daughters.

"Hamas says October 7 attack was a ‘necessary step’, admits to ‘some faults’",The Palestinian group provides its account of what happened before and during the assault on communities in southern Israel.,"The Palestinian group Hamas has said there were “faults” in the October 7 attack it led on southern Israel, but claimed its fighters only targeted Israeli soldiers and people carrying weapons. In a 16-page report titled “Our Narrative” and published on Sunday, Hamas, which governs Gaza, said it wanted to “clarify” the background and dynamics of the surprise attack it calls Operation Al-Aqsa Flood. In its first public report since the attack, Hamas said it was “a necessary step and a normal response to confront all Israeli conspiracies against the Palestinian people”. Early on October 7, Hamas fighters stormed communities along Israel’s southern fence with Gaza. At least 1,139 people, mostly civilians, were killed in the attack, according to an Al Jazeera tally based on official Israeli statistics, and about 240 others were seized as captives. Around 100 of the captives were released during a seven-day truce in late November in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails. Israeli authorities have accused Hamas fighters of committing war crimes during the attack, including torture, rape and mutilation. Hamas has strongly rejected allegations of sexual violence and or mutilation. The report said Hamas planned to target Israeli military sites and to capture soldiers, which could be used to pressure the Israeli authorities to release thousands of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. The group said that avoiding harming civilians “is a religious and moral commitment” by fighters of Hamas’s armed wing, the Qassam Brigades. “If there was any case of targeting civilians; it happened accidentally and in the course of the confrontation with the occupation forces,” read the report. It added that “maybe some faults happened” during the attack “due to the rapid collapse of the Israeli security and military system, and the chaos caused along the areas near Gaza. “Many Israelis were killed by the Israeli army and police due to their confusion,” it added.    Israel responded to the attack with a devastating bombardment of Gaza, which has been under an Israeli blockade for 17 years,killing more than 25,000 people– mostly women and children, according to Palestinian authorities in the territory. Palestinian officials and human rights groups have accused Israel of committing war crimes in its assault on Gaza. The Hamas report also addressed the issue of post-war Gaza, a day after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu doubled down on hisopposition to Palestinian statehood. “We stress that the Palestinian people have the capacity to decide their future and to arrange their internal affairs,” the report said, adding that “no party in the world” had the right to decide on their behalf. The report also listed the reasons that led to the attack, citing Israel’s campaign of settlements’ construction “and Judaization of the Palestinian lands in the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem”, and the killing of thousands of Palestinian civilians from 2000 until this year.

Israel approves plan to transfer Gaza tax funds to Norway,Palestinian Authority official Hussein al-Sheikh says ‘any deductions from our financial rights’ would be rejected.,"Taxes collected by Israel and bound for Gaza will be held in Norway, instead of being sent to the Palestinian Authority (PA), which exercises limited self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, according to a plan approved by Israeli officials. “The frozen funds will not be transferred to the Palestinian Authority, but will remain in the hands of a third country,” said a statement released on Sunday by the Israeli prime minister’s office. “The money or its consideration will not be transferred under any circumstances, except with the approval of the Minister of Finance of Israel, not even through a third party,” it said. In line with a deal reached in the 1990s, Israel collects tax on behalf of the Palestinians and makes monthly transfers to the PA pending the approval of the Ministry of Finance. While the PA was ousted from the strip in 2007, many of its public sector employees in the enclave kept their jobs and continued to be paid with transferred tax revenues. But nearly a month after theOctober 7 attack– when Hamas fighters launched an unprecedented assault into southern Israel killing at least 1,139 people, according to an Al Jazeera tally based on Israeli statistics, and taking about 240 captives – Israeli authorities decided to withhold funds earmarked for the Gaza Strip. In response to the money deduction, the PA refused to accept a partial transfer of money.    “Any deductions from our financial rights or any conditions imposed by Israel that prevent the PA from paying our people in the Gaza Strip are rejected by us,” said senior PA official Hussein al-Sheikh on X. “We call on the international community to stop this behavior based on piracy and stealing the money of the Palestinian people and force Israel to transfer all of our money,” he added. Nour Odeh, a political analyst based in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, said Israel was using its leverage over the tax revenues to “punish” and “weaken” the PA. “It’s a way for Israel to assert how much control it has on everything, including the PA’s ability to function. It’s not clear if the PA would be willing to accept conditions, because it would be humiliating to walk back its pledge to not take the revenues with the deduction of Gaza’s share of it,” she told Al Jazeera. “[WIthholding the revenues] will have a huge impact because those employed by the PA won’t receive their salaries at a time when many are starving due to Israel’s siege and war – people need that money to survive.” Far-right Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir was the only member of the government to oppose the plan to send the funds to Norway. Ben-Gvir said the plan does not guarantee that the money won’t be transferred to Gaza. “Last week they started moving flour trucks and now they are making a decision that does not guarantee that the money will not reach the Nazis from Gaza,” the far-right leader said on X, adding that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was “constantly” moving “the red line”. The issue has been a source of friction within the Israeli war cabinet, with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant calling for the funds to be distributed to maintain stability in the occupied West Bank. Violence there has spiked since the start of the war amid nearly daily raids and mass arrest campaigns in cities and villages by Israeli forces. Since then, at least 319 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces or settlers, according to UN figures, and more than 6,000 have been arrested, according to the Palestinian Prisoner’s Society advocacy group.

"Gaza death toll surpasses 25,000 as Israel escalates assault",UN chief António Guterres denounces Israel for the ‘heartbreaking’ deaths of Palestinian civilians in Gaza.,"The Palestinian death toll in Israel’s assault on Gaza has surpassed 25,000, according to the Ministry of Health in the territory. Ministry spokesperson Ashraf al-Qudra said on Sunday that 178 people had been confirmed killed in the previous 24 hours, with the death toll in more than three months of Israel’s war on Gaza reaching 25,105. The Israeli bombardment began after Hamas’s surprise attack on southern Israel on October 7 killed at least 1,139 people, according to an Al Jazeera tally based on official Israeli statistics. Around 250 other people in Israel were taken hostage by Palestinian armed groups. Reporting from Rafah in southern Gaza, Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud said there was intense ground fighting near a key hospital in Khan Younis on Sunday. “Snipers have taken positions in high-rise buildings, shooting people on the street below. People in [Nasser] hospital have no place to go,” said Mahmoud, adding that “It’s street-to-street, house-to-house fighting.” The previous day, Israeli shelling east of the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gazakilled four Palestiniansand injured 21 others, according to the Palestine Red Crescent Society. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres denounced Israel for the “heartbreaking” deaths of Palestinian civilians in Gaza. “Israel’s military operations have spread mass destruction and killed civilians on a scale unprecedented during my time as secretary-general,” Guterres said at the opening of the G77+China summit in the Ugandan capital of Kampala. Guterres told Al Jazeera that the resolution to the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict lies in “the acceptance of the right of the Palestinians to statehood and the acceptance of a two-state solution”. The comments come a day after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu doubled down on hisopposition to Palestinian statehood.    At least 62,681 people have been wounded in the Israeli assault on Gaza, according to Palestinian authorities. Some 85 percent of the territory’s population has been displaced, with thousands sheltering in UN-run camps in the southern part of the coastal enclave in squalid conditions. The UN has said there are “famine-like” conditions in Gaza as around one in four of the population of 2.3 million people faceextreme hunger. Only a fraction of the aid needed has been delivered due to fighting and severe Israeli restrictions on shipments. Women and children are the biggest victims in the war, according to the UN. Netanyahu has vowed to keep up the offensive until Hamas is wiped out, with Israel also ramping up fighting on other fronts, sparking fears oftensions boiling over regionally.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/21/gaza-death-toll-surpasses-25000-as-israel-escalates-assault
"Palestinian industries falter as Israel bombs Gaza, locks down West Bank",A serious aspect of Israel’s violence in Gaza and the occupied West Bank is how it’s hurting Palestinian businesses.,"Bethlehem, occupied West Bank– As the occupied West Bank roils with near-daily Israeli raids, settler attacks and killings of Palestinians, an overlooked impact of the violence is starting to take its toll. The past few months, Muhanad Nairoukh, manager of one of the three biggest aluminium factories in the occupied West Bank, tells Al Jazeera, have been the worst for production and profits in a long time. Life in the occupied West Bank is becoming more dangerous and complicated for the people living there, and alongside that, industry has crawled to a near halt as a result of Israeli actions, making it impossible to have “business as usual”. Nairoukh manages more than 30 employees who keep the company his father founded in 1993 running. He has found himself having to cut costs recently as the company operates at 40 percent capacity, and production has been reduced by 60 percent. The Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS)estimatedat the end of December that the overall economic losses in Palestine, since the beginning of the Israeli aggression on Gaza, reached around $1.5bn during the initial months of the war, equivalent to approximately $25m per day, excluding direct losses in properties and assets. The Israeli checkpoints, which at best hold up shipments and at worse refuse to let them through, have increased the cost of internal transportation and shipping between Palestinian cities and overseas. Conversely, importing raw materials has become a logistical nightmare, significantly inflating production costs at a time when demand is plummeting due to the war. Nairoukh added that the checkpoints also affect the ability of workers to get to work on time, with truck drivers having to reroute their shipments, which exposes them to danger in addition to the time it wastes. Importing raw materials, as Nairoukh does from countries including China, Italy, Spain and Turkey, has been complicated by the closure of ports at the beginning of the war, leading to delays that resulted in inflated costs. A shipment from China, he said, used to cost $1,650 before the war but skyrocketed to $7,600 afterwards, a 360 percent increase – the kind of rise in costs that he is not sure he will be able to absorb for much longer, especially as delays mean cancelled orders and contracts. Samir Hazboun, secretary-general of the Federation of Palestinian Chambers of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture, told Al Jazeera that both extractive and transformative industries in Palestine are in trouble. He added that other factors, such as the fluctuating exchange rates for industries that import raw materials, also play a big role. Nairoukh and other business owners who service the construction sector, as he does, have found their sales plummeting as construction has come to a near-standstill. As fewer and fewer public and private sector employees receive their salaries and Palestinians who used to work in Israel are barred from crossing the checkpoints, there is less money for even individuals to complete construction projects. While October to May is usually the construction high season, this year it was a season of significant loss instead. Collecting money owed on older orders is also becoming more complicated as cheques bounce because the people who wrote them a few months ago now have empty bank accounts. In just one day, Nairoukh reveals, he had about 67,000 shekels ($18,000) worth of cheques bounce. He is not likely to try to go after these individuals either, he says, as it is not possible to expect them to pay off such amounts when the situation is so dire for all Palestinians. But losing out on this potential income burdens his company financially even more. Hazboun predicts that, if these conditions continue, there will be numerous economic collapses. For example, he says, only 30 to 35 of Bethlehem’s 130 stone and raw material factories are operational. Nairoukh has felt this pinch in all aspects of his life as the father of two has had to postpone maintenance and renovation projects for the family home and may find himself reducing household expenses if the war persists. He has kept his employees on and continued paying them, but he acknowledges that this may not be possible for much longer if the war persists, at which point layoffs may be necessary. His employees also worry about their livelihoods. They consider themselves lucky to still have jobs but know full well that the situation is very precarious. Rakan Ibrahim Abu Al-Hur, who lives near Bethlehem, considers himself lucky to still have his job cutting and processing aluminium rolls. Responsible for supporting his parents and five siblings, he really hopes the situation improves soon. He tells Al Jazeera how difficult it is now to commute back and forth from his village of ash-Shawawra to Bethlehem for work. The checkpoint at the city’s entrance is frequently closed or the inspection lines are long and slow, delaying everyone who is trying to get through. “I hope this all ends soon because if the war doesn’t stop, everything will collapse and I’ll lose my job,” Rakan says sadly.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/21/palestinian-industries-falter-as-israel-bombs-gaza-locks-down-west-bank
US base attacked in Iraq hours after Iran vows revenge for Damascus attack,American soldiers are reportedly wounded in attacks allegedly made by Iran-linked groups as fears of a wide regional conflict grow.,"Iran-backed armed groups have targeted US troops in Iraq hours after Tehran vowed revenge and blamed Israel for adeadly attackon a building housing its elite forces in the Syrian capital Damascus, driving fears of wide regional conflict. The attack caused one Iraqi and possible American casualties, the US Central Command (CENTCOM) said on Saturday, and came hours after Tehran vowed to take revenge against Israel for its strike targeting theIranian Revolutionary Guards Corps(IRGC) in Syria. “Multiple ballistic missiles and rockets were launched by Iranian-backed militants in western Iraq targeting al-Assad Airbase,” CENTCOM said on X. Most of the projectiles were intercepted by the base’s air defence systems, but “others impacted on the base”, the statement said.

Since launching its offensive on the Gaza Strip, Israel has expanded its attacks targeting Iran-linked armed groups in Syria and Lebanon. Yemen’s Houthis, who form part of Tehran-backed groups known as the “axis of resistance”, have launched attacks towards Israel and targeted Israel-linked ships in the Red Sea in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza disrupting one of the busiest maritime routes. Houthis demand Israel end its war on Gaza and allow humanitarian aid into the besieged territory in desperate need of food, medicines and other essential items. Jordan’s Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi has warned of the dangers of escalation in Israel’s war on Gaza. “If Israel continues to ramp up its attacks on other fronts and if it drags the West in, we’ll be looking at a very, very serious escalation of the conflict,” he told Al Jazeera. The stepped-up Israeli and US attacks targeting Iran-linked groups have the potential to trigger a regional conflict, pitting Iran and its allies against Israel and the US. An Israeli drone strike in south Lebanon reportedly killed a member of Hezbollah, who was travelling in a car, according to two security sources. Another unidentified person travelling in the same car was also killed. Meanwhile, the US said it had targeted a missile that the Houthis were aiming into the Red Sea. The US military has in the last week launched anumber of strikesat the Houthis. According to Hassan Ahmadian, a professor at the University of Tehran, Israel is widening the conflict due to its inability to achieve its military goals in Gaza. “Israelis have upped the ante of what they were doing beforehand,” Ahmadian told Al Jazeera, adding that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been vocal about calls for an escalation.    Israel is also ramping up its attacks to stave off attacks by Iran and allies in the region, however many of these groups are part of the “axis of resistance” and are doing so in their own national interests, he said. On Saturday, Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi said his country would retaliate against theattack in Damascuswhich killed five members of the IRGC. Tehran blamed Israel for the latest attack targeting its forces in Syria – a close ally of Iran. “The Islamic Republic will not leave the Zionist regime’s crimes unanswered,” Raisi said, according to state broadcaster IRIB. There was no comment from Israel, but it has killed IRGC members in several similar strikes since October 7. They were targeted in a building in Damascus which was flattened by “precision-targeted Israeli missiles”, according to a security source close to Syria’s government. Portraits of the IRGC members on Iranian state media referred to three of them with an honorific used for generals, suggesting they were senior commanders, while the two others were a major and someone holding a lower rank.    An unspecified number of Syrian troops were also killed. Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian said on the X: “The activities of Iran’s military advisers in the fight against terrorism and securing the region will continue with full strength.” Iran and its military allies in Syria have entrenched themselves in several parts of the country. In December, an Israeli air strike killed two IRGC members, and another on December 25 killed a senior adviser to the IRGC.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/21/iraqi-iran-backed-group-attacks-us-base-as-region-faces-threat-of-wider-war
Israel’s Netanyahu doubles down on opposition to Palestinian statehood,"Israeli PM rejects Palestinian sovereignty over Gaza and the occupied territory, rebuffing President Biden’s push for two-state solution.","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeated his opposition to an independent Palestinian state, saying his country needed full security control over the Palestinian territories, rebuffing United States President Joe Biden’s stance on the issue. “I will not compromise on full Israeli security control over the entire area in the west of Jordan – and this is contrary to a Palestinian state,” Netanyahu posted on X late on Saturday night, doubling down his opposition to a Palestinian state a day after speaking to the US president, who has offered unconditional support to Israel in its war on Gaza Strip, in a phone call. Biden on Friday said he spoke with Netanyahu about possible solutions for the creation of an independent Palestinian state, suggesting one path could involve a non-militarised government. Biden’s call with Netanyahu was the first in nearly a month, the White House said. Asked if a two-state solution was “impossible” while Netanyahu was in office, Biden said, “No, it’s not.” But in a statement, the Israeli prime minister’s office said Netanyahu told Biden that “after Hamas is destroyed Israel must retain security control over Gaza to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel, a requirement that contradicts the demand for Palestinian sovereignty”. Netanyahu is under heat to appease members of his far-right ruling coalition by intensifying the war on the besieged Palestinian enclave, killing more than 165 people in the past 24 hours. Close to 25,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, have been killed in relentless bombardment since October 7. Heexpressed his oppositionto any Palestinian state multiple times since launching the war on Gaza deferring to the Biden administration’s stance on the issue. The UK said on Sunday that Netanyahu’s opposition to Palestinian sovereignty is “disappointing”. “I think it’s disappointing actually, to hear that from the Israeli prime minister,” said Defence Secretary Grant Shapps on the Sky News channel. Meanwhile, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Sunday said “the denial of the right to statehood for the Palestinian people” is “unacceptable”. “The right of the Palestinian people to build their own state must be recognized by all,” he posted on X. US-backed peace talks towards the so-called “two-state solution” that would see Israel existing side by side with a Palestinian state in Gaza, the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, collapsed a decade ago. On Thursday, US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said there was no way to solve Israel’s long-term security challenges and the short-term challenges of rebuilding Gaza without the establishment of a Palestinian state. Miller said Israel had an opportunity now as countries in the region were ready to give it security assurances.    Netanyahu says Israel must fight until it achieves “complete victory” and Hamas no longer poses a threat but has not outlined how this will be accomplished. Hamas has been governing Gaza since 2007 when Israel imposed a land, sea and air blockade on the enclave of 2.3 million people. But a member of Israel’s war cabinet, former army chief Gadi Eisenkot, has called a ceasefire the only way to secure the captives’ release, a comment that implied criticism of Israel’s current strategy. Critics have accused Netanyahu of preventing a cabinet-level debate about a post-war scenario for Gaza. They say he is stalling to prevent conflict within his coalition. Netanyahu’s office called the claim that he was unnecessarily prolonging the war “utter nonsense”. Israel launched itswar on Gazaafter the Hamas group’s unprecedented October 7 attacks that killed about 1,100 people, mostly civilians, in Israel and saw about 250 others taken captive. In a sign of the pressures Netanyahu’s government faces at home, thousands of Israelis protested in Tel Aviv on Saturday, calling for new elections, and others demonstrated outside the prime minister’s house, joining families of the more than 100 remaining captives held by Hamas and other fighters. They fear that Israel’s military activity further endangers captives’ lives.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/21/israels-netanyahu-doubles-down-on-opposition-to-palestinian-statehood

Another vigil held at the Masjid Omar mosque in Harvey, New Orleans was standing room only, according to the New Orleans news outlet NOLA.com. Ajaq’s relative, Joe Abdel Qaki, said Tawfiq and a friend were having a barbecue in a village field when he was shot, once in the head and once in the chest. Abdel Qaki said he arrived at the field shortly after the shooting and helped transport Tawfiq to an ambulance. He said Israeli forces briefly detained him and other Palestinians at the scene, asking for their identification cards before the men could get to Tawfiq. He said Tawfiq died in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. “Tawfiq is an American child who was chased and shot at by an Israeli settler, then Israeli forces pulled up and continued shooting,” Miranda Cleland, an advocacy officer with Defense for Children Palestine, said in a post on X. “This is not the first time Defense for Children Palestine hasn’t been able to confirm whether a settler or soldier killed a child.

Please report if you identified one of them,” read the message, which also listed a phone number and a link to a website containing images and names of the captives in Arabic. “They are asking people’s help because they are unable to get to their hostages because of the resistance,” said Abu Ali, one north Gaza resident. “End the war, Netanyahu, and get your people back,” he told the Reuters news agency. Israeli army has dropped leaflets that state they have conditioned the forced displacement of Palestinian citizens (war crime) on the return of the hostages. So, although their abduction had nothing to do with them Palestinian citizens are being collectively punished (war crime).https://t.co/PC9eqWToFV — Naks Bilal (@NaksBilal)January 20, 2024  The captives were taken during Hamas’s October 7 attack on southern Israel in which more than 1,100 people were killed. Israel has since relentlessly bombarded Gaza, killing more than 24,900 Palestinians, mostly women and children. More than 100 of the captives were freed during a short-lived November truce between Israel and Hamas. Israel says 132 remain in Gaza and 27 have died in captivity. On Saturday in the Israeli capital, dozens of relatives of the captives rallied outside the private residence of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, demanding he reach a deal with Hamas to ensure their release. The protesters plan to spend the night in tents outside Netanyahu’s house in the coastal town of Caesarea – some 60km (37 miles) north of Tel Aviv – to protest against his lack of progress. “The protesters said that they wanted Netanyahu to step out and speak to them,” said Al Jazeera’s Laura Khan, reporting from occupied East Jerusalem. “One person, whose brother is in captivity and whose mother was released in thelast deal, said Netanyahu looked her in the eyes and said the captives matter. She believes he’s lying. She said there was blood on his hands,” she added. People standing outside Netanyahu’s home held up posters reading, “We want a deal now”, Khan noted.    On Friday, Israeli war cabinet minister and former military chief Gadi Eizenkot saida deal will be neededto ensure captives still held in theGaza Stripare released alive, adding that a lightning raid would be extremely unlikely to succeed. However, Netanyahu has said he will push for “complete victory” against Hamas but has not outlined how he would achieve it. Meanwhile, in Israel’s third-largest city, Haifa, an anti-war protest took place on Saturday with Israeli Jews and Palestinian citizens of Israel coming together to call for an end to the fighting in Gaza. “The message here is to end the war and that [the Israelis] can only live peacefully, side by side, with a political solution for the Palestinians,” said Al Jazeera’s Stefanie Dekker, reporting from the protest, which Israeli officials only allowed to take place for two hours. In Gaza, attacks showedno signs of stoppingas the health ministry said Israeli attacks killed 165 people and wounded 280 others in the past 24 hours. “There hasn’t been any let-up in the intense bombing across the Gaza Strip and it looks like it’s all started again in the north where more residential buildings have been targeted,” said Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Rafah. “There appears to be a surge in the intensity and scale of the bombings, with the remaining buildings in the vicinity of al-Shifa Hospital and the western part of Gaza City and Jabalia and Beit Lahiya being hit.” The vicinity of Nasser hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis also came under heavy bombardment, Mahmoud noted. The facility is one of the few partially functioning hospitals in Gaza. In more than 100 days of war, Israel’s air, land and sea offensive has devastated much of Gaza, displacing most of the 2.3 million population, many forced to move repeatedly and seek refuge in tents that do little to protect them from the elements and disease, according to the United Nations.

Sudan suspends membership in IGAD regional bloc,Government accused east African bloc of ‘violating’ Sudan’s sovereignty by inviting RSF chief to a summit.,"The government of war-ravaged Sudan says it has suspended its membership in the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), the east African regional bloc that has tried to broker talks between the country’s warring parties. Saturday’s announcement was made by the foreign ministry, which is loyal toAbdel Fattah al-Burhan, the army chief and Sudan’s de facto leader. The Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary grouphave been fighting for nine monthsin a war that has killed thousands of people and displaced more than seven million. In a statement, the foreign ministry said Burhan sent a letter to President Ismail Omar Guelleho of Djibouti, current chair of IGAD, “to inform him of the Sudanese government decision suspending its membership in this organisation”. The governmenthad announcedthis week that it was freezing its relations with the bloc in advance of a meeting in Uganda on Thursday, after it invited RSF head Mohamed Hamdan “Hemedti” Dagalo. It accused the bloc of “violating Sudan’s sovereignty” and setting a “dangerous precedent”.    At its summit on Thursday, IGAD reiterated its call for “an immediate and unconditional ceasefire” in the “unjust war affecting the people” of Sudan. The bloc also expressed “continued readiness to offer its good offices to facilitate an all-inclusive peace process”, and again called for a face-to-face meeting between the two sides. A final communique from the extraordinary assembly gave the generals two weeks to meet. Sudan’s foreign ministry said it was this item, placed on the agenda without Sudan’s approval, which led it to the further step of suspending its membership. The ministry also accused the summit communique of violating Sudan’s sovereignty and “wounding the sentiments of victims of rebel militia atrocities”, a reference to the RSF. IGAD, in parallel with the United States and Saudi Arabia, had repeatedly attempted to mediate between the two sides, to no avail. The war erupted in mid-April over an internationally backed plan to merge the RSF into the army and launch a transition towards elections. The army and the RSF had shared power after longtime ruler Omar al-Bashir was toppled during a popular uprising in 2019. Before they came to blows, they jointly staged a coup in 2021 that upended efforts to steer Sudan towards democracy. Throughout the conflict, both sides have been accused of war crimes, including the indiscriminate shelling of residential areas, torture and arbitrary detention of civilians. The RSF has also been accused of ethnically motivated mass killings – especially inDarfur– as well as rampant looting and the use of rape as a weapon of war. More than 13,000 people have been killed in the conflict, according to a conservative estimate by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project. An estimated 7.5 million civilians have fled the fighting, either abroad or to other parts of the country, according to United Nations figures.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/20/sudan-suspends-membership-in-igad-regional-bloc
Palestinians accuse Israeli forces of executing 19 civilians in Gaza,"Footage, witness accounts shared with Al Jazeera reveal how Israeli soldiers carried out executions in Gaza last month.","Israeli soldiers executed at least 19 civilians in Gaza City in December, said witnesses who recounted how women and girls were separated from their families, beaten and strip-searched. Human rights groups have been gathering testimonies of the alleged summary executions and Al Jazeera has obtained footage and witness accounts from members of one family about the assault that took place on December 19. “Tanks and bulldozers surrounded the building. Shells had been hitting the building for days. The situation was desperate,” said Umm Odai Salem, whose husband was among those killed. The Israeli soldiers stormed the building. “They banged on our door. My husband … told them we are all civilians. They took him to another apartment. I followed them, pleading with them to let him go because we are civilians,” she said. “They beat me and my daughters. They put us women in one place and threatened us with guns and knives. They made us strip. They searched us, insulting us using the most terrible words,” Salem added. The soldiers disregarded their pleas and proceeded to “execute” all the men they rounded up outside. “My husband was one of the 19 men killed in this building. They ordered them to bend down and executed them. They killed them all.”    The footage shows the bodies of men with the entry holes of bullets in their back. After the men were killed, the apartment that Salem and her daughters were sheltering in was hit, one of her daughters told Al Jazeera, killing her three-year-old sister, Nada. “I was holding my sister in my arms. Then the shelling resumed. Nada was hit. She made some soft sounds. She asked for some water.” “I thought she was crying. But she was dying. Shrapnel had entered her head, eyes and neck. My sister tried to carry her body but she fell from her arms at the door.” William Schabas, professor of international law at Middlesex University in London, says the footage, along with testimonies, would constitute evidence in theInternational Criminal Court. “I should add that it’s not really important to demonstrate that they’re civilians. Summary executions even of fighters, even of combatants is a war crime,” he told Al Jazeera. Schabas, who was a chairperson of the Commission of Inquiry on the2014 Gaza war, added that beyond testimonies and footage of bodies, prosecutors would need to submit the identity of perpetrators to get this to court in the first place. “That’s one of the great challenges in a situation like this, [which] is actually finding out who were the people who fired the weapons or gave the orders,” he said. Muhammad Shehada, of the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor in Copenhagen, told Al Jazeera his organisation believes there is a pattern of a “systematic”killingtaking place on the ground. “In at least 13 of field executions, we corroborated that it was arbitrary on the part of the Israeli forces,” said Shehada, the group’s chief of programmes and communications. The monitoring group’s members who visited crime scenes and gathered testimonies from witnesses and family members of those who were killed, as well as reports from the health ministry in Gaza, said the soldiers have a sense of impunity. Israeli forces have previously been accused of executing civilians since the current conflict erupted on October 7. In December, citing one instance, the United Nations human rights office called for an independent inquiry into allegations that Israeli soldiers executed at least 11 Palestinian men in Gaza in what it called “a possible war crime”. The key issue is how such probes would be conducted, analysts say, since none of the entities that could investigate alleged Israeli crimes against Palestinians is currently allowed into the Gaza Strip. Many Palestinians have also accused Israeli forces ofmistreatment and tortureafter being held in Israeli prisons.    On Friday, Muhammad Abu Samra, a detainee released in Gaza, accused the Israeli army of “torture” and “beatings”. “The army … threatened to shoot us while we were naked in the cold. Then female soldiers attacked us and we were subjected to obscene insults,” Abu Samra told Al Jazeera. Another released prisoner, Abdel Qader Fatesh, said soldiers ordered him to take his clothes off, tied his hands and blindfolded him. A UN human rights official said on Friday thatdetainees in the Gaza Stripwere subjected to weeks of imprisonment in unknown locations and physical abuse.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/20/palestinians-accuse-israeli-forces-of-executing-19-civilians-in-gaza
Oil supply tightens in Europe over Red Sea disruptions,The volume going to Europe from the Middle East has nearly halved amid continuing attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels.,"The structure of the global benchmark Brent crude futures market and some physical markets in Europe and Africa have been reflecting tighter supply partly over concerns about shipping delays as vessels avoid the Red Sea due to missile and drone attacks. The disruptions – which have been the largest to global trade since the COVID-19 pandemic – have combined with other factors such as rising Chinese demand to increase competition for crude supply that does not have to transit the Suez Canal, and analysts say this is most evident in European markets. In a sign of tighter supply, the market structure of Brent – which is used to price nearly 80 percent of the world’s traded oil – hit its most bullish in two months on Friday, as tankers diverted from the Red Sea following recent air strikes by theUnited States and United Kingdomon targets in Yemen. In response toIsrael’s war on Gaza, rebels from the Iran-aligned group that controls northern Yemen and its western coastline have launched awave of assaultson ships in the Red Sea.  By targeting vessels with perceived links to Israel, the Houthis are attempting to force Tel Aviv to stop the war and allow humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. Houthi activity has so far been concentrated in the narrow strait of Bab al-Mandeb, which connects the Gulf of Aden to the Red Sea. Approximately 50 ships sail through the strait every day, heading to and from the Suez Canal – a central artery for global trade. Some of the world’s largest shipping companies have suspended transit in the region, forcing vessels to sail around the Cape of Good Hope in Southern Africa. The lengthier route has raised freight rates due to higher fuel, crew and insurance costs. “Brent is the most impacted futures contract when it comes to Red Sea/Suez Canal disruptions,” Viktor Katona, lead crude analyst at Kpler, told the Reuters news agency. “So who suffers the most on the physical front? Undoubtedly, it is European refiners.” The premium of the first-month Brent contract to the six-month contract LCOc1-LCOc7 rose to as much as $2.15 a barrel on Friday, the highest since early November. This structure, called backwardation, indicates a perception of tighter supply for prompt delivery.    Less Middle Eastern crude is heading to Europe, with the volume nearly halved to about 570,000 barrels per day (bpd) in December from 1.07 million bpd in October, Kpler data showed. Ships travelling through the Suez Canal have taken on greater strategic significance since the war in Ukraine, assanctions against Russiahave made Europe more dependent on oil from the Middle East, which supplies one-third of the world’s Brent crude. But it’s challenging to measure the impact of Red Sea shipping separately, one crude trader told Reuters. “It’s a strong market everywhere, but people are very nervous.” Other developments have also tightened the European crude market including a drop in Libyan supply due to protests, the first such disruption for months, and lowerNigerianexports. LNG vessels shun the Red Sea amid ongoing security threatsCurrently, no LNG vessels are transiting the#RedSeaamid heightened tensions off the coast of Yemen. Kpler data shows that 2-3#LNGtankers would usually pass the passage on a typical day.pic.twitter.com/mZoufWh5ss — Kpler (@Kpler)January 18, 2024  Angolan crude, which also heads to Europe without having to pass through the Suez Canal, is seeing higher demand from China and India because of issues around Iranian and Russian crude, reducing the supply that could come to Europe. China’s oil trade with Iran has stalled as Tehran withholds shipments and demands higher prices, while India’s imports of Russian crude have fallen due to currency challenges, although India attributed the drop to unattractive prices. Meanwhile, Russia leapfrogged Saudi Arabia to become China’s top crude oil supplier in 2023, data showed on Saturday, as the world’s biggest crude importer defied Western sanctions over Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine to buy vast quantities of discounted oil for its processing plants. Russia shipped a record 107.02 million metric tonnes of crude oil to China last year, equivalent to 2.14 million bpd, the Chinese customs data showed, far more than other major oil exporters such as Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Imports from Saudi Arabia, previously China’s largest supplier, fell 1.8 percent to 85.96 million tonnes, as the Middle East oil giant lost market share to cheaper Russian crude.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/20/oil-supply-tightens-in-europe-over-red-sea-disruptions
Iran’s IRGC says 5 members killed in Israeli attack on Syria’s Damascus,Iran confirms killing of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps members as regional tensions flare up amid Israel’s war on Gaza.,"Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) says five of its “military advisers” have been killed in an Israeli air raid on a residential building in Syria’s capital, Damascus. Syrian state media SANA said the attack on Saturday took place in the Mazzeh neighbourhood. It said “Israeli aggression” targeted thebuilding. Iran also blamed Israel for the attack, saying it “reserves the right to respond”. “The Islamic Republic will not leave the Zionist regime’s crimes unanswered,” Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi said in a statement broadcast on state media. Earlier, the foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani said Tehran would respond “at the appropriate time and place”, and condemned “an escalation in aggressive and provocative attacks” by Israel. A well-informed source told Al Jazeera the target was an IRGC intelligence unit, adding that a senior IRGC intelligence official in Syria and his assistants were in the building. In a statement immediately after the attack, the IRGC said an air raid by Israeli fighter jets killed “a number of Syrian forces and four military advisers”. It identified the people killed as Hojjatollah Omidvar, Ali Aghazadeh, Hossein Mohammadi and Saied Karimi, without sharing their ranks. Later in the day, IRGC said a fifth member of the elite force also died after succumbing to his wounds, naming him as Mohammad Amin Samadi, Iranian state media reported. The attack, which is believed to have been carried out with at least four missiles, completely destroyed a four-storey building, according to Iranian state media. Israel has yet to comment. The attack in Syria comes amid widening tensions in the region and theIsraeli offensiveon Gaza that has killed nearly 25,000 people. On Saturday, an Israeli raid in south Lebanon killed two people, at least one a Hezbollah member. Such attacks in the past have targeted members of Hezbollah as well as the Palestinian group Hamas. Al Jazeera’s Imran Khan, reporting from the southern Beirut neighbourhood of Borj el Barajneh, said Israel had struck deeper into Lebanese territory than usual, some 25km (15.5 miles) from the disputed border area. “However, these attacks can happen,” Khan said, citing above all the assassination ofHamas deputy leader Saleh al-Arouriin Beirut. In Iraq, missiles fired on Saturday at US-led coalition forces stationed in the Ain al-Asad air base also raised further fears of a wider regional conflagration. US officials said initial assessments suggested US personnel suffered minor injuries and a member of Iraq’s security forces was seriously wounded. It was not clear whether the base was hit by ballistic missiles or rockets. Reporting from Baghdad, Al Jazeera’s Mahmoud Abdelwahed said the base, a major military hub hosting US troops, has been the target of previous attacks carried out by Iran-backed armed groups, who “accuse the US of [being] a major supporter of Israel’s military campaign against Gaza”. Tensions have also been escalating in the Red Sea amidattacks on commercial shipsby the Iran-aligned Houthi group in Yemen. US Central Command forces on Saturday struck a Houthi anti-ship missile that was aimed into the Gulf of Aden and prepared to launch, the US military said. The Houthis, who control most of Yemen, say their attacks are in solidarity with Palestinians under attack from Israel in Gaza. Since last week, the US has been launching attacks on Houthi targets in Yemen, and this week returned the rebels to alist of “terrorist” groups. Jordanian foreign minister Ayman Safadi told Al Jazeera that the war on Gaza carried the very serious risk of spilling over the rest of the region. “The Israeli prime minister might be consciously provoking confrontations on other fronts, particularly with Lebanon and other parts of the region, to delay the political reckoning that he will have to face,” he said, referring tocorruption chargesagainst Benjamin Netanyahu. “Netanyahu may be looking to provoke other fronts into which he will drag the West,” he said. “Then we will be looking at a very serious escalation.”   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/20/israeli-strike-hits-residential-building-in-damascus-syrian-state-media

"‘Low-trust’ ties: What’s next for Pakistan, Iran after tit-for-tat attacks?","The neighbours appear to be de-escalating tensions, but their border security concerns will have deepened, say analysts.","Islamabad, Pakistan –Pakistan and Iran have agreed to de-escalate tensions after tit-for-tat military strikes on each other’s territory this week, but the episode reveals a lack of trust between the neighbours that will continue to plague relations even after the missiles and accusations have subsided, say analysts. On Friday evening Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Jalil Abbas Jilani spoke to his Iranian counterpart Hossein Amirabdollahian. “The two foreign ministers agreed that working level cooperation and close coordination on counter terrorism and other aspects of mutual concern should be strengthened. They also agreed to de-escalate the situation,” a Pakistan foreign ministry statement read. Late on Tuesday, Iran had conductedmissile and drone strikesin Pakistan’s Balochistan province, killing at least two children and injuring three. Tehran said the rare border intrusion targeted Jaish al-Adl, a Sunni Muslimarmed groupaccused of attacks inside the Iranian territory of Sistan-Baluchestan. In fewer than 48 hours, Pakistanrespondedwith “precise” military strikes that killed at least nine people, including four children and three women. Iranian media reports, quoting state officials, said those killed were “non-Iranians”, implying they could have been Pakistani nationals. The rare military actions between the two countries threatened to escalate into a broader conflict in a region already on edge over Israel’s more than three-month war in the Gaza Strip. Pakistani caretaker Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar cut short his visit to Davos, Switzerland, where he was attending the World Economic Forum. On Friday, he chaired a meeting of the National Security Council toreview the security situation.    As the United Nations and world powers urged restraint between the two Muslim-majority countries and their close ally China offered to mediate, Islamabad and Tehran toned down their rhetoric. In a statement on Friday, Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs referred to “the friendly and brotherly government of Pakistan”. A similar statement by Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday said Islamabad “fully respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Islamic Republic of Iran”. But embedded even in those reconciliatory statements were signs of the border tensions that linger between the neighbours, and that exploded in the form of missile attacks this week. Iran’s Friday statement said that it expected Pakistan “to adhere to its obligations in preventing the establishment of bases and the deployment of armed terrorist groups on its soil”, calling the safety of its citizens “a red line”. And Pakistan insisted it had struck targets in Iran “in pursuit of Pakistan’s own security and national interest which is paramount and cannot be compromised”. Analysts have questioned Iran’s motive behind conducting strikes inside Pakistan during Israel’s assault on Gaza, which has also involved Iranian allies such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen. Joshua White, professor of international affairs and a non-resident fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank in the United States, told Al Jazeera that Iran and Pakistan have ample reasons to de-escalate after the“unusual strikes”. “The reality is that both the governments deploy rhetoric about brotherhood when it suits them but are often suspicious of the other’s motives. This is a low-trust relationship, but neither Islamabad nor Tehran have much to gain from seeing tensions escalate,” he said. Ali Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group, added that the Iranian move against Pakistan risked opening a new front against a nuclear-armed neighbour. “The strike was both reckless and feckless against a nuclear state on whose cooperation Iran depends for reigning in armed Baloch groups – and a deadly message sent to the wrong address – as most of the setbacks Iran has suffered in the past few weeks were perpetrated at the hands of Israel, the US and the so-called Islamic State [ISIL/ISIS],” Vaez told Al Jazeera.    Islamabad-based expert on security issues Syed Rifaat Hussain said dialogue was necessary for the two countries to restore trust. “The conversations need to happen between the two nations, and they could be at either the military level or at civilian level, but leadership will play an important role in defusing the tension,” he told Al Jazeera. Hussain said the unprovoked Iranian strike remains a mystery to him. “The Iranian calculus is rather complex. Perhaps Iran overplayed its hand. They thought Pakistan will absorb the strike and will show restraint, or at most, a verbal protest,” he said. Vaez concurred, saying Iran “overreached” in its apparent need to demonstrate strength. “It left Pakistan in a position where it had no option other than retaliating in kind to draw a red line on unilateral Iranian strikes into its sovereign territory,” he said. Vaez wondered if Iran’s decision to strike was guided by an “internal pressure on the need to flex its military muscle to deter further targeted killings of its senior army commanders and strikes against its allies in the region”. “Plus, the Iranian government also seems keen to wag the dog, given that it has parliamentary elections coming up in six weeks amid a high degree of political apathy,” he told Al Jazeera. White said it is unlikely that the Pakistan-Iran tensions will feature significantly in US policy towards the two countries. “I don’t think this episode will alter the US attitude towards Iran or is likely to meaningfully change Washington’s engagement with Islamabad, either. American officials have long seen Iran-Pakistan tensions in the Balochistan region as a complex but localised conflict,” he said. Vaez said neither Iran nor Pakistan appear interested in escalating tensions but added a word of caution considering the volatility in the region: “This is not likely to escalate beyond a limited tit for  tat, but it is a reminder of the elevated risks of miscalculation in the fog of the Gaza war that can spread and escalate the conflict further.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/20/low-trust-relation-what-next-for-pakistan-iran-after-tit-for-tat-raids
‘Criminal complaints’ filed against Israeli President Herzog in Switzerland,Swiss prosecutor confirmed the filing but would not reveal details about the nature and number of the complaints.,"Israeli President Isaac Herzog is the subject of criminal complaints during his visit to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Swiss prosecutors have confirmed, as Israel finds itself accused of committing war crimes in Gaza. “The criminal complaints will be examined according to the usual procedure,” the Office of the Swiss Attorney General said on Friday, adding that it would contact the Swiss foreign ministry to examine the question of immunity of the individual concerned. In theory, third countries do not hold criminal jurisdiction over current heads of state, heads of government and foreign ministers of other countries. The reasons behind the complaints and who filed them were not specified. A spokesperson for Herzog’s office did not comment on the statement by Swiss prosecutors, saying only that Herzog had been to Davos to present Israel’s position on the situation in Gaza. The AFP news agency obtained a statement allegedly issued by the people behind the complaint, entitled “Legal Action Against Crimes Against Humanity”. It said several unnamed individuals had filed charges with federal prosecutors and with cantonal authorities in Basel, Bern and Zurich. The statement said the plaintiffs were seeking a criminal prosecution in parallel to a case brought before the United NationsInternational Court of Justice (ICJ)by South Africa, which has accused Israel of genocide in its offensive in Gaza. While it could take years for the ICJ to produce a final verdict, South Africa asked the court to instruct “provisional measures” – a temporary order for Israel to stop the war – while the case is pending. Israel has called South Africa’s accusations “baseless” and a “blood libel”.    The reasons behind the complaints filed to the Swiss prosecutor are unclear, said Al Jazeera’s diplomatic editor James Bays. They could relate to something that took place in Switzerland while Herzog attended the Davos summit, he explained, or they could relate to previous statements Herzog made about Palestinians, which were also cited by South Africa’s legal team at the Hague while presenting their case. Days after October 7 – when Hamas fighters launched an unprecedented attack into southern Israel killing nearly 1,200 people – the Israeli president said it was not only Hamas fighters but “an entire nation” that was responsible for the violence and that Israel would fight “until we break their backbone”. After the Hamas attack, Israel launched a ferocious bombardment of Gaza that has killed more than 24,500 people, 70 percent of whom arewomen and children, according to the United Nations. If prosecuted, such a case filed to the Swiss court would be dealt with under “universal jurisdiction”, William Shabas, a professor of international criminal and human rights law at Middlesex University in the UK, told Al Jazeera. Under international law, universal jurisdiction is based on the principle that certain crimes are so serious that their perpetrators must be prosecuted transcending borders. This means that states or international organisations can file legal complaints against people regardless of their nationality or where the alleged crime was committed. Such cases are usually related to international crimes. “It used to be extremely rare for this to happen but more and more, particularly in European countries, there is an effort to prosecute such crimes – the crime of genocide, war crimes, and so on, using universal jurisdiction,” Shabas said. “The obstacle would be the alleged immunity of a president of a country – that is going to be a real problem,” he added. Addressing the issue of immunity, the statement seen by AFP suggested that it could be lifted “in certain circumstances”, including in cases of alleged crimes against humanity, adding that “these conditions are met in this case”. Another obstacle for the prosecutor to proceed, Shabas said, would be obtaining “a level of political approval”.

Israeli minister says only a deal can free captives as rifts split cabinet,Gadi Eizenkot’s comments come amid disagreement in the war cabinet about how to handle the war in Gaza.,"A deal will be needed to ensure captives still held in theGaza Stripare released alive, Israeli war cabinet minister and former military chief Gadi Eizenkot says, adding that a lightning raid would be extremely unlikely to succeed. Eizenkot, whose youngest son was killed in fighting in Gaza last month, said the fate of the captives should take priority over other war aims, even if that means Israel missing out on an opportunity to take out the political header of Hamas. Asked if the captives could be released in a rescue mission similar to the 1976 operation in which Israeli commandos freed about 100 hostages in Entebbe, Uganda, he said it was unlikely to happen. “The hostages are scattered in such a way – even underground – that the likelihood [of such an operation] is extremely low,” Eizenkot told Israel’s Channel 12 programme Uvda late on Thursday. “We are still making efforts and looking for every opportunity, but the likelihood is low and to say that this is how it will happen is to sow an illusion.” Israel estimated that about 130 captives remain in Gaza and 27 have died in captivity. More than 100 captives seized during Hamas’s cross-border attack into southern Israel on October 7 werefreedduring a week-long November truce. “I think it is necessary to say boldly that it is impossible to bring the hostages back alive in the near future without a deal,” Eizenkot said in the interview. But he added that the broader war aims would “still be valid” after any temporary ceasefire. At least 24,762 people have been killed in Israel’s air, ground and sea offensive in Gaza. The revised death toll in Israel from the October 7 Hamas attacks stands at 1,139.    Eisenkot’s comments were the latest sign of disagreement among Israel’s political and military leaders over the direction of the offensive in Gaza, now in its fourth month. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant have said the fighting will continue until Hamas is crushed and argued that only military action can win the captives’ release. Hamas seeks an end to the war before discussing releases and has demanded thousands of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel be released in exchange for those held captive in Gaza. Eisenkot is one of four members of the war cabinet along with Netanyahu, Gallant and former Defence Minister Benny Gantz. In his interview, he also said he had convinced officials in the group to hold off on any attack onHezbollah in Lebanonin the days after the Hamas attacks, confirming that a preemptive strike was called off at the last minute during the early days of the war. He described himself as being among those arguing against such a strike in an October 11 cabinet meeting that left him hoarse from shouting. “I think our presence there prevented Israel from making a grave strategic mistake,” he said. Both Israel and Hezbollah have signalled they want to avoid war, but both said they are ready to fight if necessary. Eizenkot also dismissed suggestions that the military has delivered a decisive blow against Hamas. Gallant said Israeli forces have disabled the Hamas command structure in northern Gaza, from where significant numbers of soldiers were withdrawn this week, and that Israel’s focus is now on the southern half of the territory.

"UN says Palestinians detained by Israeli forces humiliated, beaten",Rights official says Palestinian men detained by Israeli forces in unknown locations for between 30 to 55 days.,"A United Nations human rights official has called for an end to the mistreatment of Palestinian detainees by Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip, who were subjected to weeks of imprisonment in unknown locations and physical abuse. Palestinian men were held by Israeli forces for between 30 to 55 days, Ajith Sunghay saidin a reporton Friday during his visit to Gaza, where he met some of the released detainees. “There are reports of men who are subsequently released, but only in diapers without any adequate clothing in this cold weather,” he said, adding that it was not clear why they were made to wear diapers but that “they were clearly visibly shocked and even shaken when I met them”. Several videos shared by the Israeli army since the war began show hundreds of Palestinian men stripped to their underwear, sitting outdoors in the cold, sometimes blindfolded. In a few videos, women and children were also seen. The videos were taken at locations across Gaza, including Beit Lahiya, Shujayea and Jabalia.    According to theEuro-Med Human Rights Monitor, multiple freed prisoners said that after being made to curse themselves and disparage Palestinian groups and political figures, they were transferred in trucks to open-air detention facilities where they endured beatings and other forms of mistreatment. “Israel must take urgent steps to ensure that all those arrested or detained are treated in line with international human rights and international humanitarian law norms and standards, notably with full respect for their due process rights,” Sunghay asserted. “Unless Israel can demonstrate imperative security grounds for each person remaining in detention, they must be charged or released.” Separately on Friday, several prisoners released byIsraeli forces in Gazaarrived at the Abu Youssef Al Najjar Hospital in Rafah, southern Gaza, accusing the Israeli army of mistreating them. “We were arrested by a special Israeli force in the al-Saftawi area. We were then subjected to torture and beatings. Then they … transferred us to a detention centre at the Israeli army headquarters,” Muhammad Abu Samra told Al Jazeera. “The army … threatened to shoot us while we were naked in the cold. Then female soldiers attacked us and we were subjected to obscene insults.” The UN’s Sunghay, who was in Rafah, said people were continuing to arrive in southern city, “in desperate situations, setting up makeshift shelters with any material they can get their hands on”. “I’ve seen men and children digging for bricks to be able to hold in place tents made with plastic bags. This is a massive human rights crisis,” he said. “It is a pressure cooker environment here, in the midst of utter chaos, given the terrible humanitarian situation, shortages, and pervasive fear and anger,” Sunghay noted, adding that there was an urgent need to scale up humanitarian aid for the coastal enclave. As of Friday,24,762 peoplehave been killed and 62,108 injured in Israeli attacks on Gaza since the current conflict began in October, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health. The revised death toll in Israel from the October 7 Hamas attack stands at 1,139.   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/19/un-says-palestinians-detained-by-israeli-forces-humiliated-beaten
Palestinians in Ukraine decry ‘double standard’ as Kyiv supports Israel,"Ukraine has supported Israel throughout the latest conflict, upsetting Palestinians as war ravages Gaza.","Names marked with an asterisk* have been changed to protect identities. When Russia launched a full-scale war on Ukraine on February 24, 2022, Amer Aroggi, a 30-year-old journalist based in the Gaza Strip, felt compelled to report on the European conflict. Having lived through the Israeli occupation, he felt he could relate to the plight of the Ukrainians. The move was seamless, especially because his older brother had lived in Ukraine for many years. Aroggi quickly secured a new role for himself as a correspondent for a prominent news channel. Less than two years later, war broke out again in his homeland with the latest escalation of the Israel-Palestine conflict. To some observers, there were parallels between Russia and Israel and Ukraine and the Palestinians. But in a swift and unequivocal response to the outbreak of the war in Gaza, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy threw his support behind Israel, like much of theUkrainian population, and almost all Western leaders. “I saw a double standard. … The world helped the Ukrainians, and no one helped us. No one even helped me evacuate my mother and sister out of Gaza,” Aroggi told Al Jazeera. Ukrainians were the “victims of massive propaganda” during the first stages of the war, which is why they often supported Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, according to Aroggi. He said he would like to leave but is unable to because he has a Palestinian passport. He spends his days glued to the TV, fearing for his family in Gaza. “My mother asks me, ‘Are you OK? Is there a Russian bombing?’ I say to her, ‘Are you OK? Is there an Israeli bombing?'”    The latest escalation of the Israel-Palestine conflict began on October 7 when Hamas attacked southern Israel, killing 1,139 people and triggering a violent response. At this point in the war, at least 24,762 Palestinians had been reported killed by Israeli forces in Gaza. While Israel has said it aims to wipe out Hamas, which governs the besieged enclave, the toll on civilians and its conduct have been heavily criticised. Ukrainian first lady Olena Zelenska said on October 7 that Ukrainians understand and “share the pain” of the Israeli people as billboards across Kyiv lit up the capital with Israeli flags. Hashem*, a medical professional from Gaza who relocated to Ukraine nine years ago, remained resolute in his allegiance to his adopted home when Russia invaded Ukraine. Yet the Ukrainian reaction to Israel’s offensive in Gaza left him grappling with conflicting emotions in the initial months of the war, particularly since “Ukraine suffers from occupation like Palestine”, he said. The prevailing narrative in the national media favours Israel and influences public sentiment, he said. Hashem also suffered personally. He said he received threats and discriminatory messages full of hate from individuals who learned he was from Gaza but residing in Ukraine. Even so, he plans to stay in Ukraine. Now more than three months into the Middle East war, Hashem and Aroggi said they have witnessed some changes in public opinion. The constant stream of images of death and destruction in Gaza has had an impact, leading some Ukrainians to start openly criticising their government’s position. In November, more than 300 Ukrainian scholars, activists and artists expressed their solidarity with Palestinians in anopen letter. The letter emphasised the right of Palestinians to self-determination and resistance against Israel’s occupation, drawing parallels to Ukrainians resisting the Russian invasion. Hashem said some Ukrainians came to view the “Israeli narrative” as both “false and unfair” and he “began to feel moral support” for himself and the Palestinian people. Mounting pressure from pro-Palestinian segments of society eventually forced a gradual shift in the Ukrainian government’s position, he believes. He pointed to Ukraine’s backing of a UN resolution on November 12, urging the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to provide an opinion on the legal consequences of Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories. However, Ukraine chose to abstain from voting on a recent resolution advocating for a humanitarian ceasefire in war-torn Gaza. Yuliia Kishchuk, a researcher who signed the open letter, told Al Jazeera that Israel enjoys significant support from Ukrainian political liberals who view Israel as a democratic and progressive nation. “Israel is portrayed in Ukrainian media as this very democratic state that is defending itself against the autocracy of other Middle Eastern countries,” she said, adding that crucially “there is no Palestine in this narrative.” Kishchuk said the level of knowledge about Palestine, its history and the ongoing Israeli occupation has begun to increase. Leading Ukrainian opinion makers and intellectuals specialising in the Middle East have gained traction in the media, providing context about Ukraine’s historical support of Palestine. Kyiv had previously consistently backed UN resolutions denouncing Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories. Meanwhile, images depicting the “horrors” of Israel’s bombardment of Gaza have created a sense of empathy among Ukrainians who now are unable to ignore the parallels with their own experiences of war, she said. Kishchuk has also been buoyed by a change of tone among government officials in recent months. In December, in something of a shift, Zelenskyy said Ukraine recognises the independence of both the Israeli and Palestinian people.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/19/palestinians-in-ukraine-decry-double-standard-as-kyiv-supports-israel
Palestinians welcome Chile and Mexico’s call for ICC probe into Gaza war,Two countries express ‘growing worry’ over ‘escalation of violence’ in a referral to the International Criminal Court over possible crimes.,"The Palestinian foreign ministry has welcomed a request by Chile and Mexico for the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate crimes against civilians, asIsrael’s war on Gazacontinues unabated. Israeli attacks havedevastatedthe Gaza Strip since Hamas fighters launched a surprise attack inside Israel on October 7 that killed about 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli officials. Israel retaliated with a relentless air and ground offensive that has killed more than 24,600 people, about 70 percent of them children, women and the elderly, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza. In a statement on Thursday, Mexico’s foreign ministry said the referral “is due to the growing concern over the latest escalation of violence, particularly against civilian targets”. It added that the court based in The Hague was the proper forum to establish potential criminal responsibility, citing “numerous reports from the United Nations that detail many incidents that could constitute crimes under the ICC’s jurisdiction”. Meanwhile in Chile’s capital, Santiago, foreign minister Alberto van Klaveren said in a news conference that the country supports “the investigation of any possible war crime … whether they are war crimes committed by Israelis or by Palestinians”.    The Palestinian foreign ministry welcomed the move. “The referral confirms the urgent need for the Court to fulfill its mandate, to deter, investigate and prosecute the most serious crimes of concern for the international community,” a ministry statement said on Friday. “Israeli officials are not deterred as they continue with their genocidal war,” the statement added. Mexico said it was closely following the casepresentedlast week before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in which South Africa accused Israel of carrying out genocide in Gaza and demanded that the court order an emergency suspension of Israel’s military campaign. Israel rejected the accusation. Both the ICJ and the ICC handle cases of alleged genocide, with the former resolving disputes between states and the latter prosecuting individuals for crimes. The ICC opened an investigation into Israel as well as Hamas and other armed Palestinian groups for possible war crimes in the Palestinian territories in 2021. ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan said in November that the investigation now “extends to the escalation of hostilities and violence” since the October 7 attacks. His remarks followedcallsfrom South Africa, Bangladesh, Bolivia, the Comoros and Djibouti for an ICC investigation into the conflict. Israel is not a member of the ICC and does not recognise its jurisdiction.   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/19/palestinians-welcome-chile-and-mexico-call-for-icc-probe-into-gaza-war
‘Credibility at stake’: Why did Iran strike inside Pakistan amid Gaza war?,"Tehran’s attacks on Pakistani, Iraqi and Syrian territory have only one thing in common, say analysts: a show of strength at a time Iran feels especially threatened.","In just two days this week, Iran launched missiles – first into Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdish region and Syria, and then into Pakistan – in attacks that could further inflame tensions in a region on edge. Monday’s attacks in Syria were against alleged ISIL (ISIS) targets. In Erbil, Iraq, Tehran claimed it hit a Mossad facility, also on Monday. At least four people were killed, according to Kurdish authorities. Then on Tuesday, Iran fired missiles into Pakistan’s Balochistan province. Their target was the separatist group Jaish al-Adl but at least two children were killed. Pakistan launched retaliatory attacks on Thursday morning, killing at least nine people in Iran’s Sistan-Baluchestan province, just across the border. These rapid attacks by Iran on three different neighbours have sparked concerns of a regional escalation and triggered questions over the timings of Tehran’s decision to launch cross-border strikes, given Israel’s continuing war on Gaza. On the surface, the alleged targets of Iranian attacks in Syria, Iraq and Pakistan appear to have little in common. But there’s a common thread tying Tehran’s actions – even though the strike on Pakistan may have been a reckless and ill-considered gamble – say analysts. “It has to do, I think, with Iran’s overall threat perception in the region rising. And at the same time, feeling the need – as a result of domestic and external pressure – to respond,” said Hamidreza Azizi, a visiting fellow at SWP Berlin. In late December, Israel killedSayyed Razi Mousavi, a top Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps commander in Syria, in a missile strike outside Damascus. At the start of the year, two explosions among mourners attending the memorial of Iran’s late IRGC chief Qassem Soleimanikilled at least 90 civiliansand wounded dozens more in the city of Kerman. It was the deadliest armed attack on Iranian soil in decades. Soleimani had been assassinated in a United States drone strike two years previously. The bombing was laterclaimed by ISILin Afghanistan. However, Iran accused the group of acting in concert with Israel, setting the stage for its recent attacks on the group’s alleged facilities in northern Syria and the Iraqi Kurdish region’s capital, Erbil. Last month, Jaish al-Adl had also claimed responsibility for apolice station attackin the Iranian town of Rask in Sistan-Baluchestan, which killed 11 Iranian security personnel. “If you look at the series of incidents,” Azizi said, “these had projected the image of Iran’s intelligence weakness and lack of seriousness and will to respond. So the calculation in Tehran might have been that by allowing this to continue, their very credibility would be at stake. “And that was why they decided to show a response all at once.” Yet, beyond the desire to show strength on multiple fronts at the same time, analysts caution against conflating events along the Pakistan border with those taking place in Gaza. While both Pakistan and Iran have routinely accused the other of allowing armed groups into the other’s territory, even going so far as toexchange mortar fire in 2014, they have nevertheless enjoyed military and diplomatic ties reaching back years. On the same day that Iran attacked Pakistan, the two countries were conducting joint naval operations in the Strait of Hormuz and the Persian Gulf. Moreover, just hours before the Iranian strike, the country’s foreignministry posted images of its minister,Hossein Amirabdollahian, shaking the hand of Pakistan’s caretaker prime minister, Anwaar ul-Haq Kakar, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum meeting at Davos. Those longstanding ties, coupled with anonymous Telegram messages seen by Al Jazeera and said to be from sources close to the IRGC, have led to speculation that the strikes may have been prearranged and even coordinated between Iran and Pakistan. According to some of the Telegram messages, the attacks had originally been slated for last week. However, to accept that interpretation of events is to overlook Pakistan’s own international position: distant from the storm raging in the Gulf, relatively removed from the ideological competition that links many of its principal actors and jealously proud of its status as a nuclear power. “The (strike) is costly for Pakistan, especially regarding its relationship with India (Islamabad’s longstanding nuclear rival) and that’s exactly why I don’t believe Pakistan would ever have agreed to coordinate with Iran in this way,” Abdolrasool Divsallar, a senior researcher at the Middle East Institute, told Al Jazeera. “Iran and Pakistan need each other mutually,” he said. “Even though Pakistan has struck back, my guess is that the escalation will remain limited and constrained.” China, the most important ally of Iran and Pakistan, has already offered to mediate, and the neighbours also have platforms like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), of which they are both members, where they can engage diplomatically. That the attack on a nuclear power was intended to send clear messages to the United States and its allies, not least Israel, is hard to dispute. However, it was also intended for internal consumption, say analysts. “The credibility and prestige of the Islamic republic was already waning, even among its own supporters,” Azizi said, adding preserving what remains of the support, much of it hardline, has become imperative. However, while the odds of these latest strikes contributing towards a greater regional conflict may be limited, they are not non-existent. A day after Pakistan fired back at Iran, neither side has engaged in any further military action against the other. Yet, by striking a nuclear power, even an ostensibly friendly one, Iran has sent a message that will echo far beyond Balochistan.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/19/credibility-at-stake-why-did-iran-bomb-pakistan-amid-gaza-war
"Pakistan, Iran agree to ‘de-escalate’ tensions after tit-for-tat attacks","Pakistan and Iran’s foreign ministers emphasised ‘brotherly relations’ during a phonecall on Friday, Islamabad said.","Pakistan and Iran have agreed to “de-escalate” tensions after an exchange of missile and drone attacks this week raised fears of further instability in the region, Islamabad said. Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Jalil Abbas Jilani and the foreign minister of Iran, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, spoke via phone on Friday, Pakistan’s foreign ministry said in a statement. “The two foreign ministers agreed that working level cooperation and close coordination on counter terrorism and other aspects of mutual concern should be strengthened. They also agreed to de-escalate the situation,” the statement read. “The return of ambassadors of the two countries to their respective capitals was also discussed,” it added. On Tuesday night, Iran carried out a missile and droneattackagainst the armed group Jaish al-Adl in Pakistan’s southwestern border province of Balochistan. Pakistan in turn struck armed-group targets inside Iran on Thursday. Pakistan recalled its ambassador from Tehran and said Iran’s envoy – on a visit home – was blocked from returning to Islamabad. Al Jazeera’s Osama bin Javid, reporting from Islamabad, said there has been “a lot of diplomacy in the last 24 hours from both sides” to try and come out of the growing tensions. “For the first time, we’re seeing both countries’ militaries get involved in what has been a slow-burner proxy war that has continued in these two provinces of Balochistan and Sistan-Baluchestan, and now, as we’ve been hearing from various sources and analysts, things seem to be going back on track towards normalcy.”  On Friday, Pakistan’s Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar convened a meeting of the National Security Committee, with all military services chiefs in attendance, to discuss the current crisis. Kakar had cut short a visit to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and flew home after the attacks on Thursday. Friday’s national security review concluded that “the two countries would mutually be able to overcome minor irritants through dialogue and diplomacy and pave the way to further deepen their historic relations”, according to a statement from the prime minister’s office. However, it also resolved that any attempts to breach the territory of Pakistan “will be responded with full might of the state”. It urged Iran to use existing communication channels to address security concerns. Kakar also told a cabinet meeting following the security huddle that it was in the “interest of both countries” to return to relations as they stood before Iran’s strikes, another statement said. Sources told Al Jazeera’s Javid that the cabinet had decided to end a standoff and also endorsed a move to re-establish full diplomatic relations with Iran. “These areas are problem areas for both Pakistan and Iran, and proxies aligned to both countries have been operating in this region for years now,” Javid explained. “They have carried out tit-for-tat attacks against each other, but the recent developments are unusual as both countries militaries are involved this time around, using ballistic missiles, drones and heavy ammunitions against each other,” our correspondent added.    The tit-for-tat attacks have been the largest cross-border intrusions in recent years and have raised alarm about the potential for wider instability since the war betweenIsrael and Hamaserupted on October 7. However, both countries have signalled a few times their desire to calm tensions. On Thursday, Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was committed to good neighbourly relations with Pakistan but called on Islamabad to prevent the establishment of “terrorist bases” on its soil. Pakistan issued a similar statement with its Ministry of Foreign Affairs saying that its “sole” reason for the retaliatory attacks was “in pursuit of Pakistan’s own security and national interest, which is paramount and cannot be compromised”. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged the two countries to “exercise maximum restraint to avoid a further escalation of tensions”. Guterres “underlines that all security concerns between the two countries must be addressed by peaceful means through dialogue and cooperation in accordance with the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity and good neighbourly relations,” UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said.

At least 10 civilians dead in suspected Jordanian air raids in Syria,"The attack marks the latest effort to disrupt drug trafficking into Jordan, but residents warn of civilian casualties.","An estimated 10 civilianshave been killedin air strikes targeting the neighbouring towns of Arman and Malh in the southeast Syrian province of Sweida, according to local media. Jordanian forces are believed to be behind Thursday’s attacks, thoughits governmenthas yet to confirm any involvement. Sweida 24, a news platform based in its namesake city, said warplanes carried out simultaneous strikes on residential neighbourhoods after midnight local time (21:00 GMT). The attack in Malh caused material damage to some houses. The second strike in Arman, however, collapsed two houses and killed at least 10 civilians, including four women and two girls, both under the age of five. Jordanis thought to have carried outprevious raidsin Syria, mostly near the countries’ shared border, in an effort to disrupt weapons smuggling and drug-trafficking operations. But inhabitants of the towns struck on Thursday questioned the choice of targets. “What happened was a massacre against children and women,” Murad al-Abdullah, a resident of Arman, told Al Jazeera. “The air strikes that targeted the villages are far from being identified as fighting drug traffickers.” Al-Abdullah said the bombing was not limited to houses of people suspected to be involved in drug trafficking. He noted other homes were damaged as well, terrorising villagers while they were asleep and causing needless civilian deaths. “It is unreasonable for two girls who are no more than five years old to be involved in drug trafficking,” al-Abdullah said. Tribes and residents of the villages near the Jordanian border issued separate statements this week disavowing any involvement in drug smuggling. The statements also pledged to lend a hand to Jordan to eliminate criminal networks trafficking narcotics and other drugs across the border. In turn, they asked Jordan to suspend its bombings of civilian sites. The spiritual leader of the Druze religious group in Syria, Sheikh Hikmat al-Hajri, appealed to Jordan to prevent further civilian bloodshed. “The attacks should be heavily focused towards the smugglers and their supporters exclusively,” al-Hajri said in a public statement. Al-Abdullah, the Arman resident, also called on Jordan to collaborate with Syrian locals to stop the trafficking operations. “We are a society that does not accept the manufacture or trade of drugs, and the Jordanian government should have communicated with our elders to cooperate in combating drug traffickers, instead of bombing residential neighbourhoods,” al-Abdullah said.    Thursday’s attack is believed to be the third time this year that Jordanian planes have carried out air raids on Syrian territory. A previous attack occurred on January 9, resulting in the deaths of three people in the countryside of Sweida, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based rights monitor. The Observatory said that five smugglers were also killed in a border attack on January 7. Fighting that day took place sporadically over 10 hours. By the end of the raid, Jordanian forces had arrested 15 suspects. They also claimed to have recovered 627,000 pills ofCaptagon, an illicitly manufactured amphetamine, and 3.4kg of cannabis. “What Jordan is doing can certainly delay drug-smuggling operations but unfortunately, cannot stop them completely. The border with Syria is 375km (233 miles) long, and smuggling operations are carried out by professional groups, not some random individuals carrying out bags of drugs to cross the border,” said Essam al-Zoubi, a lawyer and human rights activist. Drug enforcement officials in the United States and other Western countries have said that war-torn Syria has become a major hub in the Middle East for the drug trade. The country, for instance, has become the primary manufacturer for Captagon, a multibillion-dollar business. Experts have said smugglers are using Jordan as a route through which Syrian drugs can reach the oil-rich Gulf states. Al-Zoubi and other human rights advocates have warned the Syrian government itself is involved in the drug trade, in an effortto shore upits war-drained finances. Reports indicated that the Fourth Armoured Division of the Syrian Army has played a role in overseeing the country’s drug operations, alongside the Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah, an ally of the Syrian government. “The officials responsible for drug smuggling in Syria are Hezbollah of Lebanon, the Fourth Division, and the security apparatuses of the Syrian regime that control southern Syria,” al-Zoubi said. Jordan and its allies have also taken other approaches to stopping the drug trade. In March last year, for instance, the US Department of the Treasury imposedsanctionson six people, including two relatives of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, for their role in producing and trafficking Captagon. Some of those sanctioned had ties to Hezbollah as well. But al-Zoubi warns that even targeted attacks on Syrian drug dealers will not be enough to stop the trade. “It does not matter to the drug officials from Hezbollah or the Fourth Division if traders are killed, as the trades themselves will continue regardless of the people,” al-Zoubi said, pointing to an example in May 2023. Jordanian planes, at the time, had carried out air raids in the Sweida countryside, targeting the house ofone of the most famous drug traffickersin Syria, Marai al-Ramthan. He was ultimately killed in the attack. But, al-Zoubi said, his death “did not limit drug trafficking but, in fact, increased it”. Other smugglers used his demise as an opportunity to expand their trade in his absence. Omar Idlibi, director of the Doha office at the Harmoon Center for Contemporary Studies, said that geopolitical turmoil in the region has also allowed trafficking to flourish. “Drug-smuggling operations to Jordan did not exist before 2018, that is, before the Syrian regime and its Iranian allies regained control of southern Syria from the opposition factions,” he told Al Jazeera. Idlibi explained that the launch of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has had a direct effect on the expanding drug operations. As it focused on Ukraine, Russia withdrew some of its troops in Syria, allowing Iranian militias and Hezbollah forces to spread. Those groups then turned some of the Syrian army’s headquarters into logistical centres for the manufacture, transport and smuggling of drugs to Jordan. Russia’s need for military equipment from Iran also prompted it to turn a blind eye to the drug-smuggling activity in Syria, Idlibi explained. “Everyone knows that the Syrian regime and Iran are behind the terrorist activity on the Syrian-Jordanian border, and unless it is terminated from the source, it will continue at different rates,” Idlibi said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/18/at-least-10-civilians-dead-in-suspected-jordanian-air-raids-in-syria
Israel’s Netanyahu reiterates rejection of Palestinian state after Gaza war,US says there is ‘no way’ to solve Israel’s long-term security challenges and rebuild Gaza without Palestinian statehood.,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told the United States that he opposes the establishment of a Palestinian state as part of any post-war scenario, underscoring divisions between the allies three months into Israel’s relentlessmilitary assault on Gaza. In a nationally broadcast news conference on Thursday, Netanyahu pledged to press ahead with the offensive until Israel realises a “decisive victory over Hamas” and said he had relayed his positions on Palestinian statehood to US officials. “In any future arrangement … Israel needs security control over all territory west of the Jordan River,” Netanyahu said. “This collides with the idea of sovereignty. What can you do?” “The prime minister needs to be capable of saying no to our friends,” he added. While the US has vetoed United Nations resolutions calling for a ceasefire, it has called on Israel to scale back the intensity of its war on Gaza, and said that the establishment of a Palestinian state should be part of the “day after”. Following Netanyahu’s comments, US National Security Adviser John Kirby said that there would be no reoccupation of Gaza after the war and emphasised that the US remains committed to a two-state solution. US Department of State spokesperson Matthew Miller also said Israel now has an opportunity to engage with the idea of a Palestinian state, as countries in the region are ready to provide security assurances. “There is no way to solve [Israel’s] long-term challenges to provide lasting security and there is no way to solve the short-term challenges of rebuilding Gaza and establishing governance in Gaza and providing security for Gaza without the establishment of a Palestinian state,” he told a news briefing on Thursday. He added that despite differences of opinion between the US and Israel, “our support for Israel remains ironclad.” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken wrapped up hislatest visit to the Middle Eastlast week by saying that offering Palestinians a path to statehood could stabilise the Middle East and isolate Iran. The US top diplomat said the region faced two paths, the first of which would see “Israel integrated, with security assurances and commitments from regional countries and as well from the United States, and a Palestinian state – at least a pathway to get to that state”. The alternative path, he said, would “continue to see the terrorism, the nihilism, the destruction by Hamas, by the Houthis, by Hezbollah, all backed by Iran”. Earlier this week, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister, said on a World Economic Forum panel in Davos, Switzerland that the kingdom believed that “regional peace includes peace for Israel”. He said Saudi Arabia “certainly” would recognise Israel as part of a larger political agreement, “but that can only happen through peace for the Palestinians, through a Palestinian state.” After more than 100 days of Israel’s war on Gaza, relentless attacks have continued and at least 24,620 Palestinians have been killed. A communicationsblackoutin Gaza has entered its seventh day, while raids have continued in the occupied West Bank. The war has also rippled across the Middle East, with low-intensity fighting between the Israeli army and Lebanon’s Hezbollah threatening to erupt into all-out war, andHouthi rebelsin Yemen continuing to target international shipping while the US launches attacks against them.

Blackouts in Gaza must not be used as ‘weapons of war’: Rights group,"Gaza is under a weeklong sustained telecoms outage, the longest since the onset of the war with Israel.","A weeklong telecommunications blackout in the Gaza Strip has become a “matter of life and death” and should end immediately, digital civil rights group Access Now says during the longest continuous outage sinceIsrael’s warbegan. “It is unconscionable to toy with connectivity amidst unprecedented violence and unfathomable human suffering,” Marwa Fatafta, the group’s policy and advocacy director for the Middle East and North Africa, said in a statement on Thursday. “Internet shutdowns must not be used as weapons of war. Access Now continues to call for an immediate physical and digital ceasefire and for the full restoration of telecommunications services in the Gaza Strip.” Palestinian internet service provider Paltel announced the complete loss of all telecommunications services in Gaza “due to the ongoing aggression” on January 12. Cloudflare Radar’s data confirmed a drastic drop in traffic. The watchdog NetBlocks, which monitors cybersecurity and the governance of the internet, said on Thursday the incident had passed the 144-hour mark. “The disruption is the ninth and longest sustained telecoms outage since the onset of the present conflict with Israel,” it said on the social media platform X. Internet shutdowns have hampered thedelivery of humanitarian aidto Gaza’s 2.3 million people, 85 percent of whom are internally displaced. The outages also have made it extremely challenging to document and share information about what is happening on the ground. Since the beginning of the war on October 7, internet traffic in the Gaza Strip has undergone multiple blackouts and shutdowns. Repair crews have had trouble reaching damaged sites during heavy Israeli bombardments and have at times takensignificant personal risksto restore connections. Access Now said it found the outages across Gaza resulted from a combination of direct attacks on civilian telecommunications infrastructure, restrictions on access to electricity and technical disruptions to telecommunications services. The blackouts have occurred as Israel has carried out a devastating bombardment of Gaza, killing at least 24,620 people and wounding 61,830, according to Palestinian authorities. Access Now found air strikes by Israeli forces on October 9 destroyed a building containing both offices and infrastructure for Paltel and Jawwal, two of the main telecommunications providers in the Gaza Strip. Al-Watan Tower, another building that houses media offices and serves as a hub for internet service providers, has also been the target of Israeli air strikes.

Cries for help in Arabic echoed off the waves in the hours before sunrise. “‘We were ready for death, we were dying,’” a 30-year-old Syrian survivor told Al Jazeera as he clung to the orange rescue RIB (rigid inflatable boat) shuttling the refugees to the mother ship while fighting against the high waves. Among the survivors were one newborn and 30 minors, most of whom had embarked on the treacherous Mediterranean crossing on their own without an adult to accompany them. “The newborn was completely covered in blankets, it was not easy to recognise that there was a baby inside. “We also had very old people this time, some of them weren’t even able to walk by themselves due to dehydration and exhaustion,” Viviana di Bartolo, Humanity 1’s search and rescue coordinator, said. According to the survivors, they had departed from the Libyan coast two days ago and were in distress due to rough weather conditions and high waves when they were intercepted by Humanity 1 while drifting in Maltese waters. They boarded the Humanity 1 barefoot, completely soaked in saltwater and suffering from the cold and severe dehydration. Many were disoriented and afraid they would be taken back to Libya. The survivors spoke to Al Jazeera about the horrific ordeals they had suffered to make it across the Mediterranean, especially human rights violations on the Libyan side. A young Syrian survivor in his early 20s, suffering from severe hypothermia, said he had tried to make the crossing from Tripoli to the south of Italy three times and that every time he had been intercepted by the Libyan coastguard. “It has been hell. Libya is hell. I tried leaving for eight months now without success, over and over again, we were forced back,” he said. Another survivor on board Humanity 1 testified to the inhumane conditions in Libyan prisons over the past year, after he had been forced back in a failed attempt to leave the North African coast in early 2023. “You don’t understand, we were not even treated as humans”, he said. The Humanity 1 was assigned a port of safety in Genova, north of Italy – but will request a closer port to disembark the suffering survivors sooner. “We’ll ask for a closer port of safety because of the rough weather conditions and the fact that we have several vulnerable cases on board and people that require medical attention,” Lukas Kaldenhoff, Humanity 1’s press officer, says. The desperate people who make these dangerous crossings have usually paid every last penny they have to human smugglers who put them on board rickety boats with no concern for their safety. As the boats flounder on the high seas, often the only hope these refugees have of survival is that their plea for help is picked up by a vessel that is willing to come help. “They [the survivors] were not only in distress because of the water conditions, but because of the boat,” di Bartolo said, exhausted after shuttling refugees between the wooden boat and the mother ship for more than two hours. “It was very poorly structured, had no safety equipment at all or people that could navigate. The people on board had no life jackets or even basic stuff such as water, food or even a toilet. This kind of boat is not meant to sail in a safe way, not at all,” she continued. According to international law, vessels have a clear duty to help boats in distress. That definition is determined on a case-by-case basis but, according to di Bartolo, the term “boat in distress” is applicable to nearly every departure from Tunisia and Libya that aims to cross the central Mediterranean route. On Wednesday night, Humanity 1’s crew had received two different Mayday calls about boats in distress, and they desperately tried to clarify whether there was another boat nearby. The first Mayday came from Frontex, the European border control, regarding a wooden boat carrying 40 people and the other from Alarm Phone, [a hotline for people in distress] regarding 90 people. “We’re now sure that both calls were regarding the boat we rescued this morning”, Kaldenhoff said. Humanity 1 is operated by the German NGO SOS Humanity and has been undertaking risky search-and-rescue missions across the Mediterranean Sea since 2022. At least 2,498 refugees, migrants and asylum seekers are known to have drowned in 2023 while crossing the central Mediterranean, according to the International Organization for Migration, making it the deadliest year since 2017. But the real number is believed to be far higher. The central Mediterranean is the deadliest known migration route in the world, with more than 17,000 deaths and disappearances recorded by the Missing Migrants Project since 2014. Most of the departures are from Libya and Tunisia – but the refugees and migrants have often travelled far from countries such as Syria, Afghanistan, Lebanon, Turkey or Egypt, fleeing violence, discrimination, and a loss of livelihood.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/18/libya-is-hell-126-refugees-rescued-in-the-mediterranean-say
Israeli arrests of Palestinian journalists soared in 2023: CPJ,More than a dozen Palestinian journalists held in Israeli jails since the start of the Gaza war on October 7.,"Israel emerged as one of the world’s leading jailers of journalists in 2023, according to a report by a press freedom watchdog, with the number of reporters behind bars soaring after the start of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. In its annual snapshot of jailed journalists published on Thursday, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) found that Israel was the joint sixth biggest jailer of journalists in 2023, alongside Iran. There were 17 Palestinian reporters held in Israeli jails as of December 1, the CPJ said. By comparison, the previous year one Palestinian reporter was held in an Israeli prison, according to the New York-based non-profit group. “Israel has appeared several times on CPJ’s annual census, but this is the highest number of arrests of Palestinian journalists since CPJ began documenting arrests in 1992 and the first time Israel has ranked among the top six offenders,” read the report. All those held in Israeli prisons were detained in the occupied West Bank after the Israel-Hamas war began on October 7, when Hamas fighters launched a surprise assault into southern Israel, killing at least 1,139 people, mostly civilians, according to an Al Jazeera tally based on official statistics. Around 240 others were taken captive, according to Israeli authorities. Israel responded with a devastating bombardment and ground offensive on Gaza. More than 24,600 people have been killed in the Israeli assault, according to Palestinian officials. In the more than three months since the Gaza war started, violence has soared in towns and cities across the West Bank, with Israeli forces conducting near-daily raids and mass arrests. According to the new report, most of the journalists arrested were held under administrative detention – a practice where Israeli authorities hold detainees without charge or trial for up to six months. The detention can be extended based on “secret evidence” that neither the detainees nor their lawyers are allowed to see. Due to the lack of information on the reason behind the jailing, the CPJ said it has been difficult to establish why the 17 journalists had been arrested. Several of the reporters’ families said they believe they were jailed for messages posted on social media, the report said. The CPJ’s list is a snapshot of people incarcerated on December 1, and it does not include those imprisoned or released throughout the year.  As of January 17, at least 19 reporters were still in jail, the CPJ said. The Gaza war has also seen a spike in the number of journalists killed in the region. As of mid-January, 83 reporters have been killed since the start of the conflict. At least 67 were Palestinians, four were Israeli and three were Lebanese,according to the CPJ. Since the start of 2024, the committee recorded that at least six journalists were killed, including Hamza Dahdouh, the eldest son of Al Jazeera’s Gaza bureau chief Wael Dahdouh. He was the fourth member of Dahdouh’s close family to have been killed in the war. The report found that 320 journalists were in prison worldwide on December 1 of last year, the second-highest number recorded since the committee began documenting arrests in 1992. The total marks a fall from a record global high in 2022 when more than 360 reporters were behind bars. This represents “a disturbing barometer of entrenched authoritarianism and the vitriol of governments determined to smother independent voices”, read the report. “Some governments go a step further, using transnational repression to threaten and harass reporters beyond their own borders,” it added. China is the worst offender, with 44 journalists in jail, followed by Myanmar (43) and Belarus (28). More than 65 percent of those listed in the census are accused of spreading false information and of “terrorism in retaliation for their critical coverage”. In 66 cases, those held have not yet been told of the charges they are facing, read the report.

Which are the armed groups Iran and Pakistan have bombed — and why?,Iran’s air raids in Pakistan near border areas were part of Tehran’s unprecedented missile launches on three countries.,"Iran and Pakistan have carried out air attacks on each other’s territories, targeting armed groups near their 900km-long (559-mile) volatile border, which they say were meant to ensure their respective national security. Iran’s powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) targeted an armed group in Panjgur town of Pakistan’s Balochistan province late on Tuesday, promptingPakistan to bombhideouts of armed groups in the Sistan-Baluchestan province of Iran early on Thursday. Let’s take a look at why the neighbours have resorted to direct military strikes, who the targets were, and what the attacks tell us. The IRGC, an elite force which is a vital part of the Iranian establishment but separate from Iran’s army, hit the Jaish al-Adl armed group with missile and drone strikes in a mountainous region in Pakistan close to the Iranian border. Iran said it targeted the Iranian “terrorist” group it blamed for recent attacks in the Iranian city of Rask in the southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchestan. “The group has taken shelter in some parts of Pakistan’s Balochistan province. We’ve talked with Pakistani officials several times on this matter,” Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian said on Tuesday from the Swiss city of Davos. Videos from the scene showed what appeared to be a precision strike on a building, and Iranian media celebrated thedestruction of a “terrorist” site. The Pakistani government said two children were killed in the attack, believed to be the first such attack by Iran on Pakistani soil. Pakistan launched several air attacks using drones and rockets on a border village in Saravan town, about 1,800km (1,100 miles) from the Iranian capital, Tehran, saying it hit Baloch “notorious terrorist” separatists. Tehran said nine people, including seven women and children, were killed in the attacks. Both countries’ foreign ministries released statements to say they respected the other’s territorial integrity but took measures to safeguard their national security. The Iranian attack came hours after Iran and Pakistan held a joint naval exercise, and the two countries’ foreign ministers spoke in Davos on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum. Both summoned their respective envoys, but there has been no talk of cutting diplomatic relations. Iran on Thursday held a large-scale military exercise in its southeastern areas near Pakistan, deploying a range of aircraft and missile systems.    Iran’s target inside Pakistan was the ethnic Baloch and Sunni group known as Jaish al-Adl, meaning Army of Justice, which surfaced around 2012. It purports to fight for better living conditions in the southeastern Sistan-Baluchestan province, which is Iran’s most impoverished and the longstanding scene of border tensions. Tehran considers it a “terrorist” group due to numerous deadly assaults on Iranian outposts and security forces near the borderover more than a decade. Officials call it Jaish al-Zulm – the Army of Injustice. The group was born out of Jundallah, another Iranian Baloch group, which Tehran accused of having direct links with the United States and Israel. It was responsible for a string of deadly attacks, including one in 2009 which killed dozens, including senior IRGC officials. The leader of Jundallah, Abdolmalek Rigi, was captured in a dramatic operation by the Iranian army, with fighter jets forcing the landing of a passenger aircraft taking him from the United Arab Emirates to Kyrgyzstan in 2010. He was executed in Tehran the same year. Pakistan, for its part, said its targets were the Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF) and Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), armed separatist groups which have launched numerous attacks inside Pakistan. The BLF claimed in a statement on Thursday that none of its fighters – known as Sarmachar – were killed, dismissing as fake an earlier statement that had quoted one of its members as confirming air strikes had hit BLF positions inside Iran. The latest cross-border strikes come against a backdrop of months of border attacks, with the latest attack by Jaish al-Adl on an Iranian border outpost launched from inside Pakistan in Decemberkilling 11 police officers. Even though the strikes come after years of border tensions, they are happening within the context of Israel’s war on Gaza, which haspitted the Iran-backed “axis of resistance”against Washington and its allies. This was the first time that Iran and Pakistan launched direct assaults on each other’s territory, and the first time since the end of the eight-year invasion of Iran by Iraq in 1988 that Iranian soil was targeted by a missile. Iran’s attack on Pakistan came a day after it launched 24 missiles from three different Iranian provinces on Iraq and Syria in a military show of force amid US and United Kingdom attacks on Yemen and Western support for the Gaza war. The attacks in the Levant were also framed as revenge fortwin bombings in Kermanearlier this month that killed at least 90 civilians, serving to assuage domestic calls for retaliation. Yet they also showcase the capabilities and precision of the largest and most varied missile arsenal of the Middle East. In Iraq, Iran claims to have hit a Mossad-linked target in what appeared to be a precision strike. A wealthy Kurdish businessman Peshraw Dizayee was confirmed killed. Images from the area show that only the villa of the Dizayee was destroyed and it was located in the vicinity of the US consulate and the international airport in the regional capital, Erbil, where US and other foreign forces are stationed. For ISIL (ISIS)-linked targets in Syria’s Idlib, the IRGC made a point of saying that it used its brand new Kheibar Shekan ballistic missile with a stated range of 1,450km (900 miles). Even though the missiles could have been launched from a province closer to Syria, their stated launch site was in Khuzestan, which is several hundred kilometres farther. This means that the missiles travelled close to 1,300km (807 miles) to hit precise targets. That puts the entirety of Israel and occupied Palestinian territories within reach of Iranian missiles, sending a message that Tehran’s longstanding threat to “raze Tel Aviv and Haifa to the ground” if necessary can be exacted. The strikes on Pakistan were smaller and covered a relatively short distance by comparison, but they were only part of a larger display of force aimed at increasing Iran’s deterrence without pushing the country into an all-out war.

What the designation of ‘terrorist’ means for Yemen’s Houthis,Experts say that Biden’s re-designation of the Houthis as a terrorist group is unlikely to curb Red Sea attacks.,"In February 2021, less than a month into his presidential term, US President Joe Biden formallydelisted Yemen’s Houthisboth as a “Foreign Terrorist Organization” (FTO) and as “Specially Designated Global Terrorists” (SDGTs) to enable more humanitarian aid for Yemen. On Wednesday, the Biden administrationre-designatedthe Houthis as SDGTs amidst the group’sclashes with the USin the Red Sea. Here is more about what the re-designation means: Organisations with the SDGTs designation are those which are considered to “threaten the security of the US”. SDGTs is a designation that concerns the finances of an individual or a group. In the Houthis’ case, the tag means it is illegal for American citizens to provide any financial or material support tothe Yemeni group. Additionally, it will freeze any assets the Houthis may have in the US. Since the designation places curbs on funds the Houthis receive from American citizens, experts say it is unlikely to have much impact. “This [SDGTs designation] is sort of a minimal:restricting access to funds from abroad, access to international markets. These are things that Houthis don’t have and never had. They don’t own stock on the New York Stock Exchange,” said Nabeel Khoury, a former deputy chief of mission at the US embassy in Yemen. FTOs are foreign organisations that have also been identified as a threat to US national security. There is a publicly accessible list of such organisations compiled by the US Bureau of Counterterrorism. The Houthis are likely to view Wednesday’s move as an affront which could lead to further escalation, Khoury said. There are some key legal differences between the FTO designation and the SDGTs designation, with the SDGTs definition being narrower in scope than FTO. The US started designating organisations as FTOs in 1997 while the creation of the SDGTs designation came in the wake of the September 11 attacks in 2001. Individuals affiliated with an FTO are automatically barred from entering the US, whereas this does not apply to individuals on the SDGTs list. US citizens providing funding to FTOs can be convicted of a crime if it is proven that they knew they were providing funds to a terrorist organisation. Meanwhile, for SDGTs, the standard of proof is higher: For a US person to be convicted of a crime, proof is required that they “wilfully” funded a terrorist organisation. US citizens who are victims of terrorist attacks by FTOs can file lawsuits against them, meanwhile, this does not apply to SDGTs. The US can carry out extraterritorial application – or prosecute anyone in any country – in the case of FTOs. Meanwhile, individuals or entities can only be prosecuted for violating sanctions against SDGTs deliberately or inadvertently if the conduct occurs in the United States or was committed by a US citizen. The criminal penalty for providing material support to an FTO can be as high as life in prison. In the case of SDGTs, the penalty is up to 20 years in prison. Biden delisted the Houthis from the two designations in 2021 after the UN and other humanitarian agencies warned that the designations were preventing much-needed humanitarian relief from going into Yemen. More than half the Yemeni population – 18.2 million people – require humanitarian aid,according to the UN, as the country grapples with starvation, displacement and economic crisis. This decision could impact ordinary families living in Yemen by possibly making it harder for humanitarian aid to reach them, said Afrah Nasser, a non-resident fellow at the Arab Center Washington DC, and who previously worked as a Yemen researcher at Human Rights Watch. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement on Wednesday that the re-designation had been implemented by the US in an attempt to curb the Houthi attacks on the Red Sea. However, US officials also stated that the designation will not take effect for another 30 days. “If the Houthis cease their attacks in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, the United States will immediately re-evaluate this designation,” White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said. However, experts doubt that the move will curb attacks by the Houthis who have vowed to continue in protest over Israel’s war on Gaza. “It seems highly unlikely to have any positive effect on the behaviour of the Houthis,” said Brian Finucane, a senior US programme adviser at the International Crisis Group think tank. “I think it’s a form of ‘do-something-ism’,” he told Al Jazeera. The reimposition of the SDGT designation, he added, is a reflection of Washington’s refusal to recognise that recent Houthi attacks are linked to the war in Gaza. Afrah Nasser from the Arab Center Washington DCaddedthat the designation could further embolden the Houthis and “contribute to radicalising some parts of the population and strengthen the Houthi recruitment system”. The Houthis themselves have announced they will not back down following this designation. The Yemeni group’s spokesperson, Mohammed Abdulsalam, said the designation would not affect the group’s operations to prevent Israeli-linked ships or ships heading to Israel from crossing the Red Sea, the Arabian Sea and the Bab al-Mandeb Strait. The group will “not back down in its position in support of the Palestinian people”, he said. The designation “will trigger sanctions for anyone or any state or entity that now tries to provide material support for the Houthis. We know that they are an Iranian-backed group, so Iran, for example, could be now subject to more sanctions,” reported Al Jazeera’s Kimberly Halkett from Washington, DC.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/18/what-the-designation-of-terrorist-means-for-yemens-houthis
"Aid for Israeli captives, Palestinians reaches Gaza despite challenges","Shipment of medical supplies, other aid is being distributed as part of a deal brokered by Qatar and France.","A shipment of medical supplies and other aid for Israeli captives and Palestinian civilians has entered the Gaza Strip as part of an agreement mediated by Qatar and France between Israel and Hamas. The aid delivery is thefirst dealagreed to by Israel and the Palestinian group, and marks some progress, since a short-lived truce ended on December 1. “The humanitarian aid trucks allowed into southern Gaza are not enough to meet people’s desperate needs,” said Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Rafah in the south of the Strip on Thursday. The shipment arrived on Wednesday, Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Majed al-Ansari confirmed. It is set to be distributed by the Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS). “Over the past few hours, medicine & aid entered the Gaza Strip, in implementation of the agreement announced yesterday for the benefit of civilians in the Strip, including hostages,” al-Ansari posted on X.

The process wasmired in “complexities”, our correspondent said, as Hamas was under the impression the aid would not be inspected on entering Gaza, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denied such an agreement, triggering “political turmoil” within his government. Under the agreement, 45 captives held by Hamas are to receive prescription medicines, while supplies for Palestinian civilians are to be distributed in parts of the besieged enclave which has been relentlessly bombarded by Israeli forces, leaving the entire population facing crisis levels of hunger and at growing risk from disease. More than 100 of the 240 or so captives taken by Hamas during its assault in southern Israel on October 7 were freed during a November truce when some Palestinian prisoners were also released. Al Jazeera’s Mahmoud said that at least 10 trucks were allowed in, adding that “the packages they brought included supplies for depleted hospitals”. “Palestinians here have grown used to a routine of queueing up for more than half a day just to get aid or food stamps. It is incredibly difficult because the amount of humanitarian relief coming in is so little compared to the needs of more than 1.9 million displaced Palestinians,” he added.  The PRCS said on Wednesday that 146 trucks carrying humanitarian aid entered from the Israeli-controlled Karem Abu Salem crossing – called Kerem Shalom in Israel – while 48 trucks entered Gaza’s Rafah crossing with Egypt carrying food, water and medical supplies, in addition to 12 commercial trucks. A senior Hamas official said that for every box provided for the captives, 1,000 boxes of medicines would be sent for Palestinians. France’s ambassador to Israel, Frederic Journes, told Israeli public radio station Kan that he hoped this agreement would be a “first humanitarian step” to seeing the remaining Israeli captives released.

US launches new strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen,"On fourth day of strikes, the US military says it targeted 14 Houthi missiles that were ‘loaded to be fired’ from Yemen.","The United States military says its forces launched strikes on 14 Houthi missiles “that were loaded to be fired” from Yemen in the fourth day of direct attacks on the Iran-aligned group in less than a week. The missiles posed a threat to commercial ships and US Navy vessels in the region, the US Central Command (CENTCOM) said on Wednesday. The group, which controls most of Yemen and has been attacking ships in the region since November, said it will not stop its strikes on shipping routes despite increasing assaults by the US military. “We will not give up targeting Israeli ships or ships heading towards ports in occupied Palestine … in support of the Palestinian people,” the group’s spokesperson, Mohammed Abdelsalam, told Al Jazeera on Thursday. “These missiles on launch rails … could have been fired at any time, prompting U.S. forces to exercise their inherent right and obligation to defend themselves,” CENTCOM said on X. The strikes are meant to degrade the Houthis’ “capabilities to continue their reckless attacks on international and commercial shipping in the Red Sea, the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, and the Gulf of Aden”, it added.

However, CENTCOM did not mention any involvement of the UK in the latest attacks. “It is an open war, and they must endure the earth-shattering, powerful, and crushing strikes and responses, God willing,” Houthi official Ali al-Qahoum wrote on X after the latest strikes. The US on Wednesdayredesignated the Yemeni group as a “terrorist” organisationin response to its continuing attacks and threats to shipping and imposed sanctions on it. The designation does not go into effect for 30 days. The Houthis said the designation will not affect its operations to prevent Israeli ships or vessels heading to Israel from crossing the Red Sea, the Arabian Sea and the Bab al-Mandeb Strait. Rights advocates and analysts say the US move maynegatively affect Yemeni civilians. The Houthis, who support the Palestinian armed group Hamas, launched their attacks in response toIsrael’s war on Gaza. Their strikes have slowed trade between Asia and Europe and alarmed major world powers. Earlier on Wednesday, CENTCOM said a drone launched from areas controlled by the Houthi rebels in Yemen struck the US-owned ship Genco Picardy in the Gulf of Aden.

Pakistan missiles strike Iran in retaliatory bombing as tensions soar,Islamabad says it targeted hideouts of armed groups in Iran in a series of attacks a day after Iran struck Pakistan.,"Islamabad, Pakistan –Pakistan has hit Iran with what it described as “highly coordinated” military strikes, a little more than 24 hours after Iranian air raids in Balochistan, furtherraising tensionsbetween the neighbours and sparking fears of a broader conflict. On Thursday morning, according to a statement from its Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Pakistan conducted what it called an “intelligence-based operation” against hideouts of armed groups in the Sistan-Baluchestan province of Iran. Iranian state television said at least nine people were killed in the attacks. Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the senior-most Pakistani diplomat in Tehran to “offer explanations” for the attacks. Pakistan said its attack was based on “credible intelligence” of “impending large scale terrorist activities” from across the border. The operation was codenamed “Marg Bar Sarmachar” (Death to Sarmachar). “Over the last several years, in our engagements with Iran, Pakistan has consistently shared its serious concerns about thesafe havens and sanctuariesenjoyed by Pakistani origin terrorists calling themselves ‘Sarmachars’ on the ungoverned spaces inside Iran. Pakistan also shared multiple dossiers with concrete evidence of the presence and activities of these terrorists,” the ministry said in its statement. “However, because of lack of action on our serious concerns, these so-called Sarmachars continued to spill the blood of innocent Pakistanis with impunity,” it said. “This action [Pakistan’s missile strike] is a manifestation of Pakistan’s unflinching resolve to protect and defend its national security against all threats.”    The Pakistani response came a day afterIran launched air raidsusing “drones and missiles” against Jaish al-Adl, an armed group, near Panjgur city in Pakistan’s southwestern province of Balochistan, bordering Iran. Tehran has accused the Jaish al-Adl of multiple attacks in the past. Pakistan reacted to the Iranian action – which killed two children and injured three others – calling it “unacceptable” and said the country reserves the right to respond to this “illegal act”. 🔊: PR NO. 1️⃣7️⃣/2️⃣0️⃣2️⃣4️⃣ Operation Marg Bar Sarmachar 🔗⬇️https://t.co/1n5BvtEZBZpic.twitter.com/vVbMkJgCmk — Spokesperson 🇵🇰 MoFA (@ForeignOfficePk)January 18, 2024  But the Pakistani ministry statement on Thursday also suggested that Islamabad did not want to provoke an escalation in tensions. “Pakistan fully respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The sole objective of today’s act was in pursuit of Pakistan’s own security and national interest which is paramount and cannot be compromised,” the statement added. Pakistan had earlier recalled its envoy from Tehran in a series of moves to show its displeasure over the Iranian attack. It also said it would bar Iran’s ambassador to Islamabad – who is currently out of Pakistan – from returning to the mission. Pakistan’s interim Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar met Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian in Switzerland on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday,hours before Iran’s attack. However, on Wednesday,Amirabdollahian saidthe attack on “Pakistan’s soil” was in response to the group’s recent attacks on the Iranian city of Rask in the southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchestan. Emphasising that while Iran respected the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan, he said the country would make no compromises on its own security. “The group has taken shelter in some parts of Pakistan’s Balochistan province. We have talked with Pakistani officials several times on this matter,” he added. China, a close ally of both Pakistan and Iran, said it was willing to mediate between the two countries after the military actions. “The Chinese side sincerely hopes that the two sides can exercise calm and restraint and avoid an escalation of tension,” Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Mao Ning told a news conference on Thursday. “We are also willing to play a constructive role in de-escalating the situation if both sides so wish,” she said. Iran and Pakistan are members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. They also engaged closely with each other when a China-led mediation helped Iran and Saudi Arabia broker a deal to restore relations in March 2023. Mao said Iran and Pakistan were “friendly countries to China and countries with important influence”.    The United States also condemned the Iranian air raids on Pakistan. “We have seen Iran violate the sovereign borders of three of its neighbours in just the past couple of days,” Matthew Miller, spokesperson for the Department of State said during a news briefing on Wednesday, referring to the recent Iranian attacks in Syria and Iraq. Separately, India, Pakistan’s archrival on its eastern border and traditionally considered a close ally of Iran, said it was “a matter between Iran and Pakistan”. “Insofar as India is concerned, we have an uncompromising position of zero tolerance towards terrorism. We understand actions that countries take in their self-defense,” India’s Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement on Wednesday. United Nations chief Antonio Guterres was “deeply concerned” about  the military exchange, his spokesman said. “He urges both countries to exercise maximum restraint to avoid a further escalation of tensions,” Guterres’s spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement. Baqir Sajjad Syed, a Pakistan fellow at the US-based Wilson Center, expressed his scepticism over the Pakistani response cooling off tensions with Iran. “I doubt this will end with Pakistan’s retaliation. The mistrust that earlier prevented action against armed groups on both sides of the border would grow as a result of which I foresee resurgence of militancy in both the Balochistans – the Iranian as well as Pakistani,” he told Al Jazeera. Considering Pakistan’s already fraught relations with Afghanistan on its western border and India on the east, and a deteriorating internal security situation, Syed said Pakistan may prefer matters to be resolved diplomatically. “Pakistan was hard-pressed into responding this time because of the nature of strikes, internal political dynamics, and the perception that its deterrence had broken down. But Islamabad would like a quick de-escalation because if the situation is allowed to linger on, it has the potential of dragging Pakistan into a larger two-front conflict,” he said. Pakistani security analyst Ejaz Haider told Al Jazeera it was “unfortunate that Iran treated Pakistan like Iraq or Syria”. “A joint counterterrorism cooperation would have been the best way forward,” he said. “Pakistan had no option but to strike the terror groups and their infrastructure.” Haider said Iran is already on a “razor’s edge” as Israel’s war on Gaza has involved its regional proxies, the Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen. “For it [Iran] to open a front in the east with Pakistan makes no logical, strategic sense,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/18/pakistan-launches-precise-military-strikes-on-iran-in-response-to-bombing
Biden ‘playing with fire’ by re-designating Yemen’s Houthis as ‘terrorists’,Advocates say labelling the Houthis a ‘global terrorist group’ risks worsening an already dire humanitarian crisis in Yemen.,"It was one of Joe Biden’s first major foreign policy decisions. Less than a month after taking office in January 2021, the United States presidentlifted two “terrorist” designationsimposed by his predecessor, Donald Trump, against Yemen’s Houthi rebels. At the time, Secretary of State Antony Blinkensaidthe move came in “recognition of the dire humanitarian situation in Yemen”. The United Nations, as well as humanitarian groups and US lawmakers, had warned the “terrorist” designations couldinterrupt the flow of aidto the country. Now, almost exactly three years later, the Biden administration is reimposing one of the designations against the Houthis, declaring them to be a “Specially Designated Global Terrorist group” (SDGT) amid a series ofattacks in the Red Sea. And once again, rights advocates and political analysts are sounding the alarm over the negative effects the decision may have on Yemeni civilians. Many also question whether Wednesday’s designation will succeed in pushing the Houthis to end their attacks. “I’m very concerned about the devastating consequences for ordinary people in Yemen,” said Afrah Nasser, a non-resident fellow at the Arab Center Washington DC who previously worked as a Yemen researcher at Human Rights Watch.    Nasser told Al Jazeera that the designation risks deepening the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, which has experienced a years-long war between the Houthis and a coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. More than half of the Yemeni population — 18.2 million people — is in need of assistance,according to the UN, as the country reels from an economic crisis, rising costs, mass displacement and hunger. “The ordinary Yemeni family today is suffering because of both the Houthi domestic policies and also the international community policies in Yemen, such as this [US] designation that we heard today,” Nasser said. “Yemenis are caught between two fires.” In a statement on Wednesday morning, Blinken said the SDGT designation came in response to Houthi attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea. “This designation seeks to promote accountability for the group’s terrorist activities. If the Houthis cease their attacks in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, the United States will reevaluate this designation,” the top US diplomat said. TheIran-aligned Houthis, who control large swaths of Yemen, began firing missiles at Israel and attacking commercial ships in the Red Sea shortly after the war in Gaza began in October. The group pledged to target Israel-linked vessels as part of an effort to pressure the country’s government to end its Gaza bombardment and allow more humanitarian aid deliveries into the coastal Palestinian enclave. It later expanded the threat to any commercial vessels travelling to and from Israel along the arterial trade route off Yemen’s coast.    The attacks led shipping companies to suspend operations in the Red Sea and drew condemnation from the US and its allies. Washington launched a naval coalition to protect commercial vessels in December, and it also carried out several strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen this month in what observers called a“dangerous” escalation. On Wednesday, the Biden administration defended its decision to reimpose the SDGT designation on the Houthis, saying there would be “carve-outs” to protect aid to Yemen. “Today’s designation targets the Houthis, not the Yemeni people,” National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said in a press conference. When asked about how any related sanctions would impact negotiations with the Houthis, Kirby responded firmly: “There’s no negotiations. There’s not a bargaining chip. It’s a way of holding the Houthis accountable.” But experts cast doubt on whether the SDGT designation would lead the Houthis to stop their attacks in the Red Sea, as the administration suggested. “It seems highly unlikely to have any positive effect on the behaviour of the Houthis,” said Brian Finucane, a senior US programme adviser at the International Crisis Group think tank. “I think it’s a form of do-something-ism,” he told Al Jazeera. The reimposition of the SDGT designation, he added, is a reflection of Washington’s refusal to recognise that recent Houthi attacks are linked to the war in Gaza. “The Biden administration has put itself in a box … where it doesn’t have good policy options.” An SDGT designation focuses primarily on the finances of an individual or a group. In this case, it will freeze the Houthis’ assets in the US and prohibit American citizens from having any financial dealings with the group. And while “civil and criminal penalties may be assessed for violations”, the designation is more narrow in scope than the second label that the Trump administration hadimposedon the Houthis: that of “Foreign Terrorist Organization” or FTO. That label makes it a serious crime to provide support to a blacklisted group. “This [SDGT designation] is sort of a minimal: restricting access to funds from abroad, access to international markets. These are things that Houthis don’t have and never had. They don’t own stock on the New York Stock Exchange,” said Nabeel Khoury, a former deputy chief of mission at the US embassy in Yemen. Nevertheless, Khoury told Al Jazeera that the Houthis are unlikely to make a distinction between an SDGT or FTO designation and will see Wednesday’s decision as an affront that could lead to further escalation. Hours after the designation was announced, the Houthis said they fired “naval missiles” at an American ship in the Gulf of Aden. US Central Command laterconfirmedthe US-owned and operated Genco Picardy was struck, causing some damage but no injuries. “It’s really baffling what this administration is engaged in. I don’t think there’s much thought that went into this,” Khoury said. “This designation is more like an insult. It’s the old glove in the face, slap someone with your glove. You’re sort of challenging, but not really hurting them.” Nasser also warned that the designation could further embolden the Houthis and “contribute in radicalising some parts of the population and strengthen the Houthi recruitment system”. Yet, while the SDGT designation is “narrower” than an FTO, the Biden administration is aware “that these sanctions could make things worse for the people of Yemen”, said Finucane. That’s because financial institutions and humanitarian organisations “are likely to be very cautious about engaging with the Houthis in Yemen”, particularly until clear rules around the re-designation are laid out, Finucane explained. On Wednesday, the Biden administration said it is “taking significant steps to mitigate any adverse impacts this designation may have on the people of Yemen”. The decision will come into effect in 30 days, Blinken’s statement said, during which time the administration will consult with aid organisations and other stakeholders. The US Department of Treasury also is expected to publish licenses “authorizing certain transactions related to the provision of food, medicine, and fuel, as well as personal remittances, telecommunications and mail, and port and airport operations on which the Yemeni people rely”. An SDGT designation is doing something to do something. Like an FTO designation, it’s toothless and won’t have any desired effect. Where the FTO would have ushered in a certain catastrophe, an SDGT carries only a severe risk of catastrophe. — Scott Paul (@ScottTPaul)January 16, 2024  But that hasn’t dampened fears the designation will affect Yemenis negatively. “This designation would add another level of uncertainty and threat for Yemenis still caught in one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises,” Scott Paul, associate director of peace and security at Oxfam America, told Al Jazeera in a written statement. “The Biden administration is playing with fire, and we call on them to avoid this designation immediately and prioritise the lives of Yemenis now.” With files from Al Jazeera’s Ali Harb in Washington, DC.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/17/biden-playing-with-fire-by-redesignating-yemens-houthis-as-terrorists
Protests erupt in Tunisian town as search continues for 37 missing migrants,Residents in the town of El Hancha are waiting to hear news of loved ones who disappeared crossing the Mediterranean.,"Tunis, Tunisia –A boat said to be carrying some 37 irregular migrants and asylum seekers has gone missing off the coast of Sfax in Tunisia. Relatives described receiving final phone calls at around 2:30pm on January 11, as the boat was setting out to sea. By around 10pm the same night, all contact with the boat and its passengers had been lost. Other than three or four people from elsewhere in Tunisia, all of the boat’s passengers are reported to be from the small village of El Hancha in the Sfax Governorate. They range in age from about 13 to 35 years old. Frustrated by the lack of news since the boat’s disappearance, the families of the missing undocumented migrants erected roadblocks and burned tyres around the village yesterday, only withdrawing when the government authorities assured the public that search efforts would continue. Mohammed Jlaiel’s 25-year-old brother Ali is among the missing. “We haven’t heard anything about him. Nothing! It’s torturous,” Mohammed told Al Jazeera by phone. “We’re desperate for a piece of news on them,” he continued. ”They were all our neighbours and friends. The whole [of] Hancha is in pain. My mom is in a terrible state.” The Tunisian National Guard released a statement on Tuesday saying “all field units”, including maritime vessels and helicopters, have been mobilised to find the 37 passengers Maltese and Italian units were also reported to have been involved in the search. On Tuesday, the Italian news agency Agenzia Nova indicated that the ongoing search efforts were focused on the coastline between Sfax and the coastal town of Mahdia, some 80 miles (129km) north. Nevertheless, within Tunisia, politicians and the family members of the missing passengers have voiced disquiet about how long it is taking to receive concrete news. “Imagine not knowing anything about a brother for six days. They sent planes, boats, all sorts of things to look for them, but there’s no trace of them whatsoever,” Jlaiel said. “Tunisians, Italians, Libyans … Everyone is searching, and yet they can’t find anything. It’s so strange.” Majdi Karbai, a member of parliament responsible for Tunisians overseas, told Al Jazeera that the missing migrants and asylum seekers were “the latest victims of Europe’s migration policies”. He criticised theEuropean Union’s effortsto control irregular migration along its southern border as endangering lives. Karbai added that he was in contact with family members in El Hancha. The continued absence of information about the lost boat was troubling to residents there, he explained. He worried that the situation could trigger unrest, as happened after another vessel sank in 2022. The southern Tunisian town ofZarzislost 18 inhabitants in that shipwreck, leading to protests denouncing the speed of the rescue effort and theeconomic conditionsthat prompted the fatal voyage. Tunisian President Kais Saied eventually intervened to help quell ill feelings. “This is bad,” Karbai said of the current situation in El Hancha. “This could be very bad, like Zarzis.” Poverty and the absence of employment prospects within Tunisia often drive locals to depart for new lives in Europe. Other migrants, however, arrive on Tunisia’s coasts from elsewhere across the globe, particularly from impoverished and conflict-stricken areas of sub-Saharan Africa. Both Tunisia and neighbouring Libya are key departure points for those looking to travel irregularlyby boatto Europe. However, partly as a result of its popularity, the migration route is also one of the world’s deadliest. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM),2,498migrants and asylum seekers are known to havedrowned while crossingthe central Mediterranean Sea in 2023. The true figure is likelyfar higher. In the first 11 months of 2023, Tunisia’s National Guard intercepted almost 70,000 irregular migrants and asylum seekers. Of those, 77.5 percent had travelled to Tunisia from across Africa. The remainder came from Tunisia itself. Ali Jlaiel from El Hancha was as typical a passenger as any. His brother Mohammed described the missing 25-year-old as someone who struggled to settle down after a series of low-wage jobs, none lasting any great length of time. “He felt cornered,” Mohammed Jlaiel said. “He had no hope of a good future.” Ali’s last job was as an overnight security guard at the Mall of Sfax. But even with a steady wage, his budget barely covered his expenses, Mohammed explained. “He got 600 dinars [$193] as a salary [a month]. Ten dinars [$3] would be spent on daily transportation from Hancha to Sfax. Add to that the cost of his cigarettes and coffee. Nothing would be left. It’s depressing.” “There’s nothing in Hancha. And he’s not a special case. The boat was full of our neighbours. Even kids as young as 13 and 14,” he said. “They all didn’t find any chance here.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/17/protests-erupt-in-tunisian-town-as-search-continues-for-37-missing-migrants
Israel ramps up attacks on Khan Younis as aid for Gaza arrives in Egypt,Palestinian officials say seven people were killed by Israeli air raids that damaged homes near Nasser Hospital.,"Israel has increased attacks on Khan Younis in southern Gaza and sent tanks westwards, prompting accusations from Jordan that its field hospital in the city had been badly damaged by nearby shelling. The Jordanian army said on Wednesday that it held Israel responsible for a “flagrant breach of international law” due to the damage to the facility. Elsewhere in the city, people at and around Nasser Hospital were forced to flee as Israeli tanks approached the district overnight following a statement from the Israeli army that it had come under fire in the area. Palestinian health officials said at least seven people were killed by Israeli air raids that damaged homes near the hospital. At least 24,448 people have been killed in the Israeli assault on Gaza since October 7, the Palestinian health ministry has said. At least 1,139 people, mostly civilians, were killed in the Hamas attack on southern Israel on October 7 according to an Al Jazeera tally based on official figures. Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from southern Gaza, said there were growing fears that Nasser Hospital could soon not be operational as happened with several other facilities targeted by Israeli forces since the start of the war. “The vast majority of healthcare facilities were attacked, destroyed and left severely damaged to the point that they’re pushed out of service completely,” he said. Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy said extra field hospitals were expected in the coming days. “These have, of course, been necessitated by Hamas’s strategic militarisation of Gaza’s existing hospitals,” he said. Hamas has repeatedly denied using hospitals for cover. Israel also announced on Wednesday that it had killed six Palestinian fighters in southern Gaza. In a statement, the military said its latest operation had resulted in the death of counterespionage officer Bilal Nofal and “significantly impacts the terrorist organisation’s capacity to develop and enhance its capabilities”. Under a deal brokered by Qatar and France, desperately needed aid and medication has arrived in the Egyptian city of El Arish near the Gaza border. The International Committee of the Red Cross has welcomed the deal, which will see the 61 tonnes of medicine and food enter the enclave, and called it a “much-needed moment of relief”. Israel’s war on Gaza has left its population facing crisis levels of hunger and at growing risk of disease as supplies run low, aid agencies said. On Wednesday, the head of the Palestine Investment Fund, Mohammed Mustafa, told the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that it would take at least $15bn to rebuild houses in Gaza, not accounting for basic infrastructure and hospitals. “If the war in Gaza continues, more people are likely to die of hunger or famine than war,” Mustafa said. At the beginning of January, Israel announced it was scaling back operations in northern Gaza and beginning a new phase of lower-intensity bombing. However, Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from Rafah in southern Gaza, said that does not seem to be reflected on the ground. “The strikes have not stopped over the last few hours across the Gaza Strip, despite the fact that Israel says that they’re moving to a completely new phase with low-intensity bombing,” he said. “We can see that the death toll and casualties among civilians keeps rising, to reach more than 163 Palestinians killed in the previous 24 hours,” he said, citing Palestinian authorities.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/17/israel-ramps-up-attacks-on-khan-younis-as-aid-for-gaza-arrives-in-egypt
Pakistan-Iran border tensions: A timeline,The latest Iranian missile attacks on Pakistan add to a long list of incidents that led to border tensions between the neighbours.,"Pakistan and Iran stand on the verge of a breakdown in diplomatic ties after an Iranian missile attack on Pakistan killedtwo childrenand injured three others on Tuesday night. On Wednesday, Pakistan recalled its ambassador from Tehran after denouncing the attack and barred Iran’s envoy to Islamabad — who is travelling — from returning to Pakistan. Islamabad accused Iran of violating Pakistani airspace and Iranian state media said missiles targeted two bases of theJaish al-Adlarmed group. But while the rhetoric from Islamabad points to a growing crisis sparked by the Iranian attacks, the two countries have frequently had to navigate tensions along their 900km (559-mile) long volatile border.  Here is a recap of a few past incidents of violence, some of which have soured the diplomatic relationship between the neighbours: The Jaish al-Adl (Army of Justice), which is blacklisted by Iran as a “terror” group, claimed responsibility for apolice station attackin the Iranian town of Rask in the southeastern border province of Sistan-Baluchestan, which killed 11 Iranian security personnel. The attack was condemned by Pakistan. Pakistani military’s media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), released a statement saying armed “terrorists” killed two Pakistani soldiers at a checkpoint in the Singwan area of the Kech district. Pakistan contacted Iranian authorities to thwart attempts by fighters to escape into Iran. The ISPRannouncedthat attackers from Iran killed four of its border patrol soldiers in the Jalgai sector of Kech district. Shehbaz Sharif, who was Pakistan’s prime minister at the time, condemned the killing of four security officials along the border with Iran in Balochistan. After the attack in the Chukab sector of Panjgur district, Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) urged Iran to investigate the matter and hold the perpetrators accountable. The Iranian embassy in Islamabad condemned this attack. Pakistan claimed that a soldier had beenkilled in cross-border firingfrom Iran, blaming it on “terrorists” in Iran. The attack took place following the reopening of the border between the two countries for bilateral trade on September 20, following a four-month closure over security concerns. Iranian soldiers entered Pakistani territory to rescue two intelligence agents that Tehran said had been captured by “terrorists”. Pakistan’s former foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, told the media that Iran-based “terrorists” from the Raji Aajoi Sangar separatist group attacked passengers on a bus in Balochistan, killing 14 people, including 10 navy officers, three air force staffers and one from the coastguard. Four policemen were killed and 42 other people were wounded in a suicide car bomb attack on the police headquarters in Iran’s southern port city of Chabahar, Iranian media reported. Iran’s then-Foreign Minister Javad Zarif blamed “foreign-backed terrorists” in what was widely interpreted as an accusation against Pakistan. The MFA in Islamabad condemned the attack. Twelve Iranian security personnel, including intelligence officers from theIslamic Revolutionary Guard Corps(IRGC), were allegedlykidnappedon the southeastern border with Pakistan. Jaish al-Adl claimed responsibility for this. Pakistani security forceshelped Iran secure the releaseof at least five of the 12 abductees from the armed group. IRGC said threeIranian security personnel were killedby armed fighters in a cross-border attack on a border post in the city of Mirjaveh in Sistan-Baluchestan province. Pakistan’s foreign office said the air force shot down an Iranian drone flying in Punjgur territory. It was the first time an Iranian drone was shot down by Pakistan. Jaish al-Adl claimed responsibility for an attack in Mirjaveh that killed 10 Iranian border guards. The Iranian state media reported quoting police officials that the killings were carried out by long-range guns and “the Pakistani government bears the ultimate responsibility of the attack”. Jaish al-Adl has been launching attacks against Iranian border guards sinceat least 2013when it killed 14 Iranian soldiers in an ambush near the border. In 2014, at least five members of Iranian forces were abducted. In December 2010, 41 people were killed and 90 others wounded in a suicide attack near a mosque in Chabahar.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/17/a-recap-of-violence-pak-iran-border
US designates Yemen’s Houthis as ‘global terrorists’,Houthi spokesperson says designation would not affect the group’s attacks on ships it says are linked to Israel.,"The United States government has announced it is once again designating Yemen’s Houthi rebels as a “terrorist” organisation. Washington’s move on Wednesday to relist the group as “specially designated global terrorists” comes after the US launched strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen in response to the rebels’ attacks on vessels in the Red Sea. These attacks by the Iran-allied group since November have disrupted maritime trade between Asia and Europe. The Houthis say their attacks are aimed at ships with links to Israel and they will continue attacking targets until Israel’s war on Gaza stops. “In response to these continuing threats and attacks, the United States announced the designation of Ansarallah, also known as the Houthis, as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist,” White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said in a statement. “This designation is an important tool to impede terrorist funding to the Houthis, further restrict their access to financial markets, and hold them accountable for their actions.” The designation does not take effect for 30 days, US officials said. “If the Houthis cease their attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, the United States will immediately re-evaluate this designation,” Sullivan said. Speaking after the announcement, Houthi spokesperson Mohammed Abdulsalam said the designation would not affect the group’s operations to prevent Israeli ships or ships heading to Israel from crossing the Red Sea, the Arabian Sea and the Bab al-Mandeb Strait. The group will “not back down in its position in support of the Palestinian people”, he told Al Jazeera. The US is designating Yemen’s Houthis as a “terrorist” group. Who are they?@SandraGathmannexplains ⤵️pic.twitter.com/CBDzR78aLG — Al Jazeera English (@AJEnglish)January 17, 2024  The US previously designated the Houthis as a “foreign terrorist organisation” under former President Donald Trump’s administration despite strong objections from human rights and humanitarian aid groups. In February 2021, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken delisted the Houthis as a “foreign terrorist organisation” and as “specially designated global terrorists” as the administration of current US President Joe Biden sought to make it easier to get humanitarian aid into Yemen. The designation is being reinstated “to make sure international commerce is protected”, Al Jazeera’s Kimberly Halkett said, reporting from Washington, DC. “It will trigger sanctions for anyone or any state or entity that now tries to provide material support for the Houthis. We know that they are an Iranian-backed group, so Iran, for example, could be now subject to more sanctions. It means that members of the Houthi group would be banned from entering the United States and any Houthi funds that are in US financial institutions would be frozen,” she added. US officials said they would design the financial penalties to minimise harm to Yemen’s 32 million people, who are among the world’s poorest and hungriest after years of war between the Houthis and a Saudi-led coalition that supports Yemen’s internationally recognised government. “The people of Yemen should not pay the price for the actions of the Houthis,” Sullivan’s statement said. “We are sending a clear message: commercial shipments into Yemeni ports on which the Yemeni people rely for food, medicine and fuel should continue and are not covered by our sanctions.” In a statement, Blinken added: “During the 30-day implementation delay, the US government will conduct robust outreach to stakeholders, aid providers, and partners who are crucial to facilitating humanitarian assistance and the commercial import of critical commodities in Yemen.” However, aid officials have expressed concern. The decision would add “another level of uncertainty and threat for Yemenis still caught in one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises”, Oxfam America Associate Director Scott Paul said.

Iran says attack in Pakistan targeted ‘Iranian terrorist group’,At least two children were killed and three others injured due to the Iranian air attacks in Pakistan.,"Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said the air attacks in Pakistan that killed two children this week targeted an “Iranian terrorist group”. “On Pakistan, none of the nationals of the friendly and brotherly country of Pakistan were targeted by Iranian missiles and drones,” Abdollahian said on Wednesday on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “The so-called Jaish al-Adl group, which is an Iranian terrorist group, was targeted,” he added. Amir-Abdollahian said the attack on “Pakistan’s soil” was in response to the group’s recent attacks on the Iranian city of Rask in the southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchistan. “The group has taken shelter in some parts of Pakistan’s Balochistan province. We’ve talked with Pakistani officials several times on this matter,” he said. He emphasised that while Iran respected the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan, it would not “allow the country’s national security to be compromised or played with”.    Jaish al-Adl (Army of Justice), a Sunni Muslim armed group, has previously launched attacks on Iranian security forces in the border area with Pakistan. Earlier, Pakistan recalled its ambassador to Iran after an airspace violation had resulted in the deaths of two children. While Pakistan did not provide details into the nature of the violation or its location, the foreign ministry spokesperson said in a statement on Wednesday that it was“unacceptable”and a breach of Pakistan’s sovereignty. “Pakistan reserves the right to respond to this illegal act,” she said. Iran’s ambassador, who is visiting his home country, will not be allowed to return to Islamabad, the ministry’s spokesperson added. Officials in Pakistan’s southwestern province of Balochistan said four missiles had hit the Panjgur district close to the Iranian border. “Four missiles were fired in the village of Koh-i-Sabaz, which is around 50km [30 miles] inside Pakistan soil,” an unnamed senior official of the Panjgur administration told the Reuters news agency. “A mosque and three houses were damaged in the attack,” another official said. Authorities said that two young girls had been killed and three other family members injured. The strikes came a day after Tehran carried out similar attacks inside other neighbouring countries, Iraq and Syria. Baghdad also recalled its ambassador from Tehran after Iranian state media said it had hit an Israeli espionage centre.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/17/iran-says-attack-in-pakistan-targeted-iranian-terrorist-group
Aid headed into Gaza after Israel-Hamas seal first deal since truce ended,Could Israel and Hamas be persuaded to come to an agreement on another truce?,"Humanitarian aid for the besieged Gaza Strip has been shipped under a deal brokered between Israel and Hamas. The aid, which includes medicines for the Israeli captives that Hamas is still holding, was making its way from Egypt on Wednesday, after being flown from France to Qatar. Paris and Doha announced the previous day that they had brokered the first deal between Israel and the Palestinian group since a truce ended on December 1. More than 100 of the 240 or so captives taken by Hamas during its assault on Israel on October 7 were freed during that weeklong pause in fighting, which followed lengthy negotiations mediated by Qatar and the United States. In exchange, Israel released hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. However, efforts to return Israel and Hamas to the negotiating table have been faltering since. Israel has said it would not halt its bombardment of Gaza until the captives are all released and Hamas destroyed; Hamas says it would not release further captives without a full ceasefire. France said on Tuesday that negotiations over the aid deal had been going on for some time, and that the initial idea had come from the families of some of the Israeli captives. The aid will be delivered to the International Committee of the Red Cross. Once it crosses the border into Gaza it will be handed over to Hamas. Paris said it took months toorganise the supplyof the medicines. “France’s Foreign Ministry has issued a statement saying that 45 captives will be receiving medicine for various chronic illnesses and that the medicine should last around three months,” said Al Jazeera’s Stefanie Dekker, reporting from occupied East Jerusalem. “There’s been a lot of back and forth on this deal,” said Dekker.  “The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office announced it a couple of days ago but there’s been a lot of logistical issues to iron out.” Several elderly men are among the more than 100 remaining captives held by Hamas. Most women and children were released during the weeklong truce that ended on December 1. They will be receiving prescription medications for their illnesses, said Dekker – an element that has helped to delay the deal.    “This medication is to go to specific hostages and Hamas has voiced concerns that perhaps it could be traced, for Israel to find out where they [the captives] are,” she said. Families of the captives are demanding proof that these medicines will reach their loved ones, said Dekker. The Israeli government, meanwhile, has been party to this agreement because it wants to show that it is taking serious action to get the captives out, she added. The aid for Gaza is also desperately needed, with most of the enclave’s 2.3 million people displaced, and at risk of starvation. The Palestinian population faces “famine-like conditions”, Hani Mahmood, reporting from Rafah on the border with Egypt, reported. The deal will see humanitarian aid delivered to civilians in “the most affected and vulnerable areas”, Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Tuesday. In all parts of the strip, heavy Israeli bombardment continued overnight, said Mahmood.    Amid the worsening situation in Gaza, reports suggest that the push for another truce between Israel and Hamas may be picking up momentum once more. On Tuesday, the White House said that US Middle East Envoy Brett McGurk has been in Doha in recent days discussing a possible agreement that could free the Israeli captives. National security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters that McGurk was involved in “very serious and intensive discussions” with the Qataris about another deal. “We are hopeful it will bear fruit and bear fruit soon,” he said. At the same time, Israel stepped up its air strikes on the south of Gaza on Wednesday. “It was the most difficult and intense night in [the southern city of] Khan Yunis since the start of the war,” said the Hamas government, whose health ministry reported 81 deaths across the Palestinian territory.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/17/deal
Al Jazeera’s Gaza bureau chief Wael Dahdouh in Qatar for medical treatment,Dahdouh was injured in an Israeli strike in December that killed Al Jazeera cameraperson Samer Abudaqa.,"Al Jazeera’s Gaza bureau chief Wael Dahdouh is in Qatar for medical treatment after being wounded in an Israeli attack while reporting on the conflict. Dahdouh – who has been the face of Al Jazeera Arabic’s coverage of Israel’s war on Gaza – arrived in the Qatari capital, Doha, on Tuesday night, via Egypt. He was wounded in an Israeli drone strike in December in which Al Jazeera Arabic’s camerapersonSamer Abudaqawas killed while they were reporting in southern Gaza. Just now, we welcomed our esteemed colleague, Wael Al Dahdooh, to Doha as he arrives to receive medical treatment. Wael's unwavering dedication during his coverage in Gaza, where he tragically lost his family, is a testament to his resilience and commitment. We stand united in…pic.twitter.com/kUly4M8d9J — Mohamed Moawad (@moawady)January 16, 2024  Dahdouh, who left the besieged enclave for the first time since the currentIsraeli-Palestinian conflictstarted in October, lost hiswife Amna, son Mahmoud, daughter Sham and grandson Adamin October after an Israeli air raid hit the home they were sheltering in at the Nuseirat refugee camp, after being displaced from their house in Gaza City. Earlier this month, the 53-year-old veteran journalist’s eldest son,Hamza, also an Al Jazeera journalist, was killed by an Israeli missile strike in Khan Younis, southern Gaza.    Despite his immense personal loss, Dahdouh has comforted his family, friends and colleagues and continued to turn to the cameras to report with steadfastness about the catastrophic situation in Gaza. “The cost is very high, but at the end of the day, we ask ourselves, ‘What is the other option?’,” he told US broadcaster NBC in an interview on Sunday. “We sit in our homes, waiting for missiles to land. Leave this job, give up this humanitarian message that we delivered? This is definitely not an option,” Dahdouh said. As he laid Hamza to rest, he noted that he was one of many in Gaza bidding farewells to their loved ones and pledged to remain on his path of showing the world what is happening in Gaza. The Al Jazeera Media Network strongly condemned the attack that killed Hamza, as well as Mustafa Thuraya, another of the network’s journalists. The list of Al Jazeera journalists and staff who have died or lost members of their families has been growing.    Nearly 100 journalists have been killed in Gaza since October. Data from the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) shows that more journalists were killed in the first 10 weeks of the conflict than have ever been killed in a single country over an entire year.

Will Pakistan retaliate against ‘unacceptable’ Iran air attacks?,"A counterattack is possible, but Pakistan would be wary of getting pulled into a wider conflict. What Pakistan might instead do is strengthen ties with Iran’s rivals, say analysts.","Islamabad, Pakistan –Iran’sair attackson Tuesday night inside Pakistani territory in the southwestern province of Balochistan threaten to pull Islamabad into a broader regional conflict, analysts warn, less than a month before national elections. The bombings, which Iran said were aimed at the armed group Jaish al-Adl (Army of Justice), resulted in the death of at least two children while injuring three more, according to a statement by the Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The ministry on Wednesday said it “strongly condemned” the incident – which took place near the border city of Panjgur – calling it a violation of Pakistani sovereignty, and announced the recall of Pakistan’s envoy in Tehran. “This illegal act is completely unacceptable and has no justification whatsoever. Pakistan reserves the right to respond to this illegal act. The responsibility for the consequences will lie squarely with Iran,” it said in a statement. But what might those consequences be? On Wednesday afternoon Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry announced that it was recalling its ambassador in Tehran. Iran’s ambassador to Islamabad, who is currently in Tehran, would not be allowed back into Pakistan, the Foreign Ministry’s spokesperson said. “Last night’s unprovoked and blatant breach of Pakistan’s sovereignty by Iran is a violation of international law and the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,” the statement said, before issuing a threat. “This illegal act is completely unacceptable and has no justification whatsoever. Pakistan reserves the right to respond to this illegal act. The responsibility for the consequences will lie squarely with Iran.” Ironically, the attacks came amid increased interactions between Pakistani and Iranian officials, both civilian and military, in recent days. Hours before Iran fired missiles into Balochistan, Pakistani caretaker Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar had met Iranian Minister of Foreign Affairs Hossein Amirabdollahian on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos in Switzerland. Pakistan’s interim Foreign Minister Jalil Abbas Jilani met with Iran’s special representative for Afghanistan affairs, Hassan Kazmi Qomi, in Islamabad earlier this week, where the two discussed the need for “enhanced coordination for regional stability”.

Despite these recent engagements, and a2022 decisionto form a joint working group for border management, low-scale clashes at the border have remained a constant feature. Iranian media in December reported that the country’s interior minister issued a warning to Pakistan to stop the Jaish al-Adl group from launching attacks in Iran, after the death of 11 policemen in the southeastern city of Rask in Iran’s Sistan-Baluchestan province, which borders Pakistan. In May 2023, six Iranian border guards were killed in clashes near the Pakistan border, resulting in Iran issuing a warning, asking Pakistan to “do more”. Amonth earlier, four Pakistani soldiers were also killed in cross-border firing in Pakistan’s Balochistan province. The countries share a roughly 900km (559-mile) long border in Pakistan’s southwest and Iran’s southeast. They have accused each other of sheltering armed groups. Pakistan has been facing a decades-long uprising by Baloch rebels who demand secession. On the other hand, Iran has demanded that Pakistan act against Jaish al-Adl, a Sunni armed group which has targeted Iranian officials, reportedly demanding better living conditions for people in Sistan-Baluchestan, the most impoverished province of the country. Iran’s attack inside Pakistani territory, coming at a time when Israel’s war on Gaza could escalate regional tensions, deserves a mature response, said Mosharraf Zaidi of the Islamabad-based Tabadlab think tank. Iran has also launched attacks insideSyria and Iraqrecently. “Pakistan’s response so far is exactly what it should be. The Iranians are looking to provoke an unnecessary reaction,” he told Al Jazeera. “The real risk right now is the wider dangers of Pakistan being sucked into a conflict that it is not a primary actor in and will be distracted further by.” On the other hand, Kamran Bokhari, senior director for the Washington, DC-based New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy, said Pakistan could respond with its own attacks – though that could mean a potentially longer-term conflict for Pakistan. “After Afghanistan on the West and India on the East, this could open conflict on a third border. I am not too sure if Islamabad is ready for that,” he told Al Jazeera. Pakistan has summoned Iran’s top diplomat in Islamabad to register its protest. Ihsanullah Tipu, a security analyst, said he expected Pakistan to work on both a diplomatic riposte and look at potential options for a military response. “For Pakistan to strike back, the justification and pressure are both present. It could seek a public apology via diplomatic channels from the highest Iranian officials, but if those efforts fail, Pakistan could also consider a military response to the Iranian attack,” Tipu told Al Jazeera. Tipu, who is a director at The Khorasan Diary, a news and research portal which tracks and analyses security issues in the region, expressed his surprise at the escalation by Iran despite the continuing security conflict in the Middle East region. He said Iranian actions would have a long-lasting effect and implications on bilateral relations, in the realms of both politics and security. “By carrying out attacks inside Pakistan, it has given a kind of justification to Pakistan to follow the same path in response to target the sanctuaries of anti-Pakistan militant outfits, which Pakistan considers are based in Iran or even elsewhere,” Tipu added. Bokhari said that the Iranian air attacks could push Pakistan into seeking “greater alignment” with the United States, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. “Each of these countries has an interest in making sure Iran is contained. The attack on Pakistan is only one element of a broader Iranian confrontation with the United States,” he said. “Tehran sees Pakistan as a pawn in this high-risk brinkmanship with Washington.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/17/will-pakistan-retaliate-against-unacceptable-iranian-air-attacks
Pakistan says two children killed in ‘completely unacceptable’ Iran attack,Government accuses Iran of violating its airspace in attack targeting armed group Jaish al-Adl and recalls ambassador.,"Pakistan has said two children were killed and three others injured after neighbouring Iran launched air attacks that Islamabad described as a violation of its airspace. The Pakistani foreign ministry on Wednesday said it had recalled its ambassador from Iran and that the Iranian ambassador to Pakistan would not be allowed to return. “This illegal act is completely unacceptable and has no justification whatsoever,” it said in a statement. “Pakistan reserves the right to respond to this illegal act. The responsibility for the consequences will lie squarely with Iran,” itwarned. In an earlier statement, the ministry had said the strike late on Tuesday “resulted in death of two innocent children while injuring three girls”. Social media accounts reported blasts in the mountainous Balochistan province, where the two countries share a sparsely populated border nearly 1,000km (620 miles) long. Iran’s state media reported earlier that Tehran had targeted two bases of the Jaish al-Adl armed group in Pakistan, with the IRNA news agency and state television saying missiles and drones were used in the strikes. Press TV, the English-language arm of Iranian state television, attributed the attack to Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard. There was no official comment from Tehran.     Jaish al-Adl, the “Army of Justice”, has been launching deadly attacks against Iranian border guards since at least 2013 and has previously claimed bombings and kidnappings of border police. Iran’s Nournews, which is affiliated with the country’s top security body, said the bases were in Balochistan province. Pakistan’s statement did not mention the location of the incident, but two Pakistani security officials told the Associated Press news agency that the Iranian strikes damaged a mosque in Balochistan’s Panjgur district, about 50km (30 miles) inside the border. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to the media. Tehran and Islamabad frequently accuse each other of allowing armed groups to operate from the other’s territory. “Pakistan has always said terrorism is a common threat to all countries in the region that requires coordinated action,” the Foreign Ministry statement said in the earlier statement. “Such unilateral acts are not in conformity with good neighbourly relations and can seriously undermine bilateral trust and confidence.” On Monday, Iran fired missiles into northern Syria targeting the ISIL (ISIS) group and into Iraq at what it called an Israeli “spy headquarters” near the United States Consulate compound in the city of Erbil. Iraq on Tuesday called theattacks, which killed several civilians, a “blatant violation” of Iraq’s sovereignty and recalled its ambassador from Tehran.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/17/pakistan-says-two-children-killed-in-completely-unacceptable-iran-attack
US federal workers risk livelihoods in push for course change on Gaza war,Government employees call a ‘day of mourning’ in the latest sign of internal discontent over Biden administration policy.,"Washington, DC –When your children ask you what you did during the war in Gaza, what will you say? That’s how one federal government employee in the United States described her motivation for organising her colleagues around a “day of mourning” on Tuesday to recognise more than100 days of warin the Palestinian enclave. She and a group of federal workers, acting anonymously under the name Feds United for Peace, agreed to take leave from their jobs en masse, in an demonstration against the rising death toll in Gaza and the US’s role in the war. The move is the latestunderscoring the discontentwithin President Joe Biden’s administration. Biden has voiced “rock-solid and unwavering” support for Israel, despite mounting human rights concerns over its months-long military campaign in Gaza. More than 24,200 Palestinians have been killed in the fighting, and nearly 1.9 million displaced. “When your kids ask you, ‘What did you do?’, we don’t want to say that we just watched from the sidelines. And we hope that everyone who has a conscience looks at this situation and takes it upon themselves to not watch from the sidelines,” said the organiser, who added that she had more than 15 years of experience in the federal government. She and a second organiser spoke to Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity for fear of professional repercussions. They said the group represents employees — both career professionals and political appointees — across 27 government agencies, including the White House and Congress.    “We are really not activists. There may be, among our group, people who are political appointees, but we’re not political in any way,” said the second organiser. “This group really grows out of this immense frustration and sadness at seeing the war continue for so long — the massive death and destruction unfolding in Gaza over the last 100 days,” he said. Members of the Biden administration have repeatedly voiced frustration with the president’s stance and called for a ceasefire in Gaza, including through public statements andopen letters. There have even beenhigh-profile resignations. State Department official Josh Paul left his post over Biden’s handling of the war, as did Tariq Habash in the Department of Education. Habash had been the department’s only Palestinian American political appointee at the time of his departure. He latertold Al Jazeerathat leaving was “the only thing” he could do in the face of a US policy that has had a “near-daily dehumanising effect” on Palestinians. Nevertheless, Washington continues to provide military aid to Israel, without setting “red lines” to limit its use. An estimated $3.8bn is earmarked annually for the country, with Biden bypassing Congress twice last month to approve further sales of weaponry. The Biden administration has recently called on the Israeli government to shift towards more targeted operations with fewer civilian casualties, but Palestinian American advocates have said thosewords ring hollowwithout more decisive action. Biden also provoked the ire of Palestinian rights supporters after hequestioned the death tollprovided by authorities in Gaza. That is why the latest move by federal employees “is not something that is coming out of the blue”, said Jasmine El-Gamal, a foreign policy analyst and former Middle East adviser at the Pentagon. “We’ve seen months now of federal employees, both in the executive branch and the legislative branch, trying to bring attention to the fact that there is a huge level of dissent within the Biden administration and from people working on Biden’s campaign as well, against his policies when it comes to Gaza,” El-Gamal told Al Jazeera.    Critics said Biden’s statement on Sunday to mark the 100th day of the war echoed a pattern of dehumanisation towards Palestinians. The US president decried the “devastating and tragic milestone” for those held captive by Hamas, the group that attacked southern Israel on October 7, killing an estimated 1,139 Israelis and kidnapping hundreds more. But Biden made no mention of the profound death toll in Gaza and the ongoing humanitarian crisis there. United Nations experts have warned of a “grave risk of genocide” in the territory. Those human rights concerns have led to an “extremely uncommon, if not unprecedented”, level of dissent within the Biden administration, according to Trita Parsi, the executive vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft. “We have seen nothing like this,” Parsi said. He explained it took years for members of other administrations to organise in protest of their president. “Even during the Iraq war, for instance — not just in the beginning but also after — more and more lawmakers started to express concerns and opposition by 2004, 2005.” While members of the Democratic Party in Congress remain predominantly pro-Israel, some have come forward to demand a ceasefire and push for more oversight over weapons transfers to Israel. At least 63 members of Congress have called for an outright halt to the fighting. On Tuesday, progressive Senator Bernie Sanders introduced legislation that would require the US to conduct a human rights review of Israel before any more arms were transferred. The dismay over the administration’s policies has also resulted in apotentially damagingpolitical fallout for Biden on the campaign trail, as he seeks reelection in 2024. The Democrat’s support among Arab and Muslim voters has plummeted to anall-time low, according to a poll conducted in October. Biden is widely expected to face former President Donald Trump in a general election in November. “One of the critical qualities that Biden, frankly any Democrat, had immediately over Trump was to have the moral upper hand in the eyes of many of those in his own base,” Parsi said. “Biden has squandered that by supporting a slaughter in Gaza, refusing to listen and even spreading misinformation about it.” But for those seeking to send a message to Biden from within his administration, the stakes are high. Following a report on Feds United for Peace’s planned action last week on the Al-Monitor website, House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, tweeted: “Any government worker who walks off the job to protest US support for our ally Israel is ignoring their responsibility and abusing the trust of taxpayers.” “They deserve to be fired,” he wrote, adding he would “work to ensure that each federal agency initiates appropriate disciplinary proceedings against any person who walks out on their job”. One of the organisers for Feds United for Peace told Al Jazeera: “As a federal workforce, we are prohibited by law from striking, and so this action was never a strike.”    “It was never designed as a walkout. It was designed as a day of mourning. And employees took different types of leave for this day of mourning and used it in different ways,” she said, adding that watching the “horrors unfold” in Gaza “has taken a tremendous toll on people who care about what’s going on”. “This was also an opportunity for people to just take a day and take care of themselves in order to continue their work and the struggle,” she said. “Even though we are trying to protect ourselves, I think each one of us recognises that we’re putting our livelihoods at risk,” said the second organiser. While the organiser did not say how many were participating in the walkout, he did say that participation “has exceeded expectations”. Many, however, are keeping a low profile, “as a result of perceived intimidation”. The group is appealing for the Biden administration to support an immediate ceasefire, stop undermining international efforts to hold Israel accountable, prioritise the entry of humanitarian goods into Gaza and help facilitate the release of captives. “We went into public service to serve the United States, to try to reflect what is best about the United States,” said the first organiser. “And so in this particular case, we feel it is a moral obligation and a patriotic duty to our country to use the means at our disposal to try to urge a course change in the White House policy.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/17/us-federal-workers-risk-livelihoods-in-push-for-course-change-on-gaza-war
Qatar announces Israel-Hamas deal for medicine and aid to enter Gaza,Shipment of aid for Palestinians and medicines for captives held by Hamas to leave Doha on Wednesday for Egypt and transport to Gaza.,"Israel and Hamas have reached an agreement to allow medicines to be delivered to Israeli captives held in the Gaza Strip and for aid to be transported to residents in the besieged Palestinian territory, Qatar has announced. The deal will see humanitarian aid delivered to civilians in “the most affected and vulnerable areas” in Gaza in exchange for the delivery of medication to Israeli captives held by Hamas, the group that governs Gaza, Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Tuesday. Ministry spokesperson Majed al-Ansari said medication and aid will leave Doha on Wednesday for the Egyptian city of El Arish in preparation for their delivery into the Gaza Strip. He said the agreement was mediated by Qatar in cooperation with France. Earlier, Philippe Lalliot, head of France’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs Crisis Centre, which organises aid efforts, said negotiations had been going on for weeks and the initial idea had come from the families of some of the Israeli captives. Specific medical packages for several months, which were put together in France, would be delivered to each of the 45 captives. The International Committee of the Red Cross will coordinate on the ground. Hamas seized about 240 people as captives during its attack on southern Israel on October 7 in which at least 1,139 people were killed, according to an Al Jazeera tally based on official statistics. Israel responded to the assault with a devastating bombardment, siege and ground invasion of Gaza. More than 24,000 people have been killed in the Israeli assault, according to Palestinian authorities. More than 100 captives were freed during a week-long truce in late November following lengthy negotiations mediated by Qatar and the United States. In exchange, Israel released hundreds of Palestinian prisoners from jails. Earlier on Tuesday, the White House said US Middle East Envoy Brett McGurk was in Doha in recent days discussing a possible deal for the release of captives. National security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters that McGurk was involved in “very serious and intensive discussions” with the Qataris about another deal. “We are hopeful it will bear fruit and bear fruit soon,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/16/qatar-announces-israel-hamas-deal-for-medicine-and-aid-to-enter-gaza
Yemen’s Houthis claim attack on ship in Red Sea as US confirms new strike,Malta-flagged ship hit by missile as US military says it launches a new strike against Houthi targets in Yemen.,"Yemen’s Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for a missile attack on a Malta-flagged cargo ship in the Red Sea as the United States says it has launched a new strike on Houthi targets amid soaring tensions around the key waterway. “A Malta-flagged, Greek-owned bulk carrier was reportedly targeted and impacted with a missile while transiting the southern Red Sea northbound,” the maritime risk management company Ambrey said in an alert on Tuesday. The Houthis’ military spokesperson, Yahya Sarea, said in a statement that the Yemeni rebels targeted the Zografia ship with naval missiles on Tuesday as it was heading to Israel, resulting in a “direct hit”. There were no reports of injuries. The vessel had been heading north to the Suez Canal when it was attacked, the Greek Ministry of Shipping and Island Policy said. Earlier on Tuesday, the US military said it launched a new strike against the Houthis, hitting anti-ship missiles in the third assault on the Iran-backed group in recent days. According to a US Central Command statement, the strike destroyed four Houthi ballistic missiles that were prepared to launch and presented an imminent threat to merchant and US navy ships in the region. The Houthi attack on the Zografia involved an anti-ship ballistic missile, the statement said, adding that the ship continued its Red Sea transit after being hit and saying it remained seaworthy. The Iran-backed Houthis have attacked what they say are Israel-linked commercial vessels since November, disrupting maritime trade routes. The Houthis say the attacks are a response to Israel’s bombardment of Gaza. The group has threatened to expand the range of targets of its attacks in the Red Sea to include US ships in response to American and British strikes on its sites in Yemen.    On Sunday, US forces shot down a Houthi cruise missile targeting a US destroyer, and on Monday, a US-owned cargo ship in the Gulf of Oman was hit by a missile. Al Jazeera’s Hashem Ahelbarra said the tensions in the Red Sea could “degenerate into something bigger, particularly the potential of war for an Iranian-American confrontation in Yemen”. “We’re talking about an extremely delicate situation in the Red Sea,” Ahelbarra said. Earlier, Qatar’s prime minister said liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipments would be affected by Red Sea tensions and warned that the strikes on Yemen risk worsening the crisis. “LNG is … as any other merchant shipments. They will be affected by that [exchange with the Houthis],” Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani told the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “There are alternative routes. Those alternative routes are not more efficient; they’re less efficient than the current route,” he added. On Monday, the Bloomberg news agency reported that at least five LNG vessels used by Qatar had stopped on their way to the Red Sea. “[Military intervention] will not bring an end for this, will not contain it. So the contrary, I think [it] will create … a further escalation,” the prime minister added.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/16/malta-flagged-cargo-ship-hit-by-missile-in-red-sea
Sudan suspends contacts with IGAD mediating group: Foreign Ministry,The army-aligned government accused IGAD of ‘violating’ the country’s sovereignty by inviting the RSF chief to a summit.,"Sudan has suspended its involvement in mediation efforts with an east African regional bloc that has sought to broker talks between the country’s warring parties. The Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary grouphave been fighting for nine monthsin a brutal war that has displaced more than 7 million people and left nearly half of Sudan’s 49 million people requiring aid. On Tuesday, Sudan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement that the decision came after the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) added Sudan to the agenda of a meeting scheduled for January 18 in Kampala, Uganda, and invited the RSF’s leader, Mohamed Hamdan Daglo – known as Hemedti – to attend. The ministry, which is loyal to army chief and Sudan’s de facto leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, accused IGAD of “violating Sudan’s sovereignty” and setting a “dangerous precedent”. The bloc, in parallel with the United Statesand Saudi Arabia, had repeatedly attempted to mediate between the two warring generals, but to no avail. On Saturday, the ministry accused the bloc of lending Hemedti’s “militia” legitimacy by inviting it to a meeting that will be attended by member heads of state and government. Al-Burhan had recently accused the bloc of bias and seeking to intervene in “an internal matter”.    The RSF chief recently toured six African capitals including IGAD members, while analysts say the army chief is growing more and more isolated diplomatically, as his troops lose ground to RSF advances. Al-Burhan has reacted angrily to Hemedti’s growing diplomatic status, accusing African leaders receiving him of complicity in atrocities against Sudanese civilians. The war between the two sides erupted in mid-April over an internationally backed plan to merge the RSF into the army and launch a transition towards elections. The army and the RSF had shared power after longtime ruler Omar al-Bashir was toppled during a popular uprising in 2019. Before they came to blows, they jointly staged a coup in 2021 that upended efforts to steer Sudan towards democracy. Throughout the conflict,both sides have been accused of war crimes, including the indiscriminate shelling of residential areas, torture and arbitrary detention of civilians. The RSF has also specifically been accused of ethnically-motivated mass killings – especially in Darfur – as well as rampant looting and the use of rape as a weapon of war. The conflict has killed more than 13,000 people, according to a conservative estimate by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project. Around 7.5 million civilians have fled the fighting either abroad or to other parts of the country, according to United Nations figures.

"UK takes centre stage in Red Sea action, targeting Yemen’s Houthis","Three Royal Navy Frigates are now in the region, as the UK ramps up to its biggest military footprint since the Cold War.","As an ally of Ukraine, the United Kingdom has been an outspoken opponent of Russian aggression and moved first to provide Ukraine with tanks and long-range missiles. As a participant in the multinational naval force working to neutralise the threat fromYemen-based Houthisto international shipping, it has raised its own military profile on the world stage. “We’ve acted at the forefront of global responses to maintain regional stability,” UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said in a speech to Lancaster House on Monday. In October, after the Palestinian group Hamas attacked Israel, the UK was among the first countries to send a Royal Navy task group, marines and surveillance planes off Israel. Last December, after Yemen-based Houthis attacked international shipping in support of Hamas, the UK joined the US to lead the multinational Operation Prosperity Guardian in the Red Sea. On Friday, that force struck Houthi military sites after the Houthis targeted HMS Diamond and US Navy vessels with 21 drones and missiles. The UK used four RAF Typhoon FGR4s to drop Paveway IV guided bombs on two facilities, a site at Bani used to launch reconnaissance and attack drones, and the airfield at Abbs, used to launch cruise missiles and drones. “Early indications are that the Houthis’ ability to threaten merchant shipping has taken a blow,” said the Ministry of Defence in a statement. The UK has been raising its military profile globally and its defence budget at home. Shapps said defence spending, already at 50 billion pounds ($63bn) this year, would rise to 2.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) as soon as possible, and he called on other NATO allies to follow suit. The justification for the Red Sea action has been to protect global trade. Some 15 percent of the world’s marine traffic passes through the Bab al-Mandeb Strait, which separates the Indian Ocean from the Red Sea. From there it reaches Europe through the Suez Canal. Among the most affected are container ships, bringing manufactured products from China to the European market. When Moller-Maersk, the world’s largest operator of container ships, said it was diverting its vessels around Africa on January 5, it prompted other shippers to do the same. The diversion adds about 10 days shipping time, increases costs and could inflate prices. Maersk made its decision after Houthis attacked the Maersk Hangzhou on January 2. Oil tankers have been the other large category of ships affected, since they use Suez to bring Middle Eastern oil to European refineries. One-third of the world’s oil is moved by Greek-owned ships. “Greek tanker businesses have been monitoring the situation in the Red Sea for some time now – well before the most recent events,” an adviser to a Greek tanker operator told Al Jazeera, preferring to remain anonymous. “Incidents that were widely reported off Yemen in the last quarter of 2022 alerted everyone to the need to adopt a prudential stance.” Not everyone in Europe has seen a similar need for the use of force. “There’s a wider question about the extent to which this was legal self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter,” international relations professor at Panteion University in Athens Angelos Syrigos told Al Jazeera. “Nothing … shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations,” the article says. “Italy is hiding behind the need for parliamentary approval [of military force],” said Syrigos. “France and Spain are saying, ‘We don’t want to solve this through force because that risks escalation,’” he said. “It is a huge problem, it is a consequence of other [war] outbreaks. I would not like to open a third front of war at this time,” Italian defence minister Guido Crosetto told Reuters, in a reference to current conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza. Crosetto has also called on Ukraine to open negotiations with Russia. The risk of escalation is certainly present. Both Hamas and the Houthis are armed by Iran. A third Iran proxy, Lebanon-based Hezbollah, has also threatened to attack Israel. And there is the risk of Iranian direct involvement. On January 11, Iran seized an oil-filled tanker in retaliation for the confiscation by US authorities of a sanctioned Iranian oil cargo last year. An escalation could be a significant military challenge. The Israeli army is still fighting Hamas after more than three months of bombing and commando operations. Hezbollah is said to possess 150,000 rockets. And the Houthis may still have powerful weapons. They attacked a US-owned ship three days after the punitive attacks by the US and UK. The London-based International Institute of Strategic Studies believed Iran had provided the Houthis with Sayyad and Quds 800km (500-mile) range missiles as well as 500km (300-mile) range missiles with 300kg (660-pound) warheads. “Although the Houthis have linked their campaign against shipping to the ongoing fighting between Israel and Hamas, the weapons were being provided by Iran well before the Israeli–Hamas conflict erupted in October 2023,” wrote the IISS’s Fabian Hinz in an IISS blog. “That suggests a strong, long-term Iranian focus on strengthening Houthi anti-ship capabilities and a potential attempt to export Iran’s model of naval coercion from the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz to the geopolitically important Red Sea and Bab el-Mandeb Strait.” The UK has nonetheless determined that an advance defence is the best deterrent against possible future hostilities by other actors. “The era of the peace dividend is over,” said Shapps, referring to the post-Cold War years. “In five years time, we could be looking at multiple theatres involving Russia, China, Iran and North Korea.” “Ask yourselves – looking at today’s conflicts across the world – is it more likely that the number grows, or reduces? I suspect we all know the answer – it’s likely to grow.” The UK is about to field 36,000 soldiers overseas – its highest number of land forces in 40 years. There may be other reasons, too, why the British government is putting itself front and centre in the conflict. “Britain considers that in the Middle East, it is still a great power … it is effectively saying, ‘I need to maintain a presence there and keep an eye on events because I know the region well,’” said Syrigos. And the UK’s governing Conservatives face a general election this year. Polls conducted by Ipsos and YouGov late last year found that only a quarter of Britons held a favourable view of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, with more than half viewing him unfavourably. Whether the UK’s action in the Red Sea proves as popular as its forceful stance in Ukraine remains to be seen.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/16/britain-takes-centre-stage-in-red-sea-action
Turkey court fines Somali president’s son for car crash that killed courier,Mohammed Hassan Sheikh Mohamud’s sentence was commuted to a fine of about $900.,"A court in Turkey has convicted the son of Somalia’s president for the death of a motorcycle courier, but commuted his sentence of two-and-a-half years in prison to a fine. Prosecutors had requested that Mohammed Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, the son of Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, be sentenced to up to six years in prison. On Tuesday, the Istanbul court fined him 27,300 Turkish lira ($900), state media reported. Mohamud was not present in court. His driver’s licence was also revoked for six months. Mohamud was charged with “causing death by negligence” after a diplomatic car he was driving hit courier Yunus Emre Gocer in Istanbul on November 30. An arrest warrant was issued for Mohamud after Gocer died six days later, but the president’s son had alreadyleft Turkeyon December 2. Mohamud reportedly returned to Turkey last week to testify. The arrest warrant and a travel ban imposed on him were revoked after he gave a statement to court officials, and was then released, the DHA news agency reported. He denied negligence, saying that the motorbike stopped suddenly and that the crash had been unavoidable. The police report, however, said that Gocer, a father of two, did not violate any traffic rules and that the car driver was primarily at fault. Gocer’s father was planning to appeal the decision to commute the sentence, his lawyer Tugba Aydin told reporters after the hearing. “The life of a motorcycle courier cannot be worth 27,000 Turkish lira when the other side is 75 percent at fault,” said Mesut Ceki of the Courier Rights Association. “So what happened?

US claims seizure of Iranian weapons bound for Yemen’s Houthis,The haul is the first since the Houthis began attacks on Red Sea shipping in November.,"The US Navy has reported that it seized weapons sent by Iran to resupply Yemen’s Houthi rebels last week. The United States Central Command (CENTCOM) announced in a statement on Tuesday that US Navy Seals found the arms during a night-time raid on a ship in the Arabian Sea on January 11. Iran has denied any link to the Houthis’ campaign of attacks in the Red Sea, which have disrupted global trade. The raid on a dhow near the coast of Somalia last week uncovered “lethal” advanced conventional weapons, the statement said. The Iranian-made ballistic missiles and cruise missile components were seized by the US forces. The seizure comes at a time of rising violence in the region linked to Israel’s war on Gaza. The Houthis, who control most of Yemen’s Red Sea coast, have been attacking commercial ships that they say are linked to Israel or bound for Israeli ports. Launched in November, the offensive is, according to the Yemeni group, intended as defence of Palestinians.  After forming a joint patrol force, US and British forces upped the ante last week, carrying out dozens of strikes on Houthi targets. US officials said the strikes had significantly dented the Houthis’ capacity, diminishing their ability to fire missiles and launch drones. However, official sources cited by Al Jazeera claimed that the group still retainsthree-quarters of its capacity. On Monday, the US military said that the rebel group had struck a US-owned and operated container ship with an anti-ship ballistic missile. No injuries or significant damage were reported. The attack came the day after the Houthis launched a cruise missile toward a US destroyer. Houthi spokesperson Yahya Sarea said that “all American and British ships and warships involved in the aggression against our country” would be considered hostile targets, vowing that no attacks would go unpunished. US military analysts claimed that the weapons seized are of the same type as those deployed by the Houthis to attack international ships in the area. Despite supporting the Houthi campaign rhetorically, Iran hasstaunchly deniedWashington’s allegations that it is providing the Yemeni rebel group with weapons and tactical intelligence. The statement described the haul as “the first seizure of lethal, Iranian-supplied advanced conventional weapons (ACW) to the Houthis since the beginning of Houthi attacks against merchant ships in November 2023”. “This is yet another example of how Iran actively sows instability throughout the region in direct violation of UN Security Resolution 2216 and international law,” said CENTCOM Commander General Michael Erik Kurilla. He also noted that two Navy Seals previously reported lost at sea were directly involved in the operation that led to the seizure.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/16/us-military-claims-seizure-of-iranian-weapons-bound-for-yemens-houthis
Turkish air strikes target northern Iraq and Syria,"Attacks extend a surge in violence across Turkey’s southern border, as regional spillover of war in Gaza continues.","Turkey’s military has carried out air raids against Kurdish fighters in northern Iraq and Syria. The overnight air raids destroyed 23 targets, the Turkish Ministry of National Defence said on Tuesday. The operation extends a recent escalation in violence across Turkey’s southern border, as regional tension continues to rise amid Israel’s bombardment of Gaza. The upswing in the conflict began on Friday when nine Turkish soldiers were killed in clashes with Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) fighters in northern Iraq. Ankara responded withair attacksand military operations in the area, as well as in northern Syria. The latest air raids were carried out on Monday at 10pm (19:00 GMT) in the Metina, Gara, Hakurk and Qandil regions of northern Iraq, close to the city of Erbil, as well as in northern Syria. The action will ensure border security and prevent attacks, the ministry said. “Twenty-three targets were destroyed, including caves, shelters, tunnels, ammunition warehouses, supply materials and facilities used by the terrorist organisation,” the ministry said in a statement on social media platform X. Many fighters were “neutralised”, the post claimed – a term commonly used to mean killed or captured. The ministry also shared a video that it said showed footage from the operation. The PKK, designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union, took up arms against the Turkish state in 1984. More than 40,000 people have been killed in the violence. Turkish forces regularly strike PKK fighters based in the mountains of northern Iraq. Syrian state media and other sources said on Monday that Turkey had carried out a wave of air attacks on electricity and oil infrastructure in Syria’s Kurdish-held northeast, putting several power stations out of service. Turkey has carried out a series of military incursions and bombing campaigns in Syria against the Kurdish People’s Defence Units (YPG), which it regards as a wing of the PKK. The tension spilling over from the war in Gaza is provoking increasing levels of violence across the region, and northern Iraq and Syria is one hotspot. Iran alsolaunched missilesat armed groups in Erbil, the capital of Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdish region, late on Monday, as well as the Syrian city of Aleppo. A statement claimed that the strikes had targeted “anti-Iranian terrorist groups” and the headquarters of Israeli spy agency Mossad in Erbil.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/16/turkey-launches-air-raids-against-fighters-in-iraq-syria
Iran launches missile strikes in Iraq and Syria citing security threats,"IRGC says it fired ballistic missiles at Israeli ‘espionage centres’ in Erbil in north Iraq, hitting ISIL targets in Syria.","Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) launched ballistic missiles at what it claimed were Israeli “spy headquarters” in Iraq’s Kurdish region and hit targets allegedly linked to ISIL (ISIS) in northern Syria, saying it was defending its security and countering terrorism. At least eight explosions were heard in Erbil, the capital of Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdish region, early on Tuesday. Four people were killed and six were wounded, the regional security council said. “Ballistic missiles were used to destroy espionage centres and gatherings of anti-Iranian terrorist groups in the region,” the IRGC said, adding that it fired 11 missiles, state media reported. The Iraqi government condemned what it called Iran’s “aggression” on Erbil that led to civilian casualties in residential areas, calling it a violation of the country’s sovereignty and the security of its people, according to a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The government said it would consider various actions, including filing a complaint at the United Nations Security Council. The IRGC claimed that it had hit the headquarters of Israeli spy agency Mossad in Erbil, Iran’s IRNA news agency reported. “We assure our nation that the Guards’ offensive operations will continue until avenging the last drops of martyrs’ blood,” it said. Masrour Barzani, prime minister of the Kurdish region, condemned the attack on Erbil as a “crime against the Kurdish people”. The Kurdish regional government said it shot down three bomb-laden drones at 5:05am (02:05 GMT) that were targeting a United States-led coalition base in Erbil, near the city’s international airport, from where air traffic was briefly diverted.    Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said Tehran respected the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other countries, but was using its “legitimate and legal right to deter national security threats”. Iraq recalled its ambassador from Tehran for consultations and summoned Iran’s charge d’affaires in Baghdad over the attacks, which were condemned by the US. Multimillionaire Kurdish businessman Peshraw Dizayee and several members of his family were among the civilian casualties, killed when at least one rocket crashed into their home. Dizayee, who was close to the ruling Barzani clan, owned businesses behind major real estate and security projects in the Kurdish region. US Department of State spokesperson Matthew Miller described the missile attacks as “reckless”, adding that they “undermine Iraq’s stability”. We strongly condemn Iran’s attacks in Erbil and offer condolences to the families of the victims. We oppose Iran’s reckless missile strikes and support the Government of Iraq and the Kurdistan Regional Government’s efforts to meet the aspirations of the Iraqi people. — Matthew Miller (@StateDeptSpox)January 16, 2024  “We support the Government of Iraq and the Kurdistan Regional Government’s efforts to meet the aspirations of the Iraqi people,” he posted on X, earlier known as Twitter. Two US officials told the Reuters news agency that the attacks did not affect any of their facilities and there were no US casualties. A US defence official told The Associated Press news agency that the US has tracked the missiles, both in northern Iraq and northern Syria, and called them “imprecise”. British Foreign Minister David Cameron condemned the strikes as “unprovoked and unjustified actions” and “are an unacceptable violation of Iraq’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”. The UK condemns the Iranian regime’s attacks in Erbil last night. These unprovoked and unjustified actions are an unacceptable violation of Iraq’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Our thoughts are with the families of the victims. — David Cameron (@David_Cameron)January 16, 2024  Last week, the US and Britain launchedmilitary strikes in Yemenin response to attacks by the Iran-aligned Houthi rebels on shipping in the Red Sea, which Tehran slammed as a “violation of Yemen’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and a breach of international laws”. The attacks come amid heightened fears that Israel’scontinued military offensivein the Gaza Strip could lead to a wider regional escalation. Since the Gaza war began in October, US and allied forces have faceddozens of attacksin Iraq and Syria, which US President Joe Biden’s administration has blamed on Iran-affiliated armed groups. Sina Azodi, an adjunct professor at George Washington University, said while the strikes are significant, they do not signal a new regional escalation. “As long as the conflict in Gaza continues, we will see actions,” Azodi told Al Jazeera. “My main concern is, one of these attacks, there could be casualties, US casualties, which would force the United States to respond and then it could escalate without anyone actually wanting war,” he added. The IRGC also said it launched missile attacks against the “perpetrators of terrorist operations in the Islamic Republic, particularly ISIL”, in Syria, state media reported. It claimed to have launched four Kheibar missiles at ISIL positions in Idlib. “The Guards identified and destroyed gathering places of their commanders and key elements with a series of ballistic missiles in response to the recent terrorist atrocities in Iran,” the statement said. Mounir al-Mustafa, deputy director of Syria Civil Defence, also known as the White Helmets, in northwest Syria, told The AP that one of the strikes in Idlib hit a medical clinic that was no longer operating. Earlier, ISIL claimed responsibility for the January 3twin bombingsin Iran’s southeastern city of Kerman, which killed nearly 100 people. Al Jazeera’s Ali Hashem reported that “Iran has been trying, as much as possible, to distance itself from any kind of tension” in the region amidIsrael’s war in Gaza, which has killed more than 24,000 Palestinians. About 1,140 people were also killed in Israel in the preceding Hamas attacks. “This is the first time we’re seeing the Iranians going a step further,” said Hashem, describing the assaults as a “new escalation”. Mohammad Marandi, a Tehran-based political analyst and university professor, said everyone appears to be concerned about “an escalation” in the Middle East except for Israel and its ally US, which has refused to support a ceasefire in Gaza. “I think the strikes the Iranians carried out are both to target Mossad offices and terrorist organisations, but also to send a message to Israelis and Americans that this escalation will hurt them more than anyone else,” he told Al Jazeera.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/15/irans-revolutionary-guard-attack-anti-iranian-groups-in-iraqs-erbil
Israeli forces kill three Palestinians in occupied West Bank,"Two people killed in Dura near Hebron, and one person killed near Tulkarem, according to Palestinian Health Ministry.","At least three Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian Ministry of Health says. Two Palestinians were shot on Monday during confrontations with the Israeli military in the town of Dura near Hebron in the southern West Bank, the official Palestinian news agency, Wafa, reported. Mohammed Hasan Abu Sabaa, 22, died after he was shot in the heart by Israeli forces, the ministry said. Ahed Mahmoud Mohammed, 23, died after she was shot in the head, the director of Dura Governmental Hospital told Wafa. Ten other people were transported to the hospital with gunshot wounds, the Health Ministry said. The Israeli military said its forces opened fire at a group of about 100 Palestinians taking part in a protest during which bricks and firebombs were thrown at soldiers. The military said the man who was shot had thrown a firebomb, but it did not provide evidence for the allegation. In a separate incident, Fares Khalifa, 37, was fatally shot by Israeli forces near Tulkarem in the northern West Bank, according to the Health Ministry. Since the war in the besieged Gaza Strip began on October 7, the West Bank has experienced surging violence and attacks by Israeli forces not seen since the second Intifada from 2000 to 2005. According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Israeli forces have killed 30 Palestinians, including seven children, in the West Bank in the first 15 days of the year. Last year, 507 Palestinians were killed, the highest annual death toll since OCHA started recording casualties in 2005.    Separately, Israel arrested students at a university in the occupied West Bank during an early morning raid. The students attend An-Najah National University in Nablus, which called for their immediate release, describing the army raid as “blatant Israeli aggression”. The university and the Palestinian Prisoners Club, an advocacy group, said 25 students were arrested in the raid. The Israeli army said security forces arrested “nine wanted persons associated with a Hamas student cell”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/15/israeli-forces-kill-three-palestinians-in-occupied-west-bank-3
Hamas claims two Israeli captives killed in Gaza air strikes,Israeli military spokesman rejects Hamas claim that the two hostages were killed by Israeli bombing.,"The armed wing of the Palestinian group Hamas has released a video purporting to show the dead bodies of two Israeli captives it claims were killed in Israeli air strikes on Gaza. The video, released by the Qassam Brigades on Monday, shows three Israeli captives speaking to the camera, likely under duress. In the first part of the unverified video, a female captive identified by Israeli media as Noa Argamani, 26, and two male captives urge Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to end the assault on Gaza, according to a translation provided by the armed group. In the second part, Argamani said that the two men captives were killed “because of our own [Israeli] air strikes”. The video ends purporting to show the dead bodies of the two captives. It was not clear when the video was taken. In a statement released with the video, the Qassam Brigades said the two men were killed in “the Zionist army’s bombing”. Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari identified hostage Itay Svirsky as one of the men in the latest Hamas video, but did not give the name or other details about the second person as per the family’s request. “Itay was not shot by our forces. That is a Hamas lie. The building in which they were held was not a target and it was not attacked by our forces.” “We don’t attack a place if we know there may be hostages inside,” he said Hamas had previously released another video on Sunday showing the three captives alive. The Palestinian group seized around 240 people as captives when it attacked southern Israel on October 7, killing 1,139 people, according to Israeli authorities. Israel responded to the attack with a devastating bombardment and ground invasion of Gaza in which more than 24,100 people have been killed, according to Palestinian authorities. Later on Monday, Israel’s Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Hamas was attempting to apply “psychological pressure” to the families of the hostages by releasing the videos. The Israeli army was helping the families, he told a news conference, and keeping them up to date with any developments. “Hamas has been hit hard by the [military],” he said. “What’s left for it is to touch a sensitive nerve in Israeli society through acts of psychological abuse against the family members.” Ruling out a ceasefire in Gaza, Gallant reiterated that the only way to get the captives back home is by continuing to apply “military pressure”. Otherwise, he said, “nobody will talk to us” and we “will not succeed in reaching any agreements”. Gideon Levy, a columnist for Haaretz newspaper, told Al Jazeera that the video was “quite shocking”. “I understand the ideological warfare, but there should be some borders,” he said. “To play [a video] yesterday of them alive and today [a video showing] the opposite … there should be some borders that even Hamas should not cross. Nothing good will come out of it.” The Hamas video comes a day after thousands of people demonstrated in Tel Aviv’s Hostage Square to mark 100 days since the captives were seized. Relatives of those still held in Gaza have repeatedly called on the government to prioritise their release and to push for a temporary ceasefire. More than 100 captives were freed during a week-long truce in late November following lengthy negotiations mediated by Qatar and the United States. In exchange, Israel released hundreds of Palestinian prisoners from jails.   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/15/hamas-claims-two-israeli-captives-killed-in-gaza-air-strikes
"Yemen’s Houthis hit US-owned ship in missile attack, US military says","US military says the container ship was hit off the coast of Yemen, but continued its journey.","Houthi rebels in Yemen have struck a US-owned and operated container ship with an anti-ship ballistic missile off the coast of Yemen, the United States Central Command said. In a statement on Monday, the US military said that no injuries or significant damage were reported and that the Marshall Islands-flagged Gibraltar Eagle was continuing its journey after the incident in the Gulf of Aden. The Yemeni rebel group has claimed responsibility for the attack. “All American and British ships and warships involved in the aggression against our country are considered hostile targets,” military spokesperson Yahya Saree said. He said that no future US or British attack on Yemen would go “unpunished”. Earlier, the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) agency said that a vessel was hit from above by a missile 95 nautical miles southeast of Aden, without identifying the vessel. British Maritime Security firm Ambrey said three missiles were reportedly launched by the Houthis, with two not reaching the sea and the third striking the bulk carrier. It said that the impact reportedly caused a fire in a hold, but that the bulker remained seaworthy with no injuries on board. It assessed the vessel was not Israel-affiliated. The attack on the ship comes less than a day after the Houthis launched an anti-ship cruise missile toward a US destroyer in the Red Sea, US officials said. The Houthis control western Yemen, including the strategically critical Bab al-Mandeb Strait, which leads into the Red Sea and up to the Suez Canal. Since Israel’s war in Gaza began, they have been attacking ships in the area that they say are linked to Israel or bound for Israeli ports. They say they are attacking the vessels to pressure Israel to halt its assault on Gaza and ease restrictions on supplies of humanitarian aid for its Palestinian population. Israel has been at war with Hamas, the group that governs Gaza, for more than three months. US and British forcesrespondedto the Houthi attacks last week by carrying out dozens of air and sea strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. Abdel-Malik al-Houthi, the leader of the Houthis, has pledged revenge. On Thursday, hesaidthat “any attack on Yemen’s Houthis on the part of the United States will not go without a response.” Reporting from Washington, DC, Al Jazeera’s Mike Hanna said that US officials believe that after the strikes last week, the Houthis retained about three-quarters of their capacity to fire missiles and launch drones. “This recent attack on a US-owned freighter was launched, it would appear, from the city of Hodeidah, which was a target of US-UK strikes in recent days,” Hanna said. “So, the ante is rising in terms of what is happening … the situation is very dire and something that US intelligence is watching very closely.” Omar Rahman, a fellow with the Middle East Council on Global Affairs, said one-off strikes targeting Houthi installations would not reduce the group’s capability or deter them from attacking ships in the Red Sea. “What the US and UK are doing is not strategically justifiable. It’s only justifiable if you look at what the Houthis are doing in the Red Sea in isolation from what’s happening in Gaza and in the rest of the region,” he told Al Jazeera. “The US and UK are ignoring the source of the crisis, which is the genocide in Gaza, but they’re also enabling it,” Rahman said. “They’re trying to prevent a wider regional escalation by taking military action against the flashpoints that are occurring as a result of what’s happening in Gaza.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/15/yemens-houthis-hit-us-owned-ship-in-missile-attack-us-military-says
"At least one killed, 17 wounded in alleged car-ramming attacks in Israel",Police say two suspects from Hebron arrested after attacks in Raanana near Tel Aviv.,"At least one person has been killed and 17 wounded in car-ramming attacks in central Israel, according to police and medical officials. Israeli police said two Palestinian suspects from the occupied West Bank were arrested in connection with Monday’s attacks in the city of Raanana north of Tel Aviv. “Both suspects, Hebron residents, who entered Israel illegally, are in police custody,” the police said on X. In an earlier statement, police said two suspects stole vehicles and ran over a number of residents in different locations. “A wounded woman who arrived in a critical condition after having been hit by a vehicle has died of her injuries despite our efforts to save her,” said a statement from Meir Medical Center near the site of the assaults. At least 17 other people were being treated for injuries, including two seriously, medics from the Magen David Adom emergency service said. Central district police chief Avi Biton told reporters in Raanana that the two “went out together and in parallel, to two different locations, took two cars and launched a series of rammings”. Israeli TV showed scattered personal items on a pavement and said several children were among the injured. Israeli media named the two suspects as Ahmed Zidat, 25, and Mahmoud Zidad, 44, both residents of the southern occupied West Bank town of Bani Naim, close to Hebron.    A family member of the suspects confirmed the two are related and told Al Jazeera they used to work in Israel before their work permits were revoked. Israeli authorities banned all Palestinian workers from the occupied West Bank from entering the country after the October 7 attack. The pair have since managed to re-enter Israel irregularly, the relative said. “They now expect their houses to be demolished, a routine practice here in the occupied West Bank,” said Al Jazeera’s Hoda Abdel-Hamid. “But they also expect some form of collective punishment such as the whole village being sealed off and isolated for some time,” she added. Pressure has been ramping up in Israel and across the occupied West Bank since October 7, when Hamas fighters launched an unprecedented assault into southern Israel and killed nearly 1,200 people and took about 240 captives. The attacktriggered a brutal response from Israelwhich vowed to root out the armed group from the Gaza Strip in a military campaign that has killed more than 24,000 people. Since then, violence has surged across the occupied West Bank where Israeli forces have conducted near-daily raids. This resulted in the killing of more than 300 people across the occupied Palestinian territories by Israeli forces and settlers, according to UN data.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/15/at-least-one-killed-17-wounded-in-alleged-car-ramming-attacks-in-israel
Are the Houthi Red Sea interceptions going to bring about a regional war?,Analysts tell Al Jazeera the Houthis are not likely to back down and the impacts on the region will be felt widely.,"Beirut, Lebanon– Yemen’s Houthis hit a US-owned ship on Monday, a day after attacking a US navy destroyer in the Red Sea, indicating that the group will not be deterred by recent air attacks on Yemen by the United States and United Kingdom. Not only have the Houthis seen a spike in popularity domestically, but they also have found solidarity among the so-called axis of resistance of Iran-supported groups in the region. They were already incensed by Israel’s war on Gaza, which has killed more than 24,000 people, most of them civilians. And as the war on Gaza continues, so does the possibility of a confluence of confrontations, experts told Al Jazeera. “Yemen is now becoming a participant in the regional escalation related to the war in Gaza,” said Raiman al-Hamdani, researcher at the ARK Group, a Dubai-based social enterprise that offers strategic management services. The Houthis control parts of western Yemen, including the strategically valuable Bab al-Mandeb Strait, which leads into the Red Sea and up to the Suez Canal. They say they are intercepting Israel-bound and Israeli-owned ships passing through Bab al-Mandeb to pressure Israel to cease fire in Gaza or at least allow sufficient humanitarian aid in. But they now seem to have expanded operations after hitting the US ship sailing in the Gulf of Aden, which is at least their second attack on a vessel in the body of water off Yemen’s southern coast. So far, the Houthi interceptions have not caused any casualties in the Red Sea. But that could change if a direct hit on US or British soldiers happens. “In such a scenario, retaliation in Yemen would take a much more aggressive approach,” al-Hamdani said. And that could further inflame tensions regionally. As the war has ground on, Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and Syria have targeted US bases with the US responding by assassinating Mushtaq Talib al-Saidi, aka Abu Taqwa, the leader of Harakat al-Nujaba, an Iranian-backed militia in Baghdad. Lebanese armed group Hezbollah has traded drone and rocket attacks with Israel. “We’re in the middle of an escalation loop,” Yemen researcher Nicholas Brumfield said. “It’s hard not to see wider regional escalation.” The administration of US President Joe Biden has repeatedly said it is trying to avoid an escalation in regional tensions. Still, critics say his words ring hollow as he has twicebypassed the US Congressto send weapons to Israel rather than condition aid or take steps that might encourage a ceasefire. “If the US and the UK respond to continued Houthi escalation with more air strikes on Yemen, then this will impact regional security, including in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates,” Hannah Porter, a Yemen researcher, told Al Jazeera.. “Although these countries do not want to return to military engagement with the Houthis, ongoing escalation could change that calculus.” Saudi Arabia has been working to solidify a ceasefire with the Houthis to end Yemen’s war, which has dragged on for the past decade, as Riyadh seems committed to avoiding a restart of past Houthi attacks that disrupted its oil output. But the exchange of attacks in the Red Sea could derail the peace process. “The Houthis are playing with fire, and one wrong move could have severe consequences,” al-Hamdani said. “However, it seems unlikely as both the Houthis and the Saudis as well as the US and the UK desire an end to the state of war they find themselves in.” While the Houthis have yet to cause any casualties, their actions have disrupted global shipping through the Red Sea, prompting the US and UK to decide to attack Yemen. “The US and the UK felt like they had been backed into a corner and didn’t really have another option,” Porter said. “They’ve been issuing threats to the Houthis for some time now about their targeting of ships in the Red Sea, and those threats were starting to feel very redundant and very unsubstantiated.” On Wednesday, the Houthis fired 21 drones and missiles at the Red Sea, which US and UK naval forces repelled. The next day, US and UK forces bombed multiple sites in Yemen. The US said those attacks took out a quarter of theHouthis’ ability to target ships, but the group has not been deterred. If anything, the attacks may well intensify, according to Yemen analysts. “The Houthis have no intention of ceasing their attacks on the Red Sea,” Porter said. “We are likely to see further escalation by the Houthis and the same pattern of intercepted attacks and near-misses of military and civilian vessels.” The US and UK retaliation seems to have only emboldened the Houthis and bolstered their support as a rally of hundreds of thousands on Friday in the capital, Sanaa, showed. “This is the ‘Big Bad’ the Houthis have been rhetorically prepping to fight for 20 years,” Brumfield said. “’Death to Israel’ is on the [Houthis’] flag, but ‘Death to America’ is first.” The only casualties in these confrontations have actually been Houthis. On December 31, four Houthi vessels tried to commandeer a ship travelling through the Red Sea, and US helicopters attacked them, killing 10 fighters and sinking three boats. The Houthis have always been in the opposition in Yemen and spent most of their time in the spotlight fighting against Yemen’s government. They overthrew the internationally recognised president of Yemen, Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, in 2014 and have been fighting in Yemen’s war since then. Hadi had the support of Saudi Arabia, which led for a time an Arab coalition to fight the Houthis. A truce has been in place since April 2022 as talks progressed between the Houthis and Riyadh over a more permanent ceasefire. Currently, a split among Yemen analysts exists over whether the Houthis would like all hostilities to cease and if they would stop their Red Sea interceptions if a ceasefire is declared in Gaza. Many believe the Houthis would continue their operations while a few have pointed out that the Houthis abided by the last ceasefire in late November between Israel and Hamas. “The Houthis want this kind of military engagement because they are a group that functions well in wartime and they actually haven’t been tested during peacetime,” Porter said. “Their good governance capabilities are not great.” But while this may serve the Houthis’ domestic and regional goals, the population of Yemen will likely suffer. “Unfortunately for people living under their control in what is described as ‘the world’s biggest humanitarian disaster’, the consequences would be devastating,” al-Hamdani said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/15/are-the-houthi-red-sea-interceptions-going-to-bring-about-a-regional-war
Iran lodges hijab case against journalists day after temporary release,New proceedings are launched against the two journalists for posing without the mandatory hijab upon their release after more than a year in prison.,"Iran’s judiciary has opened a new case against two jailed female journalists for appearing without a hijab after their temporary release from prison, reports say. Niloofar Hamedi and Elaheh Mohammadi had the new case filed against them on Monday, a day after they were released on bail. The duo had been sentenced to 13  and 12 years in prison respectively for reporting on the death in custody ofKurdish-Iranian Mahsa Amini in 2022. Images of the two journalists smiling and holding hands outside the prison circulated on social media following their release. “After footage of the defendants without hijab was released online, a new case has been filed against them,” the judiciary’s Mizan news agency said on Sunday, referring to a video widely shared on social media showing the two journalists celebrating their release with family. The terms of the journalists’ release prohibit them from travelling abroad, the agency said. Amini died after she was held by the country’s morality police for allegedly violating the strict dress code, sparking months of anti-government protests. Hundreds of people, including dozens of security personnel, were killed in the unrest. In October, the judiciary said the duo had been found guilty of collaborating with the United States, conspiring against state security and spreading “propaganda” against Iran.    Also on Monday, Iran extended imprisonedNobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi’s sentence for an additional 15 months for allegedly spreading propaganda against Iran, her family said. According to an Instagram post by Mohammadi’s family, the new sentence was handed down on December 19. Mohammadi had refused to attend the court session, said the post. The verdict also stipulates that once Mohammadi ends her 30-month sentence, she will not be allowed to travel abroad, take membership in political and social groups or have a mobile phone for two years. The ruling also forbids her from being in the capital Tehran, meaning she will have to serve the new sentence in another province in Iran. Mohammadi is the 19th woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize and the second Iranian woman after human rights activist Shirin Ebadi in 2003. In November,Mohammadi went on a hunger strikeover being denied access to medical care and to protest the country’s mandatory headscarves for women.

UK’s alleged use of Cyprus bases to arm Israel and hit Yemen draw protests,Monitors and media reports claim Britain is supplying Israel’s army for its war in Gaza from military bases in Cyprus.,"Crowds of angry Cypriots gathered at a British air base on Sunday to protest against the alleged funnelling of weapons to Israel for its brutal war in Gaza. Akrotiri, near Limassol in southern Cyprus, is one of two military sites retained by the British military under the 1960 treaty that saw the island gain independence from colonial rule. “The demonstration against the British base at Akrotiri is being organised to condemn the transport of arms from the British bases to support the Israeli army’s military operations in the Gaza Strip,” said Charis Pashias, head of the Cyprus Peace Council. Since the latest escalation of the Israel-Palestine conflict began on October 7, locals have seen a “daily” increase in the number of flights from Akrotiri, Pashias said. The base is about 40 minutes flying time from Tel Aviv. People have also “become aware of the illegal presence of thousands of American soldiers now stationed in Akrotiri,” he added. Britain’s Ministry of Defence has released some information on RAF flights between Akrotiri and Israel but refuses to specify what is being transported and will not disclose details of US activity from Cyprus. Defence Minister Grant Shapps told parliament on December 5 that the UK would provide “only defensive materiel, or materiel that might help with the recovery of hostages” during the conflict. Israeli newspaper Haaretz has reported a spike in the delivery of equipment and arms to Akrotiri. Some 40 heavy-transport aircraft operated by the United States Air Force landed there in the first 24 days of the war from US and NATO depots in Europe, according to Haaretz. Another 20 heavy-lift planes from Britain’s Royal Air Force arrived at the base over the same period, the newspaper added. Declassified UK, a news website focused on British foreign policy, revealed in November that RAF transport aircraft flew daily from Akrotiri to Tel Aviv between October 13 and 26. Over the two months prior to October 7, Declassified UK found no record of British military flights from Akrotiri to Israel. Commenting on an A400M military transport plane operated by the RAF landing at Israel’s Nevatim airbase on December 4, Meral Hussein-Ece, a British Liberal Democrat peer of Turkish-Cypriot background, suggested the jet was “unlikely to be delivering humanitarian aid”. “It’s long overdue these British bases in Cyprus were handed back to the Cypriots,” she posted on social media. Ersin Tatar, who heads the ethnic Turkish administration that runs the northern third of the island, told Turkey’s state-run Anadolu news agency that the British “interfere in another country’s affairs by using these bases”. “Because of the bases they acquired in the past, the UK can conduct military operations in these regions as it pleases,” said Tatar. According to the Campaign Against Arms Trade, Israel uses F-35 jets to bomb Gaza. The aircraft is jointly produced by US, UK and other partners.    Other weaponry being used in the densely populated strip involving US and UK production are M270 rocket launchers and Paveway II guided missiles. Equipment ferried to and from Cyprus is frequently carried onboard C-17 Globemaster, A400 Atlas and C-130 Hercules military transport aircraft. The Globemaster is the logistics backbone of many Western militaries and can carry loads of up to 77 tonnes. It is capable of delivering Black Hawk helicopters and evenAbrams tanks. Social media posts from Israel’s army show weapons being delivered to the Nevatim airbase while Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion airport has received equipment including armoured vehicles. Meanwhile, there are also questions about the extent that the government of the Republic of Cyprus, which controls the island’s southern territory, is kept informed of how Akrotiri and Dhekelia, the British base housing a US-UK electronic intelligence station, are being used in the Gaza war. Armed Forces Minister James Heappey last month said Britain informs the Republic of Cyprus about flights to and from Akrotiri “where appropriate … although there is no formal requirement to do so”. Asked about Britain and the US supplying Israel from Akrotiri in November, Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides said: “There is no such information, our country cannot be used as a base for war operations.” However, as the UK’s “sovereign base areas” are technically outside Cyprus, his reply could be seen as not referring to them.    Kenny MacAskill, a British MP who has raised questions in parliament about Akrotiri’s alleged role in the Gaza war, said it was “disgraceful” that “both UK citizens and a sovereign state are denied information as to what is being done”. He added: “The use of RAF Akrotiri does seem to allow the UK to deny information and complicity by saying it’s the USA. Equally, the USA avoids disclosure by saying it’s UK territory.” Meanwhile, “it seems clear that supplies … are being transported to Israel … when war crimes are being perpetrated by that country”. In recent days, the base has also been used to launch fighter jets attacking Yemen, as it was previously in Iraq and Syria. “The British base has been used repeatedly to supply arms to Israel and now to bomb Yemen, a sovereign country,” Lindsey German, convenor for the Stop the War Coalition, said. Around 500 demonstrators carrying Palestinian and Republic of Cyprus flags marched to the gates of Akrotiri on Sunday. “Cyprus is neither a US-NATO nor a British aggressive launching pad,” Pashias said. “We the Cypriot people do not want our country to be involved in any way in the bloody massacre taking place in the Gaza Strip.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/15/uk-bases-in-cyprus-protests
Turkey frees Israeli footballer detained over Gaza war reference in match,"Turkish court releases player, pending trial, after he displayed bandage reading ‘100 days. 07/10’ while celebrating scoring a goal.","A Turkish court has released pending trial an Israeli footballer who was detained after displaying a message apparently marking 100 days since Hamas’s attack on Israel on October 7. Sagiv Jehezkel, 28, displayed a bandage on his wrist reading “100 days. 07/10” next to the Star of David after scoring a goal for Antalyaspor against Trabzonspor during a match on Sunday. Turkish authorities called the Antalyaspor club’s player for questioning after the incident and charged him with “openly inciting the public to hatred and hostility”, according to Turkish Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc. In a post on X, Tunc said Jehezkel had engaged in “an ugly gesture in support of the Israeli massacre in Gaza”. “We will continue to support the oppressed Palestinians,” he added, denouncing what he described as an ongoing “genocide” in Gaza.    NTV television reported that a private plane had been sent from Israel on Monday to pick up Jehezkel and his family so that they could return home. In testimony to the police, Jehezkel said he “did not intend to provoke anyone”. “I am not a pro-war person,” the private DHA news agency reported him as saying. Jehezkel, capped eight times by the Israeli national team, celebrated scoring a goal against Trabsonspor by displaying the message on the bandage, believed to be a reference to Israel’s 100 days of war in Gaza and the captives held by Hamas in the coastal enclave. On October 7, the Palestinian group launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing about 1,140 people and abducting 250 others, according to Israeli authorities. Since then, a brutal Israelimilitary campaignhas killed at least 24,100 Palestinians and wounded 60,834 others, while thousands of others remain trapped under the rubble.    Meanwhile, Antalyaspor said it had suspended Jehezkel, accusing him of having “acted against the values of our country”. The Turkish Football Federation (TFF) added: “We condemn the completely unacceptable behaviour of footballer Sagiv Jehezkel during the match between Antalyaspor and Trabzonspor played today (…) and find Antalyaspor’s decision to exclude the player from its team appropriate.” Jehezkel’s brief detention also sparked outrage in Israel. “Shame on you, Turkish government,” former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennet wrote on X. Since the start of the Israeli war on Gaza, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a longtime supporter of the Palestinian cause, has repeatedly described Israel as a “terrorist state” and Hamas as a “group of liberators”. In a separate incident, Istanbul’s top-flight side Basaksehir said it was launching a disciplinary investigation into another Israeli player, Eden Karzev, for reposting a social media message about the hostages, reading: “Bring Them Home Now”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/15/turkey-frees-israeli-footballer-detained-over-october-7-reference-in-match
"‘Baba, this isn’t camping’: On being displaced by Israel’s war on Gaza",A Palestinian man reflects on the pain of displacement in Gaza and trying to make it.,"Khan Younis, Gaza– To pick up a weak data signal for his phone, Hussein Owda had to stand a bit too close to a group of women and girls waiting in line for their turn to use the communal bathrooms. The wait for the bathrooms can take hours on some days, Owda tells Al Jazeera over messaging, but the reward is worth it. The media producer for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) had just returned to his agency’s training centre – where he and his family are sheltering – after spending a week in the Nasser Hospital ICU with his father, who had had a serious heart attack. “I had a horrible week,” Owda said. “You know the horrific situation we are living in and the collapse of health services. After a week at the hospital, I needed to shower and shave, and that became quite the mission. “I started in the morning and now it’s 3pm. I had to find the water, then light a fire to warm it, then wait my turn in line. But, you know what? It’s worth it. It’s one of those things that we weren’t grateful enough for before this war.” Owda and his family are living among the thousands of people who have fled to Khan Younis from the north and surrounding cities as Israeli aerial bombing and ground operations pushed them into an increasingly shrinking area. His daughter Lin is eight years old, his son Mahmoud is six, and his youngest is Zein, a little boy of 16 months. In the Khan Younis Training Centre, families are split up, with women, girls of all ages and younger children sleeping indoors as men and older boys sleep outside. “Life is pretty basic here,” Owda said. “We’re making wood fires so we can cook, sleeping out in the open, getting around on donkeys. It’s like we’ve gone back in time to a primitive way of life. “But in a primitive life, you would expect to have some privacy or even enough space to stretch out on the ground to sleep, but that’s not the case with this primitive life.” Owda spent nearly two months sleeping in his car, which, he noted wryly, happened to be missing all its windows. For most of those 58 days, he was fine. But once the rains started, he had to scramble to find enough large rubbish bags to cover the gaping sides of the car. Some moments in this displaced life frustrate him, like having to line up every time he or one of the children needs the bathrooms. “It’s kind of humiliating and frustrating, yes … but to the point where you may as well laugh about it because there is nothing else you can do.” For someone who lost his brand-new apartment on the day he and his family moved in, Owda is keeping in good spirits. “For the past eight years, I’ve poured my heart and soul into a dream – the dream of building my own apartment within my family’s building,” he said. “My wife and I joyously finalised the kitchen … and we welcomed … a fridge, oven, and washing machine.” But the family moved in on October 7, 2023, a Saturday. Before the day was out, bombs had fallen on their neighbourhood, al-Karama, and their new home was damaged. They ran to his in-laws’ home, hopeful that they would be safe there for a while. That was when Owda got his first tragic news: his best friend had been killed by an Israeli bombing, along with his entire family. By October 13, the family was on the move, heading south. One night as they were on the road, they settled in to sleep as best they could and Owda started talking to his eldest, his daughter Lin. Adopting a mock-serious voice, he asked her what she thought of the camping trip the family was on, and listened just as seriously as she responded adamantly that this was most definitely not camping. “Baba, this isn’t camping, absolutely not,” she said from her perch on a table where she and Mahmoud were sitting. as the constant hum of Israeli drones filled the night sky. “Look, there’s no nice forest around us, we don’t have a tent, we don’t have flashlights. This isn’t how it’s done. “We don’t have a campfire either to give us light or to toast marshmallows on,” she concluded as she lay her head down so her face was level with her father’s face and the phone he was holding to record their conversation so he could rewatch it. At the beginning of their displacement, Owda says, Lin, Mahmoud and Zein were terrified of the sounds of the bombs and the aircraft flying overhead, but now they don’t seem to react as much. “Actually, nobody really seems to react much, it’s all become normal, what we’re going through. Nobody can think about the future or even what they want to do tomorrow. We’re all in survival mode,” Owda said. “I used to cry easily,” he continued. “If I saw a sad child or any sort of touching moments, I would cry. But I have not shed a single tear since this war started. “We lost our house, I lost 11 members of my extended family, I live this humiliating life that is the furthest anyone could imagine from what ‘life’ should be. “But, I suppose if we want to see the glass half full, I should say that I’ve lost 20kg (44lb) with no special diet.” Owda’s job is to produce media stories for UNRWA, highlighting the plight of other displaced Palestinians and their suffering in light of the lack of safety, shelter, food, water and healthcare. As such, he is always talking to others, framing their lives and trying to capture everything they are going through in a few hundred words and some photos. And what he sees has scarred him deeply. “Look, I don’t have it so bad, you know,” he said. “I still get paid, we can manage. If my kids need fresh fruit, I can afford to pay the insane $30 per apple that is being demanded these days. “So many people around me who I am talking to have no money. The hunger and desperation here are deep and abject. Imagine someone who works for the government or as a day labourer. Imagine what kind of grinding futility they are living in.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/15/baba-this-isnt-camping-on-being-displaced-by-israels-war-on-gaza
‘Shame’: Palestine UN mission decries Blinken’s post ignoring Gaza killings,"In his social media post marking 100 days of Israeli war, US secretary of state makes no mention of Palestinian deaths.","Palestine’s mission to the United Nations has criticised US Secretary of State Antony Blinken for not mentioning some 24,000 Palestinians killed in the Gaza Strip in his post commemorating100 days of Israel’s war. “Shame on those who remain complicit and not call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Shame on them,” the mission said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, on Monday. Blinken’s social media post on Sunday night only referred to the captives taken by Hamas, saying the US has vowed to bring them back since “100 days of captivity in Gaza is far too long”. 100 days and not a single mention of the nearly 24,000 killed – 1/2 of which are children. Shame on those who remain complicit and not call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Shame on them@POTUS@SecBlinken@USUNhttps://t.co/kfsA1DrzZe — State of Palestine (@Palestine_UN)January 15, 2024  A total of 24,100 Palestinians – including more than 9,600 children – have been killed and about 61,000 injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since October 7, the day Hamas launched a surprise attack inside the Israeli territory. Israeli authorities say Hamas fighters killed 1,139 people that day and took more than 200 captives, of which about 132 remain in Gaza. On Sunday, a Reuters news agency report, quoting Israeli officials, said at least 25 of them have died in captivity. The other captives were exchanged during a weeklong truce in November.    Even theWhite House statementmarking the 100th day of the war on Gaza made no mention of Palestinian killings and displacement of residents. In the message, US President Joe Biden lamented the capture of the captives, stating that “for each of those 100 days, the hostages and their families have been at the forefront of my mind”. Biden hailed the US efforts to bring back the captives and laid blame on Hamas for failing to extend a deal to return more of them. Meanwhile, Israel’s relentless bombardment of Gaza continues with no signs of abating, as the humanitarian crisis in the besieged enclave deepens and threats of a regional spillover of the war loom. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the war will “continue until victory” but faces domestic pressure over bringing the captives back.

US says it shot down Houthi missile in first attack since strikes on Yemen,US military says no injuries or damage caused by anti-ship cruise missile fired towards USS Laboon.,"The United States military has shot down a missile fired at one of its vessels by Iran-backed Houthis, officials have said, in the first known attack on US forces by the rebel group since Washington began itslatest air strikes on Yemen. A US fighter aircraft shot down the anti-ship cruise missile after it was fired from a Houthi-controlled area of Yemen towards the USS Laboon in the Red Sea, the US Central Command (CENTCOM) said on Sunday. “The missile was shot down in vicinity of the coast of Hodeida by US fighter aircraft,” CENTCOM said. “There were no injuries or damage reported.” The attack is the first to be acknowledged by the US since Washington and its allies on Friday began launching air and cruise missile strikes on Yemen in response to Houthi attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea. The Houthis, which have yet to acknowledge the latest incident, have carried out repeated attacks on cargo ships that the group says are linked to Israel, in a show of support for Palestinians under Israeli bombardment in Gaza. At least 26 vessels have been attacked by the Houthis since they seized the Israeli-linked Galaxy Leader vessel in November. The attacks have forced some of the world’s largest shipping operators to redirect their vessels around the Cape of Good Hope on the southern tip of Africa, severely disrupting global trade. Traffic through the Red Sea, which normally facilitates the movement of $3bn-$9bn worth of cargo each day, has dropped by more than 40 percent since the start of the attacks. Earlier on Sunday, Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam accused the US of violating national sovereignty by flying aircraft close to Yemeni airspace and coastal areas, although it is not clear if the two incidents were linked.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/15/us-says-it-shot-down-houthi-missile-in-first-attack-since-strikes-on-yemen
Hezbollah says US strikes on Yemen’s Houthis harm maritime security,Hassan Nasrallah said security in the Red Sea and regional countries hinges on putting an end to Israel’s war on Gaza.,"The leader of the Lebanese group Hezbollah has said United States actions in the Red Sea will harm the security of all shipping as the area has now become a conflict zone. “The US should realise that the security of the Red Sea, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen are all hinged on one single thing: putting an end to the war in Gaza,” Hassan Nasrallah said in a televised speech on Sunday. “Rather than providing a remedy to the symptoms, they should treat the cause,” he added. Nasrallah was referring to a joint operation by US and United Kingdom air forces that launched a series of strikes against Yemen on Friday and Saturday, targeted at Houthi rebels who say they have been attacking ships linked to Israel during the war on Gaza. The strikes, which the US said targeted Houthi facilities, have furtherstoked fears of a regional spilloverof the war in Gaza. The Houthis have also promised to retaliate. The Houthi assaults against international shipping have disrupted global commerce and raised costs, which influenced Western countries to intervene. The rebels say their actions are in response to Israel’s war and have pledged to continue as long as bombardment of the Gaza Strip continues. Both the Houthis and Hezbollah are backed by Iran and also form part of the so-called “axis of resistance” to Israel. On Sunday, Nasrallah said the US was wrong if it thought the Houthis would stop confronting Israel in the Red Sea. “The more dangerous thing is what the Americans did in the Red Sea will harm the security of all maritime navigation, even the ships that are not going to Palestine, even the ships which are not Israeli, even the ships that have nothing to do with the matter,” he said, “because the sea has become a theatre of fighting, missiles, drones and warships.” The Lebanon-based group has so far refrained from entering the war. It has, however, kept high pressure on Israel by conducting nearly daily attacks along its southern border with its neighbour. While the exchanges of fire from both sides have largely remained confined to the border area, the risk of a major escalation remains. The first week of January saw tensions reaching new heights over such a risk after a seniorHamas leader was killedin a suburb of Beirut in a targeted attack widely attributed to Israel. This was followed by thekilling of at least three other Hezbollahmembers, including a senior commander. To add to the military pressure, the continued exchanges of fire have forced tens of thousands on both sides of the border to evacuate. More than 96,000 Israelis are now living in temporary accommodation, a condition that Hezbollah says it plays in its favour. “Our front is inflicting losses on the enemy in putting pressure on the displaced whose voices have grown louder,” Nasrallah said. “This is a key strategy for Hezbollah,” said Al Jazeera’s Imran Khan, reporting from  Ebel el-Saqi, in south Lebanon. “All those Israelis who have had to leave their homes in the north and can’t come back. [Nasrallah] wants them to rise up and start putting pressure on the Israeli government.”   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/14/hezbollah-says-us-strikes-on-yemens-houthis-harm-maritime-security
"Israel vows not to ‘stop’ as Gaza death toll nears 24,000 on day 100 of war","Massive destruction, displacement, hunger and loss in Gaza are ‘staining our shared humanity’, the United Nations says.","Onday 100of the war on Gaza, Israel’s relentless bombardment of the besieged Gaza Strip continues with no sign of easing, amid a growing humanitarian catastrophe and the looming threat of a regional spillover. At least 23,968 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, have been killed since the war began on October 7, after Hamas fighters carried out an assault on southern Israel that killed 1,139 there. Israel said about 240 people were also taken captive. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised to “continue [the war] until victory”, saying in a televised address late on Saturday that “it is possible and necessary”. “No one will stop us –not The Hague, not the Axis of Evil and no one else,” Netanyahu said, in reference to acasethat South Africa brought to the International Court of Justice seeking emergency measures to halt Israel’s war, and in reference to the Iran-aligned “axis of resistance” groups in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen. The war has been by far the bloodiest and most destructive episode of fighting in the decades-long conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. In early January, Gaza’s media office said Israel had dropped more than 65,000 tonnes of bombs on the territory. Analysis of satellite data cited by the Associated Press shows that about 33 percent of buildings in the whole Strip have been destroyed. The United Nations estimates that 1.9 million people, nearly 85 percent of the population, have been internally displaced, while more than 90 percent faceacute food insecurity. “The massive destruction, displacement, hunger and loss of last 100 days are staining our shared humanity,” the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) said on Sunday. “The humanitarian operation has become one of the most complex & challenging in the world,” it added in a post on the social media platform X. Palestine’s foreign ministry said that in 100 days, “the Israeli occupation has turned Gaza into an uninhabitable place, committed horrific crimes”. It added that “the international community was “again failing” to implement international resolutions related to the Palestinian cause.    Israeli authorities have set two main goals to claim victory: the destruction of Hamas and its capacity to rule Gaza, and the return of all captives, about 136 of whom still remain in Gaza. Last week, the Israeli army said it was scaling down its operation in northern Gaza after havingdismantled Hamas’s “military framework”there. It has also signalled it was shifting to a lower-intensity phase of the war. Yet questions remain on how the military will conduct more targeted operations in the south after Israel forced more than a million people to evacuate there from the north. Regarding the stated goal of bringing all captives back home, little progress has been made since a fragile truce in early December allowed the return of about 105 people. The issue is a thorny one within Israel, with relatives of those held inside Gazapressuring the war cabinetto do more for their release. Tens of thousands of people in Tel Aviv marked “100 days of hell” at rallies in Hostage Square on Saturday and Sunday. Families and supporters of the captives gathered to demand the release of the hostages. “The families are absolutely desperate,” said Al Jazeera’s Sara Khairat, reporting from Tel Aviv. “They went from uniting here at the rallies every single Saturday, where tens of thousands of people have been showing up. Now the kind of rhetoric they’re using is ‘enough is enough’.” On Sunday, a spokesman for Hamas’s armed wing meanwhile said the fate of many Israeli hostages has become unknown. In a televised address, Abu Ubaida said many of the hostages “may have been killed”, blaming their fate on Israel. As Israel bombards Gaza, it has also upped its raids and arrests on the occupied West Bank. Tensions are also high with regional neighbours. The Lebanese group Hezbollah and the Israeli army have been engaged in near-daily exchanges of fire along Israel’s northern frontier with Lebanon. Thekilling of a Hamas senior leaderin an alleged Israeli strike on Beirut also raised concerns about a wider conflict. Meanwhile, from Yemen, Houthi rebels have started targeting international ships linked to Israel on the Red Sea – one of the most important routes for global commerce – promising not to stop until the war does. In response to Houthi aggression, the United States and the United Kingdomhave launched major strikes on Yemen’s soil. Meanwhile, as the war drags on, there is little clarity on Israel’s vision for post-war Gaza. The US has repeatedly insisted that it wants thePalestinian Authorityto reform and then govern the Strip. But the body that rules parts of the occupied West Bank enjoys little support among Palestinians.

"Al Jazeera’s Samer Abudaqa was ‘targeted’, left to bleed by Israel: Report","The cameraman died despite aid organisations and journalists applying pressure to get him rescued, The Intercept found.","Samer Abudaqa, Al Jazeera’s cameraman who was killed on December 15 in an Israeli air strike in Gaza, died despite an extensive network of humanitarian organisations and fellow journalists applying pressure on Israel to help rescue him,The Intercepthas reported. Abudaqawas left to bleed to death at the Farhana school in Khan Younis, where the air strike hit, as emergency workers were blocked by the Israeli military from reaching the site despite multiple contacts writing to the military for approval, according to the report published on Friday. “The Israeli military were well aware that an Al Jazeera journalist was lying helpless, The Intercept’s reporting shows, yet it did not allow emergency teams to safely pass for nearly four hours and did not send a bulldozer for over an hour after that,” the report said. “Much of the evidence points toward a targeted Israeli strike on the Al Jazeera journalists,” it also added. Abudaqa had been filming at the school earlier withAl Jazeera Gaza bureau chief Wael Dahdouh, who was also injured in the air strike. “I tried to get up in any way because I was sure that another missile would target us – from our experience that’s what usually happens,” Dahdouh told The Intercept.    The veteran journalist told the outlet that once he realised his arm was bleeding profusely, he knew he needed medical attention, and stumbled to an ambulance hundreds of metres away. He was then taken to a nearby hospital. Abudaqa, however, was injured in the lower half of his body and could not walk to the ambulance. “I couldn’t offer him anything,” Dahdouh told The Intercept, recalling the incident, saying that once he reached the ambulance, he told emergency workers to go and rescue his cameraman. The crew said they would first take Dahdouh to the hospital and send another ambulance to Abudaqa. Yet, for hours, emergency workers were unable to reach the bleeding cameraman without approval from the Israeli military, with Israeli forces even firing in their proximity as the workers tried to get close. Orly Halpern, a freelance reporter and producer based in Jerusalem, decided to share Abudaqa’s ordeal on a WhatsApp group with more than 140 journalists from the Foreign Press Association, a Jerusalem-based non-profit representing reporters from more than 30 countries, The Intercept reported. Members of the group shared contacts of the Israeli military among one another, as they attempted to let the military know that Abudaqa needed medical help. The journalists were trying to get a response from the army, just as various humanitarian organisations, from the Palestinian Red Crescent to the International Committee of the Red Cross, were doing the same. “I thought that if many journalists contacted the army, along with the Foreign Press Association, then the army might be more pressed to act, particularly knowing that we were aware of the situation and that we would report on it,” Halpern told The Intercept.    “I believe there is power in numbers,” she said. By the evening, Halpern updated the group to share that the Israeli military had approved a Palestinian bulldozer to come through. But once the bulldozer cleared the path to reach Abudaqa, he was dead. About five hours had passed since he was injured in the strike. Since Abudaqa’s death, Al Jazeera has been preparing alegal file to the International Criminal Court(ICC) over what the network says was an “assassination” of its journalist. Dahdouh, meanwhile, continues to hold steadfast in his reporting despite losing his colleague as well as his wife, two sons, daughter and grandsonin other Israeli air raidssince October 7. “The targeting and destruction of offices, like Al Jazeera’s offices; the targeting of Palestinian families, such as is the case with my family; and the targeting of homes, like my home that was destroyed and where there are no houses around it in the first place, so they know they are targeting the house of the head of Al Jazeera,” the bureau chief told The Intercept. “It is clear that this is all happening in the context of pressure and punishment of Palestinian journalists by the Israeli military.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/14/al-jazeeras-samer-abudaqa-was-targeted-left-to-bleed-by-israel-report

Namibia condemns Germany for defending Israel in ICJ genocide case,The Namibia presidency slams Germany for failing to draw lessons from its own genocide against Namibian people in the early 20th century.,"Namibia has criticised Germany’s “shocking decision” to support Israel in the genocide case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) brought by South Africa, as Israel’s war on Gaza entered its 100th day. “Germany has chosen to defend in the ICJ the genocidal and gruesome acts of the Israeli government against innocent civilians in Gaza and the occupied Palestinian Territories,” the president of Namibia, Hage Geingob, said in a statement on X on Saturday. A two-day public hearing in the case at the World Court – the highest legal body of the United Nations – took place on Thursday and Friday during which South Africa and Israel presented their arguments. South Africatold the courton Thursday that Israel’s aerial and ground offensive – which has laid waste to much of the enclave and killed almost 24,000 people, according to Gaza health authorities – aimed to bring about “the destruction of the population” of Gaza. IsraelaccusedSouth Africa of presenting a “distorted” view of the hostilities, denying that its military operation in Gaza is a state-led genocide campaign against Palestinians. The statement by the Namibian presidency added that Berlin was ignoring Israel’s killing of more than 23,000 Palestinians in Gaza and various United Nations reports disturbingly highlighting the internal displacement of 85 percent of the besieged enclave’s 2.3 million people amid acute shortages of food and essential services. The Namibian president expressed “deep concern” over “the shocking decision” communicated by the government of Germany on Friday, in which “it rejected the morally upright indictment” brought forward by South Africa. “No peace-loving human being can ignore the carnage waged against Palestinians in Gaza,” it said. The statement claimed that Germany committed the first genocide of the 20th century in Namibia between 1904 and 1908, in which tens of thousands of innocent Namibians died in the most inhumane and brutal conditions. “Germany cannot morally express commitment to the United Nations Convention against genocide, including atonement for the genocide in Namibia, whilst supporting the equivalent of a holocaust and genocide in Gaza,” the presidency said. “President Geingob appeals to the German government to reconsider its untimely decision to intervene as a third-party in defence and support of the genocidal acts of Israel before the ICJ.”    German colonial forces carried out atrocities in Namibia against the Indigenous Herero and Nama peoples between 1904 and 1908. The killings were part of a German campaign of collective punishment between 1904 and 1908 that is today recognised as the 20th century’sfirst genocide. Henning Melber from Nordic Africa Institute in Sweden said that the statement issued by President Geingob was an unexpected turning point in the already fragile German-Namibian relations. “Germany publicly took side in the ICJ case with Israel on January 12, which marks 120 years of the beginning of what many Namibians call the German-Namibian war, which then resulted in the first genocide of the 20th century,” he said. “While Germany scored a lot of good points internationally in the way it engaged with the mass destruction of the Holocaust, it was in denial of the genocide committee [with Namibia] until 2015,” Melber said. He added that the German and Namibian governments have been in negotiations on the Namibian genocide for the past eight years. He said Germany still falls short of recognising the incidents in Namibia as a genocide in legal terms, which means it refuses the obligations to pay reparations. The ICJ is likely to present a provisional measure in the coming days but a final verdict will take years. South Africa has urged the court to order an immediate halt to Israel’s devastating military offensive in Gaza. The 1948 Genocide Convention, enacted in the wake of the mass murder of Jews in the Nazi Holocaust, definesgenocideas “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”. South Africa filed theICJ caseon December 19, accusing Israel of genocidal acts in Gaza. Several countries and international organisations have backed South Africa in its case, while Israel has received the backing of the United States, its main weapons supplier and close ally. Several global entities, including Human Rights Watch, have determined that Israel is engaging in war crimes in Gaza.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/14/namibia-condemns-germany-for-defending-israel-in-icj-genocide-case
A ‘cultural genocide’: Which of Gaza’s heritage sites have been destroyed?,Nearly 200 sites of historical importance have been destroyed or damaged in Israeli air raids on the Palestinian enclave in the past 100 days.,"Anancient harbourdating back to 800 BC, a mosque that was home to rare manuscripts and one of the world’s oldest Christian monasteries are just a few of at least 195 heritage sites that have been destroyed or damaged since Israel’s war on Gaza began on October 7, according to an NGO documenting war damage on cultural sites. Wiping out the cultural heritage of a people is one of the many war crimes South Africa alleges against Israelin a lawsuitthat was heard this past week at the International Court of Justice.It states: “Israel has damaged and destroyed numerous centres of Palestinian learning and culture”, including libraries, religious sites and places of ancient historical importance. Gaza, one of the world’s longest inhabited areas, has been home to a pastiche of people since at least the 15th century BC, according to historians. Empires – including the ancient Egyptians, Assyrians and Romans – have come and gone, at times dominating the land of the Canaanites, the ancestors of the Palestinians, leaving relics of their own cultural heritage behind. Greeks, Jews, Persians and Nabateans have also lived along this stretch of coast over the centuries. Strategically located on the Mediterranean’s eastern shores, Gaza was always in a prime position on the trade routes from Eurasia to Africa. Its ports made it a regional hub for commerce and culture. Since at least 1300 BC, the Via Maris – a route running from Heliopolis in ancient Egypt, cutting across Gaza’s western coastline and then crossing into Syrian lands – was the main route that travellers would take on their journeys to Damascus. “The crime of targeting and destroying archaeological sites should spur the world and UNESCO into action to preserve this great civilisational and cultural heritage,” Gaza’s Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities said after Gaza’s Great Omari Mosque was destroyed in an Israeli air strike on December 8. As a result of that particular strike, an ancient collection of manuscripts kept at the mosque may be forever lost. “The manuscript collections remained in the vicinity of the mosque and are currently inaccessible because of the continuing conflict,” Columba Stewart, the CEO of the Hill Museum and Manuscript Library (HMML), told Al Jazeera soon after the strike.  The 1954Hague Convention, agreed to by both Palestinians and Israelis, is supposed to safeguard landmarks from the ravages of war. Isber Sabrine, president of an international NGO that documents cultural heritage, explained that crimes affecting cultural heritage are part of the “collateral damage of genocide”. “Libraries serve as cultural repositories, and attacking them is an attack on cultural heritage. What is happening now is a war crime. It goes against the first Hague convention,” Sabrine said. “Israel is trying to erase the connection of the people with their land. It’s very clear and intentional. Gaza’s heritage is part of its people, it’s history and their connection.” While cultural genocide erases tangible heritage like museums, churches and mosques, intangible heritage includes customs, culture and artefacts. These, too, have been damaged, including the Union of Palestinian artists on Jalaa Street in Gaza City and the well-known clay pots once baked in the city’s al-Fawakhir district. In a statement to Al Jazeera, UNESCO said: “While priority is rightly given to the humanitarian situation, the protection of cultural heritage in all its forms must also be taken into account. In accordance with its mandate, UNESCO calls on all actors involved to strictly respect international law. Cultural property should not be targeted or used for military purposes, as it is considered to be civilian infrastructure.” Here’s a closer look at some of the sites that have been destroyed or damaged: There are four museums in Gaza, and two have been levelled, the International Council of Museums-Arab (ICOM-Arab) confirmed to Al Jazeera. The Rafah Museumhad completed a 30-year project to curate a collection of ancient coins, copper plates and jewellery, making it Gaza’s main museum of Palestinian heritage. It was an early victim in the war, destroyed in an air strike on October 11. Farther east and once sitting on a hilltop,Al Qarara Museum(also known as the Khan Younis Museum) was opened in 2016 by Mohamed and Najla Abu Lahia, a husband and wife team who said they wished to preserve a history of Gaza’s lands and heritage for generations to come. Its collection consisted of about 3,000 artefacts dating back to the Canaanites, the Bronze Age civilisation that lived in Gaza and across much of the Levant in the second century BC. All that remains of the museum now are shards of pottery and smashed glass that has been blown out of the widows during an October air strike. ICOM-Arab told Al Jazeera this museum was given advanced warning by Israeli forces to empty its contents and evacuate to the south of Gaza. The Mathaf al-Funduq, a small museum opened in 2008 and housed in the Mathaf Hotel in northern Gaza, was damaged by shelling on November 3. In Gaza City, the 13th-centuryQasr Al-Basha, or Pasha’s Palace,was turned into a museum in 2010 by the Palestinian Ministry of Tourism, and a collection of artefacts from different periods of Gaza’s history was on display. The site was hit by Israeli air strikes on December 11, damaging its walls, courtyard and gardens. Like many of the heritage sites in Gaza, this building has changed ownership and functions several times over its history. The two-storey fort, built by Mamluk ruler Sultan Zahir Baybars in the mid-13th century, was once a seat of power, constructed as a defence against the Crusaders and Mongol armies. During the 17th century, it was used by Ottoman rulers and once served as lodgings for the French commander Napoleon Bonaparte in 1799 when he entered Gaza to try to stave off an expected Ottoman invasion of Egypt, where the French held court. Before the 1948 Nakba, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians became refugees during the creation of Israel and many fled into Gaza, the palace served as a police station for the British, who controlled the area, and later, it became a Palestinian girls school. During aweek-long pausein the Israeli bombardment that began on November 24, Palestinians were able to briefly survey the extent of the damage to their homeland. It rapidly became clear that many public service buildings had been destroyed, including theRashad El Shawa Cultural Centerin Gaza City, once the venue for peace talks between PLO leader Yasser Arafat and US President Bill Clinton in the 1990s.Samir Mansour’s community bookshop, which waspainstakingly restoredafter the Israeli bombardment of 2021, was also badly damaged. The Library of the Great Omari Mosquein Gaza City was once filled with rare manuscripts, including old copies of the Quran, biographies of Prophet Muhammad and ancient books on philosophy, medicine and Sufi mysticism. The library, established by Sultan Zahir Baybars and opened in 1277, once boasted a collection of 20,000 books and manuscripts. Many of the rare books and manuscripts housed there were lost or destroyed during the Crusades and World War I, leaving only 62 books. These hard copies have now also been destroyed in astrikeon the Omari Mosque on December 8. A digitisation project of these books was completed last year by the Hill Museum and Manuscript Library and at the British Library and are accessible online atHMML Reading Room. Gaza’s Tourism and Antiquities Ministry estimated that as many as 104 mosques have been damaged or destroyed since the start of the Israeli assault. This includes theOthman bin Qashqar Mosquein Gaza City’s Zeitoun neighbourhood, which was built in 1220 at the site where Prophet Muhammad’s great-grandfather is believed to have been buried. It was badly damaged in an air strike on December 7. TheSayed al-Hashim Mosque,built sometime in the 12th century and rebuilt in 1850, was damaged in an October air strike. This mosque, built of sturdy limestone in the Old City of Gaza, is of great significance for Muslims because it’s said to house the tomb of another of Prophet Muhammed’s great-grandfathers, Hashim bin Abd Manaf. Local lore says he was a merchant travelling back to Mecca from Syria when he became ill, died and was buried in what is now Gaza’s Daraj neighbourhood. A brief interlude of Crusader dominance followed the mosque’s contruction before the Mamluks took over and rebuilt it. It would later be renovated under the watch of Ottoman Sultan Abdul Majid in 1850 and again after damage in 1917 during World War I. Early in the current war, the mosque caught fire during an Israeli air strike, which damaged its walls and ceilings. TheGreat Omari Mosquehas been a site of religious worship in one form or another for about two millennia. Known in Arabic as Al-Masjid al-Omari al-Kabir, it’s thought to be the first mosque built in the Gaza Strip 1,400 years ago. On December 8, it wasdestroyedin an Israeli air strike. Built out of local sandstone to accommodate as many as 5,000 worshippers for congregational prayers, all that remains is its Mamluk-era minaret, bent and broken. “This was more than just a mosque for the community,” Sabrine said. “One man told me he felt more sad about the destruction of the mosque than that of his own home.” Named after the second caliph of Islam, Omar bin Khattab, it was built in the seventh century on top of the ruins of an ancient church built in 406, which itself was built over the foundations of a pagan temple to the Canaanite fertility god, Dagon. Like many historical sites that outlive the people who built them, this one has different stories behind it. According to one account, Samson, an Israelite warrior mentioned in the Old Testament who was known to hold his strength in his hair, became buried under the rubble of the structure after he brought the walls of the pagan temple down upon himself. Others say the temple fell after the Byzantines burned down all pagan sites when they took over rule of Gaza from 390. Ayyubid conqueror Salah al-Din turned the building back into a mosque after the Crusaders had converted it to St John the Baptist Cathedral. The mosque had been used as a place of worship by the local Muslim community since 1291 and had served as a focal point for gatherings and cultural activities. In partnership with the British Library Endangered Archives Programme, HMML last yeardigitised a selectionof ancient, single copy books from the mosque’s library that are unavailable “anywhere else in the world”, an HMML adviser told Al Jazeera. Works included the 14th century Book of Sufi Poems of Ibn-Zokaa and books by famed Gazan jurists, including Sheikh Skaike. The December strike was not the first time the mosque had been hit. It was also struck on October 19 and was also damaged during World War I and again during the 2014 assault by Israel on Gaza. The floor of theByzantine Church of Jabalia, built in 444, was once decorated with colourful mosaics depicting animals, hunting scenes and palm trees. Its walls were adorned with 16 religious texts written in ancient Greek, which dated back to the era of Emperor Theodosius II, who ruled Byzantium from 408 to 450. The Palestinian Tourism and Antiquities Ministry reopened the church in early 2022 after a three-year restoration in collaboration with a French organisation, Premiere Urgence Internationale, and the British Council. At the time, the ministry’s Nariman Khella said: “The church was discovered during the paving of Salah al-Din Street, and the first thing that was discovered were two tombs, one for an old person and the other for a young child.” That same year, a farmer discovereda series of intricate mosaicsnearby. The state of the tombs and the nearby mosaics remains unclear. As for the historic church itself, it was destroyed in October by Israeli air strikes. TheMonastery of Saint Hilarionis in an area called Tell Umm Amer in Nuseirat village on the coast and dates back to about 340 during Roman rule of the region. A “tell”, is a flat-topped mound, or hill, often marking the position of an ancient city. To withdraw from worldly life and immerse himself in spiritual pursuits, Saint Hilarion, a Christian who is said to be the founder of monasticism, built a small and simple room for himself in what he thought was a secluded spot in today’s Deir el-Balah in the central Gaza Strip. Despite his desire for solitude, pilgrims sought him out in search of cures for ailments and spiritual guidance. Buildings around his simple room spread over the years, eventually becoming one of the largest monasteries in the Middle East. Within the 25-acre (10-hectare) monastery’s sanctuary, there would eventually be five churches, a burial site, a baptism hall and ancient baths. Mosaics and limestone decorated the floors and walls to welcome pilgrims travelling the Via Maris from Egypt to Damascus. Damaged in an earthquake in 614, the site lay abandoned until Palestinian archaeologists started excavations in the late 1990s. The site, which UNESCO added to its Tentative World Heritage list in 2012, has been damaged in the Israeli bombardments. The Greek OrthodoxChurch of Saint Porphyriushas been located in Zeitoun for 16 centuries. It was struck and damaged on October 19. Considered to be the third oldest church in the world, Saint Porphyrius was built in 425 on the foundations of an ancient pagan site and was named after the Byzantine saint who had made it his mission to close down the pagan temples. He is thought to have been buried on the grounds of the church. Like other significant sites, this church was turned into a mosque in the seventh century but reverted back to a church in the 1150s when Crusaders reclaimed it. Renovated in 1856, it has remained a place of worship for Gaza’sChristian communityto pray and seek shelter during times of conflict. In theOctober 19 Israeli bombing, 17 people were killed when the roof of the church caved in. The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem said targeting the church “constitutes a war crime”. The neighbouring Ottoman-styleKatib al-Wilaya Mosque, built in the 15th century, sustained damage in the same attack. TheHoly Family Church, built in 1974, is Gaza’s only Roman Catholic church and a shelter for the local community. It was hit in an air strike on November 4. A school in the church complex was partially destroyed. The Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem confirmed that shrapnel from Israeli military strikes on buildings near the Holy Family Church had destroyed water tanks and solar panels on the roof of the church. Ard-al-Moharbeen, or the Roman Necropolis, was unearthed last year by archaeologists from Palestine and France after construction workers building new homes discovered tombs at the site. At least 134 tombsdating from 200 BC to 200 AD with skeletons still intact were found in what is believed to be a Roman necropolis. Two intricately decorated lead sarcophagi were discovered, one with grape harvest motifs and the other featuring dolphins. Fadel Alatel, an archaeologist in Gaza and part of the Heritage for Peace network, was working on this excavation before October 7. He told Al Jazeera he was fearful of what may have happened to these rare tombs. “This is in the area where white phosphorous was dropped. Its damage to the site is unknown,” he said. “Also the winter weather and heavier rains may mean the rare discovery could be destroyed.” Alatel has worked to preserve Gaza’s heritage and archaeology through countless Israeli air strikes but said this time the situation is much worse and he has been unable to return to the site to survey the extent of the damage. Forensic Architecture (FA), an investigative journalism agency based at Goldsmiths, University of London, has been documenting the destruction of cultural heritage in Gaza in its investigationLiving Archaeology. On October 8, one day after the Hamas attacks on Israel that started the war, researchers at the agency using satellite technology found evidence of three large craters from Israeli rockets at the archaeological site. In a report, FA stated: “This disregard for and destruction of Palestinian cultural heritage both diminishes Palestinian claims to statehood and denies Palestinians their fundamental right to access and preserve their own heritage.” The fate of another ancient site, a harbour, is known. It has been destroyed. Located in the northwest corner of Gaza, the enclave’s first known seaport,Anthedon, also known as Balakhiyah or Tida, was inhabited from 800 BC to 1100 AD, or from the Mycenaean era to the early Byzantine age. It became an independent city during the Hellenistic period. After Roman temple ruins and mosaic floors were discovered on the 5-acre (2-hectare) archaeological site, it was placed by UNESCO on its Tentative World Heritage list in 2012. Other remains date back to the late Iron Age and the Persian, Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine periods. TheHammam al-Sammara, or Samaritan Bathhouse, was destroyed on December 8. It had pre-dated Islam and was likely established by the Samaritans, a religious sect of ethnic Jews who lived in the Zeitoun area, also known as the Jewish Quarter. The area had a thriving Jewish community until Crusader rule in the 12th century. The last Palestinian Jewish familylived in the neighbourhooduntil the 1960s. The only other piece of Jewish history in Gaza was the King David Mosaic, which dates to 508. It was discovered at the remains of a sixth century synagogue and depicted King David playing a harp. It was transferred to the Israel Museum in Jerusalem after Israel captured the Gaza Strip during the 1967 Six-Day War. At one time, Gaza City had 38 bathhouses. Many were lost during wars and occupation because there were a lack of resources to maintain them. The Hammam al-Sammara was the last one remaining. A sign once hung by its entrance stating it had been restored in 1320 by Mamluk ruler Sangar ibn Abdullah. The site was a popular meeting place for Gazans to socialise and seek cures for ailments under its traditional vaulted ceilings. With intricate, inlaid marble tiled floors the hammam was still heated using traditional wood-fired ovens and aqueducts. Located northeast of Nuseirat, the fortified city ofTell el-Ajjul, or Calves Hill, sits between the Mediterranean Sea and Wadi Gaza. It was established about 2000 to 1800 BC and has been damaged in the Israeli bombardment. British Egyptologist William Matthew Flinders Petrie discovered the site in the 1930s after he moved east into Palestine after excavating Giza’s Great Pyramid. Here he discovered gold jewellery and ancient coins used by the Hyksos, Romans and Byzantines. Most of his discoveries made between 1930 and 1934 when Gaza was under the British Mandate now reside at theBritish Museum’sInstitute of Archaeology in London. Other finds included imported pottery from Cyprus, bottles and scarabs, with many pieces dating as far back as the Bronze Age about 3,600 years ago. The artefacts also suggest Tell el-Ajjul was once a trading hub. The status of Gaza’s many other historic sites remains unknown. According to Alatel, it is difficult to keep up with the situation on the ground because it “changes every five minutes”. Local photographers have been unable to return to many sites to assess the damage because of the dangerous situation. These are a few of the sites whose condition is not yet known: Dating back to the 14th century, theKhan Younis caravanseraiwas built to serve the needs of people travelling along the Via Maris. Named after its Mamluk founder, Younis al-Nuruzi, the khanate, or khan, was a type of inn that was popular in the region from around the 10th century, offering a place for travellers to rest and take a break during their journeys. This caravanserai, built in 1387, has a mosque, a post office and storage rooms. During an archaeological excavation from 1972 to 1982, a collection of unique, human-shaped pottery coffins were discovered atDeir el-Balah Cemetery, dating back to the late Bronze Age (1550-1200 BC). Located in the Daraj neighbourhood, the Sufi mosque ofAhmadiyyah Zawiyawas established in 1336 by followers of Sheikh Ahmad al-Badawi, a well-known 12th century Sufi scholar who lived in Gaza. Sufi worshippers would gather there for collective prayers on Mondays and Thursdays. There has been shelling in the area, Alatel said, but it is as yet unknown what has become of the sacred site. “All our heritage sites are clearly marked, yet the Israeli military strikes, the tanks and the bulldozers continue,” the archaeologist said. “But I have faith all this will end. Even if they attempt to destroy our past, we will build back Gaza’s future.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/14/a-cultural-genocide-which-of-gazas-heritage-sites-have-been-destroyed
Turkey launches air attacks against Kurdish rebels in Iraq and Syria,Defence ministry says 29 locations hit after attack on Turkish military base in Iraq killed nine Turkish soldiers.,"Turkey has bombed multiple locations allegedly linked to Kurdish groups in Syria and northern Iraq in retaliation for the deaths of nine Turkish soldiers in Iraq, the defence ministry said. The raids on Saturday came one day after an attack on a Turkish military base in Iraq resulted in the soldiers’ deaths. The ministry said the attacks targeted 29 locations – including “caves, bunkers, shelters and oil installations” belonging to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and the People’s Protection Units (YPG), a Syrian Kurdish group which has been a central element in the United States-allied coalition against ISIS (ISIL). Turkey frequentlycarries out attacksagainst locations in Syria and Iraq that it suspects to be associated with the PKK. The Kurdish separatist group, which is banned in Turkey, is considered a “terror” organisation by Turkey, the European Union and the United States.    The defence ministry said fighter jets struck targets in Metina, Hakurk, Gara and Qandil in northern Iraq, but did not specify which areas in Syria. It said the aim was “to eliminate terrorist attacks against our people and security forces … and to ensure our border security”. The statement said that “many” armed fighters were “neutralised” in the attacks, a term Turkey uses to refer to killed or captured fighters. On Friday night, attackers attempted to infiltrate a military base in northern Iraq’s semiautonomous Kurdish region, killing five soldiers. Another four died later of critical injuries. The ministry said 15 fighters were also killed. There was no immediate comment from the PKK, the government in Baghdad or the administration in the region. Turkey launched Operation Claw-Lock in northern Iraq in April 2022, during which it established several bases in the Duhok governorate. Iraq has repeatedly protested against the presence of Turkish troops and called for their withdrawal. “We will fight to the end against the PKK terrorist organisation within and outside our borders,” Turkey’s foreign minister Hakan Fidan posted on X. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was to hold a security meeting in Istanbul later on Saturday, said his communications director Fahrettin Altun. Also on Saturday, 113 people were arrested for suspected links with the PKK in nationwide raids, interior minister Ali Yerlikaya said on X. Three weeks ago, PKK-affiliated fighters tried to break intoa Turkish basein northern Iraq, according to Turkish officials, killing six soldiers. The following day, six more Turkish soldiers were killed in clashes. Turkey retaliated by launching attacks against sites that officials said were associated with the PKK in Iraq and Syria. Defence minister Yasar Guler said at the time that dozens of Kurdish fighters were killed in air strikes and land assaults. It was not immediately clear if Friday night’s attack and the one three weeks earlier targeted the same base. More than 40,000 people have been killed since the start of the conflict between the PKK – which maintains bases in northern Iraq – and the Turkish state since 1984. Turkey and the US, however, disagree on the status of the Syrian Kurdish groups.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/13/turkey-launches-airstrikes-against-kurdish-rebels-in-iraq-and-syria
Have the Houthi Red Sea attacks hurt Israel’s economy?,"Most of Israel’s trade is through the Mediterranean, unaffected so far. Still, longer-term risks for Israel’s economy are growing, say analysts.","Tensions in the Red Sea have extended to Yemeni land after the United States and the United Kingdom ledbombings against multiple sitescontrolled by the Houthi armed group on Thursday night. The Houthis have carried out dozens of attacks on commercial vessels that they say are linked to Israel, and that were passing through the 30km (20-mile) wideBab-el-Mandeb strait. They demand that Israel stop the bombardment of Gaza and allow humanitarian aid. A US-led coalition is trying to deter the Houthis by positioning destroyers and other military platforms in the Red Sea and by shooting down the Yemeni group’s missiles and drones. But the Houthis have been clear that they have no intentions of stopping until Israel ends its war, which has killed nearly 24,000 Palestinians. Traffic through the Red Sea is down by more than 40 percent disrupting global supply chains. Some of the world’s largest shipping operators have redirected their vessels around the Cape of Good Hope on the southern tip of Africa, delaying delivery times and adding a further 3,000-3,500 nautical miles (6,000km) to their route. But just how much have the Houthi attacks impacted Israel’s economy itself? And how are they affecting global trade? So far, at least 26 vessels have been attacked by Houthis since they seized the Israeli-linkedGalaxy Leader vesselin November. US warships in the region have thwarted several other attacks by the Houthis, with the latest being on Wednesday when the US and UK shot down missiles and drones. The UN Security Council on Wednesday condemned the Houthi attacks. The Red Sea connects Asia to Europe and the Mediterranean, via the Suez Canal. Currently, around 12 percent of the world’s shipping passes through the Red Sea, averaging around 50 ships a day, carrying between $3bn to $9bn worth of cargo. In total, the value of goods passing through the route is estimated at more than one trillion dollars per year. Container shipping appears to have been hardest hit. However, data released by Reuters earlier this week appeared to show that the passage of oil tankers had barely been affected. Data cited from MariTrace showed that, during December, an average of 76 oil freighters were to be located in the Red Sea, only two fewer than the previous month’s average, Other trackers reported a marginal increase over the same period. In early January, the Houthi rebels announced that, should a vessel wishing to transit the area declare its ownership and destination in advance of entering the waters, it would not be fired upon. Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd have since denied reaching any agreement with the rebel group. As of mid-December, Israel’s only Red Sea Port, at Eilat, reported an 85 percent drop in activity since the attacks began. While the bulk of Israel’s marine traffic comes through the Mediterranean ports of Haifa and Ashdod, exports of Dead Sea potash, as well as imports of Chinese manufactured cars – which make up 70 percent of Israel’s EV sales – are reliant upon Eilat. For many carriers, the risks to both vessel and crew are significant. This week, Chinese state-owned carrier Cosco joined with its subsidiary, OOCL in suspending shipments to Israel. However, Brad Martin, a former US Navy captain and a director of the Institute for Supply Chain Security at the RAND Corporation cautioned against overstating the challenge before Israel. “Red Sea shipping disruption, and even some shippers declining Israeli cargo, will not bring Israel to its knees economically,” he wrote by email. “Flow through the Mediterranean will likely continue unimpeded. Israel is probably in a better position for absorbing disruption than most of its neighbours. However, shipping and trade can become subject to diplomatic and political action, so economically damaging isolation could certainly occur on that front,” he said. While analysts have agreed that the direct impact of the Houthi rebel attacks on Israel’s economy has been limited, the longer the disruptions continue, the greater the repercussions might be. One acute vulnerability may be Israel’s ambitions to establish itself as an exporter of Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) of which it holds a small but growing share of vital international market. “Prior to the attack (of October 7), Israel was on its way to becoming a reliable gas exporter,” Gabrielle Reid, an associate director at risk consultancy S-RM, said. “But, the hostilities have exacerbated the political risk of doing business in Israel and further jeopardise the outlook for the Eastern Mediterranean region as a potentially important player in global natural gas markets,” she said. According to Clarkson Research Services Ltd, traffic through the Red Sea is currently down 44 percent on that recorded during the first half of December, as increasing numbers of vessels take the longer route around the Cape of Good Hope to reach harbour. As well as the obvious costs of increased fuel and manpower, this carries increased insurance costs and can lead to delays, as congestion at ports takes its toll. According to Drewry World Container Index, which tracks shipping along eight major routes between US, Europe and Asia, the cost of transporting a 40-foot (12-metre) container from China to Europe is expected to increase by 248 percent from $1,148 in November, when the attacks began. Depending upon how shipping companies respond, Simon Heaney, a senior manager in container research at Drewry, told Al Jazeera that overall costs could increase anywhere between 3 and 21 percent. Delays will also be a significant factor, as much of the “Just In Time” manufacturing processes in developed economies, where goods are delivered moments before they are needed, struggle to adapt to interruptions. While current demand for manufactured goods from countries such as China and India remains lower than during the peak of the pandemic, any change in cost or disturbance to shipping schedules is likely to carry consequences. However, while increases in transport costs can lead to inflation – the International Monetary Fund estimated that chaos in shipping routes during the pandemic led to a 1 percent increase in global inflation –  that has not happened yet, economists have suggested.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/13/have-the-houthi-red-sea-attacks-hurt-israels-economy
"Blackout in Gaza’s Al-Aqsa Hospital as fuel runs out, babies at high risk",Israeli military attacks in the vicinity have left patients and medical staff to an uncertain fate.,"A total blackout at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in central Gaza, one of the last functioning medical facilities in the enclave, has put the lives of its most vulnerable patients at risk with no fuel left to power generators and as the Israeli military was attacking areas nearby. “We’re trying to work with what we have. But we will have to stop working completely, because we don’t have any electricity,” one doctor at the hospital told Al Jazeera. “There’s a complete outage so how can we treat the patients?” Particularly at risk were premature and newborn babies, as well as patients in intensive care units. Gaza’s Government Media Office in a statement said they were at extreme risk of death. Earlier footage showed medical staff in dark rooms trying to work with flashlights. “We worked on the light of mobile phones to take care of the condition of children in intensive care, and the devices work on secondary power, and if they stop, the children lose their lives,” said Dr Warda al-Awawdeh, who works in the nursery unit.    One doctor said “all we can do is give some primary care. It’s very tough on us as medical staff”. Many of the babies in the facility “suffer from malnutrition, they’re underweight. They can get sick easily, even die, god forbid,” said another doctor. “We have three babies in the incubators and 10 others in the other room.” Thousands of displaced people had beenshelteringat the Deir el-Balah facility as Israel’s bombardment of the coastal enclave continues, with at least 151 people killed on Friday. Gaza’s Ministry of Health said on Saturday that at least 23,843 people have been killed and 60,317 wounded in Israeli attacks on Gaza since October 7. James Smith, an emergency physician with Medical Aid for Palestinians who recently worked at Al-Aqsa, said the electricity outage will significantly hinder the facility’s capacity to provide medical care to patients and admit those seeking assistance. “A hospital can’t function without electricity. This is a basic requirement for the functioning of any health facility,” Smith told Al Jazeera. “So this has huge implications in terms of the ability to deliver ongoing clinical care to patients, to current inpatients, but also to the hospital’s capacity to accept new patients or safely transfer them to other healthcare facilities.” Meanwhile, the hospital is also increasingly feeling the effect of the expanding Israeli military ground operations in central Gaza. “The vicinity of the hospital had been widely attacked by the Israeli military as a number of residential buildings there had been destroyed, alongside the fact that the hospital exists in an area that is considered to be a battle zone,” Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum reported from Gaza. “With the expansion of Israeli military operations … the hospital may be exposed to new threats,” he said on Saturday. UN aid chief Martin Griffiths on Friday said the health system in Gaza was “in a state of collapse”, adding that women were unable to give birth safely and children unable to get vaccinated. “The sick and injured cannot get treatment. Infectious diseases are on the rise,” he said in his remarks to the UN Security Council. “There is no safe place in Gaza. Dignified human life is a near impossibility.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/13/blackout-in-gazas-al-aqsa-hospital-as-fuel-runs-out-babies-at-high-risk
"Israel’s war on Gaza: List of key events, day 99",US carries out new strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen as Israel conducts more raids in cities in the occupied West Bank.,"Here’s how things stand on Saturday,January 13, 2024:         ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/13/israels-war-on-gaza-list-of-key-events-day-99
US launches new strikes on Yemen’s Houthis as conflict escalates,"The attack comes a day after US, UK raids on Iran-aligned group’s facilities sparked protests, calls for retaliation.","The United States launched new strikes against the Houthi rebels in Yemen for asecond straight dayafter the Iran-aligned group warned it would retaliate for a series of attacks on its facilities. The US military’s Central Command (CENTCOM) said on Saturday that Tomahawk missiles were fired from the US Navy’s USS Carney at a Houthi radar site. It described the attack as a “follow-on action” after theUS and the United Kingdomlaunched a barrage of attacks by land and sea targeting Houthi military sites across Yemen to stop the group from attacking merchant and military vessels in the Red Sea. At 3:45 a.m. (Sana’a time) on Jan 13., U.S. forces conducted a strike against a Houthi radar site in Yemen. This strike was conducted by the USS Carney (DDG 64) using Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles and was a follow-on action on a specific military target associated with strikes…pic.twitter.com/YE5BKJLGBv — U.S. Central Command (@CENTCOM)January 13, 2024  “I heard these explosions and many people talked on social media that they had heard powerful explosions in the capital, Sanaa,” said Al Jazeera’s Mohammed al-Attab, reporting from Yemen’s capital. Nasreddin Amer, the Houthis’ deputy information secretary, told Al Jazeera the overnight US strike caused no damage or casualties. “There were no injuries, no material nor human losses,” Amer said, adding that the Houthis would come back with a “strong and effective response”. Meanwhile, Houthi spokesperson Mohammed Abdulsalam told Reuters news agency the US attack would not deter it from waging attacks on Israel-linked vessels. US President Joe Biden warned on Friday that he could order more strikes. “We will make sure that we respond to the Houthis if they continue this outrageous behaviour.” The Houthis say their campaign is part of their support for Palestinians under siege and bombardment byIsraeli forces in Gazaover the past three months. The US Department of Defense said that its first night of attacks on Yemen late on Thursday involved more than 150 munitions fired from US and UK “maritime and air platforms” that targeted more than 16 locations controlled by Houthi forces. The sites attacked included Houthi weapons depots, launch sites, air defence radars, “command and control nodes”, and “production facilities”, the department said. The Houthis, who have controlled most of Yemen for nearly a decade, said five fighters were killed. They promised to continue their attacks on regional shipping. The US says the Houthis have carried out 27 attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea since commandeering the Galaxy Leader and its 25-strong multinational crew on November 19.  The strikes are the first on Yemeni territory since 2016 and also marked the first military intervention by the US in reaction to drone and missile attacks on commercial ships sinceIsrael’s war on Gazastarted on October 7. The Houthi movement, which controls much of Yemen after nearly a decade of war against a Western-backed, Saudi-led coalition, is a strong supporter of Hamas in its fight against Israel. The war in Gaza has killed more than 23,000 people, including about 10,000 children, and injured more than 60,000. However, not all major US allies backed the strikes in Yemen. The Netherlands, Australia, Canada and Bahrain provided logistical and intelligence support, while Germany, Denmark, New Zealand and South Korea signed a joint statement defending the attacks and warning of further action. But Italy, Spain and France chose not to sign or participate, fearing a wider escalation. Tens of thousands of Yemenis gathered in several cities to condemn the US and British strikes, denounce Israel and reaffirm their support for Palestinians. “Your strikes on Yemen are terrorism,” said Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, a member of the group’s political council. “The United States is the Devil.” The Biden administration had removed the Houthis from a US State Department list of “foreign terrorist organizations” in 2021. When asked if he felt the term “terrorist” described the movement now, he said: “I think they are.”   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/13/us-launches-fresh-strikes-on-yemens-houthi-as-conflict-escalates
Shot in ‘cold blood’: Killing of Palestinian grandmother sparks outcry,"Relatives of Hala Khreis, who was with her grandson and waving a white flag, relive the moment of her ‘execution’.","Relatives of Hala Khreis, a Palestinian woman killed by an Israeli sniper in northern Gaza, say the soldier shot her deliberately and in “cold blood” even though she was holding the hand of her small grandson who was waving a white flag and was walking along an evacuation route which had been declared safe. Khreis was at the front of a group of Palestinians who had been ordered to leave their homes by Israeli forces. They were told by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) that the route would be safe and that it had been “cleared” by the Israeli army. But people among the group who fled said they were re-routed at the last moment by Israeli soldiers towards another road, rather than the one they were initially instructed to take. Khreis and her small grandson, Taim, 5, were slightly ahead of the group and did not see the soldiers indicating that they should change course; they continued along the original route. In a matter of seconds, a soldier had opened fire on Khreis before she could turn back. In a verified and widely circulated video, Khreis was seen holding her grandson’s hand. The small child was waving a white flag when the soldier opened fire. In the video, Khreis can be seen suddenly collapsing to the ground before Taim runs back towards the group of people who had been re-routed and is swept up with the group moving towards the south. His family were left behind as they tried to provide his grandmother with urgent medical care and he has yet to be reunited with them. Despite their attempts to give Khreis first aid, family members were unable to help her and she bled to death. Taim’s mother – Khreis’s daughter – Heba, told Al Jazeera that she had desperately tried to find her son in the confusion after the shooting. “I pleaded, ‘Where is my son’,” Heba recalled. “I couldn’t even go look for him, fearing that I would be shot.” It wasn’t until several hours later that they were informed of his whereabouts – he had reached Rafah with the people in the rest of the convoy, none of whom he knew. Speaking about the moment her aunt was shot, Khreis’s niece, Malak al-Khateeb, said she never imagined she would ever witness such a horrific scene. She said she was “overcome with fear and confusion”. After leaving their home that day, she told Al Jazeera they came across Israeli soldiers in two separate tanks. The first group of soldiers did nothing, she said, but a soldier with the second group indicated that they should turn off the route they were on to another road to the “left”. At this point, the soldier was out of Khreis’s line of vision, al-Khateeb said, so she was not aware of the gestures ordering them to bear left. In the video, it appears that she was just about to turn and look back towards the rest of the convoy when she was suddenly shot. “I stood still in the street, unsure of what to do … If I continued to walk straight ahead, then I would meet the same destiny as my aunt,” al-Khateeb said. According to her, Israeli soldiers continued to take shots at the group of displaced people after Khreis was shot. “I still can’t comprehend how we’re still alive,” she added. Khreis’s daughter, Heba, only realised her mother was killed when she saw one of her neighbours carrying her body. “It was a complete shock,” Heba told Al Jazeera. “We couldn’t even give my mother a proper burial because we couldn’t leave – the area is under siege,” she said. Northern Gaza has been cut off from the rest of the Strip by the Israeli bombardment which began on October 7, making it near-impossible for the people still trapped there to escape. The resulting humanitarian situation there has been described as “beyond catastrophic” by the World Health Organization (WHO). None of its hospitals are functioning because of the blockade on fuel, water and supplies. There are also very few staff left, the WHOsaid. Israeli forces have besieged medical facilities and bombed or shot at doctors, nurses, ambulances and first aid responders throughout the three-month assault. The bodies of victims from recent Israeli attacks have been lined up in the courtyards of abandoned hospitals because they cannot be given safe and dignified burials, the WHO said. Khreis’s family was forced to hurriedly bury her at the entrance of their home. Now, they are focused on trying to find five-year-old Taim. Heba said she is very fearful for her son. Rafah governorate has become overcrowded with people and the health ministry has warned that disease is spreading fast amid a lack of supplies, medicine, clean water and fuel. Taim’s parents are pleading for help from the international community to ensure Taim’s safe return to his family in northern Gaza. “I want my son Taim to come back home to me,” Heba said. The family is hesitant to make the trip to southern Gaza, saying no one can guarantee their safety. In previous evacuations, Palestinians fleeing parts of northern Gaza have been arrested, shot at and even killed – despite routes being declared “safe” by the Israeli army. “We ask human rights organisations, and the Red Cross, to provide a safe passage for Taim so that he can return safely to his mother and father,” al-Khateeb said. The family is also calling on the international community and the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to investigate the circumstances of Khreis’s “execution”. On Thursday, the ICJcommenced a hearingfor a case brought by South Africa against Israel. South Africa accuses Israel of committing genocidal acts against Palestinians in Gaza. Targeting civilians waving white flags is a war crime, rights groups including Human Rights Watch have said. Last month, Israeli soldiers mistakenly killed three Israeli hostages in Gaza who were waving white flags. At the time, the Israeli army said it is “unlawful” to open fire on those waving flags. It nevertheless justified the actions of the soldiers in that case, saying the shooting was carried out “during fighting and under pressure”. More than 23,000 Palestinians, mostly children and women, have been killed in Israel’s war on Gaza. The vast majority of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million have been displaced and an Israeli blockade severely limiting food, fuel and medicine has caused a humanitarian “catastrophe”, the UN says.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/13/shot-in-cold-blood-killing-of-elderly-palestinian-woman-sparks-outcry
‘Dangerous’: US attacks on Yemen’s Houthis belie push for de-escalation,"US acting as ‘arsonist and firefighter’, experts say, by urging Middle East de-escalation but backing Israel’s Gaza war.","For months, top United States officials have repeatedly said that President Joe Biden does not want to see Israel’s war in the Gaza Strip escalate into a wider conflict in the Middle East. That was the central message US Secretary of State Antony Blinken conveyed this week as he made hisfourth visit to the regionsince the war began. His trip came in the shadow of Israeli attacks inLebanonand attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels on vessels in the Red Sea. “The Red Sea — we want to avoid escalation there,” Blinken said in Cairo on Thursday, when asked about his efforts to prevent the conflict from spiralling. But only hours later, the USconfirmedit had collaborated with the United Kingdom to launch “strikes against a number of targets in Yemen used by Houthi rebels”, in coordination with a handful of other countries. Experts and rights advocates warn that the attacks clash with the Biden administration’s stated goals of de-escalation and fail to address the root cause of the soaring tensions in the region: Israel’s military assault on Gaza. “It does run contrary to what the administration has been saying, but it was also inevitable,” said Hassan El-Tayyab, legislative director for Middle East policy at Friends Committee on National Legislation, a Quaker advocacy group in Washington, DC.    “Everybody watching this situation knew that it was a matter of time before the war in Gaza spilled out across the region. And we’re seeing that not only in the Red Sea, but we’re also seeing it inLebanon, Syria and Iraq,” he told Al Jazeera. “Without that ceasefire in Gaza, it’s hard to see how this gets better. And I think the simmering pot is now boiling over, and it’s just going to get worse and worse as time goes on. It’s really a very dangerous moment.” On Friday, a senior US official told the Reuters news agency that more than 150 munitions had been used to hit nearly 30 locations linked to the Houthi armed group in Yemen. The Iran-alignedHouthiscontrol large swaths of Yemen including the western coast overlooking the Bab al-Mandeb Strait, which leads to the Red Sea. The group began firing missiles at Israel and attacking commercial ships shortly after the war on Gaza began in October. The grouphas saidit is targeting Israel-linked vessels as part of an effort to pressure the Israeli government to end its Gaza bombardment and allow more humanitarian aid deliveries into the coastal Palestinian enclave. The attacks in the Red Sea — a key commercial thoroughfare through which about 12 percent of global trade transits — led shipping companies to suspend operations in the area and drew condemnation from the US and its allies. In mid-December, Washingtonlauncheda multinational force aimed at defending “freedom of navigation” in the Red Sea, and at the end of the month,US forces sank three Houthi boats, killing 10 fighters.  During a news conference from Egypt’s capital on Thursday, Blinken condemned the Houthis and noted that the United Nations Security Councilpassed a resolutiona day earlier urging the group to end its attacks. “We have a number of countries that have made clear that, if it doesn’t stop, there’ll have to be consequences, and unfortunately, it hasn’t stopped. But we want to make sure that it does, and we’re prepared to do that,” the top US diplomat said. Brian Finucane, a senior US programme adviser at the International Crisis Group think tank, said it was widely expected that the US would launch attacks against the Houthis in Yemen amid the escalating Red Sea confrontations. But Finucane — who previously worked at the US State Department, advising on the use of military force — told Al Jazeera that the Yemen strikes show that the Biden administration “has adopted a posture of self-deception and a self-defeating policy”. “On the one hand, they repeat in this mantra-like fashion their desire to avoid a wider regional war. On the other hand, we already have that wider regional war and the underlying cause … is the conflict in Gaza, which the US is fuelling through unconditional military support [for Israel],” he said. Biden, who confirmed the strikes on Thursday, said his administration was sending “a clear message that the United States and our partners will not tolerate attacks on our personnel or allow hostile actors to imperil freedom of navigation in one of the world’s most critical commercial routes”. “I will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and the free flow of international commerce as necessary,” the US president said in astatement, which did not mention the Israeli war in Gaza. Earlier this month, a senior administration official also rejected the Houthis’ claim that their attacks in the Red Sea are tied to Gaza, calling that rationale “illegitimate”. The war in Gaza has killed more than 23,700 Palestinians since October 7, prompting widespread international outcry and raising questions about the risk of genocide.    According to Finucane, the US’s failure to “acknowledge reality” — that the Gaza war lies at the heart of current regional tensions — “will make it very difficult to craft effective policy”. And whilethe US saidits overnight Yemen strikes were “intended to disrupt and degrade the Houthis’ capabilities”, Finucane questioned whether they would really stem the Red Sea attacks. The Houthis in Yemen have alreadywithstood years of bombingsin a war led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The group is currently in talks with Riyadh over a lasting ceasefire. “I think it’s really important to recognise that the US is simultaneously playing the role of arsonist and firefighter in the Middle East,” Finucane said. “It is pouring fuel on the fire in Gaza, while at the same time trying to tamp down the flare-ups elsewhere in the region — flare-ups that endanger US service members.” Shireen Al-Adeimi, a Yemeni American assistant professor at Michigan State University, said she was disheartened but not surprised to see the Biden administration launch attacks on Yemen. “It’s not surprising because we’ve seen evidence over and over again [that] US policy in the Middle East, and Yemen more specifically, has been one that is reactive, one that leads with violence,” she told Al Jazeera. “Air strikes seem to be the go-to for whichever administration has been in power [over] the past couple of decades.” She added that, if the Biden administration really wanted to de-escalate regional tensions, it would be pushing for a ceasefire in Gaza. “Their words don’t align with their actions.” The Biden administration has provided Israel with military and diplomatic support since the Gaza war began, without drawing “red lines” for how those resources can be used. It has also blocked UN resolutions urging a ceasefire and rejected a case at theInternational Court of Justiceaccusing Israel of genocide. Trita Parsi, executive vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a think tank in Washington, DC, also told Al Jazeera in a television interview on Thursday that the Yemen attacks highlight a failure on the part of the US and UK to push Israel to end its war in Gaza.    “The question that has to be asked is, ‘Why is it that the British and American governments prefer to escalate and go to war essentially in order to prevent the Houthis from attacking ships, rather than actually [taking] the path of a ceasefire in Gaza?'” he said. A ceasefire, Parsi explained, would end the killings of Palestinians, help secure the release of Israeli captives held in Gaza, and stemattacks on US and allied forcesin Iraq and Syria, which have also escalated since early October. “The strategy of the Biden administration has been to try to achieve de-escalation by escalating,” he said. “And it doesn’t seem to work in the long run, clearly, because the Houthis are likely not going to back off.” That was echoed by El-Tayyab, who told Al Jazeera that “more war has not, and has never been, the answer”. “They should try to end the war in Gaza for its own sake because there’s a massive humanitarian crisis,” he said, noting the mass displacement of Palestinians and warnings offaminein Gaza. “But a ceasefire in Gaza would also have a knock-on effect of really ratcheting down escalation and violence in the Bab al-Mandeb Strait, in Lebanon, [to] secure all peoples in the region — Arabs and Israelis — and secure American interests abroad.” El-Tayyab added, “Really, the only way out of this mess is diplomacy, diplomacy, diplomacy.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/12/dangerous-us-attacks-on-yemens-houthis-belie-push-for-de-escalation
Who are the Houthis? A simple guide to the Yemeni group,The Houthis have been in a decade-long civil war and say their attacks are in opposition to Israel’s war on Gaza.,"Following weeks of Houthi-led attacks on vessels in the Red Sea, the United States and United Kingdom have launchedmilitary strikesin Yemen in response, which the Houthis have described as “barbaric”. The Houthis are an Iran-aligned group based in Yemen and have said their attacks are aresponse toIsrael’s bombardment of Gaza, and the international community’s failure to put an end to it. The Houthis have primarily targeted Israel-linked ships and in December, the US formed amultilateral coalitionto safeguard commercial traffic from attacks. The force now has more than 20 countries, according to the Pentagon. But who are the Yemeni fighters at the heart of this escalation? The Houthis, also known as Ansar Allah (supporters of God), are anarmed groupthat control most parts of Yemen, including the capital, Sanaa, and some of the western and northern areas close to Saudi Arabia. The Houthis emerged in the 1990s but rose to prominence in 2014, when the group rebelled against Yemen’s government, causing it to step down and sparking a crippling humanitarian crisis. The group then spent years, with Iran’s backing, fighting a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia. The two warring sides have also repeatedly tried to hold peace talks. However, analysts say the Shia group should not be seen as an Iranian proxy. It has its own base, its own interests – and its own ambitions. Yemen has been in a decade-longcivil waras the Houthis maintain control of parts of the country. The group has been in ceasefire talks with Saudi Arabia while Yemen’s official government is based in Aden and led by President Rashad al-Alimi. Al-Alimi came into office in 2022 after the country’s exiled president Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi ceded power to him. Relations between Hadi and the Houthis were especially fraught. Yemen’s civil war has plunged the country into what the United Nations called “the world’s worst humanitarian crisis”, in March 2023. An estimated 21.6 million people or two-thirds of Yemen’s population are “in dire need of humanitarian assistance and protection services”, according to the UN. Fighting between Houthis and the military coalition, however, largely subsided last year. In 2023, the Yemeni rebels and government forces also exchangedabout 800prisoners over three days. The Houthis have been engaging in Omani-mediatedtalkswith Saudi officials to negotiate a permanent ceasefire. Saudi Arabia also restored relations with Iran in 2023, raising hopes for the Yemen peace process. The Houthis say their attacks on commercial and military ships with potential Israeli links are primarily aimed at pressuring Tel Aviv toend its waron Gaza. On November 18, the grouptook overa cargo ship called the Galaxy Leader, which they have since turned into a tourist attraction for Yemenis. “We have emphasised to everyone that [the Houthi] operations are to support the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip, and that we cannot stand idly by in the face of the aggression and siege,” Houthi chief negotiator and spokesperson Mohammed AbdulsalamtoldAl Jazeera in December.  The Houthis have also said they will continue to attack Israel-linked ships even after the strikes on Yemen by the US and UK on Thursday. “They were wrong if they thought that they would deter Yemen from supporting Palestine and Gaza,” Abdulsalamwrote online. The group’s “targeting will continue to affect Israeli ships or those heading to the ports of occupied Palestine,” he wrote. The group has alsobeen demandingthat Israel allow increased humanitarian aid into Gaza. But analystsalso saythat attacks help the Houthis in other ways. Domestically in Yemen, the group has seen a sharp uptick in recruitment, riding on popular support for the people of Gaza. The attacks, and the response from major powers like the US, also force other countries and governments to negotiate with them, giving themde facto legitimacyat a time when they are not officially recognised internationally as Yemen’s government. The Red Sea and Suez Canal account for30 percentof the world’s container ship traffic and since the onset of attacks, several shipping companies havesaid they willdivert ships across Africa instead.  Analystssay thatthe Houthis attacks on Red Sea ships could threaten peace within Yemen, particularly as ceasefire talks after a decade-long war appear to be gathering momentum. The UN announced in late December that serious progress was made in negotiations, but experts warned that Houthi activity in the Red Sea could derail a final deal. They explained that attacks could trigger a US military response thatcould in turn“unravel the fragile ceasefire conditions”. Some analysts also fear that the Houthis could be tempted to use their bolstered numbers – because of increased recruitment – to expand their ambitions. In recent weeks the Houthis have deployed 50,000 troops around Marib, the internationally recognised Yemeni government’s last stronghold. But other analysts point out that the Houthis might also seek closer relations with Saudi Arabia, a factor that could hold them back from any actions that escalate tensions within Yemen.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/12/who-are-yemens-houthis-a-basic-guide
Has Biden violated the US Constitution by bombing Yemen?,Lawmakers say Biden should have sought permission from Congress before launching strikes on 16 Houthi sites.,"The United States launched military attacks on sites operated by the Iranian-backedHouthisin Yemen on Thursday, targeting its military infrastructure. The US Air Force said in a statement that it had “executed deliberate strikes on over 60 targets at 16 Iranian-backed Houthi militant locations, including command and control nodes, munitions depots, launching systems, production facilities, and air defense radar systems”. US President Joe Biden said the joint strikes with the United Kingdom were meant to demonstrate that the US and its allies “will not tolerate” theHouthis’ attackson shipping in the Red Sea. The US raids, supported by Canada, Australia, Bahrain and the Netherlands, marked the first major US military response to Houthi attacks on shipping bound for Israel or owned by companies with any affiliations with Israel. The threat posed by Houthi attacks on global shipping has become serious enough to cause major companies such as Maersk tosuspend shippingin the Red Sea. Several Democrat and Republican lawmakers have strongly criticised the move, accusing Biden of violating Article 1 of the US Constitution. So what does Article 1 of the constitution say and has it been broken? Article 1 of the US Constitution requires that war be authorised by Congress. In the lead-up to this week’s strikes on Yemen, Biden notified Congress of the strikes but did not seek authorisation. The article has long been understood to be a mechanism for checking and regulating the president’s power to wage war. The hotly debated Section 8 of Article 1 assigns Congress the authority to declare war, stating “The Congress shall have the power to … declare war.” The precise section of the article that requires explicit congressional approval for military action is the third clause of Section 10, which states: No State shall, without the Consent of Congress, lay any Duty of Tonnage, keep Troops, or Ships of War in time of Peace, enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State, or with a foreign Power, or engage in War, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay. Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal from the Democratic Party called the strikes an “unacceptable violation of the Constitution” in an X post on Friday. This is an unacceptable violation of the Constitution. Article 1 requires that military action be authorized by Congress.https://t.co/rTo7HWFB54 — Rep. Pramila Jayapal (@RepJayapal)January 12, 2024  Jayapal’s statement was echoed by Democrat Congresswoman Cori Bush, who wrote: “The people do not want more of our taxpayer dollars going to endless war and the killing of civilians. Stop the bombing and do better by us.” .@POTUScan’t launch airstrikes in Yemen without congressional approval. This is illegal and violates Article I of the Constitution.

However, it was not just Democrats who objected to Biden’s recent strikes. Republican Mike Lee shared Ro Khanna’s X post in agreement. “The Constitution matters, regardless of party affiliation,” he wrote. I totally agree with@RoKhanna. The Constitution matters, regardless of party affiliation.https://t.co/74ofiUw0Hb — Mike Lee (@BasedMikeLee)January 12, 2024  Republican Texas Congressman Chip Roy wrote: “I am potentially fine with striking Yemen to defend critical shipping channel & response to aggression” but questioned the lack of congressional approval, asking: “Under what authority was this carried out?” I am potentially fine with striking Yemen to defend critical shipping channel & response to aggression, but why is Congress not making calls to strike a foreign country with pre-meditation? Under what authority was this carried out?  Broad Art 2? Expansive view of existing AUMF? — Chip Roy (@chiproytx)January 12, 2024  Some Republicans, including Mitch McConnell, Joni Ernst, Roger Wicker, Rick Scott and Lindsey Graham voiced support for Biden’s decision, deeming the strikes overdue. A joint statement released by the governments of Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, the UK and the US justified the strikes, saying they were conducted “in accordance with the inherent right of individual and collective self-defence, consistent with the UN Charter”. The Biden administration and its allies are likely to make another argument justifying the attacks by citing a section of the War Powers Act. The War Powers Resolution, more commonly known as the War Powers Act, was passed by the US Congress in November 1973. The Act requires the president to inform Congress within 48 hours of military action and requires the termination of military action within 60 days of its commencement if Congress has not officially declared war or authorised the military action. In September 2023, the New York Times carried out a survey of presidential candidates. On this issue, Biden responded that if he was elected in 2024, he would seek congressional authorisation to start a major war but added he believed he has the power to “direct limited US military operations abroad without prior Congressional approval when those operations serve important US interests”. This stands in contrast to Biden’s stance in 2007, when, during a Q&A with the Boston Globe, he said: “The Constitution is clear: except in response to an attack or the imminent threat of attack, only Congress may authorise war and the use of force.” No. There have been several instances when US presidents have carried out military strikes without seeking congressional approval. In December, the US military launchedstrikesagainst three sites used by Kataib Hezbollah, a major Iran-aligned armed group, and other unnamed affiliated groups in Iraq. Biden did not seek congressional approval beforehand. The US president also orderedair strikes in Syriain February 2021 without the approval of Congress, a move that also drew criticism from lawmakers. In January 2020, Democrats questioned whether it was legal for former president Donald Trump to order the assassination of the Iranian military commander,Qassem Soleimani, without congressional authorisation. In March 2011, former president Barack Obama orderedair strikes in Libyawithout formal authorisation from Congress. Obama argued that the fighting in Libya did not amount to “hostilities” that would trigger the need for congressional approval. Former president Bill Clinton escalated the 1999 NATO bombingagainst Serbia in Kosovowithout formal authorisation from Congress.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/12/did-biden-violate-the-us-constitution-in-bombing-yemens-houthi-sites
Will Morocco stay the course on Israel normalisation?,"Despite popular anger against Israel, Morocco is unlikely to break up with Tel Aviv, analysts say.","Despite rising public anger in Morocco over Israel’s war on Gaza, the normalisation deal between Morocco and Israel will likely hold, analysts have told Al Jazeera. Since early October, Morocco’s streets have seen regular protests, with thousands turning out to protest against Israel’s continuing actions in Gaza. Among them are protesters who are unhappy with their government’s dealings with Israel. In the capital, Rabat, thousands have marched with Palestinian flags and placards calling for “Resistance till victory”, “Free Palestine”, and “Stop Moroccan government normalisation with Israel”. The assassination of Hamas leaderSaleh al-Arourion January 2 seemed to inflame existing anger over Israel’s continued assault upon Gaza, which was reflected in the protests. Despite rising demands for stronger action from Islamist and left-wing groups, the Moroccan government has continued to call for a ceasefire and reiterate its support for a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict, with officials unwilling to comment on areas of foreign policy reserved for the king. Morocco’s recognition of Israel came at the end of 2020 when it signed theAbraham Accords, a United States strategy from 2020 that saw the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain and Sudan normalise relations with Israel in return for various concessions. What Morocco wanted was for the US to recognise its claim to the disputed territory of Western Sahara, and for Washington and Tel Aviv to increase trade and investment ties with the kingdom. For Rabat, recognition of its claims to Western Sahara would give it the edge in its zero-sum rivalry with regional foe Algeria, which fiercely contests Morocco’s claim to the territory. Nevertheless, public feeling towards Israel has rarely been warm in Morocco, as in many Arab states. In the lead-up to the normalisation, very few Moroccans supported the idea and the vast majority toldresearchersthe Palestinian cause was for all Arabs, not just Palestinians. More than three years later, as the death toll in Gaza rises and accounts of the war crimes Israel is accused of dominate public conversation, Rabat’s relations with Tel Aviv are under unprecedented strain. Direct flights between Morocco and Israel, allowing for tourism and giving many of the country’s 2,500 or so Indigenous Jews direct links to family members, were cancelled by Royal Air Maroc on October 19. Israel’s liaison office in Rabat was evacuated at about the same time while shops and restaurants catering to Israeli visitors in tourism hubs like Marrakesh have closed. The status of other projects, such as those on agriculture and desalination, is unknown. “In terms of economic benefits, Israel has had a lot more success in its partnership with, say, the UAE than Morocco,” Ken Katzman of the Soufan Center said. While commercial links may have been slow to take hold, ties have blossomed in security and defence. A drone deal at the end of 2022 for the purchase of 150 Israeli drones – some of which were to be assembled in Morocco –  tilted the balance of power in the Western Sahara further in Morocco’s favour. Moreover, an agreement last year for Israel to develop Moroccan surveillance satellites promises to make that advantage concrete. Israel’s Pegasus spyware technology has also provided an advantage,with Amnesty International sayingin 2022 that it was being used against Western Sahara activists. Much of the West’s attention in the Maghreb is now on Algeria and its generous gas reserves, since earlier supplies were disrupted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and Morocco is likely to find itself needing the relationship with Tel Aviv more now. “Military cooperation has become really crucial for Morocco,” Intissar Fakir, a senior analyst at the Middle East Institute told Al Jazeera. “They’ve managed to sign a flurry of deals, not just for the supply of military technology, but for its manufacture,” she said. “One of the key takeaways is that the military advantage Morocco has been able to gain in the short time the deal has been in effect is substantial … [it] would be difficult for Morocco to walk away from this partnership with Israel.” Nevertheless, despite overwhelming popular support for the king, the Moroccan people’s criticism of the relationship with Israel continues. That Morocco has so far tried to ride out the waves of fury over the war is perhaps the clearest indicator yet that it intends to hold its course, Fakir said. Irrespective of the bloodshed, the war in Gaza may do little other than slow, rather than halt, Israel’s gradual normalisation with many other Arab states, Katzman added. Relations with the UAE seem barely affected, while negotiations over establishing a similar relationship with Saudi Arabia, a longstanding goal of US and Israeli diplomats, have reportedly only slowed, rather than stopped, he said. Whether anyone within the Trump administration ever conceived of the current levels of destruction being inflicted upon Gaza by Israel, and how that may affect perceptions of the US and its regional alliances will likely remain academic. For the signatories themselves, the ability to justify normalising with Israel lies not within their own capitals, but in Tel Aviv and how long it chooses to hold its present course.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/12/moroccos-deal-with-israel-feels-the-strain
What is South Africa’s five-point ICJ argument against Israel?,"Israel will defend itself against South Africa’s arguments – from the denial of food and medicines to forced displacement, mass killings and more – on Friday.","South Africa’s landmark case against Israel for its war on Gaza began on Thursday at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the World Court based in The Hague. Pretoria is accusing Israel of committing the crime of genocide in breach of the 1948 Genocide Convention. More than 23,000 people have been killed in Gaza since October 7, according to the enclave’s health ministry. That includes nearly 10,000 children. In its three-hour longpresentation to ICJ judges, the South African team, led by international law academic and barrister, John Dugard, articulated the harrowing plight of Palestinians in Gaza who are trapped under siege, bombarded by continuous Israeli air strikes and attacked by a deadly Israeli military ground invasion. It could take years for the ICJ to reach afinal judgement. But this week’s initial proceedings are focused on South Africa’s specific request for an emergency order against the continuing killings and destruction in the Gaza Strip. Experts say an interim sentence could be out in weeks. Adila Hassim, one of the advocates representing South Africa, said that it’s not necessary for the court to come to a final sentence on thegenocide allegationsnow, but that it could conclude that at least some of Israel’s actions fall within the definition of the convention, and thus, intervene. Here are the five main “genocidal acts” that Hassim accused Israel of having perpetrated during the war: The “first genocidal act is the mass killing of Palestinians in Gaza”, Hassim said, showing the court pictures of mass graves where bodies were buried, “often unidentified”. She said Israel has deployed highly destructive 2000-pound bombs in parts of Gaza that it has itself declared safe. More than 1,800 families have lost multiple family members, while some families do not have any survivors left, Hassim said. No one has been spared, not babies, and especially not children, she added. The second genocidal act, Hassim said, “is Israel’s infliction of serious mental and bodily harm,” on the people in Gaza. Close to 60,000 people have been wounded and maimed, most of them women and children, in a place where the health system has collapsed, she added. Hassim cited the arrest of large numbers of Palestinians, including children, who were undressed and loaded onto trucks going to unknown locations. “The suffering of the Palestinian people, physical and mental, is undeniable,” she said. Hassim said Israel has deliberately imposed conditions that cannot sustain life and that are calculated to bring about the destruction of Gaza through its forced displacement of most of the population. Hassim said thousands of families have been displaced multiple times, with half a million now having no homes to return to. She cited how Israel gave entire hospitals orders to evacuate within 24 hours with no assistance in moving the injured or in moving medical supplies. It did the same with large parts of northern Gaza, where more than one million people were asked to move at short notice. “The order itself was genocidal,” Hassim said. The lawyer said Israel has also blockaded food and water from the Strip, causing widespread hunger and that it has removed the ability to distribute what is available by restricting the movement of aid workers. Hassim played a clip that showed hundreds of Palestinians running after a truck carrying aid into Gaza. Israel, Hassim added, has also deliberately imposed conditions denying Palestinians in Gaza adequate shelter, clothes, bedding and other critical non-food items. She said there’s no safe water to drink, clean and cook, and that disease cases, including diarrhoea, are soaring. She said more Palestinians may die from hunger and disease, yet the siege continues. The fourth genocidal action, Hassim said, is Israel’s military assault on Gaza’s healthcare system that renders life there unsustainable. Gaza’s healthcare was already crippled by years of attack by Israel, she said, and now, it is simply unable to cope with the sheer number of injured people who need life-saving treatment. Lastly, Hassim added, Israel is blocking life-saving treatment needed to deliver babies. This, she added, amounts to preventing births in Gaza, and is an act of genocide. Hassim also cited Reem Alsalem, UN special rapporteur on violence against women and girls, who had earlier warned that the “reproductive violence inflicted by Israel on Palestinian women, newborn babies infants and children … could be qualified as acts of genocide”. Israel will present its oral argument on Friday and British Lawyer Malcolm Shaw will lead its presentation. Legal experts say Tel Aviv is likely to argue that its actions are in self-defence, following Hamas’s October 7 attacks that killed 1,139  and saw more than 200 people taken hostage, according to Israeli authorities. Israeli officials have railed against the South Africa suit. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday said South Africa presented hypocrisy and lies at the court. “We are fighting terrorists, we are fighting lies,” Netanyahu said. “Today we saw an upside-down world. Israel is accused of genocide while it is fighting against genocide.” To drive its arguments home, the South African legal team needs not only to prove that the indiscriminate mass killings it calls a genocide are indeed happening, but that there is an intent to commit these acts by Tel Aviv. “Genocides are never declared in advance,” Hassim, the advocate said in her presentation, adding that all the Israeli actions she detailed were enough proof of genocidal intent. Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, a second lawyer, cited Israeli officials’ statements as further proof of intent. In particular, he recalled Netanyahu’s comments on October 28 when the prime minister urged troops preparing to enter Gaza to “remember what Amalek has done to you,” – a biblical command from God to entirely destroy a group. “The destruction of Palestinian life is articulated state policy,” Ngcukaitobi added. Several countries and international organisations have rallied behind South Africa in its case. Malaysia, Bolivia and Turkey are among them. Tel Aviv has seen backing from the United States, its main weapons supplier and diplomatic patron. As the proceedings kicked off on Thursday, hundreds of pro-Palestinian demonstrators gathered in solidarity, and nearby, pro-Israeli protesters marched, too.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/12/icj-genocide-case-south-africas-five-point-argument-against-israel
"World reacts to US, UK attacks on Houthi targets in Yemen",Here are some of the international reactions to the most recent escalation in the region.,"The United States and the United Kingdom havelauncheda series of strikes on Yemen against the Iran-aligned Houthi rebels, who have been targeting international shipping in the Red Sea. The Houthis, who support the Palestinian group Hamas, called Friday’s attacks“barbaric”and in a statement threatened that “all US, UK interests have become ‘legitimate targets’.” The rebels – who control most parts of Yemen, including the capital, Sanaa – also promised to continue targeting Israeli-linked ships in the Red Sea. Tens of thousands of Yemenis gathered in several cities to condemn the US and British strikes and to reaffirm their support for Palestinians. Yemen’s Saudi-backed, internationally recognised government, blamed the Houthis for the UK and US strikes, saying the rebels bore responsibility for dragging Yemen into a conflict with its attacks in the Red Sea. Here are some of the international reactions to the attack, which threatens to further inflame tensions in the region: “The attacks are happening in an effort to extend the full support of the US and UK in approximately the past100 daysfor the war crimes of the Zionist regime against the Palestinian people and the besieged citizens of Gaza,” the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said: “These attacks are a clear violation of Yemen’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and a breach of international laws.” The Ministry of Foreign Affairs called for restraint and “avoiding escalation” after the strikes and said it was monitoring the situation with “great concern”. “The kingdom emphasises the importance of maintaining the security and stability of the Red Sea region as the freedom of navigation in it is an international demand,” it said. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned the strikes and said the US and UK are “trying to turn the Red Sea into a sea of blood”. “All of these acts are disproportionate use of force,” he said, adding, “Israel also resorts to this disproportionate use of force in Palestine.” Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said: “The Israeli aggression on Gaza and its continued committing of war crimes against the Palestinian people and violating international law with impunity are responsible for the rising tensions witnessed in the region.” The stability of the region and its security are closely tied, Safadi said, according to state media. “The international community is at a humanitarian, moral, legal and security crossroads,” he added. “Either it shoulders its responsibilities and ends Israel’s arrogant aggression and protects civilians or allows Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his extremist ministers to drag us into a regional war that threatens world peace.” Egypt’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has expressed “deep concern” over the escalation of military operations in the Red Sea and air strikes in Yemen. A statement from the ministry called for “uniting” international and regional efforts to reduce instability in the region. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called on all sides “not to escalate” the volatile situation in the Red Sea, his spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said. “The Secretary General further calls on all parties involved not to escalate even more the situation in the interest of peace and stability in the Red Sea and the wider region.” “These strikes were defensive and designed to preserve freedom of navigation in one of the world’s most vital waterways. The [Houthi] attacks must end,” a spokesperson for the military alliance said. “Houthi forces are supported, supplied and equipped by Iran, so Tehran has a special responsibility to rein in its proxies,” the spokesperson added. NATO was not involved in the attack, but the US and UK are part of the alliance while two other NATO members, the Netherlands and Canada, provided support. The Lebanese group, which is an ally of Iran and the Houthis, said the US aggression confirms that Washington is in “full partnership” with Israel. “The US is a full partner in the tragedies and massacres committed by the Zionist enemy in Gaza and the region,” a statement from the group said. Condemning the strikes, Hamas said in a statement that the US and UK governments will bear responsibility for their attacks’ impacts on the security of the region. The Gaza-based Palestinian group said the escalation confirms that the US administration is “waging a war of genocide against the Palestinian people in Gaza”. “We call on the people of the Arab and Islamic nation to take action in rejection of the aggression against Yemen, which rose up in defence of Gaza and the holy places of Muslims in Palestine.”    Russia said the strikes violate international law and wrongly take advantage of aUnited Nations Security Council resolutionthat had demanded the Houthis stop their attacks on shipping lanes. “The US air strikes on Yemen are another example of the Anglo-Saxons’ perversion of UN Security Council resolutions,” said Maria Zakharova, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson. Zakharova said the strikes showed a “complete disregard for international law” and were “escalating the situation in the region”. France reaffirmed its condemnation of Houthi strikes on commercial vessels in the Red Sea, calling for an immediate stop to them. “With those armed actions, the Houthis bear the extremely serious responsibility of the escalation in the region,” the Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs said in a statement. Germany’s Federal Foreign Office said the strikes were meant to prevent further attacks. “Our aim remains to de-escalate tensions and restore stability in the Red Sea,” the ministry posted on X. Spain will not intervene militarily in the Red Sea region out of “a commitment to peace” and any country doing so will have to answer for its actions, Defence Minister Margarita Robles said. Highlighting that Madrid is not judging other countries’ actions in the Red Sea, she said: “Every country has to give explanations for its actions. Spain will always be committed to peace and dialogue.” Belgium is working with its partners in the European Union and the United States to restore security in the Red Sea region and avoid any spillover, Belgian Foreign Minister Hadja Lahbib said on X. “The ongoing attacks by the Houthis are a real danger for the stability of the region and represent an escalation that benefits no one,” she wrote. “The US-British action is based on the right of self-defence, aims to protect free passage and is focused on de-escalation. The Netherlands, with its long history as a sea-faring country, places significant importance on the right of free passage and supports this targeted operation,” Prime Minister Mark Rutte said. Denmark fully supports the US and British strikes, according to a statement by Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen. Oman denounced the military action from “friendly countries”, state media reported. Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi said the attack went against his country’s advice and will only add fuel to an extremely dangerous situation. The United Arab Emirates has expressed grave concern over the consequences of attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, the Gulf state’s official news agency said. The UAE also stressed the importance of maintaining security in the region and the interests of its countries. The paramilitary group has warned that American interests and coalition countries will not be safe from now on. McConnell welcomed the US-led coalition’s operations against “the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists responsible for violently disrupting international commerce in the Red Sea and attacking American vessels”. “President [Joe] Biden’s decision to use military force against these Iranian proxies is overdue. I am hopeful these operations mark an enduring shift in the Biden administration’s approach to Iran and its proxies,” he said. Khanna said Biden “needs to come to Congress before launching a strike against the Houthis in Yemen and involving us in another Middle East conflict”. “That is Article I of the Constitution. I will stand up for that regardless of whether a Democrat or Republican is in the White House.” Hoyle stressed that “the air strikes have not been authorised by Congress”. “The Constitution is clear – Congress has the sole authority to authorize military involvement in overseas conflicts. Every president must first come to Congress and ask for military authorisation, regardless of party.” The former Labour Party leader said the military action was “a reckless act of escalation that will only cause more death and suffering”. “It is utterly disgraceful that Parliament has not even been consulted. When will we learn from our mistakes and realise that war is not the answer?” Corbyn wrote on X. The independent member of parliament said that at a time when the UK government should be backing a ceasefire in Gaza, it was instead sending “jet fighters to back the US against the Houthis”. “No parliamentary approval and no idea where it will all end,” Abbott said on X.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/12/world-reacts-to-us-uk-attacks-on-houthi-targets-in-yemen
"How the US, UK bombing of Yemen might help the Houthis","The Yemeni group could gain from a raised domestic and international profile, with a superpower taking them on.","Beirut, Lebanon –Yemen’s Houthis will not be deterred by United States-led attacks on them in retaliation for their targeting of Israel-linked ships in the Red Sea, and could in fact be emboldened further, say analysts. On Thursday night, the US and the United Kingdombombed multiple sitesin Yemen that Washington said were Houthi facilities, a day after they shot down missiles fired by the Yemeni group in the Red Sea. The bombings are the first time during this war that the US or its allies have attacked Yemeni territory. But the Houthis could gain from a raisedregional and domestic profile, as the world’s sole superpower takes on a group that is not internationally recognised as the government of Yemen despite controlling large parts of the country, say experts. On January 10, the US and the UK repelled 21 drones and missiles in the Houthis’ largest operation yet on Red Sea traffic. And the United Nations Security Council, with the world’s most powerful nations, focused on the attacks on Red Sea ships, in a resolution that condemned the Houthis – but also underscored their growing influence as a force to reckon with. “The Houthis actually won that confrontation the day they started it,” Abdulghani al-Iryani, a senior researcher with the Sanaa Center for Strategic Studies, told Al Jazeera. WithinYemen, Ansar Allah, the formal name of the Houthi group, controls the west, including the Bab al-Mandeb strait that leads into the Red Sea, and is fighting for territory against the internationally recognised government of Yemen and its domestic allies. The group’s actions in the Red Sea, along with its messaging about supporting the people of Gaza, have been immensely popular among Yemenis, bolstering recruitment and allowing it to mobilise massive rallies in support of the Palestinian people. The Houthis say they are intercepting Israel-bound and Israeli-owned ships passing through the Bab al-Mandeb strait to pressure Israel to at least allow sufficient humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip, which Israel has pounded for the past three months. The Israeli war on Gaza following an October 7 attack by Hamas and other armed Palestinian groups has killed more than 23,000 people, most of them civilians, some in direct bombings and others as a result of the dire conditions the enclave has been plunged into by Israeli actions. The Houthis grabbed global attention on November 19, when theycommandeered the Galaxy Leadercargo ship and subsequently turned it into a tourist attraction. While global shipping has been deeply affected, with major shipping companies avoiding the Red Sea altogether, the Houthi interceptions have caused minor damage to most ships and have avoided killing or injuring anyone on board. On December 31, four Houthi vessels tried commandeering a ship travelling through the Red Sea when US Navy helicopters attacked them, killing 10 Houthi fighters and sinking three boats. In early January, the Houthis began using unmanned surface vessels. In the past, the group has used them as drone boats that explode on impact with other vessels. While the group has changed tactics, they have not stopped their activity in the Red Sea, on the one hand, analysts say, because their declared aim has not been achieved, and on the other, because they do not fear US threats. “The Red Sea front has entered the next level – the direct clash between the Houthis and the US,” Eleonora Ardemagni, a senior associate research fellow at the Italian Institute for International Political Studies, told Al Jazeera. “Both the US and the Houthis are respectively testing the effects of their moves and how far they are willing to go.” In response to an ultimatum from Washington and its allies to stop Red Sea activity or incur their military wrath last week, the Houthis held an enormous rally in Yemen’s capital Sanaa where bombastic speeches from the group’s leaders declared themselves ready for US escalation. “Everything that was worth striking has been struck by the Saudi coalition in the past nine years,” al-Iryani said, referring to the war waged against the Houthis by a Saudi-led coalition that began fighting the Houthis in 2015 after they had overthrown President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, head of the internationally recognised government. “I don’t think [US attacks on Houthi targets] are going to act as a deterrent to the Houthis,” Raiman al-Hamdani, a researcher at the ARK Group and a former visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told Al Jazeera. “Considering the Houthis’ rhetoric of always blaming the United States and Israel for the problems that exist in Yemen and in the Middle East in general, I think they’d be quite happy.” Strategically speaking, al-Iryani said, the Houthis should also be quite comfortable. The Houthi mobile infrastructure should make picking targets more difficult for the Americans, he said. Meanwhile, the Houthis are still in talks with neighbouring Saudi Arabia over a long-term ceasefire and analysts say they may be trying to strengthen their hand through the Red Sea show of power. The Saudis have been keen on preventing an escalation in Yemen and, in December, Riyadh urged the US to exercise restraint. Saudi Arabia doubled down on that message of caution after Thursday night’s attacks on Yemen. Instability next door would not benefit Saudi Arabia, which has had itsoil infrastructurebadly affected in past Houthi attacks. The Saudis may also have longer-term considerations in these negotiations, in that it would benefit them to build relations with the Houthis and may be on track to recognise them. “Formal recognition may be the most important thing to [the Houthis],” al-Hamdani said. “The group’s main concern is to continue consolidating power over the country.” To date, the Houthis have drawn support from Iran as part of their regional Axis of Resistance, along with Hamas, Hezbollah and a network of militias in Iraq and Syria. “The Houthis … have developed a relationship with Iran that many analysts consider to rival that Iran possesses with Hezbollah,” Yemen researcher Nicholas Brumfield told Al Jazeera. But analysts say the group should not be seen as an Iranian proxy and, in the future, the Houthis may look to recalculate their regional alliances. “It’s going to be better for them to be close to the Saudis,” al-Hamdani said, adding that they could benefit more by “relying on [Saudi Arabia’s] financial resources rather than depending on Iran for weapons”. The Houthis’ identity as a Shia group does not mean that they will fall under Iranian influence by default – the long historical and cultural ties between Yemen and Saudi Arabia can play a pivotal role between the two.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/12/how-the-us-uk-bombing-of-yemen-might-help-the-houthis
"Israel’s war on Gaza: List of key events, day 98",The US and UK have carried out retaliatory strikes against multiple Houthi sites in Yemen. Here is the latest:,"Here’s how things stand on Friday,January 12, 2024:         ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/12/israels-war-on-gaza-list-of-key-events-day-98
US and UK launch strikes against Yemen; Houthi rebels promise to retaliate,Houthis say all US and British interests are now ‘legitimate targets’.,"The United States and Britain have launched military strikes in Yemen in response to Houthi rebel attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, raising fears of an escalation of conflict in the region. Hours after the attacks early on Friday, which the rebels said killed five people, the Houthis warned that all US and British assets have now become “legitimate targets”. US President Joe Biden said the strikes followed “unprecedented”attacksby the Houthis on commercial ships in the Red Sea and warned he would “not hesitate” to take further action if necessary. “These targeted strikes are a clear message that the United States and our partners will not tolerate attacks on our personnel or allow hostile actors to imperil freedom of navigation,” Biden said of the attacks by air and sea. The attacks struck nearly 30 locations in Yemen using more than 150 munitions, US Lieutenant General Douglas Sims, the director of the Joint Staff, said late on Friday. He did not expect a high number of casualties as the targets included those in rural areas. But he said Washington expected the Houthis to attempt to retaliate. In a statement the Houthis’ Supreme Political Council threatened that “all American-British interests have become legitimate targets for the Yemeni armed forces in response to their direct and declared aggression against the Republic of Yemen.” Earlier, the Houthis called the strikes on Yemen “barbaric”, threatened retaliation and also said they will continue targeting ships heading towards Israel for as long as its war on Gaza continues. “The American and British enemy bears full responsibility for its criminal aggression against our Yemeni people, and it will not go unanswered and unpunished,” Yahya Saree, the group’s military spokesperson said. Yemen’s Saudi-backed, internationally recognised government, however, blamed the Houthis for the UK and US strikes on the country, saying the rebels bore responsibility for dragging Yemen into an arena of military confrontation with its attacks in the Red Sea. Pentagon spokesperson Pat Ryder told Al Jazeera that the US military is closely monitoring the situation and hasn’t seen any retaliatory attacks from the Houthis so far. “Our goal here is to ensure this vital waterway [the Red Sea] is safe and secure for international shipping and mariners,” he said.    On Friday, tens of thousands of Yemenis gathered in several cities across the country to condemn the US and British strikes and to reaffirm their support for Palestinians in Gaza. Mohammed Abdul-Salam, the Houthis’ chief negotiator and spokesperson, described the US and Britain as having “committed foolishness with this treacherous aggression”. “They were wrong if they thought that they would deter Yemen from supporting Palestine and Gaza,” he wrote online. The group’s “targeting will continue to affect Israeli ships or those heading to the ports of occupied Palestine”, he added. Al Masirah, a Houthi-run satellite news channel, reported that the strikes hit the al-Dailami air base north of the capital, Sanaa, the airport in the strategic port city of Hodeidah, a camp east of Saada, the airport in the city of Taiz and an airport near Hajjah. The strikes are the first on Yemeni territory since 2016 and also marked the first military intervention by the US in reaction to drone and missile attacks on commercial ships sinceIsrael’s war on Gazastarted in October. The Houthi movement, which controls much of Yemen after nearly a decade of war against a Western-backed, Saudi-led coalition, is a strong supporter of Hamas in its war against Israel. The Palestinian group said the US and the UK will bear responsibility for the impact of the strikes on the security of the region. Ryder told Al Jazeera the US has no plans to add additional forces to the region. “As you know, since we did deploy additional amounts of capabilities in the region as part of deterrence efforts, that gives us a wide range of capabilities in order to respond to multiple contingencies should we need it,” he said, referring toUS military deployments to the Middle Eastsince Israel’s war in Gaza began. “Since the beginning, our goal has been to ensure that the Israel-Hamas conflict does not turn into a wider conflict. … As of now, we don’t see that conflict has expanded, but we understand the tensions and will continue to stay focused on that,” he added. No further strikes against Houthi targets were currently planned, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s office said, adding that the situation will be kept under review. The Houthis have attacked commercial ships they said were linked to Israel or bound for Israeli ports and have engaged directly with the US navy in the Red Sea, firing ballistic missiles and deploying armed drones against US and UK warships. Sunak called the strikes “necessary and proportionate”. His spokesperson said the prime minister will make a statement to parliament on Monday about the strikes, but there are no plans to hold a vote on support for the military action. “As we’ve said, the deployment of armed forces is a prerogative power, and the government is under no legal obligation to seek formal parliamentary approval,” the spokesperson said on Friday. Britain’s Ministry of Defence said in a statement that “early indications are that the Houthis’ ability to threaten merchant shipping has taken a blow”.    Giorgio Cafiero, CEO of Gulf State Analytics, a Washington, DC-based geopolitical risk consultancy, said the US had options other than a military attack. “One of them was to use the leverage that Washington has over Israel to push Israel into abiding by a ceasefire [in Gaza],” Cafiero told Al Jazeera. “This has the potential to drag the US into a protracted conflict in the Middle East,” he said. “I think the decisions that the Biden team is making are pushing us in this very dangerous direction right now.” Trita Parsi from the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft shared a similar sentiment. “The question that needs to be asked is why the British and American governments prefer to escalate and go to war … rather than going on the path of a ceasefire in Gaza, which would not only be more effective,” he told Al Jazeera. The US said Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands supported the operation as it presented the strikes as part of an international effort to restore the free flow of trade in a key route between Europe and Asia that accounts for about 15 percent of the world’s shipping traffic. Iran, which supports the Houthis,condemned the attacks, and Russia said it had requested an urgent meeting of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the military strikes. White House spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Friday that the US was not looking for conflict with Iran despite attacks from the Houthis. “We’re not interested in a war with Yemen,” Kirby also said. “Everything the president has been doing has been trying to prevent any escalation of conflict, including the strikes last night.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/12/us-and-uk-launch-strikes-against-houthi-rebels-in-yemen
Gaza daily deaths exceed all other major conflicts in 21st century: Oxfam,Human Rights Watch also says Israel’s war on Gaza has included ‘acts of collective punishment that amount to war crimes’.,"The killing of civilians inGazais at a scale unprecedented in recent history, monitoring groups have said, as Israel continues to pound the besieged coastal enclave more than three months into the war. Britain-based charity Oxfam said on Thursday that the daily death toll of Palestinians in Israel’s war on Gaza surpasses that of any other major conflict in the 21st century, while survivors remain at high risk due to hunger, diseases and cold, as well as ongoing Israeli bombardments. “Israel’s military is killing Palestinians at an average rate of 250 people a day, which massively exceeds the daily death toll of any other major conflict of recent years,” Oxfam said in a statement. For comparison, the charity provided a list of average deaths per day in other conflicts since the turn of the century: 96.5 in Syria, 51.6 in Sudan, 50.8 in Iraq, 43.9 in Ukraine, 23.8 in Afghanistan, and 15.8 in Yemen. Oxfam said the crisis is further compounded by Israel’s restrictions on the entry of aid into Gaza, where only 10 percent of weekly food aid that is needed gets in. This poses a serious risk ofstarvationfor those who survive the relentless bombardment, it said. Also on Thursday, United States-based rights group Human Rights Watch (HRW) released itsWorld Report 2024, which said civilians in Gaza have been “targeted, attacked, abused, and killed over the past year at a scale unprecedented in the recent history of Israel and Palestine”. At least 23,469 Palestinians have been killed and 59,604 injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since October 7, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health. In the most recent 24-hour reporting period, Israeli forces carried out 10 mass killings in the Gaza Strip, causing 112 deaths and 194 injuries, the ministry added. About 7,000 people remain missing under the rubble and are presumed dead. “The heinous crimes carried out by Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups since October 7 are the abhorrent legacy of decades-long impunity for unlawful attacks and Israel’s systematic repression of Palestinians,” said Omar Shakir, Israel and Palestine director at HRW. “How many more civilians must suffer or be killed as a result of war crimes before countries supplying weapons pull the plug and otherwise take action to end these atrocities?” he asked. This comes as South Africa on Thursday presented itscase against Israelat the International Court of Justice in The Hague, accusing the country of committing “genocide” against Palestinians in Gaza, a charge that Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected as “hypocrisy and lies”.    In its report, HRW noted that Israel’s war on Gaza has included “acts of collective punishment that amount to war crimes and include the use of starvation as a method of warfare”, including cutting off essential services such as water and electricity and blocking the entry of most critical humanitarian aid. Meanwhile, in the occupied West Bank, HRW said during the first eight months of 2023, incidents of settler violence against Palestinians and their property reached the highest daily average since the United Nations started recording this data in 2006. At least 3,291 Palestinians were held in administrative detention without charge or trial, according to Israel Prison Service figures. “Israeli authorities’ repression of Palestinians, undertaken as part of a policy to maintain the domination of Jewish Israelis over Palestinians, amount to the crimes against humanity of apartheid and persecution,” HRW said. Experts in mapping damage during wartime have also found that the war in Gaza now sits among the deadliest and most destructive in recent history. According to an analysis of Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellite data by the CUNY Graduate Center and Oregon State University, the war has killed more civilians than the US-led coalition did in its three-year campaign against ISIL (ISIS). The offensive has wreaked more destruction than the razing of Syria’s Aleppo between 2012 and 2016, Ukraine’s Mariupol or, proportionally, the Allied bombing of Germany in World War II, researchers found, according to a report by The Associated Press. Israel’s offensive has likely either damaged or destroyed more than two-thirds of all structures in northern Gaza and a quarter of buildings in the southern area ofKhan Younis, according to satellite data collected by the research group. That includes tens of thousands of homes as well as schools, hospitals, mosques and stores. UN monitors have said that about 70 percent of school buildings across Gaza have been damaged. “Gaza is now a different colour from space. It’s a different texture,” said Corey Scher of the CUNY Graduate Center, who has worked to map destruction across several war zones.

Any US attack on Yemen’s Houthis will ‘not go without response’,The Houthis’ leader says any US attack will trigger a greater response as the group steps up attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea in protest against Israel’s war in Gaza.,"Any attack on Yemen’s Houthis on the part of the United States will not go without a response, the group’s leader Abdel-Malik al-Houthi has said in a televised speech, as the Iranian-backed group stepped upattacks on commercial vessels in the Red Seain protest against Israel’s war in Gaza. “Any American attack will not remain without a response. The response will be greater than the attack that was carried out with 20 drones and a number of missiles,” the Houthi leader said, referring to astrike on Wednesday, when Houthi drones and missiles targeted US and United Kingdom ships in the largest single attack yet on foreign vessels. “We are more determined to target ships linked to Israel, and we will not back down from that,” al-Houthi said. The comments come after the US and 11 allies published ajoint statementlast week calling for an end to Houthi attacks from Yemen on Red Sea shipping, sending out an implicit threat of force. Various shipping lines have suspended operations, instead taking the longer journey around Africa. The Cyprus Shipping Chamber (CSC), a key shipping industry group representing around 200 companies in Cyprus and abroad, said the attacks could have a “substantial” impact on economies and a knock-on effect on prices around the world. “Where countries heavily depend on raw materials, gas, grain, [and] pharmaceuticals, we will have to assume that it will have a substantial impact on day-to-day living, business operations, and this will have a multiplying effect,” CSC Director Thomas Kazakos said. The Houthi movement, an Iran-aligned group that controls much of Yemen after nearly a decade of war against a Western-backed and Saudi-led coalition, has emerged as a strong supporter of the Palestinian group Hamas in its war against Israel. The Houthis have attacked commercial ships they say are linked to Israel or bound for Israeli ports and have engaged directly with the US Navy in the Red Sea, firing ballistic missiles and deploying armed drones against US and UK warships. Human Rights Watch, among other organisations, said attacks targeting civilians and civilian objects, if carried out deliberately or recklessly, would be a war crime. The rights watchdog argued that on more than one occasion, the targeted vessels presented no direct links to Israel or evidence of military targets on board. The United Nations Security Council on Wednesdaypassed a resolutiondemanding the Houthis end attacks on ships in the Red Sea and free theJapanese-operated Galaxy Leaderthat was seized last year. US-allied Gulf and Arab states, including Saudi Arabia, have been pressing Washington for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, saying that is the only way to prevent the conflict from spreading beyond the Gaza Strip. In an interview with Reuters on Thursday, the chief negotiator for Yemen’s Houthis said the group’s attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea do not threaten its peace talks with Saudi Arabia, blaming Israel’s war on Gaza for dragging the Middle East into more regional conflict. “It has nothing to do with what is happening in the Gaza Strip, unless the Americans want to move other countries in the region to defend Israel which is another matter,” Mohammed Abdulsalam told Reuters. “The one who is dragging the region into a wider war is the one who allows the continuation of the aggression and the siege that continues for more than 100 days in the Gaza Strip.” The group is seeking to pressure the Israelis and Americans into a ceasefire, including lifting the siege on Gaza and moving towards peace and dialogue, Abdulsalam added. US forces have also been increasinglyattacked in Iraqand Syria in the aftermath of Israel’s now three-month-old offensive into Gaza, launched in response to the October 7 attack on Israel by Hamas.

"Lebanon and Israel ‘prefer’ diplomatic end to tensions, US envoy says",Hezbollah and Israel have been engaged in cross-border attacks since the early days of the Gaza war.,"Both Lebanon and Israel “prefer” a diplomatic deal to end tensions along their shared border, where Hezbollah and the Israeli army have been exchanging fire for the past three months, a United States envoy has said. Senior White House adviser Amos Hochstein spoke to reporters after meeting Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister, foreign minister, army commander and speaker of parliament during a visit to Beirut on Thursday. “We’re living in a crisis moment where we would like to see a diplomatic solution and I believe that both sides prefer a diplomatic solution,” he said, adding, “It’s our job to get one.” Hochstein said what’s needed is a diplomatic solution “that will allow for the Lebanese people to return to their homes in south Lebanon … as the people of Israel need to be able to return to their homes in their north”. Prior to his visit to Beirut, the envoy travelled to Israel last week to discuss the tensions on the border that have escalated as Israel’s months-long war on Gaza continues. “I’m hopeful that we can continue to work on this effort to arrive together, all of us on both sides of the border, with a solution that will allow for all people in Lebanon and Israel to live with guaranteed security and return to a better future,” he said. In a televised interview earlier this week, Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati said a potential deal to curb tensions along the border may be “linked” to the fighting in the Gaza Strip. “We are working on a diplomatic solution to the situation in the south, and its implementation will perhaps be linked to ending the assault on Gaza,” he said. Since the war began, Hezbollah, a close ally of the Palestinian group Hamas, and Israel have been engaged in intense fighting. So far, Israeli shelling has killed at least 25 Lebanese civilians and 140 Hezbollah fighters in southern Lebanon. According to the Israeli army, at least nine Israeli troops have been killed during the cross-border fighting. Washington fears that the tensions on the border could see Israel’s war on Gaza spread to the wider region, particularly after Israeli attacks this month killed senior Hamas official,Saleh al-Arouri, and Hezbollah commanderWissam al-Tawil. Israel has said it is giving diplomacy a chance to prevent Hezbollah from firing on people living in the north of the country and to push the group away from the border, warning that the army will otherwise take action to achieve its aims. Hezbollah has said that it does not seek a wider war but that if Israel launches a broader assault, it would not hesitate.

Day one of the ICJ genocide hearing against Israel: Key takeaways,South Africa laid out a list of alleged genocidal acts by Israel while seeking an injunction against the war.,"The International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague has held the first of a two-day hearing inSouth Africa’s genocide case against Israelover the war in Gaza. Even as the hearing, which will span Thursday and Friday, was being conducted, theongoing bombardmentof the Gaza Strip by Israeli forces killed more than 100 Palestinians and injured nearly 200 over the latest 24-hour reporting period, the Gaza Ministry of Health said on Thursday. Outside the court, pro-Palestinian demonstrators called for an end to Israel’s military operations. Here are the key takeaways from the first day of the hearing at the ICJ — and what Friday might hold.    Thehearingbegan with a reading of South Africa’s case against Israel and the demand that Israel should immediately suspend its military operations in Gaza as South Africa reminded the court that more than 23,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli attacks in the Gaza Strip since October 7. Pretoria’s ambassador to the Netherlands, Vusimuzi Madonsela, said: “South Africa acknowledges that the genocidal acts and permissions by the state of Israel inevitably form part of a continuum of illegal acts perpetrated against the people, Palestinian people since 1948.” Ronald Lamola, South Africa’s justice minister, said Israel’s response to the attacks by Hamas on October 7 in southern Israel “crossed a line”. “No armed attack on a state territory, no matter how serious, even an attack involving atrocity crimes, can provide justification for or defence to breaches to the [1948 Genocide] Convention whether it’s a matter of law or morality,” he said. Lamola added that the case presented the court with an opportunity to act in real time to prevent genocide from continuing in Gaza by issuing an injunction.    Adila Hassim, an advocate representing South Africa’s case, laid out what she argued were a series of violations of the Genocide Convention, which Israel is a party to. “South Africa contends that Israel has transgressed Article 2 of the convention by committing actions that fall within the definition of genocide. The actions show systematic patterns of conduct from which genocide can be inferred,” she said. Hassim then listed a number of “genocidal acts” committed by Israel. The “first genocidal act is mass killing of Palestinians in Gaza”, she said while showing photos of mass graves where bodies were buried “often unidentified”. No one – including newborns – was spared, she added. The second genocidal act was serious bodily or mental harm inflicted on Palestinians in Gaza in violation of Article 2B of the Genocide Convention, Hassim argued. Israel’s attacks have left close to 60,000 Palestinians wounded and maimed, the majority of them women and children. Hassim argued that large numbers of Palestinian civilians, including children, have been arrested, blindfolded, forced to undress, loaded onto trucks and taken to unknown locations. Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, a second lawyer representing South Africa, argued that “Israel’s political leaders, military commanders and persons holding official positions have systematically and in explicit terms declared their genocidal intent.” Ngcukaitobi recalled Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s comments on October 28, urging ground troops preparing to enter Gaza to “remember what Amalek has done to you.” “This refers to the biblical command by God to Saul for the retaliatory destruction of an entire group of people,” the lawyer said. Other Knesset members repeatedly called for Gaza to be wiped out, flattened, erased and crushed, the lawyer argued. “Soldiers believe that this language and their actions are acceptable because the destruction of Palestinian life in Gaza is articulated state policy,” Ngcukaitobi said.    The hearing then moved on to addressing the question of jurisdiction. John Dugard, a South African international law professor, pointed out that the obligations under the Genocide Convention are “erga omnes, obligations owed to the international community as a whole”. “State parties to this convention are obliged not only to desist from genocidal acts but also to prevent them,” Dugard said. He added that South Africa tried to reach the Israeli government via the embassy before filing the case. Max du Plessis, another lawyer representing South Africa, said UN bodies and experts as well as human rights organisations, institutions and states “have collectively considered the acts committed by Israel to be genocidal or at the very least warned that the Palestinian people [are] at risk of genocide”. South Africa’s legal representatives reminded the court that at this stage, it does not “have to determine whether or not Israel has or has not acted contrary to its obligations under the Genocide Convention” because this can be done only “at the merits stage”. Israel has repeatedly argued that it is acting in self-defence after Hamas fighters entered its territory on October 7, killed 1,139 people and took more than 200 people captive. In what appeared to be a preemptive argument aimed at blunting Israel’s calls for Hamas to be tried under international law, South Africa’s delegation noted that Hamas is not a state and cannot be a party to the Genocide Convention or to the proceedings at The Hague. After three hours of detailed descriptions of what South Africa said is a compelling case of genocide, the court was adjourned. The hearing will resume on Friday to hear Israel’s oral arguments. Thomas MacManus, senior lecturer in state crime at the School of Law, Queen Mary University of London, told Al Jazeera that South Africa’s case was “very impressive”. “They set out in a very concise way some devastating accusations strung together in such a legally sound way,” MacManus said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that hypocrisy and lies had been presented to the UN’s top court, adding that South Africa’s accusation against Israel of genocide in Gaza could only happen in a world turned upside-down. “We are fighting terrorists, we are fighting lies,” Netanyahu said. “Today we saw an upside-down world. Israel is accused of genocide while it is fighting against genocide.” “Israel is fighting murderous terrorists who carried out crimes against humanity: They slaughtered, they raped, they burned, they dismembered, they beheaded – children, women, elderly, young men and women,” he said. “The hypocrisy of South Africa screams to the heavens,” Netanyahu added. “Where was South Africa when millions of people were killed or torn from their homes in Syria and Yemen, by whom? By partners of Hamas.” Netanyahu said Israel would maintain the right to defend itself until it had achieved “total victory.” Lior Haiat, spokesperson for the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, labelled Thursday’s hearing as one of the “greatest shows of hypocrisy in history, compounded by a series of false and baseless claims”. He then accused South Africa of seeking to allow Hamas to return to Israel to “commit war crimes”. While any rulings by the ICJ may have little bearing on the war itself, one in favour of South Africa and the Palestinians would pile significant pressure on Israel’s number one backer: the United States. White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Thursday that the United States sees no basis for South Africa’s allegation of genocide against Israel over civilian deaths in Gaza.

"Blinken says path to a Palestinian state can stabilise region, isolate Iran",Top US diplomat stresses the need for a path to Palesitnian statehood as he ends latest visit to the Middle East.,"Offering Palestinians a path to statehood can stabilise the Middle East and isolate Iran, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said as he wrapped his latest visit to the region amid Israel’s continuing war on Gaza. Speaking to reporters on Thursday after meeting Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the US top diplomat said the region faced two paths, the first of which would see “Israel integrated, with security assurances and commitments from regional countries and as well from the United States, and a Palestinian state – at least a pathway to get to that state”. “The other path is to continue to see the terrorism, the nihilism, the destruction by Hamas, by the Houthis, by Hezbollah, all backed by Iran,” he said. “If you pursue the first path … that’s the single best way to isolate, to marginalise Iran and the proxies that are making so much trouble – for us and for pretty much everyone else in the region.” Blinken’s visit came a day after Egypt and Jordan warned that Israel’s military campaign, which has killed more than 23,000 people in Gaza according to the Health Ministry in the Palestinian territory, must not displace the strip’s 2.3 million people or end in an Israeli occupation. Blinken’s comments came after he visited several allies in the region, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Turkey in an effort to prevent the Gaza war setting off a regional conflagration. Israel’s northern border with Lebanon has seen almost daily exchanges of fire between the Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah and Israeli forces for the past three months. While the artillery exchanges have largely remained confined to areas along the border, the killing last week of a senior Hamas leader in Beirut and of several Hezbollah members have raised the prospect of a broader escalation. On a different front, the Iran-aligned Houthi rebels in Yemen continue to conduct attacks on vessels in the Red Sea threatening global commerce despite the US and Western allies threatening actions against the group if it continues its assaults. On Wednesday, the United Nations Security Councilpassed a resolutiondemanding the Houthis to “immediately cease all attacks”. US forces in Iraq and Syria have also faced a surge in attacks since the start of the war. Last week, the Iraqi government accused theUS of carrying out a drone attacktargeting an Iran-aligned paramilitary group in the capital Baghdad that killed and wounded several people. In his Middle Eastern tour, Blinken urged Arab countries to “keep a lid on things” to avoid a spread of the conflict. In the past few days, the US top diplomat also insisted on the necessity for Israel to reduce civilian casualties as images of the devastation caused by its bombardment of Gaza have triggered condemnation worldwide. On Thursday, South Africabrought Israel to the bench of the International Court of Justiceon genocide charges. Before travelling to Cairo, Blinken met Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank, where he reiterated theUS’s support for Palestinian statehoodand called for the PA to govern Gaza once the war is over. Such a scenario has not been endorsed by the Israeli political leadership which has failed so far to share plans for governance of Gaza after the war.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/11/blinken-says-path-to-a-palestinian-state-can-stabilise-region-isolate-iran
ICJ hears South Africa’s genocide case against Israel over Gaza war,"South Africa accuses Israel of violating the UN’s 1948 Genocide Convention, established in the wake of the Holocaust.","Israel faces accusations that it is subjecting Palestinians in Gaza to genocidal acts, as the International Court of Justice (ICJ) commenced ahearingon South Africa’s genocide case against it on Thursday. Amid Israel’s ongoing three-month war in Gaza, more than 23,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed, lawyers told the top United Nations court. Most of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million has been displaced, and an Israeli blockade severely limiting food, fuel and medicine has caused a humanitarian “catastrophe”, according to the UN. South Africa’s case in The Hague argues thatIsrael violatedthe 1948 genocide convention, established in the aftermath of the Holocaust, which mandates that all countries prevent the recurrence of such crimes. It filed an 84-page document with the court detailing acts it says amount to genocide in Gaza. Adila Hassim, a lawyer representing South Africa, told the ICJ that Israel had breached Article II of the Genocide Convention, which included the “mass killing” of Palestinians in Gaza. “Israel deployed 6,000 bombs per week … No one is spared. Not even newborns. UN chiefs have described it as a graveyard for children,” she said. “Nothing will stop the suffering, except an order from this court,” she added. South Africa has demanded that the ICJ order Israel to suspend its military campaign. Also called the World Court, the ICJ is the highest UN legal body that can adjudicate issues between member states. Alanna O’Malley, a professor of UN and international history, told Al Jazeera that South Africa’s case was a “historic” one. “We see from the invocation of the various articles of the Genocide Convention by the South African legal team the ways in which they are going to structurally present this case,” she said outside the court in The Hague, calling it “extremely compelling”. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said his nation was pursuing the case of what it called “the ongoing slaughter of the people of Gaza”. Israel will respond to the allegations made by South Africa on Friday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that hypocrisy and lies had been presented to the UN’s top court, adding that South Africa’s accusation against Israel of genocide in Gaza could only happen in a world turned upside-down. “We are fighting terrorists, we are fighting lies,” Netanyahu said. “Today we saw an upside-down world. Israel is accused of genocide while it is fighting against genocide.” “Israel is fighting murderous terrorists who carried out crimes against humanity: They slaughtered, they raped, they burned, they dismembered, they beheaded – children, women, elderly, young men and women,” he said. “The hypocrisy of South Africa screams to the heavens.” Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, another lawyer for South Africa, tackled the issue of Israel’s “genocidal intent” against the Palestinians in Gaza, usually the most difficult thing to prove in a case of this kind. “Israel’s political leaders, military commanders and persons holding official positions have systematically and in explicit terms declared their genocidal intent,” he said. “These statements are then repeated by soldiers on the ground in Gaza as they engage in the destruction of Palestinians and the physical infrastructure of Gaza.” Ngcukaitobi brought to the court’s attention Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s comments on October 28, 2023, urging ground troops preparing to enter Gaza to “remember what Amalek has done to you“.    “This refers to the Biblical command by God to Saul for the retaliatory destruction of an entire group of people,” the lawyer said. “The evidence of genocidal intent is not only chilling, it is also overwhelming and incontrovertible,” he added. Israel has rejected the accusations of genocide as baseless, with President Isaac Herzog calling the case “preposterous” and saying it constitutes a “blood libel”. On Thursday, Israel’s foreign ministry spokesman, Lior Haiat, called the case “hypocrisy” and accused South Africa of being the “legal arm” of Hamas. Gaza resident Aya Daloul said she hoped for a favourable decision and for the ICJ to help “stop the Israeli genocide against the Palestinians”. “The war must come to an end. We need to go back home and live in freedom and peace,” she told Al Jazeera. Outside the ICJ, a large number of demonstratorsgatheredto express solidarity with Palestinians and call for an end to Israel’s war, with people holding Palestinian flags and chanting occasionally: “Stop, stop genocide”, “We are all Palestinians” and “Boycott Israel”. “I’m here because we just can’t assist this genocide every day on social media and not do anything,” said Kim Wouters, a demonstrator who travelled from Brussels. Meanwhile, South Africans are feeling “a lot of pride” over the legal action taken by their country, said Al Jazeera’s Fahmida Miller, reporting from Pretoria. “What is happening in Gaza resonates very deeply with many South Africans because of their own history of apartheid, subjugation, oppression, institutionalised racism and the challenges South Africans have had to overcome,” she said. White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Thursday that the United States sees no basis for South Africa’s allegation of genocide against Israel over civilian deaths in Gaza.

Iran seizes oil tanker off Oman in dispute with US,The state-run IRNA news agency published a story acknowledging the seizure of an oil tanker by Iran’s navy.,"Iran has seized a tanker with Iraqi crude destined for Turkey in retaliation for the confiscation last year of the same vessel and its oil by the United States, Iranian state media reported, a move likely to stoke regional tensions. “The Navy of the Islamic Republic of Iran seized an American oil tanker in the waters of the Gulf of Oman in accordance with a court order,” the state-run IRNA news agency said. “After the theft ofIranian oilby the United States last year, St Nikolas tanker was seized by Iran’s Navy”, the navy said, as cited by the Iranian news agency Fars. The US condemned what it called an “unlawful seizure” and demanded Iran “immediately release the ship and its crew”. The seizure comes after weeks of attacks by Yemen’s Iranian-alignedHouthison vessels in the Red Sea. The Houthi rebels say they are carrying out the attacks in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza amid Israel’s assault on the territory. The group’s attacks have raised the risk of possible retaliatory strikes from US-led forces patrolling the busy waterway, especially after aUnited Nations Security Council voteon Wednesday condemning the Houthis. But while the Houthis have been concentrated on theBab al-Mandab Strait, to the southwest of the Arabian Peninsula, Thursday’s incident was located closer to the Strait of Hormuz, between Oman and Iran. The British maritime security firm Ambrey said the incident began at about 7:30am (03:30 GMT) when several armed men boarded the Marshall Islands-flagged St Nikolas, around 50 nautical miles east of Sohar in Oman, and then headed towards Bandar-e-Jask in Iran. TankerTrackers.com, which tracks and reports global shipments of crude oil, said the tanker was carrying “Iraqi oil” and previously went by the name Suez Rajan. Ambrey said the recently renamed tanker was previously prosecuted and fined for carrying sanctioned Iranian oil, which was confiscated by US authorities. The yearlong dispute ended with the US Department of Justice seizing one million barrels of Iranian crude. United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO), which is linked to the British military and provides warnings to sailors in the Middle East, said the incident began in waters between Oman and Iran, and it had received a report from the ship’s security manager of hearing “unknown voices over the phone” alongside the ship’s captain. Ambrey said that the men covered surveillance cameras as they boarded the vessel. As the tanker appeared to veer towards Bandar-e-Jask, its tracker was turned off, it added.    The St Nikolas was sailing from the Iraqi port of Basra to Turkey, according to MarineTraffic.com, a tracking website. The vessel was manned by a crew of 19, including 18 Filipino nationals and one Greek national, the operator said, adding that Turkish oil refiner Tupras chartered it. The Gulf of Oman, a key route for the oil industry that separates Oman and Iran, has witnessed a series of hijackings and attacks over the years, often involving Iran. Since the collapse of Iran’s nuclear deal, Iran and theUS Navy’s Fifth Fleet, which patrols the Middle East, also have had a series of tense encounters in the waterway. The US and its allies have also been seizing Iranian oil cargoes since 2019, which has led to a series of attacks in the Middle East attributed to Iran, as well as ship seizures by its military and paramilitary forces, threatening global shipping.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/11/iran-navy-says-seized-oil-tanker-off-oman-state-media-2
"NATO allies Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria sign deal to clear Black Sea mines","Initiative limited to three nations aims to make shipping safer, including for vessels transporting grain from Ukraine.","Turkey, Romania and Bulgaria have signed an agreement to clear mines drifting in the Black Sea that have posed a threat to shipping since the start ofRussia’s war in Ukraine. On Thursday, Turkish Defence Minister Yasar Guler said the deal establishes a Mine Countermeasures Task Group among the three NATO allies to deal with the mines as he met in Istanbul with his Romanian counterpart, Angel Tilvar, and Bulgarian Deputy Defence Minister Atanas Zapryanov. Zapryanov said mines pose a “danger to ports, communication networks and key water infrastructure” while Tilvar added that Russia’s “disdain for the norms of international law and its aggression in the Black Sea is not only a regional problem but also a problem with global consequences”. Sea mines have posed a threat to Ukraine’s Black Sea export routes since Russia’s invasion in February 2022, and several commercial ships have been hit, including a bulk carrier heading to a Danube River port to load grain in December. Ukraine has two main ports on the Danube – Reni and Izmail – which have become central to the country’s grain exports since Russia’s blockade of Ukraine’s Black Sea ports andMoscow’s withdrawalin July from a United Nations-backed agreement that had allowed grain shipments safe passage across the Black Sea. Three minehunting ships from each country and one command-control ship will be assigned to the initiative, a Turkish Ministry of National Defence official said. The initiative is open to only the three countries, whose naval commanders will form a committee to run the operation, Guler said, adding that it might include other Black Sea states after the war ends. Last week, Turkey said it would not allow two minehunter vessels donated toUkraine by Britainto transit its waters en route to the Black Sea because it would violate the 1936 Montreux Convention, an international pact concerning wartime passage of the Bosphorus and Dardanelles strait. At the start of the Ukraine war, Turkey enacted the convention to block the passage of Russian or Ukrainian ships through the two straits and also told non-Black Sea states not to send warships. Russia and Ukraine have blamed each other for stray mines that have washed up along Black Sea coasts.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/11/nato-allies-turkey-romania-bulgaria-sign-deal-to-clear-black-sea-mines
Oil tanker in Gulf of Oman boarded by masked men in military uniforms,Vessel bound for Turkey from Iraq was once at the centre of a crisis between Iran and the United States.,"Armed men wearing military uniforms and black masks have boarded an oil tanker near Oman, according to a British maritime security firm and the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) authority. In the latest in a spate of shipping incidents in the region, about four or five men boarded the Marshall Islands-flagged St Nikolas at about 7:30am (03:30 GMT) on Thursday, some 50 nautical miles east of Sohar in Oman and then headed towards Bandar-e-Jask in Iran, according to Ambrey, the maritime security firm. Tankertrackers.com, which tracks and reports global shipments of crude oil, identified the vessel as the St Nikolas and said it was carrying “Iraqi oil”.

Ambrey also said the recently renamed tanker was previously prosecuted and fined for carrying sanctioned Iranian oil, which was confiscated by US authorities. The yearlong dispute ended with the US Justice Department seizing one million barrels of Iranian crude. “Iran has previously taken action against those it has accused of cooperating with the US,” it added. The British military’s UKTMO, which provides warnings to sailors in the Middle East, said the incident began in waters between Oman and Iran, and it had received a report from the ship’s security manager of hearing “unknown voices over the phone” alongside the ship’s captain.

Greek shipping company Empire Navigation, which operates the vessel, acknowledged losing contact with it. It said a crew of 18 Filipinos and one Greek national were on board. The company also said the vessel was carrying 145,000 tonnes of oil from Basra to Aliaga in Turkey. Shipping in the region has been on heightened alert following weeks of drone and missile attacks by Yemen’s Houthis rebels in the Red Sea. The Houthis have been attacking commercial vessels in the Red Sea to show support for Palestinian armed group Hamas and against Israel’s war in Gaza. Those incidents had been concentrated on the Bab al-Mandab Strait, to the southwest of the Arabian Peninsula. Thursday’s incident is located closer to the Strait of Hormuz, between Oman and Iran.

Nobel winner joins push to boycott German cultural institutions over Gaza,"Author Annie Ernaux, Palestinian poet and activist Mohammed El-Kurd and actress Indya Moore call on artists to strike against German institutions.","Berlin, Germany –More than 500 global artists, filmmakers, writers and culture workers have announced a push against Germany’s stance on Israel’s war on Gaza, calling on creatives to step back from collaborating with German state-funded associations. Launched this week, the campaign, backed by French author and Nobel Prize for literature winner Annie Ernaux, and Palestinian poet and activist Mohammed El-Kurd, alleges Germany has adopted “McCarthyist policies that suppress freedom of expression, specifically expressions of solidarity with Palestine”. Other artists involved are the American actress, Indya Moore, British Turner Prize winner Tai Shani, and Lebanese alternative rock singer Hamed Sinno of the popular disbanded group Mashrou’ Leila. The German authorities’ actions over the past 97 days of war, the signatories say, have had a chilling effect throughout the nation, especially in the arts. “At a time when Palestinians are being slaughtered by a Germany-backed army at an unprecedented rate, and at a time of rising totalitarianism in German institutions, it is more important now than ever that good people reject anti-Palestinian racism assertively and publicly, and boycott the organisations that spread or give cover to that racism,” El-Kurd told Al Jazeera. “There can be no business as usual during genocide and there can be no collaboration with those who deny, justify or partake in the Israeli genocidal campaign currently waged on the Palestinian people in the besieged Gaza Strip. It’s our moral responsibility.” Called Strike Germany, the protest is in response to the continuing brutal Israeli assault on Gaza that since October 7 has killed more than 23,000 Palestinians, nearly 10,000 of them children. It aims to bring attention toGermany’s alleged crackdownon pro-Palestinian advocacy, which has beenwidely reportedamid the latest escalation of the Israel-Palestine conflict. Symbols of pro-Palestine support have been banned, authorities in Berlin have banned rallies, and, in a move that was widely condemned as discriminatory, the German president has called on Arabs todistance themselvesfrom Hamas. The artist-led coalition demands that German authorities should protect artistic freedom. “Cultural institutions are surveilling social media, petitions, open letters and public statements for expressions of solidarity with Palestine in order to weed out cultural workers who do not echo Germany’s unequivocal support of Israel,” organisers said. It also calls on German institutions to combat structural racism, referencing Germany’s 2019 resolution against theBoycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS)campaign. Should a swath of artists heed the call, German cultural events such as the upcoming Berlin Film Festival, as well as associations like the Goethe-Institut, and museums like Gropius Bau stand to be affected. “Strikes and boycotts are often effective in instigating political change,” Phillip Ayoub, a professor of political science at University College London, told Al Jazeera. “They disrupt existing power structures, and if done effectively, mobilise public support. At a minimum, they raise awareness around social problems and amplify the voices of those advocating on their behalf.” He said in the case of Germany’s “imbalanced and increasingly isolated response to the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza”, the latest campaign could challenge an “entrenched status quo that scholars and artists increasingly criticise as blind to Palestinian suffering and dehumanising of their lives”. Fearing personal or professional reprisal, one striking artist who requested anonymity said the withdrawal of artists represents “the refusal to comply with Germany’s absolute and unquestioning support for the Israeli state”. “The generous public funding for culture has been a trap. It has allowed the German state to censor, control and punish those it deems ideologically beyond the pale’,” said the artist. “Withdrawing means refusing to be an ornament to a state that fancies itself open-minded and a centre of progressive culture – but bans expressions of support with a people facing genocide. A genocide armed, in part, by the German state itself.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/11/artists-urged-to-reject-german-institutions-over-berlins-stance-on-gaza
"Iran identifies suspected bomb-maker behind twin blasts, arrests 35 people","Intelligence ministry says one alleged bomber identified as Tajikistan national, who entered Iran illegally last month.","Iranian authorities say they have identified the alleged ringleader who made bombs used in the twin bombings onJanuary 3in the southeastern city of Kerman that killed more than 90 people, state media reported. On Thursday, the Ministry of Intelligence said the main suspect who planned the bombings was a Tajik national known by his alias Abdollah Tajiki, the IRNA news agency reported. He had entered Iran in mid-December by crossing the southeast border, and left two days before the attack, after making the bombs, according to a statement from the ministry. The ISIL (ISIS) armed group claimed responsibility on January 4 for the attack in Kerman, about 820km (510 miles) southeast of the capital, Tehran, at a memorial for top commander Qassem Soleimani. Soleimani, the head of the elite Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), was killed in a drone strike in Iraq in 2020 ordered by then-United States President Donald Trump. On Thursday, authorities said the death toll from the attack had climbed to 94, among them 14 Afghan nationals. More than 280 people were wounded. So far 35 people have been arrested across several provinces with alleged links to the bombings, IRNA said. According to the ministry, one bomber first detonated his explosives at the ceremony in Kerman, then another attacked 20 minutes later as emergency workers and other people tried to help the wounded from the first blast. Last week, as funerals were held in Kerman, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi promised to retaliate for theattack,telling Tehran’s enemies that “our forces will decide on the place and time to take action”. The United Nations, the European Union and several countries, including China, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Iraq, denounced the bombings. Tehran frequently alleges that both Israel and the US support anti-Iran armed groups involved in past attacks. In 2022, ISIL claimed responsibility for an attack on an Iranian Shia shrine that killed 15 people. Earlier attacks attributed to ISIL include the 2017 twin bombings targeting Iran’s parliament and the mausoleum of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the republic.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/11/iran-identifies-suspected-bomb-maker-behind-twin-blasts-arrests-35-people
A quick guide to South Africa’s ICJ case against Israel,"As Israel defends itself against genocide charges, pro-Palestine campaigners hope the World Court will put an end to Gaza’s war.","The two-day public hearing in South Africa’s genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) begins on Thursday. The South African government brought the case against Israel on December 29, accusing it of “genocidal acts” in its assaults on Gaza. Palestinians and pro-Palestine campaigners around the world are hoping the ICJ might halt Israel’s devastating military campaign in Gaza, which has seen more than 23,000 people killed – nearly 10,000 of them children. Here’s the ICJ case, simplified:    The ICJ, also called the World Court, is the highest United Nations legal body that can adjudicate on issues between member states. It is separate from the International Criminal Court (ICC), which tries individuals in criminal cases. The ICJ comprises 15 judges appointed for nine-year terms through elections at the UN General Assembly (UNGA) and the Security Council (UNSC). The court’s rulings are binding and cannot be appealed by member states, but it depends on the UNSC to enforce the decisions.  South Africa has accused Israel of committing the crime of genocide in Gaza in violation of the 1948 Genocide Convention, which both countries are party to. The killing of Palestinians in Gaza in large numbers, especially children; destruction of their homes; their expulsion and displacement; blockade on food, water and medical assistance to the strip; the imposition of measures preventing Palestinian births by destroying essential health services crucial for the survival of pregnant women and babies, are all listed as genocidal actions in the suit. South Africa is requesting that the ICJ move urgently to prevent Israel from committing further crimes in the strip using “provisional measures” – essentially an emergency order that can be applied even before the main case begins. It argues that provisional measures are necessary “to protect against further, severe and irreparable harm to the rights of the Palestinian people under the Genocide Convention, which continue to be violated with impunity”.  Israel, which has lambasted South Africa for bringing the case, has promised to defend itself at the court. Senior Israeli officials, including President Isaac Herzog, have called the case “preposterous” and say it constitutes a “blood libel”. Israel is likely to argue that its killing of more than 23,000 people in Gaza is in self-defence. Herzog, speaking to visiting US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday, said Israel “will present proudly our case of using self-defense under our most inherent right under international humanitarian law”. The initial proceedings will likely last only a few weeks, so we should expect a sentencing from the court, in favour of or against South Africa’s urgent request, in a few weeks. The main case though, could take much longer – years. The ICJ’s deliberations are a painstaking process, involving detailed written submissions followed by oral arguments and counter-arguments by the team of top legal counsels representing each state. Experts say a sentence in this case could take three to four years.  After the initial proceedings this week on provisional measures, and later on in the main case, ICJ judges will take a vote to decide on a sentence. Judges ought to be impartial but in the past, some have voted in line with their countries’ politics. When the bench voted in favour of a decision to provisionally order Russia out of Ukraine in March 2022, judges from Russia and China voted against the decision. Several countries and organisations have backed South Africa’s suit. Malaysia, Turkey, Jordan, Bolivia, the Maldives, Namibia, Pakistan, Columbia, and members of the Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC) are among them. The European Union has been silent, but Israel has seen support from its number one backer and weapons supplier, the United States. Department of State spokesperson Matt Miller said in a statement the “allegations that Israel is committing genocide are unfounded”, but he added that Israel must “prevent civilian harm” and investigate allegations of humanitarian crimes.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/11/a-quick-guide-to-south-africas-icj-case-against-israel

UN Security Council demands Houthis stop Red Sea shipping attacks,Resolution backed by 11 members also calls for the immediate release of the seized Galaxy Leader’s multinational crew.,"The UN Security Council has passed a resolution demanding Yemen’s Houthis end attacks on ships in the Red Sea and free the Japanese-operated Galaxy Leader that was seized last year. Eleven members of the council voted on Wednesday for the measure calling on the Iran-aligned Houthis to “immediately cease all attacks, which impede global commerce and navigational rights and freedoms as well as regional peace”. Four members – Algeria, China, Mozambique and Russia – abstained. None voted against. As permanent members of the council, China and Russia have vetoes but chose not to use them. “The world’s message to the Houthis today was clear: Cease these attacks immediately,” Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the United States’ ambassador to the United Nations, said in a statement after the vote. The US sponsored the resolution alongside Japan. “With this resolution, the Council has lived up to its responsibility to help ensure the free flow of lawful transit through the Red Sea continues unimpeded,” Thomas-Greenfield added. The US says the Iran-backed Houthis have carried out 26 attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea since commandeering the Galaxy Leader and its 25-strong multinational crew on November 19. The Houthis claim they are targeting Israeli-linked or Israel-bound vessels in protest against the ongoing war on Gaza, but many of the ships have had no discernible link with the country, and many lines have begun to avoid the area altogether. The key provision of the resolution noted the right of United Nations member states, in accordance with international law, “to defend their vessels from attack, including those that undermine navigational rights and freedoms”. The provision amounts to an implicit endorsement of Operation Prosperity Guardian, a US-led multinational naval task force, including the United Kingdom and Norway, that was established in December to defend commercial shipping from Houthi attacks. Norway has one of the world’s largest merchant shipping fleets, and itsvessels have been targeted by the Houthis. Earlier on Wednesday, the US military said that it had shot down 21 Houthi missiles and drones that were part of a “complex attack” on southern Red Sea shipping lanes. The UK, which worked with the US to thwart the Houthi attack, said it was the largest in the area so far. The US accuses Iran of providing critical support for the Houthi attacks, including advanced missiles and drones, in violation of UN Security Council resolutions. Tehran denies the allegations. Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, the head of Yemen’s Houthi supreme revolutionary committee in Yemen, dismissed the UN resolution as a “political game” and claimed the US was the one violating international law. The Red Sea links the Middle East and Asia to Europe via the Suez Canal and its narrow Bab al-Mandeb Strait. Nearly 10 percent of all oil trade and an estimated $1 trillion in goods pass through the strait every year. At the time of its hijack, the Galaxy Leader – although ultimately owned by a firm linked to an Israeli businessman – was being operated by a Japanese shipping line with a crew from Bulgaria, Mexico, the Philippines, Romania and Ukraine. The Houthis have been engaged in a civil war with Yemen’s internationally recognised government since 2014.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/11/un-security-council-demands-houthis-stop-red-sea-shipping-attacks
‘Still no endgame’ as Blinken concludes latest Middle East tour: Analysts,Critics question whether Blinken’s trip is an exercise in ‘face-saving’ as US faces criticism over stance in Gaza war.,"As the United States’ top diplomat concludes hisfourth tourof the Middle East since the war in Gaza began, foreign policy analysts are questioning whether the visit was an act of diplomacy — or an exercise in “damage control”. On Wednesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken travelled from Israel to the West Bank and then Bahrain. The stops were part of a tour that included visits to Turkey, Greece, Jordan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, with a final stop in Egypt on Thursday. Much of the attention was on the US’s continued support of Israel, as it continues its months-long military campaign in Gaza. An estimated 23,357 Palestinians have died in that offensive, amid mounting concerns over human rights violations. At a Tel Aviv news conference on Tuesday, Blinken ran through oft-repeated themes: that the administration of US President Joe Biden “continues to stand” with Israel but thatcivilian casualties in Gazaremain “far too high”. Analysts described the latest tour as an attempt at “face-saving”, as Blinken sought to walk a fine line between exerting influence over Israel and failing to publicly exercise any real leverage. “We want this war to end as soon as possible,” Blinken told reporters on Tuesday. But three months into the war, an “endgame” remains elusive, said Michael Schaeffer Omer-Man, the director of research for Israel-Palestine at Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN). “There’s still no plan,” he told Al Jazeera. He cast doubt on Israel’s stated mission of eliminating the Palestinian group Hamas as part of the war. “Israelis are still living in fantasyland, in that they think they can accomplish the impossible, and the Americans are still in fantasyland [thinking] that they can bring Israelis around to something that’s acceptable to the world,” Omer-Man explained.    Critics warned that the US and Israel are also articulating different visions for the path forward after the war. On his visit to Tel Aviv, for example, Blinken called on Israel to accept a two-state solution for Palestine, something he againdiscussedwith Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on Wednesday. But Netanyahu hasrepeatedly rejectedany moves towards a two-state solution and has said Israel will maintain security control over Gaza for an indefinite period after the war. Two far-right Israeli officials — Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich — have also voiced a desire for the “voluntary migration” of Palestinians out of Gaza, something critics have interpreted as a push forethnic cleansing in the enclave. The latest rhetoric underscored the “yawning gap” between Washington’s vision for a post-war Gaza and what Israel’s government is willing to accept, according to Joshua Landis, the director of the Center of Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma. “Netanyahu, who has said numerous times that America is easy to manipulate and who has done end runs around one president after the next, is doing an end run around Biden,” Landis told Al Jazeera. “He’s getting all the arms he wants, and he’s continuing to do this massive damage in Gaza, and he’s not moderating his government officials, who are constantly spouting out this hate messaging, which is embarrassing America in front of the world,” he said. Still, Blinken sought to claim some victories during the trip. He announced, for instance, that US and Israeli officials had agreed on a plan for a United Nations assessment mission in northern Gaza to “determine what needs to be done to allow displaced Palestinians to return safely to homes in the north”. That announcement came before the World Health Organization (WHO)cancelledits latest aid mission to northern Gaza, saying Israeli approval and security assurances had not been granted. Blinken also hailed Israel’sannouncementthat it would begin to shift some troops out of Gaza, describing it as a transition to a “lower-intensity phase” in the enclave. On Monday, in interviews with the New York Times and Wall Street Journal, Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said his country would move from the “intense-manoeuvring phase of the war” to “types of special operations”, in an effort to reduce civilian casualties. However, intense fighting would continue in the centre and south of Gaza. Hours later, speaking at a campaign event in South Carolina, Biden said in unscripted remarks that he had been “quietly working with the Israeli government to get them to reduce and significantly get out of Gaza”.    But far from acquiescing to US pressure, DAWN’s Omer-Man said talk of a strategic shift was more likely a response to South Africa’sproceedingsagainst Israel at the UN’s International Court of Justice (ICJ). South Africa has accused Israel of genocide in Gaza and requested a provisional injunction that would, in theory, order Israel to stop its operations. Preliminary hearings are set to take place on Thursday and Friday. Israel’s rhetoric about shifting tactics is “absolutely designed so they can tell the ICJ that any interim measures are not relevant any more because major military operations have ended”, Omer-Man explained. “I think a big part of this is the US and Israel trying to preempt [the ICJ hearings] in some way.” For his part, speaking in Tel Aviv, Blinken dismissed the charge of genocide as “meritless”. Blinken’s latest trip through the Middle East has also coincided with increased fighting along Israel’s northern border with Lebanon, where there have been a string ofhigh-profile assassinationsin recent days. Those include the killing of Hamas deputy leaderSaleh al-Arouriin Beirut, which Israel has yet to claim or deny, as well as the killing of Hezbollah commander Wissam Hassan al-Tawil on Monday. Randa Slim, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Middle East Institute, described the killings as part of an “escalatory trend” fuelled by Israeli officials pledging to “change the status quo” in the Hezbollah stronghold of southern Lebanon. Hezbollah is an Iran-backed movement, and fighting along the Lebanon-Israel border has fuelled fears of a wider regional conflict erupting, with Iran and other countries potentially entering the fray. “[The US] is concerned that things might get out of control. They are concerned about voices inside the Israeli war cabinet who want to escalate the Hezbollah-Israel front, who want to basically finish what they had not done in 2006,” she said, referring to Israel’s ground invasion of southern Lebanon during the Israel-Hezbollah war.    On Tuesday, Blinken was asked if the strikes surrounding his visit undermined US calls to avoid any escalation with Iranian proxy forces and potentially Iran itself. “One thing that we’ve heard clearly every place we’ve gone, including in Israel, is that escalation is in no one’s interest. No one’s seeking it,” Blinken said. For his part, Omer-Man said there was less “daylight” between Israel and the US over the actions along the Israel-Lebanon border. The two countries remain united in their opposition to Iran. “Whatever public messaging is coming out of the US and Israel is really just meant to play ‘good cop, bad cop’,” he said. “Whether it’s chosen roles or understood roles.” Nevertheless, Landis at the University of Oklahoma said the broader strategy behind the Blinken visit was damage control in the Middle East. Washington has consistently refused to support a ceasefire in Gaza, and it has continued to offerweapons and political supportto Israel’s operations. That has strained relations with many of its Arab allies in the Middle East. “The major pillars of US strategy have been badly hurt,” Landis said. He added that those weakened relationships could result in the “years-long” delay — if not a “death knell” — forIsraeli-Arab normalisation schemessought by the White House. The US stance on Gaza might also set backefforts to calm tensionswith Iran and its proxies as part of a wider pivot to Asia.    As the Middle East Institute’s Slim told Al Jazeera: “The region, minus Israel, is not interested in listening to the Americans until the Americans call for a ceasefire.” Meanwhile, at home, Biden has faced criticism over his Gaza stance from within his own Democratic Party — and indeed within his own administration — as the humanitarian situationcontinues to worsen.Pollsshow a majority of Americans support a call for a ceasefire. But with little indication that the US will attempt to assert leverage over Israel, Blinken’s latest trip to the Middle East is fundamentally “performative”, according to Osamah Khalil, a history professor at Syracuse University. “There is a face-saving domestic consumption element for [the Biden administration] and a separate face-saving element to allow Israel to claim some kind of victory,” Khalil said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/11/still-no-endgame-as-blinken-concludes-latest-middle-east-tour-analysts
"US top diplomat Blinken meets Abbas, discusses Palestinian statehood",US secretary of state travelled to the occupied West Bank during his fourth trip to the region since the Gaza war began on October 7.,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has held talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank, where the two leaders discussed post-war plans for Gaza, including steps towards the establishment of a Palestinian state. The visit on Wednesday came as part of the US top diplomat’s fourth trip to the region since Israel’s war in Gaza started on October 7. After the meeting, Blinken made a surprise trip to Bahrain, while Abbas met neighbouring country leaders in Jordan. Blinken’s arrival in Ramallah was met by a group of protesters who held up signs that read “Stop the genocide”, “Free Palestine” and “Blinken out”. Some scuffled with Palestinian security forces in riot gear. Blinken discussed efforts to “minimise civilian harm” in Gaza and increase the delivery of aid inside the besieged enclave, according to astatementfrom the US Department of State, points he had madea day earlierduring a visit to Israel. He also expressed support for a Palestinian state and encouraged “administrative reforms” of the Palestinian Authority (PA), the State Department added. The PA said Abbas told Blinken that no Palestinians should be displaced from Gaza or the West Bank. Hamas, meanwhile, rejected Blinken’s visit to the region. “The aim of the visit was to support the security of the occupation. There are no differences between Israel and the Americans,” Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told the Reuters news agency. In a statement, Hamas also said the US official’s “attempts to justify the genocide committed by the Israeli occupation army against Palestinian civilians … are miserable attempts to wash the hands of the criminal occupation of the blood of children, women and the elderly of Gaza”. In three months of war, more than 23,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in the Israeli bombardment. The war was launched after fighters from Hamas, the group that governs Gaza, attacked communities in southern Israel killing approximately 1,200 people there.    Since the start of the war, the US has repeatedly stated that the PA should govern Gaza once Israel has achieved its objective of eliminating Hamas. The PA, which exercises limited self-rule in the occupied West Bank, lost control of the strip to Hamas in 2007. Its popularity across the Palestinian territories has been waning over the years. After travelling to Bahrain later on Wednesday, Blinken said he discussed the role that regional powers will play in a post-conflict Gaza and efforts to bring countries in the region together. He added that this would happen in a way that “provides for the security of Israel and also provides a pathway to Palestinians for a state of their own”. Blinken also said Abbas agreed “to move forward and engage in some of these efforts” and is prepared to “reform” the PA so it can take control of a united Gaza and occupied West Bank. Blinken declined to characterise how Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his cabinet responded to his appeal for a Palestinian state. He said Israel would have to make “hard decisions, hard choices” to take advantage of the opportunity offered by regional integration. “Extremist settler violence carried out with impunity, settlement expansion, demolitions, evictions, all make it harder, not easier for Israel to achieve lasting peace and security,” he said at a news conference. Since October 7, violence in the occupied West Bank has increased to levels unseen in nearly two decades. Since then at least 314 Palestinians, including 81 minors, have been killed, figures from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). Later on Wednesday, Abbas was in Jordan to meet King Abdullah and Egyptian President Abdel Fatah el-Sisi, who stressed at the end of an Arab summit in Aqaba that pressure should be increased to end Israel’s “aggression” against Gaza and protect civilians there. In a palace statement, both leaders rejected any Israeli plans to separate the fate of Hamas-controlled Gaza from the Israeli-occupied West Bank, adding the two entities were the basis of a future Palestinian state. Jordan and Egypt also restated their rejection of any plans to displace Palestinians from their lands. A statement issued by el-Sisi’s office said the international community needed to show a “decisive stance” to push for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Egypt says has grown as Israel’s war against Hamas has driven most Gaza residents southward towards the Egyptian border. The Arab leaders confirmed “a complete rejection of any attempt to reoccupy parts of Gaza, and the need to enable its people to return to their homes”, the statement added. Blinken’s visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories comes after he toured Washington’s allies in the Middle East, including Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates who he said want closer relations with Israel but only if that included a “practical pathway” to a Palestinian state.

WHO facing ‘near insurmountable challenges’ in Gaza aid delivery,"The UN says it remains ‘ready’ to deliver aid to Gaza, calls on Israel to approve access requests.","The UN health agency has deplored the lack of access to Gaza for the delivery of much-needed humanitarian assistance, amidintense bombardmentin the southern part of the besieged Palestinian enclave. “Delivering aid to Gaza continues to face near insurmountable challenges,” the World Health Organisation Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus said during a news conference on Wednesday in Geneva. “We have the supplies, the teams and the plans in place. What we don’t have is access,” he said, stressing that the UN and its partners remained “completely ready” to deliver assistance to Gaza Palestinians. Israeli authorities have repeatedly refused to allow UN aid teams to deliver desperately needed humanitarian relief inside Gaza, effectively cutting off hospitals and residents from lifesaving medical supplies. “We call on Israel to approve requests from WHO and its partners to deliver humanitarian aid,” Ghebreyesus said. Israel’s Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories, or COGAT, has repeatedlyblamed the world bodyfor failing to deliver supplies at a fast enough pace. Moshe Tetro, head of COGAT, on Wednesday denied any bottlenecks on the Israeli end preventing aid from reaching the enclave. “The problem lies with the international organisations processing and receiving the aid,” he said, according to The Times of Israel. Richard Peeperkorn, WHO representative for the Occupied Palestinian Territory, claimed instead that the UN has been operating within a “shrinking humanitarian space”. “There should be more avenues to get into Gaza, but also to work within Gaza,” he said, adding that humanitarian corridors were to be expected even in the absence of a ceasefire. The UN health agency said six humanitarian missions to northern Gaza – where the situation is most dire amid a total collapse of the healthcare system – have been cancelled since December 26 due to the lack of necessary permissions to proceed safely. “If you do not get a permission, you cannot move, and our requests were repeatedly rejected,” Peeperkorn said. Only about a third of Gaza’s hospitals are functioning totally or partially WHO officials on Tuesday voiced concern about the possible collapse of hospital provision in southern and central Gaza, as fighting intensifies and hundreds of medical staff and patients flee medical facilities. “The international community must not allow this to happen in the middle and southern areas,” Peeperkorn said. Three hospitals located near evacuation zones – European Gaza Hospital, Nasser Medical Complex and Al-Aqsa – are providing a lifeline to about two million people. On Wednesday, Al Jazeera correspondents reported explosions in front of the Al Aqsa Hospital in central Gaza. The area around the compound has come under intense fire in recent days. Sean Casey, WHO emergency medical teams coordinator in Gaza, warned on Tuesday that Gaza cannot afford to lose more medical infrastructure. “We cannot lose these health facilities. They absolutely must be protected. This is the last line of secondary and tertiary healthcare that Gaza has – from the north to the south, it’s been dropping, hospital after hospital,” he said. At least 23,357 people have been killed and more than 59,410 wounded in Israeli attacks on Gaza since October 7, according to Palestinian authorities. Significant damage has been inflicted upon critical infrastructure, including water purification systems. Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO’s infectious disease epidemiologist expert, said the organisation detected a number of indicators – including respiratory illnesses and diarrhoea – that point to the spread of infectious diseases in Gaza. “These are a manifestation of multiple diseases, but we can’t get to the bottom of it because we don’t have access to testing,” Van Kerkhove said. “By the time we identify the disease, it will be at a late stage,” she added.

Morocco to lead UN Human Rights Council despite South Africa’s disapproval,"Secret vote held after 13 African members could not agree on a candidate, as some criticise Rabat’s human rights record.","Morocco has won a vote to lead the United Nations Human Rights Council despite protests from South Africa that Rabat’s human rights record mean it is unfit to lead the council. In a vote in Geneva on Wednesday, Morocco’s Ambassador Omar Zniber was elected council president after he received 30 votes, while his South African opponent, Ambassador Mxolisi Nkosi, secured 17. It was Africa’s turn to take the presidency of the UN Human Rights Council, but because African nations could not agree on a candidate from among the 13 members, a secret ballot was conducted. Following his success, Zniber said the council’s work was “so important and so fundamental: the promotion of, respect toward and guarantee of human rights as universally recognised”, according to a statement from the body. Morocco also said it “sees a strong signal sent by the international community in favour of its constructive approach, and its unifying leadership on key subjects such as inter-religious dialogue, tolerance and the fight against racial hatred, the right to a healthy and sustainable environment, migrants’ rights and the impact of new technologies”. Prior to the vote, Nkosi told the Reuters news agency that Morocco was the “antithesis of what the council stands for”. “For a country with all these challenges to aspire to be the face of Human Rights Council, and God forbid if they get elected this will shatter whatever shred of legitimacy this council ever had,” he added, speaking on Tuesday. Morocco, in response, accused South Africa and other African states of undermining its efforts to hold the prestigious but mostly symbolic position. “The Kingdom’s election, supported by a large number of countries around the globe in spite of Algeria’s and South Africa’s efforts to counter it, demonstrates the trust and the credibility inspired by Morocco’s external actions,” the Morocco Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. Part of the dispute between the countries revolves around Morocco’s sovereignty claim over Western Sahara, where the Algeria-backed Polisario Front seeks independence. Morocco has denied allegations of rights abuses against its opponents there.  While Rabat has been courting countries to back its sovereignty claims, it has yet to gain the support of South Africa, which helped organise an event in Geneva last year to promote the self-determination of the Sahrawi people. Moroccan and international nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) have regularly condemned the repression of journalists, activists and human rights through the use of trials for common law crimes, particularly sexual offences, or through digital surveillance. Morocco is also accused of using Pegasus spyware to hack the phones of journalists, activists and politicians, both Moroccan and foreign. But authorities have refuted the claims, calling them “unjust and fantasist” allegations. NGOs have also criticised the alleged persistent discrimination against women and minorities. The UN Human Rights Council was established in 2006 and is tasked with protecting and promoting human rights around the world, and addressing violations.

Israeli army appears to change tack on strike that killed Gaza journalists,Al Jazeera journalists Hamza Dahdouh and Mustafa Thuraya were killed in a targeted strike on their car in Khan Younis.,"The Israeli military has seemingly walked back its justification for targeting a vehicle in Gaza last week, killing two Al Jazeera journalists, United States broadcaster NBC reported. Hamza Dahdouh, the eldest son of Al Jazeera’s Gaza bureau chief Wael Dahdouh,was killedin an Israeli missile strike on Sunday in Khan Younis, southern Gaza. Journalist Mustafa Thuraya was also killed in the attack, while a third passenger, journalist Hazem Rajab, was seriously injured. At the time of the attack, the Israeli army said it was targeting a “terrorist” in the vehicle. It confirmed in a statement that a military aircraft “identified and struck a terrorist who operated an aircraft that posed a threat to (Israeli) troops,” adding that “we are aware of the reports that during the strike, two other suspects who were in the same vehicle as the terrorist were also hit”. However,when askedif Israel had any proof that a so-called terrorist was present in the car, army spokesperson Daniel Hagari described the incident to NBC as “unfortunate”, and said that an investigation was continuing to determine what happened. “Every journalist who dies, it’s unfortunate,” Hagari told NBC. “We understand they were putting a drone, using a drone. And using a drone in a war zone, it’s a problem. It looks like the terrorists,” adding that Hamas uses drones to collect intel on Israeli forces. “We will investigate this incident and we will provide the data,” Hagari said. Calling for an independent investigation into the strike, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said: “Israel first said it lethally targeted a car carrying journalists in Gaza because there was a terrorist in the car. Now it says that the use by a journalist of a drone made it ‘look like’ they were terrorists.” CPJ’s Middle East and North Africa Programme Coordinator Sherif Mansour said: “Targeting of civilians is illegal. Journalists use equipment like cameras and drones for their work. It does not make them terrorists and should certainly not make them targets.” Al Jazeera correspondents said that the car with the journalists was hit as they were trying to interview civilians displaced by previous bombings. The Al Jazeera Media Network strongly condemned the attack saying the “assassinations” of Dahdouh and Thuraya reaffirmed the need “to take immediate necessary legal measures against the (Israeli) occupation forces to ensure that there is no impunity”. In October, Dahdouh’s mother, brother, sister and nephew were killed in an Israeli air raid. His father Wael was injured in a drone attack last month, which killed Al Jazeera journalist and cameramanSamer Abudaqa. More than 100 journalists have been killed in Gaza since the current conflict broke out on October 7. More journalists have been killed in three months of Israel’s war on Gaza than in all of World War II or the Vietnam War. CPJ data shows that more journalists were killed in the first 10 weeks of the conflict than have ever been killed in a single country over an entire year.

"US, UK forces shoot down 21 drones and missiles fired by Houthis",No injuries or damage reported in what the US military said was the 26th attack by the Yemen-based group since November 19.,"The United States military’s Central Command (CENTCOM) has said it shot down 18 drones launched by Yemen’s Houthi rebels over the southern Red Sea, the armed group’s 26th attack on international shipping lanes in the last seven weeks. Working with forces from the United Kingdom, CENTCOM said two anti-ship cruise missiles and one anti-ship ballistic missile were also brought down. The Houthis “launched a complex attack of Iranian designed one-way attack UAVs … anti-ship cruise missiles, and an anti-ship ballistic missile” from areas in Yemen controlled by the Iran-aligned rebels into the southern Red Sea, CENTCOM said in a statement on Wednesday. The attack was the 26th by theHouthison shipping lanes in the Red Sea since November 19 when it hijacked the Galaxy Leader, a vehicle carrier that was on its way from Turkey to India. The group said it began the attacks in protest atIsrael’s war on Gaza. CENTCOM said fighter jets from the Dwight D Eisenhower aircraft carrier and four destroyers, including one from the UK, took part in the operation. UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said that the HMS DIAMOND, along with US warships, repelled what he called “the largest attack by the Iranian-backed Houthis in the Red Sea to date”. “Destroying multiple attack drones with her guns and sea viper missiles,” he added on X, calling the attacks “illegal”.

The US last month formed aninternational maritime coalitionto deal with the attacks, which have prompted some shipping lines to take the longer sea route around southern Africa and avoid the Red Sea altogether. The Houthis have said they will continue their attacks until Israel halts the conflict in Gaza. CENTCOM said US forces shot down a drone launched from Yemen over the weekend, while Vice Admiral Brad Cooper, the commander of US naval forces in the Middle East, said the Houthis had launched an explosives-laden sea drone into shipping lanes last week – the first time they had used such a weapon in the current conflict. The Houthis say they are targeting Israeli-linked vessels but Cooper said dozens of countries have connections to ships that have been attacked. At the time of its hijack, the Galaxy Leader – although ultimately owned by a firm linked to an Israeli businessman – was being operated by the Japanese shipping line NYK and most of its 25-strong multinational crew were from the Philippines. Other vessels have had nodiscernible links to Israel. The White House said the Houthi attacks were “escalatory” and that the US will consult with its partners about next steps if these attacks continue. “Despite what the Houthis may say, they are threatening and targeting commercial vessels with ties to countries all over the world, many of which have no connection to Israel whatsoever,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said. ” These attacks are unlawful and escalatory,” he said. The United Nations Security Council was set to vote on Wednesday on a draft resolution put forward by the US that condemns the attacks on merchant shipping in the Red Sea, and demands the immediate end to such actions as well as the release of the Galaxy Leader and its crew.    Japan’s UN envoy Yamazaki Kazuyuki told a security council briefing last week that Japan was “outraged by the armed seizure and continued holding” of the Galaxy Leader and its crew. “We see no reason to tolerate such an injustice, and strongly demand the release of the Galaxy Leader and its crew immediately and unconditionally,” he said. The war in Gaza erupted on October 7 when armed group Hamas carried out a shock cross-border attack and killed 1,139 people in Israel.

Q&A: Former Biden appointee says US policy is ‘dehumanising’ Palestinians,Al Jazeera speaks to Tariq Habash about why he resigned from the Biden administration amid Israel’s war on Gaza.,"Tariq Habash says it was “the only thing” he could do. A Palestinian American and political appointee in the United States Department of Education, Habash drew headlines last week when he became the second official to publicly resign from the administration of President Joe Biden over its response to the war in Gaza. Since October, Israel has bombarded the Palestinian enclave, killing more than 23,210 people. But the White House has continued to voice staunch support for Israel, its top ally in the Middle East. Habash said he resigned because he could no longer “represent an administration that does not value all human life equally”. “I cannot stay silent as this administration turns a blind eye to the atrocities committed against innocent Palestinian lives, in what leading human rights experts have called a genocidal campaign by the Israeli government,” he wrote in his resignation letter. Other administration staffers andformer Biden campaign workershave also spoken out since the war began on October 7, following Hamas’s attacks in southern Israel that killed 1,200 people. In letters and other statements, the staffers urged the president to demand a ceasefire. Yet, while Biden and his senior officials have called on Israel to do more to minimise civilian casualties, Washington remains opposed to a ceasefire. The US stands with Israel in its mission to “ensure that October 7 never happens again”, Secretary of StateAntony Blinken saidduring a news conference in Jerusalem on Tuesday. Al Jazeera host Nick Clark spoke to Habash about his decision to resign and the effect US support for Israel has had on Palestinians as the war on Gaza continues. Al Jazeera: What goes through your mind when you hear Blinken singing the same old song when he’sspeaking from Israel, basically backing Israel’s efforts in Gaza with weapons the US supplied? Tariq Habash:It’s hard to hear. Unfortunately, we’re in a situation where the indiscriminate bombing of over 2 million people in Gaza has continued for over three months now. And it’s clear that the messaging and the policy is not really shifting. I think there’s a clear acknowledgement that there is too much violence, too much harm, that has fallen on innocent Palestinian lives, but we continue to fall short of acknowledging the humanity and the right to life for those Palestinians. And it’s difficult to hear. Al Jazeera: You had a significant, important job in the Biden administration. Take us through, if you would, why you did make the decision that you did in the end. Habash:For me, as a Palestinian American, as a Palestinian man, as a Palestinian Christian, my identity is intertwined with everything that has been happening. And the reality is that there has been a near-daily dehumanising effect of our [the US’s] current policies and just what is allowed to persist in terms of the aggression against Palestinian life. I, for weeks, used every avenue I could to raise concerns about these policies, to emphasise the importance of humanising Palestinians — Palestinian men too, Palestinian Christians who are a significant minority in the region now. That message, it fell on deaf ears, and it was clear that the only thing I could do in this moment to emphasise my consternation, my concern, with the ongoing policy was to resign. Al Jazeera: When you say it fell on deaf ears, what actually happened? Did people tell you just to keep quiet and not mention it? How did it unfold? Habash:It wasn’t necessarily like, “Keep quiet.” The White House held listening sessions, policy briefings, which was mostly just communicating to us what their assessment of the region is — of the circumstance as it was unraveling. Within the Department of Education, there was a lot of understanding, even from the secretary himself, who I met with and spoke with on numerous occasions, about how the violence was affecting me on a personal level. There was a lot of patience and constant support from my own building. But I think being able to communicate about that on a personal level is very different from acknowledging how the broader policies are affecting millions of people in the region — and also millions of Americans who broadly support an end to this violence and apermanent ceasefire. Al Jazeera: It must have been extremely hard for you to hear what was being said effectively by your boss, the president, when he said he didn’t, for example, necessarily trustPalestinian figuresfor the number of dead. Habash:Absolutely. I talk about that in my [resignation] letter. There are certain things that I think were really dangerous rhetoric used by the administration over the last three months that allowed and facilitated the level of destruction against the Gaza Strip and the millions of people that live there today.    Al Jazeera: You talked about growing support for the Palestinian cause in the United States.Protesters interruptedPresident Biden’s speech yesterday in South Carolina. We’re likely to see more of that in this election year. To what degree do you think this is going to affect Democrats’ hopes in the election polls? Habash:I think it’s up to the president and the Democratic Party more broadly to make a decision, but I think we’re seeing it affect that [support for Democrats] right now. Like you said, there were protests at the [South Carolina] church where the president spoke. There were protests across New York City that shut down four different tunnels and bridges. This is something that we’re starting to see more of because I think the soul of the American people really does believe in an end to the violence here. We see a majority of Americans support a ceasefire. We see the vast majority of the Democratic base — young voters, voters of colour — who do not believe that the current policies are reflective of their values. The president has frequently, in the last week, talked about what 2024 means with respect to protecting democracy from an authoritarian regime that would be possible under [former President and 2024 Republican frontrunner Donald] Trump. That’s a really important and critical message, but I think it’s also inconsistent with what the president is doing with respect to his deference to an authoritarian, right-wing regime in the Israeli government and its oppression of millions of Palestinians. Al Jazeera: Democrats can disagree all they like with President Biden, but what are they going to do? Are they just going to turn turtle and vote for Trump? Habash:I think it’s up to the president to decide how important his voters are and understanding that they really do value human life, regardless of whose lives it is. It’s clear that the current policies put restrictions on when Palestinian lives matter and when they don’t, and I think that’s a problem for voters.

British FM ‘worried’ Israel may have breached international law in Gaza,David Cameron spoke to a parliamentary committee about whether Israel was ‘vulnerable to a challenge’ from the ICC.,"British Foreign Minister David Cameron has said he is worried that Israel’s war on Gaza may have included breaches of international law, and while the advice he received so far was that Israel was compliant, there were questions to answer. Speaking to the British parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee on Tuesday, Cameron said some of what he had seen during the war in the besieged Palestinian territory was “deeply concerning”. Asked during a question-and-answer session with lawmakers if Israel could be “vulnerable to a challenge” from the International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Hague over whether its actions were proportionate, Cameron said the stance was “close to that”. While the former prime minister did not directly answer questions about whether he had received legal advice that Israel might have broken the law, he said some incidents had raised questions over whether there had been breaches. “Am I worried that Israel has taken action that might be in breach of international law because this particular premises has been bombed, or whatever? Yes, of course,” Cameron said. He added that there was always a “question mark” over whether a given incident had broken international law, which lawyers would examine and advise him over. “The advice has been so far that they [Israel] have the commitment, the capability and the compliance [with international law], but on lots of occasions, that is under question,” he said.    The United Kingdom has reaffirmed its support for Israel multiple times and backed its right to defend itself against Hamas, but has also called on the Israeli military to show restraint and act within international law in its offensive in Gaza. The Foreign Affairs Committee scrutinises the work of the UK’s foreign ministry, to which Cameron was appointed late last year. During Israel’s relentless bombardment of Gaza, at least 23,210 people have been killed, according to the Palestinian health ministry, and most homes in the Gaza Strip have beendestroyed. Cameron, who sits in the parliament’s upper chamber as an unelected minister, said it would take “a giant effort” to rebuild Gaza due to the level of destruction being so “great”. “We’re going to need as many people as possible. It will take more than any one country to do it,” he said. He also said that he had seen figures that show Hamas fighters had lost “over 50 percent of their capability and capacity” to fire rockets into Israel. Amid growing concern over the Gaza death toll and theSouth Africa genocide caseagainst Israel, United States Secretary of StateAntony Blinkenurged Israeli leaders on Tuesday to avoid future harm to civilians and civilian infrastructure.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/9/british-fm-worried-israel-may-have-breached-international-law-in-gaza
Israel’s war on Gaza and the ‘obligation to prevent genocide’,Experts say ICJ case accusing Israel of genocide highlights Genocide Convention duties and a need for political will.,"It was just days into Israel’s bombardment of the Gaza Strip when a grave warning rang out. United Nationsexpertshad sounded the alarm that Palestinians in Gaza faced a risk of genocide. The Israeli army was battering the coastal enclave, forcing most of the population from their homes and imposing a stringent blockade barring food, water and other supplies from getting in. Morewarningshave since followed alongside calls for the international community to act. Now, as the International Court of Justice (ICJ) is set to heara casealleging Israel is committing genocidal acts in Gaza, global attention is again focused on what can — or should — be done to stop the war and prevent crimes like genocide. South Africa, the country that brought the case to the ICJ, invoked in its decision an “obligation to prevent genocide” as a signatory to the United Nations Genocide Convention — something experts say is a critical step in such cases. “Genocide is seen as having under international law this special character that it’s relevant to everyone,” explained Mark Kersten, assistant professor of criminology and criminal justice at University of the Fraser Valley in Canada. “What South Africa is saying, amongst many other things, is that it has the obligation to prevent genocide under the Genocide Convention and therefore the obligation to do something about what it sees as genocide in Gaza,” he told Al Jazeera.    Signed in 1948 in the aftermath of World War II, the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide — the Genocide Convention — “codified for the first time the crime of genocide”. It “signified the international community’s commitment to ‘never again’ after the atrocities committed during the Second World War”, the UNsayson its website. Today, 153 countries arepartiesto the convention, confirming “that genocide, whether committed in time of peace or in time of war, is a crime under international law which they undertake to prevent and to punish”. States can meet their obligation to prevent genocide in several ways, including by appealing — as South Africa has done — to the ICJ, the UN’s top court. In its filing,South Africa arguedthat Israel has not only “failed to prevent genocide”, but it also “engaged in, is engaging in and risks further engaging in genocidal acts against the Palestinian people in Gaza”. “The acts in question include killing Palestinians in Gaza, causing them serious bodily and mental harm, and inflicting on them conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction. The acts are all attributable to Israel, which has failed to prevent genocide and is committing genocide in manifest violation of the Genocide Convention,” the submission (PDF) reads. “South Africa is acutely aware of the particular weight of responsibility in initiating proceedings against Israel for violations of the Genocide Convention. However, South Africa is also acutely aware of its own obligation — as a State party to the Genocide Convention — to prevent genocide.”    This goes further than other genocide cases previously heard by the court, said Kersten. An important precedent, however, was a case (PDF) brought by The Gambia in 2019. It argued that Myanmar was committing genocide through actions “intended to destroy” themostly Muslim Rohingya minority group“in whole or in part”. The proceedings are ongoing, and Canada, France, the United Kingdom and other countries late last year filed ajoint petitionin support of The Gambia’s case. “This case confirms that any contracting party can bring a case under the Genocide Convention,” said Amanda Ghahremani, an international criminal lawyer and research fellow at the Human Rights Center at the University of California, Berkeley, in the United States. “It doesn’t necessarily have to be a case between the states that are directly involved.” In 2007, the ICJ also laid out when states can act to uphold their obligation to prevent genocide, noting that their responsibility does not solely begin “when perpetration of genocide commences”. “That would be absurd, since the whole point of the obligation is to prevent, or attempt to prevent, the occurrence of the act,” the court said (PDF) in a decision in a case brought by Bosnia and Herzegovina against Serbia and Montenegro over crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia. Instead, the obligation arises “at the instant that the State learns of, or should normally have learned of, the existence of a serious risk that genocide will be committed”, the court explained. “From that moment onwards, if the State has available to it means likely to have a deterrent effect on those suspected of preparing genocide, or reasonably suspected of harbouring specific intent … it is under a duty to make such use of these means as the circumstances permit.” In the Gaza case before the ICJ, South Africa has asked the court to take provisional measures, including to urge Israel to end its attacks on the enclave, punish public incitement of genocide and lift restrictions on aid deliveries to Palestinians in the territory. Kersten explained that South Africa does not have to immediately prove that genocide is happening to get those measures approved, but rather it must show that there is “a serious risk of genocide” — a lower threshold. “We may differ on whether Israel as a state is committing genocide or has committed genocide,” he said. “But we can definitely say, on the basis of all the statements and all of the violence andthe starvationand the siege and the blockade and the expulsions and all of these things, that there is a serious risk of genocide, and if there’s a serious risk of genocide, the duty to prevent it exists. “And that’s, to me, one of the more powerful things that South Africa has said.” Meanwhile, if a state fails to comply with a ruling by the ICJ, the other party can go to the UN Security Council to enforce the decision, explained Ghahremani. But even that path does not guarantee compliance. Ghahremani noted that the court last year issued (PDF) provisional measures in Ukraine v Russia, ordering Moscow toimmediately suspendits military operation as it considered Kyiv’s case. Russia, which holds veto power at the Security Council, rejected the decision. “In reality, you will see that states do fail to comply with legal rulings, but it’s still really important that an international institution like the ICJ adjudicates these cases and publicly validates international norms,” she told Al Jazeera. Ghahremani acknowledged that Israel’s “consistent disregard for international law” over the past decades “doesn’t paint a great picture of the international legal system and the enforcement capabilities of international institutions”. Like Russia, the US — Israel’s main ally — also has aSecurity Council veto.    “There have been many legal interventions in the international sphere related to Israel’s conduct against Palestinians, and yet Israel continues to breach international law. When you see that level of impunity … you do lose a lot of hope in the international legal system to be able to halt and prevent genocide, amongst other atrocities,” she said. Still, she said lawyers and rights advocates persist with new and creative ways to use international law to get justice and accountability. “What’s interesting here to me, with this [South Africa] case, is seeing how precedents from the situations in Ukraine and Myanmar — where there was more political will — are now being used in this context,” Ghahremani explained. “I’m very curious to see how that plays out and whether we’re going to see consistency in the positions that states take and in the positions of these international institutions… That will also be very telling and illuminating for all of us.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/9/israels-war-on-gaza-and-the-obligation-to-prevent-genocide
Blinken says civilian death toll in Gaza ‘far too high’,"In Israel, US secretary of state urges working towards lasting peace and rejects permanent displacement of Palestinians from Gaza.","United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said the civilian death toll in Gaza is “far too high”, especially among children, and called for aid to reach the besieged strip more effectively. Speaking at a news conference in Jerusalem on Tuesday, Blinken said the US continued to stand with Israel in its mission to “ensure that October 7 never happens again”, but also sought to avoid further civilian losses in Gaza and prevent the conflict from spreading to the wider region. The US diplomat, who is on hisfourth visit to the Middle Eastsince the conflict began, said Israel had taken steps to ensure that aid reached the population of Gaza, including opening Karem Abu Salem, also known as Kerem Shalom, border crossing with Gaza. Blinken travelled to Turkey, Greece, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates before Israel, and was in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday for talks with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah. Blinken’s visit to Ramallah and Israel showed there was no fundamental change in Washington’s stance, said Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri. “The aim of the visit was to support the security of the occupation,” he told the Reuters news agency. The Palestinian armed group said in a statement that Blinken’s position “reflects the extent of US involvement in these crimes and the widespread violations of all international laws committed by the Israeli army in the Gaza Strip”. Speaking in Israel earlier of plans for post-war Gaza, Blinken said countries in the region had expressed their readiness to work towards an “integrated region”, but that any agreement must include the fulfilment of Palestinian political ambitions. “Many countries in the region are prepared to invest when the conflict is over in [Gaza’s] reconstruction and security,” Blinken said. “But it is essential to them that there also be a clear pathway to the realisation of aPalestinian political state.” He added that the present moment presented a “powerful opportunity” but that all parties must work together towards this goal. “Israel must stop taking steps that undercut Palestinians’ ability to govern themselves effectively,” he said, including “settler violence carried out with impunity, settlement expansion, demolitions and evictions. “All make it harder – not easier – for Israel to achieve lasting peace,” he said. The top US official also reiterated that Washington rejects any plans for the permanent displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip. “As soon as conditions allow, we want to see people move back home and we’ve been very clear about that,” he said, adding that a UN assessment mission had been agreed upon to determine the presence of suitable conditions for residents to move back to northern Gaza.  Blinken deflected a reporter’s question on whether the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government would accept a two-state solution and agree to a diplomatic solution, saying he could not speak for Tel Aviv. Al Jazeera’s diplomatic editor Marwan Bishara said Blinken spoke for Arab leaders, but refused to relay Israel’s position “because Netanyahu disagrees”. “He doesn’t want a two-state solution, he does not want to leave Gaza or the West Bank, he wants to continue to settle illegally,” Bishara added. Israel stands accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), based in The Hague, afterSouth Africafiled the lawsuit at the end of December. Blinken rejected the accusation as “meritless”, saying the lawsuit “distracts the war” and downplays the threats against Israelis and Jews. The conflict broke out on October 7, when Hamas launched an attack on southern Israel that killed 1,139 people, according to Israeli authorities. Israel responded with a devastating bombardment and a ground invasion of Gaza that has destroyed much of the territory and killed more than 23,200 people, mostly women and children, according to Palestinian officials. Blinken said the war could “have ended on October 8” if Hamas had given up its weapons and released the hostages. Israel said that of about 240 people seized by Palestinian armed groups on October 7, 132 are still being held in Gaza and 25 have died in captivity. “This [war] could end tomorrow if Hamas makes those decisions,” he added. In his meeting with Netanyahu, Blinken “stressed the importance of avoiding further civilian harm and protecting civilian infrastructure in Gaza”, according to the US Department of State. The secretary of state voiced hope that, after the war, Israel could push on with its efforts towards regional integration following its US-brokered normalisation deals with the UAE and other states. Several dozen protesters gathered outside the hotel where Blinken was holding the meetings and called for a ceasefire to secure the release of the captives. Israel’s Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told Blinken that increasing pressure on Iran was “critical” as it could prevent a regional escalation. “An increase in the pressure placed on Iran is critical and may prevent regional escalation in additional arenas,” Gallant was quoted as saying in a government statement. Tensions mounted on the Israel-Lebanon border on Tuesday as the Israeli army and the Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollahtraded fire. In Jordan on Friday, Blinken noted “real concern” over the situation along the Lebanese border, which is stoking fears of a wider regional conflagration.

Which countries back South Africa’s genocide case against Israel at ICJ?,Here are countries which welcomed the ICJ case that says Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.,"The International Court of Justice (ICJ) based in The Hague will hold its first hearing in South Africa’s genocide case against Israel on Thursday, with several countries welcoming the move amid a global chorus for a ceasefire in Gaza. South Africa filed the lawsuit end of December, accusing Israel of genocide in its war on Gaza and seeking a halt to the brutal military assault that has killed more than 23,000 Palestinians, nearly 10,000 of them children. The 84-page filing by South Africa says Israel violated the1948 Genocide Convention, drawn up in the aftermath of World War II and the Holocaust. Both Israel and South Africa are signatories to the United Nations Genocide Convention, which gives the ICJ – the highest UN legal body – jurisdiction to rule on disputes over the treaty. All states that signed the convention are obliged to not commit genocide and also to prevent and punish it. The treaty defines genocide as “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”. Here’s what we know about the countries backing South Africa in its case against Israel, and the countries that oppose the case at the world court.  Bolivia also pointed out it had earlierfiled a requestto International Criminal Court (ICC) Prosecutor Karim Khan alongside South Africa, Bangladesh, Comoros, and Djibouti to investigate the situation in Palestine. Khan said he received the request on November 30. The ICC and the ICJ are sometimes conflated with one another. Both the courts are located in The Hague, Netherlands. While the purpose of the ICJ is to resolve conflicts between states, the ICC prosecutes individuals for committing crimes, according to the University of Melbourne’s Pursuit platform. While states cannot be sued at the ICC, the prosecutor can open an investigation where crimes, including genocide, were likely committed. The United States has voiced its opposition to the genocide case. National security spokesperson John Kirby called South Africa’s submission “meritless, counterproductive, and completely without any basis” during a White House press briefing on January 3. Israeli President Isaac Herzog told US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday that “there is nothing more atrocious and preposterous” than the lawsuit. Herzog also thanked Blinken for Washington’s support of Israel. Israel’s Western allies, including the European Union, have mostly maintained silence on the ICJ case. The United Kingdom, which has refused to support the case, has been accused of double standards after it submitted detailed legal documents to the ICJ about a month ago to support claims thatMyanmar committed genocideagainst the Rohingya community.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/9/which-countries-back-south-africas-genocide-case-against-israel-at-icj
‘Brink of war’: Hezbollah-Israel trade further strikes across border,Fears that the Israel-Gaza war could spark regional conflagration are growing amid a rise in violence across the Israel-Lebanon border.,"The Israeli army and Hezbollah, based in Lebanon, have again traded fire across the border, stokingfearthat the war in Gaza could spark a regional conflagration. The Iran-backed Hezbollah on Tuesday launched a drone attack on an Israeli command base. Israel retaliated with air strikes, while it is also reported to have killed three Hezbollah members in a targeted strike. Hezbollah said that it had targeted the “enemy’s northern command centre in the city of Safed with several drones” in retaliation for the killing of Hezbollah field commanderWissam al-Tawilin Lebanon on Monday, as well as an attack on Hamas’s deputy leaderSaleh al-Arourion January 2 in Beirut’s southern suburbs of Dahiyeh, a Hezbollah stronghold. Al-Tawil was the deputy head of a unit in the elite Radwan force and is the highest Hezbollah fighter to be killed in the fighting since the war on Gaza began on October 7. Hezbollah, a close ally of Palestinian group Hamas, said Al-Tawil was involved in the abduction of Israeli soldiers which triggered the group’s last war with Israel in 2006 as well as high-calibre operations in Syria. He had also “directed numerous operations” against Israeli forces since the Gaza war began, the group said. Al-Tawil was buried in his south Lebanon village of Khirbit Silm on Tuesday. According to Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency (NNA) and eye witnesses, Israel struck a car parked in the village shortly before the procession began. It was unclear who the target of the strike was and whether there were casualties. The NNA said preliminary reports suggested injuries. Hezbollah number two Naim Qassem warned that Israel’s wave of targeted killings “cannot lead to a phase of retreat but rather to a push forward for the resistance”.    The Israeli air force said it had intercepted a number of the Hezbollah drones before they reached their target. Videos show that at least one made it through. Planes then attacked the location from which the drones were launched. The Israeli army confirmed that a “hostile aircraft” had come down at one of its bases in the north and said that “no injuries or damage were reported”. Al Jazeera’s Laura Khan, reporting from Israel’s northern border town of Shlomi, said sirens had sounded for several hours across the 120km (75 miles) border between Lebanon and Israel. “We heard drones fly overhead for more than an hour. We also heard some jets screaming,” she added. Shlomi is now a “ghost town” Khan reports, with thousands of people having evacuated amid the fighting. “The Israelis have been talking about pushing Hezbollah back from the border and bringing tens of thousands of residents who evacuated this area back. It’s a complete ghost town. This is really pushing both sides to the brink of war,” she said. Earlier on Tuesday, three members of Hezbollah were killed in a targeted strike on a vehicle in the town of Ghandouriyeh in southern Lebanon, sources familiar with the group’s operations told Reuters news agency. The vehicle was hit by an “apparent Israeli drone strike” reports Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr from the Lebanese border town Tyre. The identity of those killed was not clear at the time of writing. “Ghandouriyeh is outside the battleground, which is the 120km (75 miles) border between Lebanon and Israel, 4 to 5km [2.5 to 3 miles] on each side. This strike is 10km [6.2 miles] deep inside Lebanon, not far from where Hezbollah commander al-Tawil was killed,” she said.    “Israel seems to have a new strategy targeting members and commanders of different groups that make up what Iran calls the ‘Axis of Resistance’.” Hezbollah has lost more than 130 fighters in Israeli shelling on southern Lebanon, and the killings of al-Arouri and al-Tawil have hiked concern that the war in Gaza could spill over into Lebanon and elsewhere across the region. Amid Israel’s bombardment of the enclave, violence is flaring in the West Bank, in Iraq and Syria, and in the Red Sea. The rise in violence in Lebanon comes as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is visiting countries in the Middle East to try to calm what he has called a “moment of profound tension” in the region.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/9/brink-of-war-hezbollah-israel-trade-strikes-as-fear-of-escalation-rises

Countries file UN complaint over Boeing 737-800 shot down by Iran in 2020,"The Ukraine International Airlines plane was hit by two missiles Iran says were fired in error shortly after takeoff, killing 176 people.","Canada, Sweden, the United Kingdom and Ukraine have filed a complaint with the United Nations civil aviation agency against Iran for shooting down a passenger plane in 2020, killing 176 people. The four countries, which all had citizens on board the Ukraine International Airlines flight, accused Tehran of “using weapons against a civil aircraft in flight in breach of its international legal obligations”. The Boeing 737-800 wasshot downshortly after takeoff from Tehran on January 8, 2020, amid rising tensions with the United States following the assassination of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani. Three days later, Iran admitted that its Revolutionary Guard had fired two missiles at the plane, which was heading to Kyiv, by mistake. The four countries said they opened “dispute settlement proceedings” with the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in Montreal. The move was “an important step in our commitment to ensuring that the families of the victims impacted by this tragedy get the justice they deserve”, said Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who attended a memorial service in Ontario to mark the fourth anniversary of the disaster.    The countries have alreadyfiled a casewith the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague, seeking reparations from Iran for the families of the victims. They said Iran had “failed to conduct an impartial, transparent and fair criminal investigation and prosecution consistent with international law”. In April last year, an Iranian courtissued initial sentencesfor 10 unnamed people accused of involvement in the incident, including the operator of an air defence system. Iran has also set compensation of $150,000 for each of the families of the victims and said in 2022 it had begun making the payments. Tehran has rejected claims that it is not cooperating or being transparent and has accused the four governments of trying to “politicise” the issue. It hasfiled its own case with the ICJ, accusing Canada of violating its “international obligations” by allowing people to seek civil damages against Tehran.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/9/countries-file-un-complaint-over-boeing-737-800-shot-down-by-iran-in-2020
US officials renew calls for Israel to reduce civilian casualties in Gaza,Palestinian Health Ministry says 249 people killed and 510 wounded in Israeli assault on Gaza over 24 hours.,"US officials have reiterated calls for Israel to ease its assault on Gaza as the Ministry of Health in the besieged Palestinian territory reports hundreds of more deaths. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is visiting the Middle East amid growing alarm that Israel’s war on Gaza could turn into a regional conflagration. He arrived in Israel late on Monday after a day meeting Gulf Arab leaders. Israeli officials have said they are entering a new phase of more targeted warfare after the mass bombardments that have laid waste to the Gaza Strip and killed more than 23,000 people, according to Palestinian authorities. Blinken held talks in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia on Monday to try to chart a way out of the conflict. Saudi state news agency SPA reported that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) stressed the importance of ceasing hostilities in Gaza and forming a path to peace. SPA said MBS emphasised the need to restore stability and to ensure the Palestinian people gain their legitimate rights. Blinken said he would tell Israeli officials in their meeting later that they must do more to prevent civilian casualties in Gaza and they must allow Palestinians to return to their homes after several calls from right-wing Israeli officials for the displacement of Palestinians out of Gaza. He announced that Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar and the UAE would consider participating in and contributing to “day after” scenarios for Gaza. “We agreed to work together and to coordinate our efforts to help Gaza stabilise and recover, to chart a political path forward for the Palestinians to work toward long-term peace, security and stability in the region as a whole,” he told reporters. While he did not offer specifics, he said the countries had agreed to use their leverage and influence in the region to prevent the war from spilling into neighbouring countries. European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell also attended the meeting in Saudi Arabia. In the United States, President Joe Biden was interrupted by protesters calling for a ceasefire while giving an address in Charleston, South Carolina. “I understand their passion, and I’ve been quietly working, quietly working with the Israeli government to get them to reduce and significantly get out of Gaza,” Biden said.    Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant announced on Monday that the war in Gaza would move away from the “intense manoeuvring phase of the war” toward “different types of special operations”. Gallant told The Wall Street Journal that the next phase will last for a “longer time”. “We’re close to the next phase in the north, including Gaza City. … It will take some time, but we aren’t going to give up.” At least 23,084 people have been killed, and 58,926 wounded in Israel’s assault on Gaza, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. At least 249 people were killed in the latest 24-hour reporting period and 510 wounded, the ministry said on Monday.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/8/us-officials-renew-calls-for-israel-to-reduce-civilian-casualties-in-gaza
Israel says it is scaling down north Gaza operations. What does that mean?,"The Israeli army did not claim to have destroyed Hamas’s forces, but rather to have eliminated its ‘senior commanders’.","The Israeli army has announced it will scale down its operations in northern Gaza after it “dismantled” Hamas in the area. According to the Israeli military spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, the army has “completed the dismantling of Hamas’s military frameworkin the northern Gaza Strip”. Israel released a list with the names of Hamas commanders killed, to suggest that the two northernmost of the Qassam Brigades – a total of 12 battalions – were rendered headless and out of battle. If 12 battalions were indeed destroyed, it would be a significant strategic victory for Israel and a loss that Hamas will probably not be able to overcome while fighting in other parts of the Strip. But careful reading of Israeli claims and analysis of both sides’ performance suggests the situation is not a simple “Israeli victory/Hamas defeat”. A more precise description would be “Israeli acknowledgment of a Hamas disengagement in one theatre”. There is little doubt that Hamas suffered heavy losses while facing a determined and prolonged Israeli offensive using far superior technology and numbers. It is also very likely that a significant number of commanders and deputies have been killed. Israel uses all means to decapitate Qassam Brigades units by targeting their commanders, often using precision rockets fired from helicopters and drones. But Hamas has known this for a long time and its units operate on the principle that each commander always has at least one deputy trained and briefed to the same level. When one falls in battle, the chain of succession moves a step up and units are rarely “headless” for more than a couple of hours. There is also a fundamental difference in the way the Israeli army and the Qassam Brigades operate on the battlefield. Israel has a well-equipped military organised very classically, where each unit or a battle group has precisely allocated tasks, means at their disposal and areas of responsibility. It uses those forces very flexibly, with each unit commander highly independent so that they can exploit military opportunities when they arise without waiting for approval from headquarters. Yet, even though they are flexible, Israeli units still operate under the rules of a hierarchical army where ranks and position determine the commanders’ thinking. Hamas armed units follow a different fundamental principle: as a non-state force, the Qassam Brigades’ prime consideration is secrecy, protection of the chains of command and maximum separation of units in the field. Although not guerrillas in the full meaning of the term, Hamas forces aim for a structure designed to ensure the survival of the combat capabilities of other units when one is compromised or lost. Hamas battalions apparently operate with only basic coordination with their brigade commands. If higher command is lost, as may have happened with the northern brigades when their commanders and deputies were killed within a short time span, battalions can still operate under their last set of coordinated orders. Having practically independent battalions may be quite inadequate for offensive actions that require precise coordination but, for defence – which is almost exclusively what Hamas has been doing since the beginning of the Israeli land offensive on October 27 – it is usually more than adequate. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) lists both the Northern Brigade and the Gaza Brigade of Hamas as “degraded” – a step below “combat effective”, but far from destroyed. Out of the two brigades’ 12 battalions, ISW lists eight as “degraded” and three as “combat ineffective”, denoting units that have practically broken down, and just one as “combat effective”, practically untouched. Objective reading of that assessment suggests that Hamas has been seriously weakened but remains capable of putting up a fight, especially in defence. So why then would Israel claim that the two northern brigades have been defeated and that it would slow down its attacks? Actually, a careful reading of the statements shows that Israel has never openly claimed that Hamas forces in the north have been destroyed. It has talked about “elimination of senior commanders” and the like, and has mentioned “dismantling”, a very vague and PR-friendly term, but not “destruction” or “defeat”. The last two words are used by semiofficial influencers on social networks, bloggers and the like, but not by the Israeli army. In modern warfare, units are seldom “destroyed” in the sense of ceasing to exist, crumbling, being killed, incapacitated or arrested to the last soldier. The nature of today’s battles and the knowledge, competence and information level of unit commands favours disengagement when units cannot fulfil their tasks. The lay observer’s imagination is often conditioned by movies in which brave defenders make a last stand and fight to the last soldier, like The Alamo, or where exhausted, emaciated and disillusioned defenders surrender en masse, like Stalingrad. Such dramatic endings are rare. Whenever defenders have an option to disengage from battle, they usually do so when they realise they are disproportionately weaker than the other side or when their supplies or support are compromised. A sensible commander calls it quits to save whatever forces he might still have, pull them out of the fighting to rest and either reform the units or have the surviving fighters, with valuable recent combat experience against the enemy, join other units. That is exactly what is likely to have happened in northern Gaza. Seeing that continuing defence in separate pockets against overwhelming force is becoming less effective, Hamas command probably decided to disengage and reform. Using the tunnels still under their control, several thousand Hamas fighters probably retreated over several days to the central and south zones of the Strip where they are likely to reinforce the remaining three full brigades.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/8/israel-says-it-is-scaling-down-north-gaza-operations-what-does-that-mean
Hezbollah says Israel kills top commander amid fears of Gaza war escalation,Israel and the Lebanese armed group have frequently exchanged cross-border fire over the past three months.,"Israel has killed top Hezbollah commander Wissam al-Tawil in an air strike in southern Lebanon, the Lebanese armed group says. Hezbollah on Monday announced the killing of one of its commanders for the first time in three months of cross-border clashes with Israeli forces. Al-Tawil, 58, also known as “Jawad”, was the deputy head of a unit in the elite Radwan force. The Lebanese state-run National News Agency reported that the attack was carried out by an Israeli drone about 10:15am (08:15 GMT) on the road to al-Dabshah in the town of Khirbet Selm in the Bint Jbeil district and it killed two people. There was no immediate comment from Israel. Al-Tawil is the highest-ranking Hezbollah member to be killed since the Israel-Hamas war began. Hezbollah said he joined the group in 1989 and that he participated in several “qualitative” operations against Israeli forces during the occupation of southern Lebanon before 2000 and suffered serious wounds during an attack in 1999. According to Hezbollah, al-Tawil was also part of an operation that captured two Israeli soldiers in 2006. Israel retaliated by launching a full-scale offensive against Hezbollah that would become known as the Second Lebanon War in Israel and the July War in Lebanon. Al-Tawil also fought in Syria, where the Lebanese group fought alongside government forces against the country’s opposition. Since October 7, Hezbollah said, he had led several attacks against Israeli army positions across the Lebanese border “in support of the Palestinian people in Gaza and their honourable and courageous resistance”. Like the assassination of Hamas’s deputy leader last week in Beirut, al-Tawil’s killing has raised fears of a wider conflict. Hezbollah said the killing of Salah al-Arouri, which Hamas and Hezbollah said was also caused by an Israeli air strike, “will not go unpunished”, and it claimed responsibility for anattack on an Israeli military baseon Saturday. Reporting from Ibil El Saqi in Lebanon, Al Jazeera’s Imran Khan said Israeli authorities held al-Tawil responsible for rocket attacks on the Meron air surveillance base. Khan said the killing of al-Tawil would be a “setback” for Iran-backed Hezbollah. “It’s going to be something that they will feel, but it is not going to stop them. The way Hezbollah is set up is that there are people who are always ready to replace commanders and fighters who have been killed on the battlefield.” After the killing, sirens warning of rocket attacks were activated across northern Israel along the border with Lebanon. Jamal Ghosn, a political commentator in Beirut, told Al Jazeera that a change has occurred in the fighting between Israel and armed Lebanese and Palestinian groups in the past week or so in which Israel has resorted to targeted killings of people who are not directly involved on the battlefield. “Hezbollah will definitely respond to al-Tawil’s assassination either as part of its ongoing operations or through a single event,” he said. Hezbollah has lost more than 130 fighters in Israeli shelling on southern Lebanon, and al-Tawil’s killing has further raised fears that the war in Gaza is spilling over to Lebanon and elsewhere. The killing comes as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is visiting countries in the Middle East to try to calm what he has called a“moment of profound tension”in the region. In a televised address last week, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah warned Israel not to launch a full-scale war on Lebanon. “Whoever thinks of war with us … will regret it,” he said.    The United Nations peacekeeping mission in Lebanon has warned that any escalation along the Israeli-Lebanese border “could have devastating consequences for people on both sides of the border”. Leaders across the globe, including the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, have made similar statements and warned that “nobody will win from a regional conflict”. Sheikh Ali Damoush, deputy chairman of Hezbollah’s executive council, said the group will not engage in any discussion on cross-border clashes until the Israelis stop their “aggression against Gaza”. “The Israeli predicament is deepening day after day as the war lasts because the longer the aggression continues, the more and more exhausted the enemy becomes, whether on the Gaza front or on the Lebanon front,” Damoush said at a ceremony commemorating a Hezbollah fighter, Abdul Jalil Ali Hamza, who was killed in the town of al-Khader in the Bekaa Valley. “There is no choice but to stop the aggression.” Meanwhile, according to areportby the Israeli daily Haaretz, Lebanese Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib said the country is ready to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which states Hezbollah forces will not deploy south of the Litani River and the Lebanese army will control all of Lebanon, up to the border with Israel. The minister also said Israel “must fully withdraw from all the Lebanese territories and stop its land, sea and air violations”. At a meeting with soldiers in northern Israel on Monday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised to do “whatever it takes” to uphold security in the region. “We, of course, prefer that this not be done in a broad campaign, but that will not stop us,” Netanyahu said. “They must not mess with us.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/8/hezbollah-says-israel-kills-top-commander-amid-fears-of-gaza-war-escalation
"Remembering Issa al-Souri, a little boy killed when Israel bombed a church","A sweet, smiling boy who was his parents’ whole world is now gone along with them.","Gaza Strip –No child likes the sounds of bombing and missiles, their ears cannot bear them. Issa Tariq al-Souri, 13, was the same. There was a time when he, like the other children of Gaza, had a child’s concerns – finishing his schoolwork and running out to play football or connect with friends. They played, chasing each other around or seated around a videogame console, shouting and cheering. Complaints that he and his classmates at the Rosary Sister’s School in Gaza City had were about schoolwork, exams or an exam being scheduled at the same time as sports class. Issa and his parents fled their home in October, heading for theGreek Orthodox Churchbetween Zeitoun and Shujayea where they sheltered with hundreds of Christian and Muslim Palestinians who were all fleeing Israel’s bombing. Despite the international ban on targeting places of worship,Israeli forces bombed the churchon October 20, killing Issa, his mother Lisa and his father Tariq. He was an only child. Issa was a gentle, calm, well-mannered seventh-grader with a beautiful smile that lit up his face that was definitely that of a child. He was not a “big boss” but he was well-loved by the other children in class, always in the middle of a game or joke. While he was shy with his teachers and would find it difficult to look them straight in the eye, Issa knew how to charm when he needed to. Hoping for a good grade in an upcoming exam or another, he would find the courage to ask the teacher to make the test as easy as possible. It is not clear if he was always successful, but he did get good grades. So many children wept for Issa when they heard that he had been killed, especially his best friend, Amir Farah, who could not comprehend what it meant to have lost his close friend and companion. For a 13-year-old, the idea that he will never see his friend again ever is a difficult one to wrap his head about. Amir would pick up his phone for weeks after he heard that Issa had died, dialling his friend’s number hoping that Issa would answer and tell him that the news was not true, he had not been killed. “I won’t see Issa again. Not in the school corridors where he would come running up to me during break time to suggest that we do this or that in the break. I just won’t see him again,” Amir said. Issa’s mother was a kindergarten teacher at the same school and was very involved with how he was doing, making sure to talk to his teachers and take note of any suggestions they had for him to improve. The two were devoted to each other, and Lisa’s colleagues often said that Issa was her whole life and she had put everything into making sure he grew up to be a good man. One of her fellow teachers remarked sadly that it may have been a small comfort that the two left this world together as she may have not been able to withstand losing her boy whom she dreamt of seeing grow into a successful, kind man. Lisa’s colleagues will miss her, as will the children she taught who, over the generations, had gotten used to greeting their old kindergarten teacher in the corridors as they dashed to their higher classrooms. The death of an entire family is a bewildering thing, there is nobody left to mourn their parents or siblings. The extended al-Souri family lost many people in that Israeli bombing, and hearing an aunt count them all off was heartbreaking indeed. On November 4, Issa’s school, Rosary Sister’s School was bombed as well.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/8/remembering-issa-al-souri-a-little-boy-killed-when-israel-bombed-a-church

Blinken says Palestinians displaced in Gaza must be able to return home,"In Doha, the top US diplomat rejected Israeli officials’ comments calling for mass displacement of Gaza residents.","US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said that Palestinian civilians must be able to return home and rejected statements byIsraeli officialscalling for the mass displacement of Gaza residents. Speaking at a press conference in Doha on Sunday alongside Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, Blinken said the United Nations can play a crucial role in allowing displaced civilians in Gaza to return home as Israel moves to a “lower-intensity phase” of its military campaign. “They [Palestinian civilians] cannot – they must not – be pressed to leave Gaza,” he said. The top US diplomat condemned thekilling of Al Jazeera journalist Hamza Dahdouh, the son of Al Jazeera’s Gaza bureau chief and correspondent Wael Dahdouh, and called it an “unimaginable tragedy”. Hamza was killed along with fellow journalist Mustafa Thuraya in an Israeli attack on southern Gaza on Sunday. Israeli forces previously killed several members of Wael Dahdouh’s immediate family in an air raid. “I can’t begin to imagine the horror that he’s experienced – not once, but now twice,” Blinken said. “This is why we are pressing the need – the imperative – not only of making sure that humanitarian assistance can get to people who need it, but that people are protected from harm from this conflict in the first place.” Tamer Qarmout, assistant professor in public policy at the Doha Institute of Graduate Studies, told Al Jazeera that while Blinken has expressed sorrow over Dahdouh’s loss, the top US diplomat has not held Israel accountable for killing journalists in Gaza.    The US Department of State has issued emergency declarations twice in recent weeks to deliver bombs to Israel without congressional oversight. At the press conference in Doha, Blinken said that all US weapons deliveries to any country, including Israel, are made with conditions that humanitarian law is respected. He said that while Israel has a right to target Hamas and ensure that the group can no longer launch attacks, it is “imperative” to protect civilians. “As operations phase down, that will certainly make it easier to ensure that civilians are not harmed and will also ensure that more assistance can get to people who need it,” he said. Qatar’s Al Thani said that the world is getting used to the images of civilian suffering in Gaza. “This is a big test for our humanity,” he said. At least 22,835 people have been killed – including 9,600 children – in Israel’s assault on Gaza since October 7, according to Palestinian officials. At least 1,140 people were killed in Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel, according to Israeli authorities, and around 240 others taken captive. Al Thani said the killing of Hamas deputy political leaderSaleh al-Arouriin Beirut has affected Qatar’s efforts to negotiate between the Palestinian group and Israel over freeing the captives. Qatar previously played a key role in mediating a seven-day truce between Israel and Hamas that saw more than 100 captives freed and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners released from Israeli jails. Al Thani said Doha continues to negotiate and that he and Blinken discussed efforts to reach a ceasefire and ensure the release of more captives. The top US diplomat was in Doha as a part of a week-long diplomacy tour in the Middle East, seeking to calm what he said is a “moment of profound tension” in the region amid Israel’s three-month-long war in Gaza. Since the Israel-Hamas war began on October 7, Israel and the Lebanese armed groupHezbollahhave frequently exchanged cross-border fire. Dozens of Lebanese civilians and more than 140 Hezbollah members have been killed in the fighting, leading to growing concern that the Gaza war could escalate into a regional conflagration. On a separate front, the Iran-alignedHouthirebels in Yemen have fired missiles at Israel and carried out several attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea in what they say are acts of solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. The group, which controls much of Yemen, say they are targeting vessels which are destined for Israel. The attacks have led to many global shipping companies including Maersk to avoid the Red Sea shipping route, and the US has responded by setting up a multinational maritime force to protect shipping lanes in the region. Blinken noted how the Houthi attacks were “hurting people around the world”, with shipping costs increasing and goods deliveries taking longer. He stressed that Washington is keen to ensure the war does not spread. “Over a dozen countries have made clear that the Houthis will be held accountable for future attacks,” Blinken said, referring to the US-led coalition. Qarmout told Al Jazeera that it is clear that the Americans are sending a clear message from Doha to neighbouring Iran, who back the Houthis, that they [the US] doesn’t want to see an escalation of the war. “There is war fatigue … It is an elections year in the US as well. I think the Americans don’t have an appetite for this conflict to escalate and to involve other parties like Hezbollah and Iran,” Qarmout said. “So I think there is a sincere will by the Americans to engage in diplomacy and achieve some gains.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/7/blinken-says-palestinians-displaced-in-gaza-must-be-able-to-return-home
Jordan’s King Abdullah II presses Blinken to push for a ceasefire in Gaza,The top US diplomat is travelling across the Middle East amid growing calls for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war.,"Jordan’s King Abdullah II has urged US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to push for a ceasefire in Gaza and bring an end to the humanitarian crisis in the besieged Palestinian territory, as the months-long war continues to rage. The king met Blinken in the Jordanian capital Amman on Sunday and warned him of the “catastrophic repercussions” of the continuation of the war which began three months ago, the royal palace said. At least 22,835 people have been killed – including 9,600 children – in Israel’s assault on Gaza since October 7, according to Palestinian officials. At least 1,139 people were killed in Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel, according to Israeli authorities. The king reiterated “the important role of the United States in bringing pressure for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, protection of civilians, and guaranteeing delivery” of medical and humanitarian aid, the royal palace said. Blinken, who kicked off a weeklongtrip across the Middle Easton Friday, aimed at calming tensions in the region and ensuring the war does not spread, arrived in Jordan from Turkey and Greece, where he noted that there was “real concern” over the Israel-Lebanon border. “We want to do everything possible to make sure that we don’t see escalation there” and to avoid an “endless cycle of violence”, he said. Today in Amman, I met with His Majesty King Abdullah II to discuss efforts to protect civilians in Gaza and the West Bank. I thanked him for his leadership in providing humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza. The conflict must not spread further in the region.pic.twitter.com/ya5FvABxjJ — Secretary Antony Blinken (@SecBlinken)January 7, 2024  After visiting Jordan, Blinken will travel to Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Israel and the occupied West Bank, where he will deliver a message that Washington does not want a regional escalation of the Gaza conflict. The top US diplomat also hopes to make progress in talks about how Gaza could be governed after the war. Earlier on Sunday Blinken met Jordan’s Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi, who discussed a future scenario that would bring the West Bank and Gaza together as the basis of a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians, according to a statement from Jordan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates. Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 and King Abdullah reaffirmed the need for a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian question and underlined Jordan’s “total rejection” of any forced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza and the occupied West Bank. Washington also insists on a two-state solution, something rejected by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, some of whose cabinet members have also called for Palestinian inhabitants of Gaza to leave. A senior US State Department official travelling with the top diplomat told Reuters that Blinken will continue pressing hesitant Muslim nations to prepare to play a role in the reconstruction, governance and security of Gaza. The US delegation aims to gather Arab states’ views on the future of Gaza before taking those positions to Israel, the official said, acknowledging there would be a significant gap between the different parties’ positions. After his meeting with Jordanian officials, Blinken visited the World Food Programme’s regional coordination warehouse near the Jordanian capital and highlighted that “it is imperative” to “maximise assistance to people in need”, by getting the aid in and distributing it effectively. Inside the warehouse, stocked with pallets of canned food aid, the senior UN official in Jordan, Sheri Ritsema-Anderson, described the situation in Gaza as unlike anything she had seen during 15 years in the Middle East. It is “catastrophic”, she told reporters. Blinken said the US was working to keep aid routes into the strip open and multiply them. “We are intensely focused on the very difficult and indeed deteriorating food situation for men, women and children in Gaza, and it’s something we’re working on 24/7.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/7/jordans-king-abdullah-ii-presses-blinken-to-push-for-a-ceasefire-in-gaza
"Hamza, son of Al Jazeera’s Wael Dahdouh, killed in Israeli attack in Gaza",An Israeli attack targeted the car he was travelling in with two other journalists.,"Hamza Dahdouh, the eldest son of Al Jazeera’s Gaza bureau chief, Wael Dahdouh, has been killed by an Israeli missile strike in the western part of Khan Younis, Gaza. Journalist Mustafa Thuraya was also killed in the attack, when the vehicle they were travelling in near al-Mawasi, a supposedly safe area towards the southwest, was struck by the missile. A third passenger, Hazem Rajab, was seriously injured. According to reports from Al Jazeera correspondents, Hamza and Mustafa’s vehicle was targeted as they were trying to interview civilians displaced by previous bombings. Hamza, 27, was a journalist like his father. Mustafa was also in his 20s. Speaking from the cemetery where his son had been laid to rest, Wael seemed subdued yet resigned, saying he was one of the droves of people in Gaza today who are bidding bitter farewells to their loved ones every day. He vowed to remain on his path of showing the world what is happening in Gaza, despite the pain of one loss after another. “Hamza was everything to me, the eldest boy, he was the soul of my soul … these are the tears of parting and loss, the tears of humanity,” he said. The Al Jazeera Media Network strongly condemned the attack, adding: “The assassination of Mustafa and Hamza … whilst they were on their way to carry out their duty in the Gaza Strip, reaffirms the need to take immediate necessary legal measures against the occupation forces to ensure that there is no impunity.” Reacting to the news, Gaza’s media office condemned the killing of the two journalists, denouncing “in the strongest terms this heinous crime”. Hamza was extremely attached to his family and was devastated when he heard on October 25 that an Israeli raid had hit the house his family was sheltering at in the Nuseirat refugee camp. He found out shortly after that his mother Amna, brother Mahmoud, 15, sister Sham, 7, and nephew Adam, 1, had beenkilled in the Israeli attack. His grief after their loss seemed to motivate him to work harder on covering the war on Gaza, according to his colleague. As news of Hamza’s killing spread, his wife of one year rushed to the cemetery, as did his surviving siblings, for one last look before he was buried. Wael stood by his son’s head, consoling the rest of his family as they tried to comprehend the sudden loss. His composure and strength have made Wael Dahdouh much more than the Al Jazeera Arabic bureau chief in Gaza. He is the face of the channel’s coverage of Israel’s war on Gaza and a symbol of the resilience of Gaza’s people. When he lost his wife, son, daughter, and grandson to the Israeli air raid at the end of October, the world watched, aghast, as he ran into the hospital where the bodies of his four loved ones had been moved. After saying his emotional goodbyes to his children, grandchild, and life partner, he also seemed more determined than ever to perform his job. Then in mid-December, he was badly injured in an attack thatkilled his colleague Samer Abudaqa, but he was again out and about covering the news shortly after. The Palestinian Journalists Syndicate has documented the killing of 102 journalists and the injury of 71 others by Israeli forces since hostilities began in October. The list of Al Jazeera journalists and staff who have lost members of their families or have died themselves is also growing. In December, Anas al-Shariflost his fatherto an Israeli air raid that struck his family’s house in Jabalia. A few days earlier, on December 6, Moamen Al Sharafi, a correspondent for Al Jazeera Arabic, had22 members of his family killedwhen an Israeli attack hit the house they were sheltering in at the Jabalia refugee camp. In late October, broadcast engineer Mohamed Abu Al-Qumsanlost 19 members of his family, including his father and two sisters, during Israeli air raids on the same refugee camp.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/7/hamza-son-of-al-jazeeras-wael-dahdouh-killed-in-israeli-attack-in-gaza
Israel signals bombardment of northern Gaza set to end,"The Israeli military has ‘dismantled’ Hamas in the north, but suggests the onslaught will continue in the rest of Gaza.","Israel has signalled that it is ready to end its bombardment of northern Gaza, saying it has “dismantled” Hamas in that part of the Gaza Strip. The claim from the military spokesperson that Israel has nullified the Palestinian armed group in the north of the enclave extends the signs that it plans to shift to a more precise campaign. It came as top American and European envoys toured the region on Sunday, stepping up the international pressure over the mounting death toll and humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The spokesperson said Israeli forces have now completely dismantled Hamas’s “military framework” in northern Gaza after killing about 8,000 fighters, and will now end major combat operations. Hamas fighters “without a framework and without commanders” are still present, he continued, and scattered fighting is to be expected, along with rockets sporadically being launched towards Israel. But Hamas no longer operates in an organised manner in the area, he asserted. The military did not address troop deployments in northern Gaza going forward, but the spokesperson said it will “continue to deepen the achievement” in the area. However, the onslaught in the rest of the enclave, including the south, to which Israel previously pushed Palestinians labelling it a safe area, is set to continue. “We are now focused on dismantling Hamas in the centre of and south of the strip,” the spokesperson said. The Israeli military’s assault using drones, missiles and ground forces was launched following Hamas’s attack on October 7, which killed about 1,140 people in Israel and saw some 240 taken captive. The latest figures on casualties in Gaza show that close to 23,000 people have been killed and more than 58,000 wounded. Many more are missing, feared under the rubble of bombed buildings. Most of the 2.3 million population has been displaced, and are struggling for food and shelter. Amid these figures and the ongoing humanitarian crisis, pressure has been growing on Israel for weeks to end its indiscriminate warfare. In particular, the United States, Israel’s main backer, is reported to be pressing Tel Aviv to end its tactic of widespread bombardment, and the associated civilian casualties. However, Israel has remained defiant. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted the war will not end until the objectives of eliminating Hamas, getting Israel’s hostages returned, and ensuring that Gaza will no longer be a threat are met. The military spokesperson reiterated that stance, stating that “fighting will continue during 2024. We are operating according to a plan to achieve the war’s goals, to dismantle Hamas in the north and south.” Yet, as the death toll mounts, the risk that the war could spark a regional conflagration looks to be rising. Violence is flaring in theoccupied West Bank, on the Israel-Lebanon border, in Iraq and Syria, and in the Red Sea. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Josep Borrell, the EU’s top diplomat, are currently in the Middle East seeking to prevent Israel’s high-intensity campaign from spilling over into a wider war across the region. On hisfourth visitto the region in three months, Blinken is stressing that Israel should adjust its military operations to reduce civilian casualties and significantly boost humanitarian aid into Gaza. However, many in the region suggest that they expect Washington to do more to rein in Israel, which is receiving billions of dollars worth of support from the US. Jordan’s King Abdullah on Sunday warned the US secretary of state of “catastrophic repercussions” from the continuation of Israel’s military campaign.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/7/israel-signals-bombardment-of-northern-gaza-set-to-end
‘Victory photo’: Will Beirut killings help embattled Netanyahu politically?,"Netanyahu’s popularity is at an all-time low. The Beirut assassinations won’t fundamentally change that, analysts say.","It was a rocky start to 2024 for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. On Monday, January 1, theSupreme Court of Israel struck down a controversial lawintroduced by Netanyahu’s government in 2023, which curtailed certain powers of the top court and sparked widespread protests across the country. Then, the following day, an attack on a Beirut apartmentkilled top Hamas officials. While Israel has not claimed responsibility for the attack, analysts have said that it bears all the marks of a targeted Israeli strike. Will it help stall the fall in popularity of Israel’s long-serving leader? The block to the judicial overhaul plan is a “significant setback” for Netanyahu and the Israeli far right that had invested “significant political energy on the topic”, Nader Hashemi, associate professor of Middle East and Islamic politics at Georgetown University, told Al Jazeera. For some Israelis, Hashemi said, Netanyahu’s longstanding insistence on the judicial changes had “divided Israeli society and made it weaker, allowing October 7th in the way it did”. Recent opinion polls show that the vast majority of Israelis think Netanyahu should publicly accept responsibility for the failures that led to Hamas’s attack on southern Israel on October 7, in which nearly 1,200 people were killed, and more than 200 people were taken captive. Israeli bombs and artillery firing have killed more than 22,000 Palestinians in Gaza since then. Nimrod Goren, a senior fellow for Israeli affairs at the Middle East Institute, told Al Jazeera that the Supreme Court ruling was seen as a “big win for Israeli democracy”. After the ruling, Israel’s Minister of Justice Yariv Levin struck out at the court, saying the timing of its judgement was “the opposite of the unity required these days for the success of our fighters on the front”. Opposition leader Yair Lapid, however, warned Netanyahu’s government against ignoring the ruling, saying if they did, it would “show they didn’t learn anything from October 7”. Former Defence Minister Benny Gantz, who is in Netanyahu’s war cabinet, also called for the ruling to be respected. The scenes of political bickering after the ruling, Goren said – after months of relative unity following October 7 – served as a “reminder of what’s ahead for us [Israelis] after the war is over”. He said that focusing on the proposed reforms, a divisive issue before the war, “instead of dealing with the important issues we need to face (now)” has only added to the criticism of Netanyahu within Israeli society.    Yet, if the ruling by the Supreme Court was a blow to Netanyahu, the assassination of key Hamas leaders in Beirut presented a moment of triumph for him and his war cabinet, which includes Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant and Gantz, now a member of the opposition. “I think these types of dramatic assassinations against Israel’s sworn enemies do help Netanyahu politically,” Hashemi said. An article published in the left-leaning Israeli newspaper Haaretz stated that the news from Beirut had been seen “positively” by Israeli society and provided the country’s leaders with a much-needed “victory photograph” as the war approached the three-month mark. But, for the families of the more than 100 captives still being held in Gaza, the article stated, the news came as “a stab in the heart”. On Tuesday, Netanyahu had met with the families, informing them that a possible deal with Hamas was taking form that could lead to the release of captives. Immediately afterwards, information filtered through that senior Hamas leaders had been killed in Beirut, followed by news that progress on a potential deal for the release of captives had stalled. Haaretz said the news extinguished a growing optimism among the families about the prospects of a deal, citing Eli Shtivi, father of 28-year-old Idan Shtivi, who was kidnapped from theSupernova music festival. Shtivi told Israeli TV that the assassinations “came at a time when we thought we were looking at a real possibility that more hostages would be coming home”. It’s a sentiment that Gil Dickmann, whose cousin Carmel Gat was kidnapped by Hamas, does not share. He said that politics ought to wait and that the main priority for the families of captives is to support whatever the government is doing to bring them back. “After everything is over. We’ll have enough time to talk about politics, but I want my cousin Carmel to be here when we talk about it,” he told Al Jazeera. Until then, he said, “We’ll be supporting every effort to get” the captives out. “I think the most important thing is the government knows that it has the support of most Israelis.”    Still, the killings have rankled with many Israelis who are vocally calling for a peaceful resolution to the war. Standing Together, a Jewish-Arab movement for Peace, brought thousands of people on to the streets in recent weeks to call for a bilateral ceasefire and an end to the current military campaign in Gaza. Alon-Lee Green, the co-director of Standing Together, told Al Jazeera that the assassination was a message from Netanyahu and his war cabinet that “we’re not here to negotiate”. The events in Beirut might be seen by many Israelis as a military achievement, but they do not necessarily translate into a political win for Netanyahu, say analysts. Instead, Goren said it merely widens the gap between the “lack of trust in the current leadership of the government and a continued high level of trust in the areas of the security establishment despite all that happened on October 7”. The fact that Gantz, an opposition leader, is also in the war cabinet, he said, shows that the goal of going after Hamas is shared by most political leaders, and therefore, military successes are not just attributed to Netanyahu. Yossi Mekelberg, associate fellow of the MENA programme at Chatham House, said that even if events such as the Beirut killings might offer a brief respite for Israel’s embattled leadership, they won’t change Netanyahu’s precarious political situation. The prime minister is largely blamed for allowing October 7 to happen, so whenever there is a ceasefire, Mekelberg said, the opposition is likely to challenge his position and demand an election.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/7/victory-photo-will-beirut-killings-help-embattled-netanyahu-politically
"At least nine Palestinians, two Israelis killed in West Bank violence","Seven Palestinians killed in an Israeli air strike on the city of Jenin in the occupied West Bank, authorities say.","At least nine Palestinians and two Israelis have been killed in violence across the occupied West Bank. At least seven Palestinians were killed in an Israeli air strike on the city of Jenin in the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said on Sunday. The strike targeted a gathering of citizens, the ministry said. Four brothers were among the dead, according to the official Palestinian news agency Wafa. Israeli police said an officer was killed when her “vehicle… was hit by an explosive device” during a raid in Jenin, adding that three other officers were wounded. In a separate incident, Israeli forces killed a Palestinian girl in a car at a checkpoint in the occupied West Bank when they opened fire on another car suspected of a ramming attack, Israeli emergency services said. Four-year-old Ruqaya Ahmed Odeh Jahaleen was killed when Israeli forces opened fire at the Beit Iksa checkpoint northwest of Jerusalem, Wafa reported. Israeli forces said a van driver swerved into officers at a checkpoint between Jerusalem and Ramallah, prompting them to open fire. “As a result of shooting at the terrorists, a girl who was in another vehicle at the checkpoint was hurt,” Israeli forces said. It was not immediately clear if there were other casualties in the incident. Earlier, a Palestinian man was killed by Israeli army fire in Abwein village north of Ramallah, said the health ministry. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Elsewhere in the Ramallah area, an Israeli civilian was shot dead, according to the army, which said forces were searching for the assailant. The Israel man was “killed adjacent to the British police junction” north of Ramallah, it said in a statement. Violence in the West Bank has surged to levels unseen in nearly two decades since October 7, when Israel launched an assault on Gaza after Hamas fighters from the territory attacked southern Israel. Israeli forces carry out regular raids in the West Bank including Jenin and its adjacent refugee camp, often triggering gun battles between Palestinian armed groups and Israeli forces.    Wafa reported early on Sunday a major deployment of Israeli forces in Jenin. The Israeli army stormed Jenin at about 1am (23:00 GMT on Saturday) and left at about 5am (03:00 GMT), said Al Jazeera’s Laura Khan, reporting from occupied East Jerusalem. “We know that there was at least one IED [improvised explosive device] that exploded and destroyed an Israeli army vehicle,” she said, adding that there was “fierce resistance” from fighters in the camp. A border police officer was killed and at least three other Israeli soldiers were wounded when their vehicle was hit by the IED blast, Israel said. A helicopter helped rescue them with covering fire, the military said, adding that an aircraft fired at a “terrorist squad that hurled explosives and endangered our forces” and that “a number of terrorists were killed”. “This is just part of the nightly raids that we’re witnessing in the occupied West Bank,” said Khan. The Jenin Brigades, an armed wing of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group, issued a statement claiming responsibility for the attack on the Israeli forces.  “We know, at least 5,600 people have been arrested, more than 3,000 injured and with this latest death toll, we’re looking at around 332 Palestinians killed in the occupied West Bank since October 7,” Khan said. Al Jazeera’s team in the occupied West Bank reported that Israeli forces also raided the cities of Nablus, Hebron, Qalqilya and Jericho overnight. In Nablus, Israeli forces arrested a young Palestinian after raiding her home, according to video footage verified by Al Jazeera. Nightly raids by the Israeli army have been taking place for almost two years, but they haveintensified following the attackby Hamas on October 7, which killed about 1,140 people in Israel. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has since killed at least 22,722 Palestinians and injured more than 58,000 people. The overnight raids on Jenin took place amid US Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s visit to the region.

Relentless bombing and ‘constant death’: A bleak start to 2024 for Syria,Syrians in the northwest see in the new year just as they left the last – ‘with blood’ and destruction.,"Idlib, northwestern Syria– Shaher Masri and his family heard bombs near their home shortly after noon prayers on the first day of the new year. The Syrian regime and its Russian allies had allowed no pause for the holidays, this time bombing a bakery a few metres from the house Masri, 29, his wife and four children have been living in for the past four years in the village of Jakid al-Adas, near Darat Izza in northwestern Syria. “I’ve never seen something more horrible. When we ventured out we found a man who had died while buying bread and breakfast for his family,” Masri told Al Jazeera. That afternoon, artillery hit the town repeatedly, frightening civilians and damaging buildings, including a bakery, a mosque, a market and an electricity facility. The attack was part of a general assault on the villages of Darat Izza, Kabashin and Burj Haidar in the countryside west of Aleppo, which killed six people and injured 11 more, including four children, a baby and two women. It followed thebombing of the city of Idlibthe previous day and Israeliair raids on the Aleppo and Neirab airports, as well as several points belonging to the Syrian regime south of Aleppo, on Saturday. Nada al-Rashed, a director of the Syrian Civil Defense (White Helmets), told Al Jazeera Syrians had welcomed the new year with the same motif they had bid the last one farewell: “with bloodshed”. Masri and his family, who are originally from Jakid al-Adas in the Aleppo governorate, have already been displaced several times within northwestern Syria. They will not move again, despite the repeated bombing of Darat Izza –  there is little point they say. But Masri remains hopeful. “We hope to get rid of [Syrian president] Assad in our new year,” he said. The regime aims to destabilise the population by taking out civilian infrastructure, al-Rashed said. “The absence of accountability and the impunity for the crimes committed by the Syrian regime is what gave it the green light to continue its attacks without deterrence.” Yahya Sheikh Mohammed, 30, the nephew of the man killed near the bakery, told Al Jazeera he feels like he is living “in the midst of constant death”. He had rushed out to the street after the bombing to retrieve his aunt’s husband’s body, Mohammed said. “We found another dead person as we were transporting the old man.” By staging these attacks, the Syrian regime is hoping to drive a wedge between the northern Aleppo countryside – controlled by Turkey – and Idlib and the western countryside of Aleppo – under Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, allied to the Syrian opposition government and classified as “terrorist” by the regime – Mustafa al-Naimi, a journalist based in Turkey, told Al Jazeera. “Under the pretext of ‘terrorism’, Idlib governorate continues to be exposed to artillery and missile bombardment as well as air strikes,” said al-Naimi, who is also a researcher at the Arab Forum for Analyzing Iranian Policies. He added that the military operations also prevented people living there from feeling safe and scared away any investment, which has added to Idlib’s deep economic stagnation. More than 90 percent of people in the region live in poverty and are reliant on international aid. However, the arrival of aid was severely restricted last July by Russia vetoing a UN Security Council vote on renewing across-border aid mechanismthrough the Bab al-Hawa border crossing with Turkey. The regime may also be venting its anger about being unable to respond to Israel’s bombing of Iranian sites by striking either Israel or the United States bases east of the Euphrates, al-Naimi added. The northwestern region of Syria has been subject to aceasefire agreementbrokered in 2020 with the assistance of Russia and Turkey. Still, the regime and its allied forces haverepeatedly violated this agreement– on at least 1,200 occasions over the past year alone, according to the White Helmets. Al-Naimi said opposition factions controlling the northwest may not have the military capacity to mount a strong enough defence against the bombings. Opposition leaders remain defiant, however. “Our options are open and we have the ability to respond to the attacks,” Khattab al-Shami, the military commander of the al-Fatah al-Mubin grouping of opposition factions, told Al Jazeera. “Today we are stronger than ever and we possess military capabilities and initiative, while our enemy lost it years ago,” said al-Shami. “The liberation battle is coming, God willing, and everything happening today is a foreword to it.” He disagreed that the Syrian regime’s bombing was aimed at separating northwestern Syria, pointing out that the bombing had targeted areas under Turkish control, including Afrin in the countryside around Aleppo. He feels that the regime’s escalation over the past four months has been “an attempt to restore stolen sovereignty” after being bombed several times by Israel. Keeping people living outside its control in a constant state of displacement and fear is the regime’s way of exacting “revenge on them while increasing their suffering during the winter”. Targeting civilian infrastructure is also a way to divert attention from the fact that the regime is unable to secure the needs of the population living in areas under its control, al-Shami said. “It is escalating the bombing on the liberated area in order to hide the very major economic, political and social problems that its areas are suffering from.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/7/relentless-bombing-and-constant-death-a-bleak-start-to-2024-for-syria
"US diplomat Blinken meets Turkey’s Erdogan, kicking off Gaza diplomacy tour",The US secretary of state will also travel to Israel and the occupied West Bank as the war in Gaza rages on.,"United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken met senior Turkish officials in Istanbul before heading to Greece, his first stops on a week-long trip aimed at calming tensions that have spiked across the Middle East since Israel’s war on Gaza began in October. In his meeting with Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Blinken “emphasised the need to prevent the conflict from spreading, secure the release of hostages, expand humanitarian assistance and reduce civilian casualties”, US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Saturday. Blinken also stressed the need to work towards broader, lasting regional peace that ensures Israel’s security and advances the establishment of a Palestinian state, Miller added. “In Turkey, we focused extensively on what Turkey can do, using its influence, using its ties, to help prevent the conflict in the Middle East from spreading,” Blinken said, speaking to journalists in Crete on Saturday evening. “We also talked about the role that Turkey can play, both in the day after for Gaza, in terms of the challenging questions of Palestinian-led governance, security, rebuilding, as well as the work that it can do to try to produce more lasting durable peace and security in the region.” Erdogan, a fierce critic of Israel’s military actions in Gaza, hadskipped a meetingwith Blinken when the US diplomat visited Ankara in November over Washington’s staunch backing of Israel’s assault on Gaza. On Saturday, Blinken also met Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan and discussions focused on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, Turkey’s Foreign Ministry said. In his conversation with Blinken, Fidan pointed to Israel’s escalating aggression, saying it poses a threat to the entire region. He also underlined the necessity of an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, allowing the permanent delivery of aid, and stressed the need to return to two-state solution negotiations as soon as possible, the ministry added. Minister of Foreign Affairs@HakanFidanmet with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken at Vahdettin Mansion in Istanbul. At the meeting, Ministers discussed the war and humanitarian crisis in Gaza, Sweden's NATO accession process, bilateral & regional issues. 🇹🇷🇺🇸pic.twitter.com/UvHbV5YoDs — Turkish MFA (@MFATurkiye)January 6, 2024  The US’s strained relationship with Turkey precedes the current war, with the two nations also feuding over foreign policy issues ranging from NATO to Iraq. Ankara is frustrated by the delay in approval from the US Congress for a $20bn deal for 40 F-16 fighter jets. Washington is waiting for Turkey to ratify Sweden’s bid to join NATO. On Saturday, Blinken and Fidan addressed Ankara’s process to ratifySweden’s NATO membership, according to officials from both sides. Blinken said they had discussed “final steps in the process”. US officials are confident Ankara will soon approve Sweden’s accession after it won the Turkish parliament’s backing last month, a senior State Department official travelling with Blinken told the Reuters news agency. As part of Blinken’s whistlestop tour of several countries, he travelled from Turkey to the island of Crete to meet Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis on Saturday. Fellow NATO member Greece is awaiting the US Congress’s approval of the sale of F-35 fighter jets. Post Greece, Blinken’s tour in the coming days will include Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Israel and the occupied West Bank, where he will deliver a message that Washington does not want a regional escalation of the Gaza conflict. Blinken also hopes to make progress in talks about how Gaza could be governed if and when Israel achieves its aim of eradicating Hamas. Blinken’s trip has “three main messages”, said Mahjoob Zweiri, a professor of Gulf studies at Qatar University: deescalation of the conflict; the humanitarian crisis; and what happens the day after the war ends. “Washington doesn’t seem to be happy over the statements coming from the government of Netanyahu talking about the displacement of the people. They seem to want to put pressure on Netanyahu, especially with London, Paris and Germany saying the status quo of Gaza should not be changed,” Zweiri told Al Jazeera. Blinken has said Washington wants regional countries, including Turkey, to play a role in reconstruction, governance and potentially security in the Gaza Strip, which has been run by Hamas since 2007. At least 22,722 people have been killed and 58,166 wounded in Israeli attacks on Gaza since October 7. The revised death toll from the October attack on Israel stands at 1,139 people.

Hezbollah fires rockets at Israel in ‘response’ to Hamas leader’s killing,Lebanese group says it targeted Meron air base following the killing of Hamas leader Saleh al-Arouri in Beirut.,"Lebanese armed group Hezbollah has said it targeted a vital Israeli military post with a barrage of 62 rockets as a “preliminary response” to thekillingof a Hamas leader in Beirut this week. This comes as the European Union foreign policy chief met the Lebanese prime minister in Beirut on Saturday, and warned against Lebanon being dragged into a regional conflict in a spillover from Israel’s war on Gaza. “As part of the initial response to the crime of assassinating the great leader Sheikh Saleh al-Arouri … the Islamic resistance [Hezbollah] targeted the Meron air control base with 62 various types of missiles,” the Iran-aligned group said in a statement on Saturday of the attacks in northern Israel. The Israeli military said earlier that about 40 rockets were fired towards the Meron air surveillance base and it responded by attacking a “terrorist cell” that took part in the launches. There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage. Later on Saturday, Lebanon’s Jama’a Islamiya group said in a statement that it had fired two volleys of rockets at Kiryat Shmona in northern Israel. Hezbollah and the Israeli army continued to exchange fire along the border area, with one Israeli attack going deep into Lebanese territory and hitting a house nearly 40km (25 miles) from the border, Al Jazeera’s correspondent in Lebanonsaid. Hezbollah leaderHassan Nasrallahon Friday said all of Lebanon would be exposed if it did not react to the killing of Hamas deputy chiefal-Arouriand warned it would “certainly not go without reaction and punishment”. Al-Arouri wasassassinated in an alleged Israeli attackon Tuesday in a Hezbollah stronghold. Nasrallah has warned Israel against expanding the conflict, saying there would be “no ceilings” and “no rules” to his group’s fighting if Israel chose to launch a war on Lebanon.    EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Saturday that it was “imperative” to avoid a regional escalation in the Middle East. “It is absolutely necessary to avoid Lebanon being dragged into a regional conflict,” he said, also warning Israel that “nobody will win from a regional conflict”. “We are seeing a worrying intensification of exchange of fire across the Blue Line,” he added, referring to the current demarcation line between the two countries, a frontier mapped by the United Nations that marks the line to which Israeli forces withdrew when they left south Lebanon in 2000. Lebanon’s Prime Minister Najib Mikati said that any large-scale bombing in southern Lebanon would lead to a “comprehensive explosion” in the region. Al Jazeera’s Imran Khan, reporting from Beirut, said Hezbollah’s attack on Saturday was an expected outcome following Nasrallah’s statements on al-Arouri’s killing. “The Israelis would have been expecting a response. They would have been on high alert,” he reported. Khan said that amid the continuing cross-border fighting, Hezbollah had a “very political calculation” to make in Lebanon. “It doesn’t want Lebanon to suffer as a result of an outright war. But it is talking tough. It says if Israel wants to escalate, then it will respond in kind,” he added. Israel and Hezbollah have beenexchanging near-daily firesince the war in Gaza started in October last year. The violence has largely been contained to the border area. “Israel is putting immense pressure on Hezbollah positions in the south with air strikes and drones,” Al Jazeera’s correspondent reported. “That’s interesting because the more pressure it puts on Hezbollah, there may be a misfire or a miscalculated strike from either side and that could escalate things.” With no end in sight to Israel’s war on Gaza and amid soaring regional tensions, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is on his fourth visit to the Middle East in three months.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/6/hezbollah-fires-rockets-at-israel-in-response-to-hamas-leaders-killing
Will the Houthi Red Sea attacks destabilise Yemen’s fragile peace?,The strikes have helped the Yemeni group gain recruits – and analysts worry that a domestic build-up of might could strain ceasefire attempts.,"Beirut, Lebanon —The recent Houthi attacks on commercial shipping vessels in the Red Sea have helped the group drive domestic recruitment and mobilise large rallies in the capital, Sanaa. Analysts say the attacks have provided the group a boost after its popularity had taken a hit in recent months. But they also warn that domestic moves by the emboldened group could threaten the fragile peace within Yemen, as talks towards a ceasefire to a decade-long-war appear to be gathering momentum. The Houthis say their attacks in the Red Sea target Israeli-connected or allied ships and are aimed at pressuring Israel to stop its devastating war on Gaza, which has killed more than 22,000 people since October 7. That’s a message that appears to have resonated with many Yemenis. Ansar Allah, more popularly known as the Houthis, held a rally in Sanaa in support of Gaza on Friday, drawing millions of Yemenis,accordingto a Houthi-affiliated media outlet. Images from the event showed a packed al-Sabeen Square, where protesters carried Palestinian and Yemeni flags. The mobilisation took place as the Houthis continued sending missiles and drones into the Red Sea, defying threats of increased military action by the United States. Amid the heightened tensions in the key maritime waterway, international shipping companies have decided to avoid the Red Sea and go around the southern coast of Africa, adding about nine days to their journey and increasing costs by at least 15 percent. Danish shipping giant Maersk announced on Friday that it wouldavoid the Red Seafor the foreseeable future. In December the US put together Operation Prosperity Guardian, a 10-country coalition that originally included the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Canada, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Seychelles and Bahrain. Their ostensible aim? To stop the Houthis from targeting commercial ships passing through the Bab al-Mandeb strait, a narrow passageway leading into the Red Sea and further on to the Suez Canal. On November 19, the Houthis took over the Galaxy Leader and turned it into atourist attractionfor Yemenis. But the Houthis have not been deterred. They have continued targeting commercial traffic in the Red Sea. On December 31,four Houthi vesselstried commandeering a ship travelling through the Red Sea when US Navy helicopters attacked them, killing 10 Houthi fighters and sinking three boats. On Wednesday, the US and their allies announced what they said was afinal warningto the Houthis to stop attacking ships. But at Friday’s rally, the Houthis seemed defiant, as a fighter plane flew overhead, leaders praised the group’s martyrs and declared they were prepared for a military escalation from the US. “The Houthis seem immune to Western and US pressure,” Sanam Vakil, deputy head of the Middle East North Africa programme at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera. The Palestinian cause is extremely popular among Yemenis. But prior to their attacks on ships in the Red Sea, some analysts said the Houthis had struggled to pay salaries and attract new recruits. That changed after the Houthis started attacking vessels. Recruitment has spiked in recent months as young Yemenis eagerly enlist in the hopes of fighting for the Palestinian cause. The group recently graduated more than 20,000 new fighters, according to Yemen researcher Nicholas Brumfield. He added that the class was named after Hamas’s October 7 mission, Al-Aqsa Flood. “The attacks towards Israel and maritime targets in the Red Sea are favouring Houthis’ internal support and recruitment, thus diverting the attention from the social and economic failures,” under their rule in Yemen domestically, said Eleonora Ardemagni, a senior associate research fellow at the Italian Institute for International Political Studies (ISPI). “Direct confrontation with the US is likely to have the same effect.” A decade-long war with a Saudi-backed coalition, which supports the internationally recognised government of Yemen, dampened enthusiasm surrounding the group. A truce took effect in April 2022 and the parties have since been in ceasefire talks. The two sides seem to have made serious progress with an end to hostilities in sight, the United Nationsannouncedin late December. But analysts believe that the Houthis’ recent actions mean a final deal could still be derailed. “Their actions continue to foreshadow escalation that could easily trigger a more aggressive US military response that in turn can unravel the fragile ceasefire conditions,” Vakil said. Brumfield added that “it wouldn’t be the first time that there was progress and the whole thing fell apart at the last minute”. The ceasefire could be threatened if the Houthis decide to launch a new domestic offensive, a prospect that some analysts say is a distinct possibility. In February 2021, the Houthis launched an offensive to seize Marib, the internationally recognised Yemeni government’s last stronghold. The city saw active fighting until the truce was announced in October 2022. But in recent weeks, the Houthis have capitalised on their recent recruitment bump by deploying 50,000 troops around Marib, sparking fears that hostilities could be renewed. “We’ve seen this very large build-up of forces there over the course of the last couple of months,” Brumfield said. “Within the last week, they’ve deployed even more forces to that location.” He warned that the relative period of calm in Yemen could soon be over. The Houthis appear to be in position for possible confrontations on both the domestic and regional fronts – on land and at sea. “For the last 18 months, Yemen has been relatively quiet and that’s been a good thing,” Brumfield said. “It’s just a matter of smoothing out how this war can end and it could very easily go the other way.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/6/will-the-houthi-red-sea-attacks-destabilise-yemens-fragile-peace

Why is Lebanon home to so many Palestinian refugees and leaders?,"An estimated 270,000 Palestinians live in the country. Their story is one of war, displacement and a struggle to return.","When Hamas politburo memberSaleh al-Arouriwas laid to rest in the Shatila refugee camp in Beirut, Lebanon, on Thursday evening, Palestinians from around the country gathered to bid him goodbye. Al-Arouri was killed in a drone strike on a Beirut neighbourhood that is a stronghold of the Lebanese group Hezbollah, allies of Hamas. The Hamas leader had been in Lebanon since 2015 – one of tens of thousands of Palestinians in the country. Successive waves of Palestinian refugees to Lebanon have led to a stateless population of up to about 270,000 people, who live in 12 camps across the nation. It started with the Nakba of 1948, when 750,000 Palestinians were expelled from Palestine during the creation of Israel, and has continued since, as resistance leaders and refugees alike sought shelter from Israeli attacks. But while Lebanon has hosted these refugees, they have faced systemic discrimination – and the Palestinian community and its leaders have constantly lived under the threat of Israeli attacks. Since 1969, Lebanese security forces have been banned from entering the camps, with security provided by several armed Palestinian factions. At times, these armed groups haveclashed among themselves, vying for influence, control and support from the Palestinian community. The refugee camps remain recruitment grounds for Palestinian armed factions: in early DecemberHamas put out a callfor people in the camps to join the group. Accurate population numbers are hard to come by, with the 2017 Lebanese census reporting about 170,000 refugees resident within the Lebanese camps, while the UNRWA – the UN agency which supports Palestinian refugees – reports more than 270,000 Palestinians live in Lebanon. But as many as 475,000 Palestinians are registered with UNRWA in Lebanon. Overcrowding, poverty and a lack of jobs characterise the camps. Most Palestinians are precluded from obtaining the identity cards needed to access most jobs or social services. Instead, as Lebanon seeks to preserve its own fragile sectarian balance, they must rely upon the UNRWA to provide them with many of the necessities of daily life. Palestinians first arrived in Lebanon in significant numbers in 1948 following the creation of Israel. Initial numbers have since been bolstered by further arrivals following the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, which resulted in Israel occupying further stretches of Palestinian territory. More recently have come from those fleeing the fighting in Syria. In the late 1960s, the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) was fighting against Israel on several fronts. Principally, it operated out of Jordan, where about two million refugees were registered, and Lebanon, where poor conditions, non-existent infrastructure and substandard accommodation helped spread a sense of injustice. Following a series of clashes between the Lebanese military and heavily armed Palestinian militias in 1968 and 1969, the Lebanese military signed an agreement known as the Cairo Accord. While the details were closely guarded, the accord granted the Palestinians autonomy over the camps’ administration as well as the right to continue the armed struggle from Lebanon. Shortly after the agreement was signed, the PLO was expelled from Jordan, where it had helped stage a revolt against the king, to the Lebanese camps where it enjoyed greater freedom to operate. Through the 1970s, leaders of the PLO and its factions based in Lebanon were repeated targets of Israeliassassination attempts. In 1982, the organisation was ejected from Lebanon to Tunisia, following its participation in the Lebanese civil war. However, during its time in Lebanon, the group had drawn upon dissatisfaction within the refugee camps to establish significant control over southern Lebanon, including founding its own police force, before the region was subsequently occupied by Israel some years after the PLO’s departure. A variety of groups now compete for control over the camps, and have a political and military presence in Lebanon. Al-Arouri was a key interlocutor for Hamas with Hezbollah and other allied armed groups. At least two other senior Hamas military leaders were killed with him in the January 2 attack: Azzam al-Aqra, a leading commander of the Qassam Brigades – Hamas’s armed unit – outside Gaza; and Samir Fendi, the southern Lebanon commander for the Qassam Brigades.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/6/why-is-lebanon-home-to-so-many-palestinian-refugees-and-leaders
Sudan’s army chief al-Burhan says ‘no reconciliation’ with paramilitary RSF,"Abdel Fattah al-Burhan rejects latest peace efforts, saying RSF fighters are ‘committing war crimes’ across country.","Sudan’s army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan has promised to continue a nine-month war between the military and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), rejecting the latest peace efforts. RSF head Mohamed Hamdan “Hemedti” Dagalo agreed earlier this week to a ceasefire proposed by civilian groups, contingent on the military also agreeing. But observers responded sceptically in light of the paramilitary force’s prior unfulfilled promises. “The whole world witnessed these rebel forces committing war crimes and crimes against humanity in West Darfur and the rest of Sudan. For that reason, we have no reconciliation with them, we have no agreement with them,” al-Burhan, who is also Sudan’s head of state, told troops gathered in Port Sudan in video released by his office on Friday. He was referring to ethnic cleansing in and around the West Darfur city of El Geneina. The United States has accused both the army and RSF of war crimes, and it says the RSF is also responsible for crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing. The war that began on April 15 has devastated wide swaths of Sudan and displaced more than 7.5 million people.    With the RSF appearing to gain the upper hand in the fight, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, an African trade bloc, got al-Burhan and Dagalo last month to agree to an in-person meeting. But al-Burhan on Friday ruled that out and called his rival a “clown”, “traitor” and “coward”. He rejected the ceasefire deal Dagalo signed in Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa, this week. Al-Burhan also criticised leaders of African countries including South Africa, Ethiopia and Kenya who received Dagalo as a statesman during visits this week and Sudanese politicians who met him in Ethiopia. “He is humiliating the Sudanese people, he is killing them, insulting them, and some people are clapping for him and laughing with him,” al-Burhan said. The RSF has faced growing popular resistance in northern Sudan after it last month raided Gezira state and ransacked farming villages. Al-Burhan said he would arm Sudanese people who wanted to fight the RSF and urged them to join the military. The country faces the threat of falling under “bondage and colonialism”, al-Burhan said. It was an apparent reference to the United Arab Emirates, which the army accuses of supporting the RSF. Dagalo has shared photos in which he was disembarking from a jet owned by an Emirati airline that flight records show has gone to the places on his regional tour.

Hezbollah chief warns Lebanon could be ‘exposed’ to more Israeli attacks,"Nasrallah again pledges retaliation for killing of Hamas deputy chief al-Arouri, says Hezbollah ‘cannot be silent’.","The head of Lebanese armed group Hezbollah has said that all of Lebanon will be exposed if the group does not react to the assassination of Hamas deputy chiefSaleh al-Arouriin Beirut this week. Speaking in a televised address for thesecond timein less than a week, Hassan Nasrallah reaffirmed that Hezbollah “cannot be silent about a violation of this level”. “This means that all of Lebanon will become exposed, all cities, villages, and figures will become exposed,” he said on Friday. “The murder of al-Arouri … will certainly not go without reaction and punishment,” he added. Al-Arouri waskilled in an alleged Israeli attackon a southern suburb of Beirut on Tuesday, a stronghold of Hezbollah. Nasrallah’s comments come as Lebanon filed a complaint to the United Nations Security Council over the assassination of al-Arouri, calling it the “most dangerous phase” of Israeli attacks on the country. The complaint said Israel used six missiles in the attack that killed al-Arouri and added that Israel uses Lebanese airspace to bomb Syria, the Reuters news agency said, citing the document dated January 4.    This is not the first time that Nasrallah promised retaliation. He had on WednesdaywarnedIsrael against expanding its war, saying there would be “no ceilings” and “no rules” to his group’s fighting if Israel chose to launch a war on Lebanon. “Whoever thinks of war with us – in one word, he will regret it,” Nasrallah said. Al Jazeera’s Imran Khan, reporting from Beirut, said Nasrallah reiterated a promise to retaliate. Nasrallah said al-Arouri’s killing “will not go unanswered or unpunished”, and that Hezbollah fighters will use the “right place and the right time, and the field will respond”, Khan said. Nasrallah also said “We have full knowledge of where Israeli military positions are,” and the Israelis “aren’t revealing the true number of their casualties, and the destruction of their equipment”, our correspondent added. In his remarks, the Hezbollah leader said Lebanon’s southern border with Israel was a “key part” of the war, and that the group’s current operations along the border opened a “historic opportunity” for Lebanon to liberate its land occupied by Israel. He added that the Islamic resistance in Iraq also has a “historic opportunity” to get rid of the United States presence in that country.    Nasrallah said Hezbollah fighters had conducted approximately 670 military operations on the Lebanon-Israel border, adding that the group destroyed a “large number of Israeli vehicles and tanks”. He also said if the Israeli military managed to achieve its military goals in Gaza, it would then turn to Lebanon. Since October 8 – a day after Israel launched its war on the Gaza Strip – continuing clashes between the Israeli army and Hezbollah along the Israel-Lebanon border have resulted in the deaths of dozens of Lebanese civilians and more than 140 Hezbollah members. Israel and armed groups in southern Lebanon, particularly Hezbollah, have engaged in frequent back-and-forth exchanges across the United Nations-patrolled border.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/5/hezbollah-chief-warns-lebanon-could-be-exposed-to-more-israeli-attacks
Al Jazeera journalist Samir Sassi released in Tunis two days after arrest,Sassi was arrested on Wednesday at his house.,"The Al Jazeera journalist,Samir Sassi, has been released by a court in Tunis, following his arrest on terrorism charges earlier this week. Police first entered Sassi’s house late on Wednesday evening, searching his computer and confiscating his mobile phone and those of his wife and four children. Speaking to the press agency AFP, Sassi’s lawyer, Ayachi Hammami – a prominent former member of parliament and human rights activist, confirmed that his client had been released. Speaking separately, a source with knowledge of the matter suggested to Al Jazeera that no further action was presently being considered by authorities, “for now, at least,” they added. Responding to Sassi’s release, Khaled Drareni, the North African representative of the press freedom organisation, Reporters Sans Frontieres told Al Jazeera, “We condemn the unjustified arrest of Samir Sassi, and continue to call on the Tunisian authorities to cease all forms of harassment against journalists. “In our view, this latest arrest is further evidence of the authorities’ strategy of threatening press freedom in the country and creating a climate of fear for journalists,” he said. Prosecutions ofjournalists and opponentsof the government have continued apace since the introduction of Decree Law 54, ostensibly intended to combat misinformation online. Its provisions have increasingly been used to muzzle criticism of Saied’s presidency. At the time of writing, more than 20 journalists and activists were awaiting trial after being charged for online offences. Police recently arrested three journalists – Khalifa Guesmi of Mosaique FM, Chadha Hadj Mbarek, and well-known radio journalist Zied el-Heni on December 28, charging him with insulting Tunisian Commerce Minister Kalthoum Ben Rejeb, on his radio programme, Emission Impossible. “The detention of journalists in such a reckless manner reflects an authoritarian mindset of the authorities tracking anyone who expresses their opinion,” Mahdi Jlassi, president of the National Syndicate of Tunisian Journalists (SNJT), told Al Jazeera. “What’s alarming in Samir Sassi’s case is that he was interrogated for 48 hours under the terrorism law, deprived of his right to have a lawyer present during the interrogation. “This constitutes a blatant violation of fair trial conditions. This breach, along with the disregard for procedures, the right to defence, the right to a fair trial, and ensuring the presumption of innocence … all are characteristics of political trials and trials based on opinion in Tunisia for over two years.” The United Nations human rights chief Volker Turk said last year he was “deeply concerned” about the crackdown on media in Tunisia, with vaguely worded legislation used to criminalise criticism. The SNJT is currently planning on staging a protest outside the country’s principal court in Tunis when el-Heni, the radio journalist, appears there on Wednesday.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/5/al-jazeera-journalist-samir-sassi-released-in-tunis-two-days-after-arrest
Shipping giant Maersk to avoid Red Sea routes for ‘foreseeable future’,"Due to ‘volatile’ situation amid Houthi attacks, ships will go around Africa, increasing journey times and shipping costs.","Container shipping giant Maersk has announced it will divert all vessels around Africa instead of using the Red Sea and the Suez Canal for the “foreseeable future”. Maersk said on Friday that the decision was due to the volatile situation in the Red Sea as Yemen’s Houthis continue to attack vessels that pass through the busy waterway. “We have therefore decided that all Maersk vessels due to transit the Red Sea/Gulf of Aden will be diverted south around the Cape of Good Hope for the foreseeable future,” the Danish company said. The trip around Africa can add about 10 days to journey times and requires more fuel and crew time, increasing shipping costs. “The situation is constantly evolving and remains highly volatile, and all available intelligence at hand confirms that the security risk continues to be at a significantly elevated level,” Maersk added. The Houthis have said they are targeting vessels linked to Israel in the Red Sea shipping lane in solidarity with Palestinians who are facing relentless bombardment in the ongoing war on Gaza. On Tuesday, Maersk said it would pause all vessels that would cross through the Red Sea following an attack on one of its ships, the Singapore-flagged Maersk Hangzhou, by Houthis, and has since begun redirecting ships. The company also rerouted four out of five southbound container vessels already passing through the Suez Canal back north for the long journey around Africa on Thursday. “While we continue to hope for a sustainable resolution in the near future and do all we can to contribute towards it, we do encourage customers to prepare for complications in the area to persist and for there to be significant disruption to the global network,” Maersk said. Since November, at least 25 commercial vessels operating in the southern Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden have been attacked. Last month, the United States launched a multinational operation to safeguard commerce in the Red Sea. However, due to continued attacks, many shipping companies are still diverting vessels around Africa. On Wednesday, a coalition of 12 countries, led by the US, issued a statement calling on the Houthis for an “immediate end of these illegal attacks and release of unlawfully detained vessels and crews”, and warned of “consequences”. The waterway is the main route for about 12 percent of world trade, according to the International Chamber of Shipping. The Red Sea connects the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean and Europe to Asia.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/5/shipping-giant-maersk-to-avoid-red-sea-routes-for-foreseeable-future
Iran’s Raisi promises retaliation at funeral for victims of twin bombings,Authorities say 11 suspects arrested after attack in Kerman during a memorial for top commander Qassem Soleimani.,"Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi has promised to retaliate aftertwin bombingsin the city of Kerman this week killed and wounded many people attending a memorial for top General Qassem Soleimani. On Friday, Raisi addressed thousands of mourners who had gathered in Kerman, about 820km (510 miles) southeast of the capital, Tehran. He said Tehran’s enemies could see “Iran’s power and the whole world knows its strength and capabilities”, adding that “our forces will decide on the place and time to take action”. Raisi’s comments come as authorities announced they had arrested 11 people suspected of involvement in the blasts. Iran’s intelligence ministry said in a statement shared on state TV that security forces detained two people for providing support to the two suicide bombers in Kerman, and nine others based in other parts of the country who were suspected of links to the incident. ISIL (ISIS) claimed responsibility for Wednesday’s bombings in a statement on Thursday. As people in Kerman paid respects to the victims in front of caskets draped in Iranian flags on Friday, they shouted: “Death to America!” and “Death to Israel!” At least 89 people were killed in the blasts, and more than 280 were injured. Several Afghan nationals were also among those killed. “We will find you wherever you are,” the commander-in-chief of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Major General Hossein Salami, told the crowd, referring to ISIL. ISIL said two of its members had detonated explosive belts in the crowded cemetery where many people had gathered at a memorial for Soleimani, the head of the IRGC’s elite Quds Force, who died in a United States drone strike in Iraq in 2020 ordered by then-President Donald Trump. State television showed footage from the Imam Ali religious centre in Kerman, where grieving families mourned and people chanted “revenge, revenge”. The United Nations, European Union and several countries, including China, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Germany and Iraq, denounced the bombings. Tehran frequently alleges that both Israel and the US support anti-Iran armed groups involved in past attacks. In 2022, ISIL claimed responsibility for an attack on an Iranian Shia shrine that killed 15 people. Earlier attacks attributed to ISIL include 2017 twin bombings targeting Iran’s parliament and the mausoleum of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic republic. Al Jazeera’s Ali Hashem, reporting from Tehran, said the authorities in Iran were linking the attack to growing regional tensions during Israel’s war in Gaza. “They can’t see this as isolated from what’s happening across the region,” Hashem said. “The Iranians have not taken the statement from ISIL seriously. We’ve had the Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi saying they’re looking into it and that they will have their say in the coming hours.” The attacks occurred a day after the killing ofSaleh al-Arouri, a deputy leader of the Palestinian armed group Hamas, an ally of Iran, in a drone strike in the Lebanese capital, Beirut, raising fears of further escalation in the region following the start of Israel’swar in Gazaon October 7. Raisi said the end of Al-Aqsa Flood, the name of the operation launched by Hamas on October 7, “will be the end of the Zionist regime [Israel]”.

‘We’ll have more’: Palestinians in Lebanon lay killed Hamas leader to rest,Palestinians refugees from across the country pay their respects to top Hamas commander Saleh al-Arouri.,"Beirut, Lebanon –As Saleh al-Arouri’s coffin was laid to rest in Martyrs Cemetery in Shatila refugee camp in Lebanon’s capital, an elderly man saw a familiar routine play out. “In every period of Palestinian history, we have leaders that rise up and then die. We’ll have more in the future. It’s cyclical,” said the man, who did not disclose his name. Al-Arouri was Hamas’s deputy commander and the group’s most senior figure to have been killed since the start of Israel’s war on Gaza on October 7. More than 23,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed since then. Israel has not formally taken responsibility for the drone attack in a densely populated area controlled by the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah on Tuesday night, in which al-Arouri was killed. But the country’s intelligence chief recentlypromisedto kill every fighter that was involved in Hamas’s surprise attack on Israeli military outposts and communities on October 7, 2023. And analysts say the Beirut attack bearstelltale signsof an Israeli operation. Al-Arouri was one of seven people killed, which included at least two other Hamas officials and two members from Jama’a Islamiya, a Lebanese party tied to the Muslim Brotherhood. All were celebrated as martyrs at al-Arouri’s funeral. “May God protect [them]. Arouri is a martyr,” said Somaya al-Faour, 55, a Palestinian woman living in south Lebanon. “Palestinians have lived through so many Israeli massacres in Lebanon and in Gaza. But God gives us dignity when we die.” Al-Faour was among thousands of Palestinian refugees who attended the funeral to mourn al-Arouri, on transportation arranged by Hamas and other political factions. Somewhere between 250,000 and 300,000 Palestinians live in Lebanon since their parents and grandparents were uprooted from their land during the creation of Israel in 1948 – an event referred to as the “Nakba” or catastrophe. At the funeral on Thursday evening, many among them promised to never give up their aspiration or fight to return home. Palestinian men, children and women described al-Arouri as the latest national figure to pay the ultimate price to advance their national struggle. Mohamad Ali, 17, said that he even dreams of growing up to emulate al-Arouri’s life. While speaking to Al Jazeera at the funeral, Ali stood next to his friend wearing a Palestinian keffiyeh, a black handkerchief and holding the flag of Jama’a Islamiya. “Al-Arouri is an example to all young Palestinians,” he said. “We need to grow up and be just like him.” Ali acknowledged that Palestinian youth have few opportunities in Lebanon due to the endemiclegal discriminationthat they face. Palestinians are barred from working in 39 highly skilled professions, owning real estate and improving the conditions in refugee camps, where most people live in barely habitable and densely confined spaces. Ali was born in Ein el-Hilweh, the largest Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon whereviolent clashesoften erupt due to turf wars between rival factions. It’s also where80,000 peoplelive – squeezed together – on 1.5 square kilometres. While Ali is still growing up, he said that life was short and that he wanted to give his life to the Palestinian cause, if he could. “In the end, we will all die. But I wish to be martyred,” he told Al Jazeera. Zachia Abde, an elderly Palestinian woman from Shatila, stressed that Hamas fighters are part of the Palestinian community and that they cannot be eradicated, regardless of Israel’s military goals in Gaza. “Israel and America call Hamas terrorists. But we think they’re terrorists,” she told Al Jazeera. “We know Hamas. Hamas comes from us [the Palestinian people].” As the celebratory gunfire quieted down, Wael Abdel-Rahman, who described himself as a Hamas fighter, told Al Jazeera that al-Arouri’s life – like his death – was a tragedy, even though he advanced the Palestinian cause. He referenced the 20 years that al-Arourispentin Israeli jails before he was finally released in 2007. Al-Arouri then spent the rest of his life in exile, first in Syria, Turkey and then Lebanon. “He didn’t see his family for so long and now he’s a martyr,” Abdel-Rahman, 42, said. “His life wasn’t easy, but we all want to die like him.” Abdel-Rahman added that he was training with Hamas in Lebanon and that he wants Hezbollah to expand its war with Israel, even though most Lebanese civilians would prefer not to be dragged into a wider regional conflict. However, Hezbollah has reportedly pulled back its fighters a few kilometres from its southern border with Israel. Sources in the Palestinian camps told Al Jazeera that Hamas is still recruiting in case of an escalation. Abdel-Rahman said that many of his peers regard the group as the face of Palestinian resistance, regardless of how they are portrayed in the West. “I don’t want to comment about how we are seen,” he told Al Jazeera. “God knows who is right and who is wrong in this conflict.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/5/well-have-more-palestinians-in-lebanon-lay-killed-hamas-leader-to-rest

Israeli defence minister outlines new phase in Gaza war,Yoav Gallant says Israeli officials want a ‘Palestinian entity’ to run civilian affairs in Gaza after the war.,"Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has outlined Israel’s plans for the next phase of its assault on the besieged Gaza Strip and future scenarios for the day after the war ends. “In the northern region of the Gaza strip, we will transition to a new combat approach in accordance with military achievements on the ground,” Gallant’s office said in a statement it said outlined the guiding principles reflecting Gallant’s vision for the next phases of the war on Thursday. He said operations would include raids, demolishing tunnels, air and ground strikes, and special forces operations. In the south of the besieged enclave – where most of Gaza’s 2.3 million population is now living, many in tents and other temporary shelters – the operation would continue to try to eliminate Hamas leaders and rescue Israeli hostages. “It will continue for as long as is deemed necessary,” the statement said. Israel launched its offensive in Gaza following the October 7 attack by Hamas gunmen who killed some 1,140 people in communities near Gaza and took around 240 into captivity as hostages, according to Israeli estimates. Israel’s war on Gaza has killed more than 22,400 people, according to Palestinian health authorities, and has forced most of the population out of their homes and reduced much of Gaza to rubble. Gallant also outlined Israel’s plans for Gaza after the war. He said Hamas would no longer control Gaza and Israel would reserve its operational freedom of action. But he said there would be no Israeli civilian presence and Palestinian bodies would be in charge of the enclave. “Gaza residents are Palestinian, therefore Palestinian bodies will be in charge, with the condition that there will be no hostile actions or threats against the State of Israel,” Gallant’s office said in a statement on Thursday. Al Jazeera’s Sara Khairat, reporting from Tel Aviv, said Gallant made it clear that Israeli officials want a “Palestinian entity” to be in charge of running civilian affairs in the Gaza Strip, but with “very specific conditions”. “Those conditions are that they won’t act hostile towards Israel, and they won’t act against it in any way, shape, or form,” Khairat said.    Israel has repeatedly said that there is “no place” for Hamas in the post-war civilian structures of Gaza. Several Israeli officials, including far-right finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, have also said Israel will permanently control the Gaza Strip and possibly resettle Israelis there. Gallant also said that Israel will have “complete freedom to military operations in Gaza”, Khairat said. “This is something we’ve been seeing in the occupied West Bank” she noted. As part of a so-called restructuring, Israel also intends to establish a “multi-national task force that comprises … Western and Arab nations”, Gallant told reporters. The force, Khairat said, will look to govern the border area. Israel wants to lead the force, and wants it to be in charge of the restructuring and redeveloping of the Gaza Strip, she said. “Egypt, Israel, and the US are working together to guarantee tight supervision of that border,” Khairat added. Gallant said this is one of many potential plans that officials will be discussing in upcoming meetings. Meanwhile, Hamas is gaining popularity across the occupied Palestinian territories. It governs Gaza and has the backing of several other Palestinian factions. The group has repeatedly said it will remain steadfast and voiced its refusal to leave the territory.    Hamas fighters continue to battle Israeli ground troops in central Gaza and parts of southern Gaza. Military operations in the south continued on Thursday, despite the area previously being declared by the Israeli army as “safe” after it forced thousands of Palestinian families to flee their homes in the north, east, and central Gaza. Many of the displaced are now crammed inside the Rafah governorate in southern Gaza. The health ministry has warned that disease there is spreading amid a lack of supplies, medicine, clean water and much-needed fuel. The United Nations says nearly 1.9 million people have now been displaced – more than 80 percent of the Gaza Strip’s pre-war population.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/4/israeli-defence-minister-outlines-new-phase-in-gaza-war
Al Jazeera journalist Samir Sassi arrested in Tunis,Sassi was arrested after a raid on his family’s home on Wednesday night.,"Al Jazeera journalist Samir Sassi has been arrested by Tunisian “anti-terrorism” officers at his home in Tunis. According to Sassi’s wife, a squad of officers raided their home on Wednesday night, going through the family’s possessions and confiscating mobile phones from every member of the family as well as Sassi’s laptop and copies of novels he had written and published locally in Tunisia. According to Al Jazeera Bureau Director Lotfi Hajji, a team of lawyers spent nearly 12 hours after Sassi’s arrest to try to ascertain where he had been taken. “They went from one police station to another, one court to another, until finally they were able to find out that he had been taken to the anti-terrorism unit in Ariana,” Hajji said. Ariana is a province just north of the capital Tunis. Thus far, Hajji added, the government has not provided any information regarding what Sassi might be charged with and it is not expected that there will be any such announcement before 48 hours have passed since his arrest. Tunisia implements an automatic48-hourperiod during which a detained person cannot access a lawyer if they have been arrested on “terrorism-related” charges. Sassi’s wife and children are still shaken by the experience and are very worried about him, Hajji said. While Sassi is generally in good health, it is hard to guess what conditions he is being held in and what impact that will have on him physically, he said. Sassi’s youngest child, Moayed el-Hak, is six years old and lives with chronic health issues. His three older siblings are his brother Mortadha, 19, sister Tuqa, 16, and brother Mohamed, 13. Freedom of the press has been dramatically curtailed in Tunisia, not least following the introduction of Decree 54 in September 2022. While the law is ostensibly to target the spreading of false information online, it has been used to target journalists and online activists, with at least 20 journalists, critics and activists arrested under it so far, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said. Al Jazeera’s bureau was closed by President Kais Saied’s government in July 2021 when Saied was engaged in a power grab at the end of which he was ruling the country by decree and had hobbled all its institutions. Al Jazeera journalists are still accredited in Tunisia and continue their work. Tunisia has come under increasing international pressure since itsracially charged crackdownon the undocumented Black migrants who travel from across Africa to enter the country, as well as its increasinglyauthoritarian responsesto most forms of criticism. Currently, many opposition members, including Rached Ghannouchi, the leader of the self-styled Muslim Democrats, Ennahda, are in prison. Most recently, police arrested three journalists – Khalifa Guesmi of Mosaique FM; Chadha Hadj Mbarek; then well-known radio journalist Zied el-Heni on December 28, charging him with insulting the Tunisian commerce minister, Kalthoum Ben Rejeb, on his radio programme, Emission Impossible, the same day. The National Syndicate of Tunisian Journalists had held a meeting to discuss how to help Guesmi, Mbarek and el-Heni on January 3, hours before Sassi’s home was stormed. Responding to the current wave of arrests, Salsabil Chellali, HRW’s Tunisia director, told Al Jazeera: “The arrest of these journalists is an ominous start to 2024. “We’re still finding out the details of Sassi’s arrest, but it’s clear that, this year, the threats against the free press and journalists are becoming action.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/4/al-jazeera-journalist-samir-sassi-arrested-in-tunis
Beirut bombings: Israel’s long history of assassination attempts in Lebanon,Israel has been targeting Palestinian leaders in Lebanon for decades.,"A drone strike on the southern Beirut neighbourhood of Dahiyeh this week killed several Hamas leaders includingSaleh al-Arouri, the deputy leader of the group’s political wing and founder of the military wing, Qassam Brigades. The move represents a major regional escalation in Israel’s war on Gaza, which has killed more than 22,000 people there so far. But this was not the first time that Israel has carried out an assassination within Lebanon. Al-Arouri had been living in exile in Lebanon since 2015. Israel has not taken responsibility for the killings, but it is considered highly likely that Tel Aviv ordered the assassination. For decades, Israel has targeted Palestinian leaders in Lebanon, a stronghold of the Hamas ally, Hezbollah. However, al-Arouri’s death comes after an 18-year pause in a long list of attempted and successful political assassinations. Here are some of the key cases. One of Israel’s first targets in Lebanon wasGhassan Kanafani, a prominent Palestinian author and poet who was assassinated on July 8, 1972 in Beirut along with his 17-year-old niece. A grenade had been connected to the ignition switch of his car. When he started the car, this ignited a plastic bomb that had been planted behind the car’s bumper. Kanafani was a spokesperson for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). His assassination came in the aftermath of the May 30, 1972 Lod Airport (now Ben Gurion International Airport) mass shooting in which 26 people were killed and scores of others were injured. Three members of the Japanese Red Army had been recruited to carry out the shootings as the airport was already on high alert for possible attacks by Palestinians. Israel said Kanafani’s killing was in response to this attack, but it is thought the assassination was already being planned well before that. Bassam Abu Sharif, who became spokesperson for PFLP after Kanafani’s murder, was also targeted with a parcel bomb in Beirut on July 25, 1972. Abu Sharif survived the attempt but suffered severe injuries – he partially lost his sight and hearing, as well as four fingers. On September 5, 1972, members of Black September, a faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), kidnapped 11 Israeli athletes at the Summer Olympics in Munich. The hostages were eventually killed in a botched rescue attempt by West German authorities. In response, Israel launched an assassination campaign called Operation Spring of Youth, to target the masterminds of the kidnapping. Travelling by boat from Haifa for an operation that would last from April 10 to 11, 1973, Israeli special forces landed on the beach in Beirut with their commander, the future prime minister, Ehud Barak, disguised as a woman. They raided a high-rise building and private homes of PLO officials in Beirut and Sidon which they had previously had under surveillance, blowing open the doors with explosives and spraying gunfire until their targets were dead. Three top PLO officials were killed: Muhammad Youssef al-Najjar, a deputy to PLO leader Yasser Arafat; spokesperson Kamal Nasser; and Kamal Adwan, military leader for the West Bank. On October 1, 1973, Israel tried to assassinate Arafat, as well as PLO members Khalil al-Wazir, Faruq al-Qaddumi, Hani al-Hassan and Wadi Haddad during a meeting in Beirut. Bombs dropped on the building where the men were meeting failed to detonate, however. Plans to assassinate Arafat continued for years. Israeli intelligence mapped out several plans to shoot down commercial planes that might carry Arafat, but concerns about the possible political fallout from killing civilians in the attempt hindered those efforts. Several attempts to eliminate Arafat were launched between June and August 1982. Salt Fish, an Israeli task force created for that sole purpose, launched several bombing attacks on possible locations of Arafat, but none were successful in killing him. In 2001, Israel’s prime minister, Ariel Sharon, who regarded Arafat as a “murderer of Jews”, is understood to have finally decided to stop trying to assassinate him. On January 22, 1979, Mossad agents executed an elaborate plot to assassinate Ali Hassan Salameh, 37, a top PLO member believed to be the architect of the Munich kidnappings. Spies had enrolled at his gym to befriend him weeks before and a British-Israeli agent rented an apartment close to Salameh’s home to monitor his movements. Salameh was killed when his car passed by a mined Volkswagen that was remotely detonated. On December 9, 1988, Israel raided Palestinian bases in southern Lebanon, targeting Ahmad Jibril, then secretary-general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine General Command (PFLP-GC). Commandos raided locations just outside Beirut, but were met with heavy resistance from Palestinian fighters. Several Palestinian operatives were killed. It was later revealed that Jibril was never in that location. On May 25, 2006, Mahmoud al-Majzoub, a senior leader of the armed Palestinian group Islamic Jihad and a close Hezbollah ally, was assassinated in the city of Sidon. A car bomb attached to the door of al-Majzoub’s car door exploded when he opened it. Israel denied responsibility for the attack, but both Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah held Tel Aviv responsible. Nidal al-Majzoub, his brother, was also killed. On January 2, a drone strike in Beirut’s southern suburbs of Dahiyeh left Saleh al-Arouri dead. Six others, including high-ranking Hamas military commanders Samir Findi and Azzam al-Aqraa, were also assassinated. The men were on the second floor of an apartment building. Israel has not claimed responsibility for the attack, but Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati called the killing an “Israeli crime”. Hezbollah said that the attack on Lebanon’s capital “will not pass without punishment”. ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/4/israels-long-history-of-assassination-attempts-in-lebanon
Egypt’s economy will be its biggest challenge during el-Sisi’s third term,How will the coming years unfold for Egyptians who are hoping that their standard of living will improve a bit?,"Abdel Fattah el-Sisi returned as president of Egypt in the election held at the end of 2023, winning a third term with 89.6 percent of the votes in favour of the incumbent. That el-Sisi was going to secure a victory in the December poll was never really in doubt, according to analysts and Egypt watchers. Second-place candidate Hazem Omar, of the People’s Republican Party, only managed 4.05 percent of the vote, with the third-place candidate coming in with a similar figure. El-Sisi’s most serious challenger, former Member of Parliament Ahmed al-Tantawy, as well as chair of the Dostour Party, Gameela Ismail, both withdrew after failing to secure the endorsements needed to run. Ismail withdrew due to what her supporters claimed was a divided opposition, and al-Tantawy because of what he said was the intimidation of his supporters. Egypt’s National Election Authoritysaid al-Tantawy’s accusations were baseless. “People chose President el-Sisi because of his experience in overcoming security challenges,” political analyst Gamal Abdel-Gawwad subsequently wrote in state-owned newspaper Al Ahram Weekly. “After all, he was a former minister of defence and head of military intelligence.” While victory may have been expected, addressing low voter turnout was a priority for el-Sisi. In 2014, only 47.5 percent of the population turned out to vote, four years later, only 41.5 percent made it to the polling station, potentially undermining the impact of el-Sisi’s victories. This year’s final figure of 66 percent, remarkable given the absence of alternatives, did not come about by accident or because people were anxious to make their voices heard about the crushing economic crisis. While el-Sisi has never aligned himself with a political party, in recent years the Mustaqbal Watan Party has increasingly positioned itself as his closest political ally, using its dramatic 2020 landslide win to demonstrate unflagging support for the president. Likewise, other pro-regime parties, such as Homeland Defenders Party and the Republican People’s Party appear to have been embraced, being encouraged to wave the flag and get the vote out in the recent poll. “The election was in some ways a test for whether the now-revamped political machine the regime has been building for years will be able to deliver what the Sisi regime couldn’t deliver in prior electoral contests on its own,” Hesham Sallam of Stanford University said in emailed comments about the increased turnout. “Since the 2020 [legislative] election, Mustaqbal Watan has been stuck in this ‘political friend-zone’ with Sisi, where he is clearly relying on it as his primary political arm but will still not recognise it as his official ruling party. “The hope is that this election was an opportunity for the party to prove that it is worthy of this recognition and that it should no longer be just an ‘acting ruling party’,” Sallam wrote, adding that Mustaqbal Watan would always have to comply with el-Sisi’s ambitions and style of rule. “The regime-allied media went beyond the call of duty in propping up Hazem Omar’s image as a credible challenger and an alternative political voice, which has made observers speculate whether he is being groomed to play a bigger role in the regime’s political theatrics in the coming years,” he said. Al Jazeera reached out to Hazem Omar on the points raised by Sallam but has received no response by time of publication. Electoral achievements notwithstanding, Egypt’s economy remains on life support. While the regime continues to plough on with mega projects, such as constructing a new capital, public debt continues to mount. Across the country, price rises on subsidised goods have pushed the cost of living beyond the reach of many. The Egyptian pound’s precipitous fall against the dollar has led to increased competition for the hard currency needed to pay for foreign goods and a subsequent shortfall in imports. “Egypt is currently enduring its most severe economic crisis since the 2011 revolution, characterised by a weak currency, soaring inflation and capital flight, all signs of a deepening debt crisis,” Saif Islam, an associate in Strategic Intelligence with risk consultancy firm S-RM, said in emailed comments. “These macroeconomic challenges have considerable repercussions for ordinary Egyptians, including increased poverty and unemployment. These socio-economic challenges will likely exacerbate in the coming year, especially in light of the anticipated further devaluation of the Egyptian pound,” he wrote. New loans, such as the mooted injection of a further $5bn from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates into the central bank, as well as the potential expansion of the $3bn loan from the International Monetary Fund, were more a reflection of Egypt’s strategic significance – reaffirmed by the outbreak of war in Gaza –  rather than an undertaking on el-Sisi’s part to commit to any fresh policy direction, Islam suggested. “A significant portion of any new loans will probably be allocated towards servicing Egypt’s substantial debts. The country is obligated to pay $29.2bn in external debt service in 2024, which underscores the critical role of new loans in meeting debt obligations,” he said. “There was much speculation that Cairo might default on some of their international debt before too long,” Dr HA Hellyer, a nonresident scholar at Carnegie said, referring to the financial strains the country is experiencing, “but few expect that will result in much political change domestically. “It’s also clear that, for much of the international community, Egypt is deeply important due to its population size and its geopolitical position, especially due to the situation in Gaza and Sudan. No one wants Egypt to fail, on the contrary.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/4/egypts-economy-will-be-its-biggest-challenge-during-el-sisis-third-term
Iraq blames US-led coalition for deadly drone strike in Baghdad,Senior commander of Iran-backed Popular Mobilisation Forces group is among those killed.,"Iraq’s government has accused the United States-led international coalition forces of carrying out a drone strike targeting an Iran-aligned paramilitary group in the capital, Baghdad, that killed and wounded several people. The strike on Thursday targeted the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), also known as Hashd al-Shaabi. Hajj Mushtaq Talib al-Saidi (Abu Taqwa), a senior PMF commander, was among those killed. The total number of casualties was not immediately clear, but the Reuters news agency reported that four PMF members were killed and six wounded. “The Iraqi armed forces hold the forces of the international coalition responsible for this attack,” Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani’s office said in a statement, calling it a “dangerous escalation and aggression”. Iraq’s foreign ministry also condemned the attack, calling it an “aggression” on an Iraqi security facility. “Iraq reserves its right to take a firm stance and take all measures that deter anyone who tries to harm its land and security forces,” it said in a statement. Iraq’s Al-Nujaba TV, considered close to the PMF, published footage showing the impact of the strike on the group’s headquarters. The attack came amid heightened regional tensions since war broke out between US ally Israel and Hamas, triggered by the Palestinian armed group’s October 7 attack in southern Israel. There was no immediate comment from US officials, whose forces in Iraq and neighbouring Syria have faced a surge in attacks since the start of the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.    There was an intense security presence around the site of the strike, Baghdad’s Palestine Street, according to The Associated Press news agency, which said its journalists were blocked from accessing the area. Since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, a group of Iranian-backed armed organisations – calling itself the Islamic Resistance in Iraq – has carried out more than 100 attacks on bases housing US troops in Iraq and Syria. The group has said the attacks are in retaliation for Washington’s support of Israel in the war against Hamas that has killed more than 22,000 people in Gaza, and that they aim to push US forces out of Iraq. Last month, the US carried out retaliatory air raids in Iraq after a drone attack by Iran-aligned fighters left three wounded, including one US service member in critical condition. The strike also comes two days after the killing ofSaleh al-Arouri– a deputy leader of Hamas, an ally of Iran – in a drone strike in Beirut, raising fears of further escalation and destabilisation in the region.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/4/iraq-blames-us-led-coalition-for-baghdad-deadly-drone-strike
Iran holds day of mourning after twin blasts kill more than 80 people,More than 280 people were wounded in the attacks that took place at a memorial for slain Iranian general Qassem Soleimani.,"Iranians have observed a day of mourning aftertwin bombingsin the city of Kerman killed and wounded many people at a memorial for top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani four years after his assassination, raising tensions in the region. At least 84 people were killed in the blasts, Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi said on Thursday, according to state news agency IRNA. An earlier death toll of 103 was twice revised down after officials realised some names had been repeated on the victims’ list, and because bodies had been dismembered and counted “several times”, said Jafar Miadfar, the head of Iran’s emergency services. More than 280 people were wounded in Wednesday’s attacks, with 195 still in hospital. The ISIL (ISIS) armed group claimed responsibility for the bombings in a statement on Thursday. The group said on its official Telegram channel that two of its members “activated their explosives vests” at the gathering near Soleimani’s grave. It was thedeadliest attackto target Iran since its 1979 Islamic revolution. The blasts struck minutes apart, shaking Kerman, about 820km (510 miles) southeast of the capital, Tehran. The second blast sent shrapnel into a screaming crowd fleeing the first explosion. The commemoration marked the fourth anniversary of the killing of Soleimani, the head of the elite Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), in a US drone strike in Iraq ordered by then-President Donald Trump. The blasts took place near his gravesite as long lines of people gathered for the event. Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, who cancelled his planned trip to Turkey, declared Thursday as a national day of mourning to pay respect to those killed in the bombings. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei blamed “evil and criminal enemies” of the country for the attack and pledged a “harsh response”. “These hard-hearted criminals could not tolerate the love and enthusiasm the people had to visit the shrine of their great commander, Qassem Soleimani,” Khamenei said in a statement. “Let them know that the soldiers of … Soleimani will not tolerate their vileness and crimes.” The United Nations, European Union, and several countries, including China, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Germany and Iraq, denounced the bombings. The attacks came a day after the killing ofSaleh al-Arouri, a deputy leader of the Palestinian armed group Hamas, an ally of Iran, in a drone strike in the Lebanese capital, Beirut, raising fears of further escalation in the region following the start of Israel’swar in Gazaon October 7.

Israeli military strikes south Lebanon stoking fears of widening conflict,"Attacks on Hezbollah military infrastructure follow the killing of Hamas leader in Beirut, which Israel has not claimed.","Several Hezbollah members have been killed in Israeli strikes on southern Lebanon in one of the deadliest days for the Iran-aligned group as cross-border fighting has escalated since the start of the Gaza war in October. At least nine members of the group were killed in separate attacks on Wednesday, the Reuters news agency reported. The Israeli military released nighttime videos of the attacks, including those on Hezbollah military infrastructure and “observation devices” in the village of Yaroun in southern Lebanon’s Nabatieh governorate, located across the border from the Israeli settlements of Yir’on and Avivim in northern Israel. The grainy footage appears to show Israeli bombs hitting and destroying several residential buildings near other civilian buildings.    “Launches” were also detected crossing Lebanese territory that fell in open areas in northern Israel’s Goren settlement area, the Israeli military said. Since October 8, continuing clashes at the border between the Israeli army and Hezbollah have resulted in the deaths of dozens of Lebanese civilians and more than 140 Hezbollah members. Israel and armed groups in southern Lebanon – some 200km (124 miles) from the Gaza Strip, particularly Hezbollah, have engaged in frequent back-and-forth exchanges across the United Nations-patrolled Israel-Lebanon border. The attacks followed the killing ofSaleh al-Arouri, a deputy leader of Hamas, in a drone strike in the Lebanese capital, Beirut, on Tuesday. Hezbollah chiefSayyed Hassan Nasrallahsaid in a televised speech on Wednesday that the killing of al-Arouri was “a major, dangerous crime about which we cannot be silent”. Hezbollah supports the Palestinian armed group. Thousands attended al-Arouri’s funeral in Beirut later on Thursday, where mourners prayers before carrying his body to the Palestine Martyrs Cemetery in the Shatila refugee camp. The funeral was attended by Palestinian officials, including top Hamas official Moussa Abu Marzouk, as well as representatives of some Lebanese political groups. Al Jazeera’s Imran Khan, reporting from Beirut on Thursday, said all of the various Palestinian factions in Lebanon “came out in force”. Members of Hezbollah joined them as well, Khan said. All of the senior Hamas leadership in Lebanon also attended the funeral, he added. “That was a real sign of respect, that was a real sign of unity,” Khan said. “Today, wasn’t about revenge … today was about showing defiance and unity.” Both Hamas and Hezbollah are expected to react, Khan said. He said that the language coming from both Israel and Hezbollah suggests that neither side is willing to back down. Nasrallah blamed Israel for the attack and offered his condolences to Hamas for what he called a “flagrant Israeli aggression”. Israel has not taken responsibility for the attack that killed al-Arouri in the southern Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh, a Hezbollah stronghold. But there are growing concerns that Israel’s war in Gaza is escalating across the region. The United Nations called for restraint, saying a further uptick in hostilities could be devastating for both Israel and Lebanon. French President Emmanuel Macron, in a call with Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz, urged Israel to “avoid any escalatory attitude, particularly in Lebanon”. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu previously warned that Beirut would be turned “into Gaza” ifHezbollahstarted an all-out war.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/4/israeli-military-strikes-south-lebanon-stoking-fears-of-widening-conflict
Netanyahu’s bait: Why Israel might have killed Hamas leaders in Beirut now,The assassinations bear the marks of an Israeli operation. But the timing might also be about Israeli domestic politics.,"The killing oftop Hamas officialsin what is alleged to be an Israeli attack in Beirut on Tuesday resounded across the Middle East. Although hundreds of people are being killed every day for nearly three months now, the latest targeted killingsent shockwaves, opening old wounds and setting off fears of an escalation of the conflict. The victims of the attack included senior Hamas leaders. The most prominent wasSaleh al-Arouri, a former leader of the Qassam Brigades and member of the political bureau of Hamas who coordinated the group’s military and political activities outside the Gaza Strip, gathering political and financial support. A native of the West Bank, al-Arouri was reportedly one of the most popular Hamas leaders in the Fatah-led parts of Palestine, and his reputation might have grown after October 7. High-ranking military commanders Samir Findi and Azzam al-Aqraa were also killed, along with four other operatives. The assassination bore all signs of classic Israeli long-distance targeted eliminations of high-value human targets. Al-Arouri and his companions were killed by a strike that pinpointed a second-floor apartment in the street flanked on both sides by buildings eight storeys high. The action had striking similarities with the killing of Ahmad Yassin, one of Hamas’s founders and spiritual leader of the group, who was eliminated in a street in Gaza by a modified antitank guided missile. Times and technology change, and so do Israeli capabilities. To killSheikh Yassinin 2004, an armoured antitank AH-64 Apache helicopter needed to get within 2km (1.2 miles). The same task is now performed by quieter, smaller unmanned drones that are harder to hear and see, and a new generation of missiles. The combination used in Beirut, undetected, appears to have been an Israeli-built system – Hermes drone and Nimrod missile. The attack also evoked unpleasant memories of previous military incursions and actions in Beirut that Israel performed with impunity. One of the most notorious clandestine killings happened 50 years ago, in April 1973, when an Israeli commando team landed on Beirut beach and killed three top Palestinian leaders. The Israeli team included future Prime Minister Ehud Barak, donning the dress and makeup of a young blonde woman. In a chilling parallel to Tuesday’s killing, the main target was the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) military leader for the West Bank, Kamal Adwan. Israel reaped fruits from the action codenamed Spring of Youth for years afterwards, as it polarised Lebanon so deeply that it prompted the resignation of Prime Minister Saeb Salam, followed by armed clashes between pro-Palestinian factions and their opponents and a general breakdown in the political and security situation. Within two years of spiralling mistrust, broken promises, false allegiances and infighting, Lebanon descended into a bloody and exhaustive civil war that would only end in 1990. Israel used the internecine fighting for its goals,fuelling war, arming proxies, and encouraging and abetting massacres like those in Sabra and Shatila in 1982. The past examples are terrifying, but history does not always have to repeat itself, especially for those who learn from the past. The first questions an analyst asks are: why him, why now and what will happen next. “Why him” is in a way a moot question, but it still must be asked. In principle, Israel wants to eliminate as many senior Hamas officials as possible, after October 7 probably with even more determination. Al-Arouri was a very high-ranking Hamas official, influential and capable, different from the rest of the top leadership in being reportedly independent-minded. Having lived outside Palestine for a long time, in Turkey and Lebanon, he developed his own international contacts and network. Israel, with its usually excellent intelligence, must have been aware of his capabilities and perhaps of his plans that are as yet unknown publicly. If al-Arouri was killed for any political reason, it could probably be his close and frequent physical contacts with the leader of Hezbollah, Hasan Nasrallah, and the numerous Iranian political and military representatives present in south Beirut. He probably engaged with them daily, as a trusted partner. In that role, it will be hard for Hamas to immediately replace him. “Why now” is probably the key question. There is little doubt that Israel was immediately aware of his 2015 settling in Beirut after years on the move; although all Hamas leaders follow strict security routines, those were surely more relaxed before October 7, and there would have been plenty of opportunity to assassinate him earlier. Both Hezbollah and its protector and patron Iran have shown remarkable restraint and political patience in not rushing to attack Israel after it started bombing and then assaulting Gaza. Israel’s initial calculation had to consider the possibility of Hezbollah opening a second front, but after almost three months of relative quiet in the north, Israeli forces allowed themselves to demobilise five brigades, obviously convinced that whatever fighting it will have to do in future, it will be in the strip. But many prominent Israeli politicians, generals and influentials have been warning that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu does not see eye to eye with the generals. Rather, he may see the continuation of war being in his direct interest. “The government of Netanyahu does not want this war to end. Politically, Netanyahu has a major problem on the day after [the war ends] as this is when inquiries will begin as to the failures on the Israeli side,” warned former Israeli peace negotiator Daniel Levy just days ago. If you fear the end of the war – why not push it into the future, prolong it? Why not open another front in the north, have more of your own men and women in uniform, have the country continue on a war footing, preventing citizens and politicians from asking unpleasant questions? Why not use the convenient opportunity to prolong the atmosphere in which politicians from the farthest right like Finance MinisterBezalel Smotrichmay continue to advocate the extreme views such as the expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza and resettling of Israelis instead? All of this would be consistent with the behaviour of the Israeli prime minister, say experienced Netanyahu watchers. The big question now is whether Hezbollah will swallow the obvious bait. A high Iranian delegation that included several senior Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps generals is reported to have flown to Beirut on Wednesday. Nasrallah apparently cancelled his speech previously announced for Thursday, releasing on Wednesday a recorded address in which he reiterated his usual warnings to the enemies of Hezbollah, but without revealing any concrete decisions. He is now almost certainly conferring with his Iranian allies on the eventual Hezbollah reaction to the Beirut killings. The answer to “what will happen next” might emerge from those meetings.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/4/netanyahus-bait-why-israel-might-have-killed-hamas-leaders-in-beirut-now
US-led coalition warns Houthis of ‘consequences’ after Red Sea attacks,The Houthis have argued that their attacks on ships linked to Israel are an act of solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza.,"A group of countries led by the United States have warned Yemen’s Houthi rebels of “consequences” unless they stop their attacks on Red Sea shipping vessels. “Let our message now be clear: we call for the immediate end of these illegal attacks and release of unlawfully detained vessels and crews,” said the statement released by the White House on Wednesday. “The Houthis will bear the responsibility of the consequences should they continue to threaten lives, the global economy and free flow of commerce in the region’s critical waterways”. The United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Germany and Japan are among the 12 signatories. The only country in the Middle East to sign the statement was Bahrain, which has a strained relationship with Iran, which is aligned with the Houthis. The statement comes after several reports that US President Joe Biden’s administration is considering direct strikes on the rebels if the attacks continue. The Houthis have said that their attacks in the busy waterway are an act of solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza and that they are targeting ships with links to Israel. The US has sent an aircraft carrier, the USS Dwight D Eisenhower, to the area and earlier announced a coalition of countries to protect movement in the Red Sea, through which 12 percent of global trade passes.    Earlier on Wednesday, the Houthis claimed responsibility for a previous attack on a merchant vessel in the Red Sea. “The naval forces of the Yemeni armed forces carried out an operation targeting the ship CMA CGM TAGE which was travelling towards the ports of occupied Palestine,” the Houthis said on X. The French operator CMA CGM said that its container ship was unharmed and suffered “no incident”. A CMA CGM spokesperson said the ship was headed for Egypt. The Houthi attacks in recent weeks have mainly been concentrated on the Bab al-Mandeb Strait. On Tuesday, Danish shipping giant Maersk extended a suspension of services through the waterway and the Gulf of Aden, south Yemen, “until further notice”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/3/us-led-coalition-warns-houthis-of-consequences-after-red-sea-attacks
‘Heinous’: World reacts to twin blasts that kill dozens in Iran,"Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, promised a ‘harsh response’ to attack in southeastern city of Kerman.","Two explosions have killed nearly 100 people and wounded over 200 others at a ceremony in Iran to commemorate the death of top commanderQassem Soleimani, who was killed in 2020. Wednesday’s attacks took place in the southeastern city of Kerman along the road leading to Kerman’s Martyrs’ Cemetery. While no one has claimed responsibility and it was not immediately clear what caused theblasts, Iranian officials have blamed a “terrorist attack”. “The evil and criminal enemies of the Iranian nation once again created a disaster and martyred a large number of dear people in Kerman,” Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said in a statement. “This disaster will have a harsh response, God willing.” In a statement, Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi said, “Undoubtedly, the perpetrators … of this cowardly act will soon be identified and punished for their heinous act by the capable security and law enforcement forces. The enemies of the nation should know that such actions can never disrupt the solid determination of the Iranian nation.” Here are some global reactions in the aftermath of the deadly blasts. European Union The EU demanded that the perpetrators of the twin blasts be brought to justice and condemned the attack. “The EU condemns in the strongest terms today’s bombing in the city of Kerman in Iran. The EU expresses its solidarity with the Iranian people. This act of terror has exacted a shocking toll of civilian deaths and injuries,” an EU foreign affairs spokesperson said in a statement. “Our thoughts now are with the victims and their families. Perpetrators must be held accountable.” Hezbollah Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah, said those who were commemorating the death ofSoleimaniwere “targeted”. He added that those who died were “martyrs who died on the same road, cause and battle that was led by” Soleimani. Houthis The Yemeni group condemned what it called the “criminal bombings” on the anniversary of Soleimani’s death. “This heinous crime represents an extension of all the crimes that attempted to undermine the Islamic Republic, its role in confronting global arrogance, its adoption of the nation’s central cause, and its support for the resistance forces in Palestine and Lebanon,” a statement reads. Iraq The government issued a statement condemning the explosion and described it as a “terrorist attack in Kerman”. “In a show of solidarity, our government stands with Iran, expressing support for both the Iranian government and its people during this difficult time.” “Iraq expresses willingness to offer various forms of assistance, aiming to alleviate the impact of this cowardly criminal act.” Malaysia Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim conveyed Malaysia’s condolences and solidarity with Iran and its people. Anwar said Malaysia “strongly condemned” the attack, and “any form of violence against the innocent”, urging that the “mastermind of this violent action be brought to justice”. Russia President Vladimir Putin expressed his condolences to Iran’s leadership, Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported, citing a Kremlin statement. Putin condemned “terrorism in all its forms” and said the attack on peaceful people was “shocking in its cruelty and cynicism”. Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan offered his condolences and condemned the attack. “We are deeply saddened by the heinous terrorist attacks carried out in Iran’s Kerman province. May God have mercy on those who lost their lives in the attacks, and I wish a speedy recovery to those who were injured,” he said in a post on X. “I express my condolences to the friendly and brotherly Iranian people.” United Nations UN chief Antonio Guterres offered his condolences for those killed and called for the perpetrators to be held accountable. “The Secretary-General strongly condemns the attack today on a memorial ceremony in Kerman city in the Islamic Republic of Iran, which reportedly killed more than 100 people and injured many more,” a statement from his spokesperson reads. “The Secretary-General calls for those responsible to be held accountable. The Secretary-General expresses his deep condolences to the bereaved families and the people and the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran. He wishes the injured a speedy recovery.” United States US officials rejected any suggestion that it or ally Israel was behind deadly blasts in Iran. Soleimani was killed four years ago in a US drone strike. “The United States was not involved in any way, and any suggestion to the contrary is ridiculous,” Department of State spokesperson Matthew Miller said of Wednesday’s blasts. “We have no reason to believe that Israel was involved in this explosion,” he added during a daily news briefing. Separately, White House national security spokesman John Kirby also said the US had seen no indication that Israel was behind the blasts. “We do express our sympathies to the victims and their loved ones who died in this horrific explosion,” Miller said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/3/heinous-world-reacts-to-twin-blasts-that-kill-dozens-in-iran
Hezbollah chief says group won’t ‘be silent’ after killing of Hamas leader,Hassan Nasrallah offers condolences to Hamas after the killing of its deputy leader Saleh al-Arouri.,"The head of Lebanon’s powerful armed group Hezbollah says thekilling of the deputy chief of allied Palestinian faction Hamasin Beirut was “a major, dangerous crime about which we cannot be silent”. In a televised speech on Wednesday, Hassan Nasrallah blamed Israel for the attack and offered his condolences to Hamas for what he called a “flagrant Israeli aggression” that killedSaleh al-Arouri. Tuesday’s strike hit the southern Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh, a Hezbollah stronghold. Israeli army spokesman Daniel Hagari did not directly comment on al-Arouri’s killing but said the military was “highly prepared for any scenario” in its aftermath. But on Wednesday, the chief of Israel’s Mossad intelligence service vowed that the agency would hunt down every Hamas member involved in the October 7 attack on Israel, no matter where they are. The comments by David Barnea appeared to be the strongest indication yet it was behind Tuesday’s blast. It was the first strike to hit Beirut after almost three months ofnear daily firebetween the Israeli military and Hezbollah across the Israel-Lebanon border. Hezbollah launched rockets across the border beginning on October 8 in support of Hamas, which had carried out a deadly assault into southern Israel the previous day that Israel responded to with a devastating bombing campaign on the Gaza Strip.    Hezbollah is part of the “axis of resistance”, a loose alliance of armed groups with ties to Iran. They include Hamas in Palestine and the Houthi rebels in Yemen. Nasrallah asserted Hezbollah’s “quick” action on October 8 and the cross-border shelling since then had prevented a broader bombing campaign by Israel of Lebanon. He said there would be “no ceilings” and “no rules” to fighting by Hezbollah if Israel launches a war on Lebanon. Speaking to Al Jazeera, Andrea Dessi, an assistant professor of international relations at the American University of Rome, said it does not seem like there’s going to be “a direct escalation in the coming days”. “However, the threat is there,” Dessi told Al Jazeera. The reaction will have to come at some point, he said, especially because the “credibility of Hezbollah and Nasrallah is on the line”, given that in the previous speech, he stated that any such killing would be met with a response. Hezbollah, though, “does not want to assume the responsibility of starting a major war”, he added.    Reporting from Beirut, Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr said Nasrallah’s address was a “delicate balancing act”. “He talked about the front in southern Lebanon, where Hezbollah is engaged in a low-intensity conflict with the Israeli army along the border. He said that [fighting] will continue. “He said that if Israel decides to launch a full-scale offensive, then Hezbollah would fight back with its full military capabilities.” “But Nasrallah also spoke about strategic, national considerations that each of the so-called resistance groups in this ‘axis of resistance’ across the region have to take into account. And in Lebanon, Hassan Nasrallah knows that Israel can destroy this country,” she said. “In many ways, his hands are tied. But at the same time, he reiterated that Hezbollah is not afraid of war.” Nasrallah is set to deliver another televised speech on Friday. Hamas said al-Arouri would be buried on Thursday in Beirut’s Shatila Palestinian refugee camp.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/3/hezbollah-chief-says-group-wont-be-silent-after-killing-of-hamas-leader
"‘Israeli warning’: Beirut bombing sparks anger, fear in Lebanon","On the streets of Beirut, there is anger over what people believe was an Israeli violation of their sovereignty, in which seven people were killed.","Beirut, Lebanon —Lina Mounzer is convinced that Israel wants to escalate the war in Gaza. The Lebanese writer and researcher has a family home in Dahiya, the Hezbollah-controlled residential neighbourhood in Beirut that wasbombed by a droneon Tuesday night, killing seven people, including Hamas politburo member Saleh al-Arouri. Israel has not officially accepted responsibility for the attack — in fact, Mark Regev, an adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tried, in a television interview, to distance his country from the attack, without outright denying that it was behind the bombing. But Mounzer has no doubt. “I think it is generally Israel’s modus operandi,” she told Al Jazeera. “They are warning that they will escalate. It’s similar to when they bombed the first hospital in Gaza. When they realised that there wasn’t going to be an [international outcry], then they started bombing hospitals left, right and centre.” On the streets of Lebanon, too, people are convinced Israel had attacked Beirut, much as it had laidsiege to the city in 1982,and fears are mounting among Lebanese who are angry about their country’s territorial sovereignty being violated, yet also concerned that any response from Hezbollah could pull Lebanon into a wider conflict. In addition toal-Arouri, six other people were also killed, including two senior Hamas military officials and, two members of Jama’a Islamiya, according to a person close to the Lebanon-based political movement. The men from Jama’a Islamiya provided services such as transportation for al-Arouri, a source close to the group told Al Jazeera. “It’s just the fear of an imminent attack on our capital and attacking people in our capital that is insane and unfathomable at this point,” said Michelle Eid, a Lebanese researcher. “There are a lot of people in Lebanon against the [Israeli] attacks regardless of their political affiliation,” she told Al Jazeera. After al-Arouri’s assassination, Israel’s Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told reporters that he does not want an escalation with Hezbollah. After Hamas’s surprise attack on Israeli military outposts and communities on October 7, Hezbollah – which is backed by Iran and part of the so-called Resistance Axis that also includes Hamas – began a low-intensity conflict with Israel on its southern border. While violence in the south has displaced more than 72,000 people and killed more than 120  – including civilians – many in Lebanon believe that Hezbollah has taken adequate measures to avert an all-out war with Israel. But Hezbollah is now in a tough spot, according to Mounzer. She said that the armed group risks triggering an escalation if they retaliate for al-Arouri’s killing, but they could also fail to deter future Israeli attacks if they do not. “To tell you the truth, I’m resigned to the idea that this [Hamas-Israel] war is going to widen,” she added. Many Lebanese civilians have faith that Hezbollah will not drag Lebanon into an all-out war. Karim Saifeddine, a Lebanese expert from southern Lebanon, said that extending the war to Beirut would be pointless. He added that the war in south Lebanon is relatively contained compared with what is taking place in Gaza and that most Lebanese would prefer to keep it that way. “I don’t think an all-out war is something that neither most Lebanese want nor the political leaders of Hezbollah prefer,” Saifeddine told Al Jazeera. “But I do believe Hezbollah will escalate. However, they will escalate within certain rules of engagement that may not elicit a major response from Israel.” Ronnie Chatah, a Lebanese commentator and the son of former Finance Minister Mohammad Chatah, who was killed in a car bomb in 2013 that many accuse Hezbollah of conspiring, also said that neither Hezbollah nor Iran wants a major war. “For Iran, keeping Hezbollah in Lebanon is more important than Hamas in Lebanon,” he told Al Jazeera. “Hezbollah remains [Iran’s] crown jewel and testing the limits of that crown jewel is not something that I think Iran wants to do right now.” Saifeddine told Al Jazeera he believes that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has clear motives to continue the war in Gaza – and possibly escalate his northern front with Hezbollah – to extend his political career. According to a recentsurveyby the Israel Democracy Institute, which gauges public opinion every month, only 15 percent of Israelis want Netanyahu to remain in power after the war on Gaza. But 56 percent of Israelis support Netanyahu’s continuing offensive on Gaza, while 50 percent support expanding the northern front with Hezbollah. “The ball is also in Israeli’s court [not just Hezbollah’s] and I believe they have an interest in prolonging this war and to find ways to use Israeli air supremacy against the various militants they are fighting,” said Saifeddine Eid, the Lebanese researcher, said that in many ways, the war has already reached her country, with Israel frequently invading its airspace with drones and planes, signalling their ability to escalate at any time. “To be honest, we can’t even discern if it’s a passenger plane or an Israeli plane because of how frequently the Israelis have been passing over us,” Eid said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/3/israeli-warning-beirut-bombing-sparks-anger-fear-in-lebanon
Who were the Hamas officials killed in Beirut?,"Along with leader Saleh al-Arouri, other significant members of Hamas died in Tuesday’s blast.","Other significant Hamas officials died in Tuesday’s drone strike that killedsenior leaderSaleh al-Arouri, harming the armed group’s military capabilities in Lebanon during Israel’s war on Gaza. According to Lebanese state media, the strike on a Hamas office in the Hezbollah stronghold of Dahiyeb, a southern suburb of Beirut, killed seven people. Hamas described the killing of al-Arouri on its official TV channel as “a “cowardly assassination” by Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s adviser Mark Regev told the United States-based TV news channel MSNBC that Israel had not taken responsibility for the attack and added: “Whoever did it, it must be clear that this was not an attack on the Lebanese state.” Here is what we know about al-Arouri and the six other Hamas officials killed in the drone attack in the Lebanese capital: Al-Arouri, 57, was the deputy chief of the Hamas political bureau. He was also one of the founding members of Hamas’s armed wing, theQassam Brigades. After spending 15 years in an Israeli prison, al-Arouri was released in 2007 and had been living in exile in Lebanon. He was a Hamas spokesperson and was one of the negotiators of a deal that saw 1,027 Palestinian and foreign prisoners exchanged for a single Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, in 2011. At the start of December, al-Arouri was the Hamas official whotoldAl Jazeera that a prisoner exchange under which more captives would be released from Gaza would not take place without a ceasefire. On October 31, Israeli forces destroyed al-Arouri’s house in Aroura near Ramallah in the occupied West Bank. Israel blamed him for attacks on Israelis in the area. He had received multiple death threats from Israel before the war broke out on October 7. The United States designated al-Arouri a “global terrorist” in 2015 and issued a $5m reward for information leading to his identification or location. Al-Aqra, 54, was a leading commander of the Qassam Brigades’ military operations outside Gaza. As a young man, he was arrested twice for short periods. In 1992, the year that al-Arouri was imprisoned in Israel, he was exiled to Marj al-Zuhur in Lebanon along with 415 other members of Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups. In 2022, Israeli media alleged he had plotted to penetrate Israeli communications networks. He settled in Lebanon, married there and was a key member of the group there. He was also known as Abu Abdullah. Samir Fendi was a senior leader of the Qassam Brigades and its top commander in southern Lebanon. He was also known as Abu Amer. In July, an Israeli television channel reported that Shin Bet, Israel’s domestic intelligence agency, had included him and al-Arouri on a list of targets for assassination. The drone strike also killed four other Hamas members: Mahmoud Zaki Shaheen, Mohammed al-Rayes, Mohammed Bashasha and Ahmed Hamoud.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/3/who-were-the-hamas-officials-besides-saleh-al-arouri-killed-in-beirut
General strikes across West Bank after assassination of Hamas’s al-Arouri,"Seven Hamas members were assassinated on Tuesday night in southern Beirut, the impact was felt across the region.","A general strike has been called across the cities of the occupied West Bank in protest against the assassination of seven members of Hamas, including the deputy head of its political bureau, Saleh al-Arouri. The strike was called by Palestinian armed groups that asked people to stay home on Wednesday and only leave to march in demonstrations against the drone attack on the outskirts of Beirut. The slain men are Saleh al-Arouri, who was also the commander of the Qassam Brigades in the occupied West Bank; Samir Fendi, who commanded the Qassam Brigades in Lebanon; Azzam al-Aqraa, who commanded the Qassam Brigades in southern Lebanon; and members Mahmoud Shaheen, Mohammed al-Rayes, Mohammed Bashasha and  Ahmed Hamoud. All seven will be buried in Lebanon. Funerals will be held for Hamoud and Shaheen on Wednesday in the Burj al-Barajneh camp for Palestinian refugees and Taalbaya, respectively. Al-Arouri will be buried on Thursday in the Shatila refugee camp while Fendi is to be buried on Friday in the Rashidiya refugee camp and Mohammed Bashasha will be buried on the same day in Sidon. Al-Arouri came from Aroura, a town near Ramallah in the occupied West Bank. Many locals were mourning his death, and streams of visitors went in and out of his family home on Wednesday to pay their respects. His sister Dalal Muhammad Suleiman, 52, described his passing as a seismic event and praised his humility and strength of character, saying he was “like a mountain”. But her brother had long reflected on the likelihood of his death, she added. “Even though losing him is a deep wound, we will take comfort in knowing that he followed his chosen path to the end. He devoted himself to the struggle,” she said. When al-Arouri was younger, Suleiman said, he had “a love for altruism, bravery and a dedication to giving more to others than to himself”. “Even in his early school years, he avidly followed the news, had a keen interest in politics and his cultural pursuits were reflected in his office.” Others in town also remembered him fondly. A classmate, Nasser Abdel Karim, 58, told Al Jazeera how they played together at school and went to mosque together for prayers. In Hebron, also in the West Bank, the strike emptied the streets on Wednesday morning as shopkeepers heeded the call to close their businesses and people stayed home. Later, demonstrators filled the streets, waving flags and chanting against Tuesday night’s attack. Al-Arouri had a long association with Hebron, political activist Mufid Al-Sharbati, 53, told Al Jazeera. For Al-Sharbati, the killing of al-Arouri took aim at the struggle against the Israeli occupation of Palestine. His hope, he said, was that the Palestinian people carry on their resistance and all the Palestinian factions reconcile for the greater good. Killing national leaders would only spur greater acts of Palestinian resistance, Majd Tamiza, 22, said. Others, like 40-year-old barber Suhail Nasser Al-Din, urged a Lebanese response to the killings, saying groups like Hezbollah should respond to theassassination of a Palestinian national on Lebanese soil. Hamas has blamed Israel for the drone strike, but its government has not claimed responsibility for the killings, which have sparked fears that the war in Gaza will expand into a regional conflict. The situation was similar in Nablus, where an eerie quiet ruled the streets in the morning. People on the streets were few and far between, but several stopped to speak to Al Jazeera about what the slain men meant to them in spite of the fact that they belonged to Hamas, which is seen by many as a rival to the Fatah movement, which governs parts of the occupied West Bank while Hamas governs the Gaza Strip. Referring to al-Arouri, Tayseer Nasrallah, a member of the Revolutionary Council of the Fatah Movement, said: “I admire Sheikh Saleh’s stances and unionist positions. His poise and how calm and articulate he was earned him significant respect among Fatah members, not just within Hamas. “[He] prioritised the Palestinian cause over party affiliations. His loss is deeply felt by patriots and the Palestinian people.” “The Palestinian people realise that the path to liberation is through resistance. Sheikh Saleh al-Arouri … was a dedicated fighter for the liberation of the homeland,” said Ismat Shakhshir, a member of the General Secretariat of the General Union of Palestinian Women. “The general strike expresses our mourning over his death while condemning the cowardly method of his assassination,” she added. “The inability of the occupation to make headway in Gaza has led to desperate measures like these.” Hanan Barghouthi, who has been detained by Israel, said she was deeply sorry for al-Arouri’s death but she believed the Hamas movement would remain resilient and continue to grow because of its commitment to its cause.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/3/general-strikes-across-west-bank-after-assassination-of-hamass-al-arouri
EU foreign policy chief says world must ‘impose’ solution to Gaza war,Josep Borrell warns that the killing of a Hamas leader in Lebanon could lead to an escalation of the Israel-Hamas war.,"European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has said the international community must impose a solution to the Israel-Hamas war as both sides are unable to come to terms. “I believe that we have learned in these 30 years that the solution has to be imposed from outside because the two parties will never be able to reach an agreement,” Borrell said at an event in Lisbon, Portugal, on Wednesday. “If this tragedy doesn’t end soon, the entire Middle East might end up in flames”, he said. Israel has bombarded the besieged Gaza Strip since October 7, when Hamas fighters from the Palestinian territory stormed into southern Israel, killing around 1,200 people, and taking around 240 others hostage, according to Israeli officials. In response to the Hamas attack, Israel declared war, launched a devastating bombardment of Gaza and later ordered a ground invasion that has left much of the territory in ruins. More than 22,000 people, mostly women and children, have been killed in the Israeli assault, according to Palestinian authorities. The war reached the Lebanese capital Beirut on Tuesday, when a senior Hamas official was killed in a blast. Hamas said its deputy leader, Saleh al-Arouri, was assassinated in an Israeli drone attack. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied that it killed al-Arouri. Army spokesperson Daniel Hagari said forces were in a high state of readiness and prepared for any scenario. Hamas politburo member Husam Badran said in a eulogy for al-Arouri, “We say to the criminal occupation [Israel] that the battle between us is open.” Israel had previously accused al-Arouri of orchestrating attacks on its citizens. A Hamas official said al-Arouri was “at the heart of negotiations” conducted by Qatar and Egypt over the release of hostages held by armed groups in Gaza. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati said the death of al-Arouri on Lebanese territory aims to “draw Lebanon” deeper into the war, as the Lebanese armed group, Hezbollah, has traded near-daily fire with Israeli forces since the war began on October 7. “What happened yesterday with the death of one of the leaders of Hamas is yet another factor that could push the conflict to escalate,” Borrell said. Hezbollah chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah is due to make a speech in Beirut later on Wednesday after he previously warned Israel against carrying out assassinations on Lebanese soil and promised a “severe reaction”. The United Nations peacekeeping mission in Lebanon warned that any escalation “could have devastating consequences for people on both sides of the border”. Borrell added that he is planning to visit the Middle East, including Lebanon, to “explore ways out” of the war and would present to EU member states a proposal to create a mission in the Red Sea. Yemen’s Houthis have been targeting vessels in the Red Sea since October in what they say are acts of solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. Several shipping lines have suspended operations through the Red Sea due to the attacks and have changed routes to take the longer journey around Africa instead.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/3/eu-foreign-policy-chief-says-world-must-impose-solution-to-gaza-war
Strike on Hamas leader in Lebanon sends tension spiking across Middle East,UN says further escalation could have devastating consequences for people in both Israel and Lebanon.,"The UN and France have called for restraint as fears of further escalation of the Israel-Gaza war around the region rise in the wake of the strike on a Hamas leader in Lebanon late on Tuesday. Saleh al-Arouri, a senior official in Hamas’s politburo, was killed along with six others in the attack on the outskirts of Beirut. Israel has not taken responsibility, but concern was rising on Wednesday that the conflicts that its war with Hamas have sparked across the region could expand further. Amid Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, and the support being offered by allies led by the US, violence has been on the rise in the occupied West Bank, on the Lebanon border, in Iraq and Syria, and in the Red Sea. There is now worry that the Beirut strike threatens to provoke a full war between Hezbollah, which is based in Lebanon, and Israel. A spokesperson for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) said any potential escalation could have devastating consequences for people on both sides of the Blue Line – the demarcation line dividing Lebanon from Israel and the Golan Heights. “We continue to implore all parties to cease their fire, and any interlocutors with influence to urge restraint,” Kandice Ardiel added. French President Emmanuel Macron, in a call with Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz, urged Israel to “avoid any escalatory attitude, particularly in Lebanon”.    Despite the pleas from the West, the hit has also set off a new round of tough rhetoric across the region. Israeli officials have reportedly been ordered not to discuss the killing of al-Arouri. But an Israeli military spokesman said “we are on high readiness for any scenario”. Al Jazeera’s Laura Khan, reporting from occupied East Jerusalem, said the assassination is a major topic of discussion among the Israeli public. “Everyone is talking about it, and it has been splashed across the headlines of newspapers,” which are using words like “eliminated” to describe his killing, she said. Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said Arouri’s killing would “ignite another surge in the veins of resistance and the motivation to fight against the Zionist occupiers”. Hamas politburo member Husam Badran said in a eulogy for al-Arouri: “We say to the criminal occupation that the battle between us is open.” Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said the Palestinian group was “more powerful and determined” following the attack. “They left behind them strong men who will carry the banner after them.” Meanwhile, Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati on Tuesday warned that the Israeli strike was an attempt to pull his country into the war. “The explosion is an Israeli crime that clearly aims to bring Lebanon into a new phase of confrontations after the ongoing daily attacks in the south,” Mikati said. Israel and Hezbollah have been trading low-level blows across the Lebanon border since the war in Gaza exploded, but the strike on al-Arouri threatens to push the pair into an all-out war. Acting Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib told the BBC that his government was speaking to Hezbollah to try to “convince” the movement not to react to the assassination. “We are very concerned, [the] Lebanese do not want to be drawn into it; even Hezbollah does not want to be drawn into a regional war,” he was quoted as saying. Hezbollah called the strike “a serious attack on Lebanon, its people, its security, sovereignty and resistance”. “We affirm that this crime will never pass without response and punishment,” it said. Much will now depend on the reaction of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, who was due to make a speech in Beirut on Wednesday afternoon. Previously he has warned Israel against carrying out assassinations on Lebanese soil, vowing a “severe reaction”. Meanwhile, there is also concern that the strike could disrupt stuttering talks on a ceasefire plan put forward by Egypt. Hamas officials said that al-Arouri was “at the heart of the negotiations” conducted by Qatar and Egypt. An Israeli delegation was in Cairo on Wednesday to discuss the proposal, AP reported, quoting an unnamed Egyptian official. The killing of al-Arouri is likely to hamper the negotiations for a couple of days, the official added. Unrest has also been stirred on the streets of the occupied West Bank. Hundreds of Palestinians protested on Tuesday to condemn al-Arouri’s killing. A general strike was announced for Wednesday, and many shops and businesses remained closed across the territory. “We’ve heard a lot of calls for revenge. And we’ve seen calls for a general strike … where Palestinians have said all schools and public institutions will be closed to mourn al-Arouri’s death,” Al Jazeera’s Nida Ibrahim reported from the city of Arura. Ibrahim said people believe that Israel assassinated al-Arouri “to show its people a victory which it cannot guarantee in the besieged Gaza Strip”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/3/assassination-of-hamas-leader-in-lebanon-raises-concern-of-escalation

"Who was Saleh al-Arouri, the Hamas leader killed in Beirut?",Killing of the deputy chief of Hamas’s political bureau could spark retaliation from Hamas and Hezbollah.,"A drone strike in Beirut’s southern suburbs of Dahiyeh, a Hezbollah stronghold, killed senior Hamas official Saleh al-Arouri on Tuesday. The drone hit a Hamas office, leaving six people dead, Lebanon’s state news agency reported. Hamas confirmed the death of al-Arouri and called it a “cowardly assassination” by Israel, adding that attacks on Palestinians “inside and outside Palestine will not succeed in breaking the will and steadfastness of our people, or undermining the continuation of their valiant resistance”. “It proves once again the abject failure of this enemy to achieve any of its aggressive goals in the Gaza Strip,” the group said. Following the news of the death of al-Arouri, mosques in Arura, the occupied West Bank town of north Ramallah, are mourning his death and a general strike has been called in Ramallah for Wednesday. Here is what to know about the Hamas official killed in Lebanon. Al-Arouri, 57, was the deputy chief of Hamas’s political bureau and one of the founders of the group’s armed wing, the Qassam Brigades. He had been living in exile in Lebanon after spending 15 years in an Israeli jail. Before the war began on October 7, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had threatened to kill him. In recent weeks, al-Arouri took on the role of spokesperson for the group and told Al Jazeera last month that Hamas would not discuss an exchange deal for the captives the group is holding before the war ends in Gaza. The United States labelled al-Arouri as a “global terrorist” in 2015 and issued a $5m reward for any information on him. While there has been no official response from Israel about the death of the Hamas official, Mark Regev, an adviser to Netanyahu, told the US outlet MSNBC that Israel does not take responsibility for this attack. But, added, “Whoever did it, it must be clear: this was not an attack on the Lebanese state.” “Whoever did this did a surgical strike against the Hamas leadership,” he said. However, Danny Danon, a former Israeli envoy to the United Nations, hailed the attack and congratulated the Israeli army, Shin Bet, the security service and Mossad, Israel’s intelligence agency, for killing al-Arouri. “Anyone who was involved in the 7/10 massacre should know that we will reach out to them and close an account with them,” he said on X in Hebrew, referring to the October 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel that killed nearly 1,200 people. Israel’s relentless bombing and artillery shelling of Gaza since then has killed more than 22,000 Palestinians, including more than 8,000 children. According to Israeli media, the government has ordered cabinet ministers not to give any interviews about al-Arouri’s death after Danon’s tweet. Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned the attack on the Beruit suburb and said it was a “new Israeli crime” as well as an attempt to pull Lebanon into the war. Mikati also warned against the “Israeli political upper echelon resorting to exporting its failures in Gaza to the southern border to impose new facts on the ground and change the rules of engagement”. Hezbollah said that the attack on Lebanon’s capital “will not pass without punishment”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/3/who-was-saleh-al-arouri-the-hamas-leader-killed-in-beirut
Biden under pressure to act amid new fears of ‘ethnic cleansing’ in Gaza,Remarks from far-right ministers renew concerns that Israel aims to force Palestinians out of Gaza amid ongoing war.,"Rights advocates in the United States are urging President Joe Biden to end his administration’s “complicity” in Israeli rights abuses after key members of Israel’s government backed the idea of pushing Palestinians out of Gaza. Far-right Israeli ministersItamar Ben-Gvirand Bezalel Smotrich said this week that Israel should “encourage emigration” from the coastal enclave, home to an estimated 2.3 million Palestinians. Israel has been carrying out a military offensive in Gaza since October 7, resulting in an estimated 1.9 million Palestinians being internally displaced, according to the United Nations. “If there are 100,000 or 200,000 Arabs in Gaza and not two million Arabs, the entire discussion on the day after [the war ends] will be totally different,”Smotrich saidon Sunday, calling for the “voluntary migration” of Palestinians. A day later, Ben-Gvir, who oversees national security, made a similar appeal, saying it was “a correct, just, moral and humane solution”, Israeli media outlets reported. Their remarks are the latest by Israeli officials alluding to the prospect of resettling Palestinians outside of Gaza. Human rights and legal experts have warned that forced displacement constitutes a war crime under international law andcould leadto ethnic cleansing. “It’s not really ‘voluntary’ when you’re bombing homes and starving the entire population,” said Rasha Mubarak, a Palestinian American organiser. Mubarak told Al Jazeera that the Biden administration has not only failed to condemn Israeli officials’ push to get Palestinians out of Gaza, but it has also contributed to the war by providing Israel with continued military aid and diplomatic support. “They have played an immense part in this genocide and ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people,” she said.    Over the past several weeks, asIsrael pressed onwith its bombing campaign, senior US officials have said they do not support efforts to force Palestinians out of the enclave. “The United States remains firmly opposed to any forced or enduring displacement of Palestinians from Gaza,” a State Department spokesperson told Al Jazeera in an email on Monday evening, without commenting specifically on the Israeli ministers’ most recent remarks. In a statement on Tuesday afternoon, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Washington “rejects” the comments by Ben-Gvir and Smotrich. “This rhetoric is inflammatory and irresponsible. We have been told repeatedly and consistently by the Government of Israel, including by the Prime Minister, that such statements do not reflect the policy of the Israeli government. They should stop immediately,” Miller said. But rights advocates say the US’s unwavering support for Israel’s war, which has killed more than 22,000 Palestinians in Gaza to date, is leaving the door open to further atrocities and violations of international law. Under theFourth Geneva Convention, civilians cannot be deported or forcibly transferred from a territory unless such a move is required for “the security of civilians involved or imperative military reasons”. The International Criminal Court (ICC) also states that the forcible displacement of civilians is a war crime unless justified by “military necessity” or civilian safety. Kenneth Roth, a former head of Human Rights Watch, told Al Jazeera in a television interview on Monday that the “idea of massive ethnic cleansing — the war crime of forced displacement — is still very much an idea” within Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government.    Critics fear, however, that there is growing pressure to make that idea a reality in Gaza. Ben-Gvir’s and Smotrich’s comments are only the latest in a string of comments that have prompted concern since the war began. In late October, for instance, the news outlet +972 Magazine reported that the Israeli Ministry of Intelligence had recommended the forcible transfer of Gaza’s population to Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula. Intelligence Minister Gila Gamliel, a member of Netanyahu’s Likud Party, also wrote in The Jerusalem Post in November that the international community should be “helping the people of Gaza build new lives” elsewhere. Danny Danon, Israel’s former ambassador to the UN and another Likud lawmaker, also has promoted the “voluntary migration” idea. In a Wall Street Journal opinion column in November, Danon and Yesh Atid party legislator Ram Ben-Barak urged “a handful of the world’s nations to share the responsibility of hosting Gazan residents”. Yet while the US has pressed Israeli leaders to avoid civilian casualties and allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza, Roth said that “Biden so far refuses to use the leverage he has” to pressure Israel. The country receives $3.8bn in US military aid annually. In addition, late last week, the Biden administrationbypassedCongress to authorise the transfer of about $147m in artillery ammunition,sayingthat “an emergency exists that requires the immediate sale” of the weapons to Israel. “It would have been very simple to say, ‘You want these weapons? Let in the aid. You want these weapons? Stop killing so many civilians.’ [Biden] didn’t do that,” Roth said. “He left it completely unconditional, giving up the leverage he had and, in a sense, making him complicit in what’s going on — actually, an aider and abetter of those war crimes.”    Zaha Hassan, a human rights lawyer and fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, also told Al Jazeera that the Biden administration could be doing more to discourage any attempts at forced displacement. Israel’s military offensive, she explained, has “made Gaza not just unlivable but has put at risk the lives of the 2.3 million Palestinians that are there”. Israel — asan occupying power— has an obligation to ensure the basic needs of Gaza’s Palestinians are met, Hassan said. But instead, the ongoing Israeli bombardment has destroyed critical infrastructure in Gaza, and its siege is severely limiting access to food, water and other much-needed supplies. “So to come now and say that Palestinians in Gaza, if they so chose to leave, would be welcome to do so by Israel is a really cynical understanding of their obligations. They haven’t really created choice at this point for Palestinians. They’re trying to, it appears, force them to flee and force them to seek safety and survival elsewhere,” she said. Hassan also calledNetanyahu’s commentsabout taking control of the Egypt-Gaza border zone — an area known asthe Philadelphi corridor— deeply concerning. “This would enable them to execute on any plans they have to push Palestinians out of Gaza under this guise of it being voluntary.” Voluntary migration?

It has not so far been willing to do more than have quiet conversations with Israel behind the scenes about what it expects. It has of late made some statements publicly, but we haven’t seen it use its leverage as it would need to.” Smotrich’s and Ben-Gvir’s statements, however, have renewed pressure for the US to act. Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), released astatementon Sunday calling on the Biden administration to “repudiate” Smotrich’s words. He added that US leaders “must finally acknowledge what has long been known and demonstrated daily by Israel’s genocidal actions — that Israel’s racist government seeks to ethnically cleanse Gaza”. “It has always been the Israeli government’s plan to ethnically cleanse Gaza,” he wrote. “Smotrich just made it official.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/2/biden-under-pressure-to-act-amid-new-fears-of-ethnic-cleansing-in-gaza
Senior Hamas official Saleh al-Arouri killed in Beirut suburb,"At least six people killed in Israeli drone strike on Lebanese capital, state media report.","Senior Hamas official Saleh al-Arouri has been killed in an Israeli drone strike on Beirut’s southern suburb of Dahiyeh, the Palestinian group and Lebanese media outlets say. Al-Arouri was killed on Tuesday in a “treacherous Zionist strike”, Hamas said on its official channel. Hamas politburo member Izzat al-Sharq called it a “cowardly assassination”. Al-Arouri was a senior official in Hamas’s politburo and was known to be deeply involved in its military affairs. He had previously headed the group’s presence in the occupied West Bank. Samir Findi Abu Amer and Azzam Al-Aqraa Abu Ammar, leaders of Hamas’ armed wing – the Qassam Brigades – were also killed, Hamas said in a message on its Telegram channel. It named four other members of the group who were also killed. Earlier, Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said the blast killed at least six people and that it was carried out by an Israeli drone. Hamas said al-Arouri’s killing would not “undermine the continued brave resistance” in Gaza, where the Palestinian group’s fighters are battling Israeli ground forces. “It proves once more the utter failure of the enemy to achieve any of its aggressive goals in the Gaza Strip,” senior Hamas official Izzat al-Rishq said in a statement. The group’s top leader Ismail Haniyeh condemned the attack as a “terrorist act”, a violation of Lebanon’s sovereignty, and an expansion of Israel’s circle of hostility against Palestinians. Haniyeh said in televised remarks that Hamas “will never be defeated”. There was no immediate comment from Israel. Mark Regev, an adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told the United States news channel MSNBC that Israel had not taken responsibility for the attack but “whoever did it, it must be clear that this was not an attack on the Lebanese state”. “Whoever did this did a surgical strike against the Hamas leadership,” Regev said in an interview. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned the killing. His office said in a statement that the attack “aims to draw Lebanon into a new phase of confrontations” with Israel at a time when Hamas ally Hezbollah has been exchanging daily cross-border fire with Israeli forces in northern Israel, the statement said. Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr, reporting from Beirut, said there was “panic” in the Lebanese capital after the attack. “The targeted killing made many people here in the capital feel that this conflict could widen and could escalate, and all eyes are now on Hezbollah’s reaction,” Khodr said. Iran, which supports both Hamas and Hezbollah, said al-Arouri’s killing would create more resistance against Israel, its state media reported. “The martyr’s blood will undoubtedly ignite another surge in the veins of resistance and the motivation to fight against the Zionist occupiers not only in Palestine but also in the region and among all freedom seekers worldwide,” Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said. Kanaani also condemned the violation of Lebanon’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Netanyahu had threatened to kill al-Arouri long before Israel’s latest assault on the besieged Gaza Strip. Israeli political analyst Akiva Eldar told Al Jazeera the killing was a much needed success for Netanyahu.    Imad Harb, director of research at the Arab Center Washington DC, agreed, saying Israel carried out the attack in search for what has become an elusive win. “So far, the Israelis have not been able to call a victory in Gaza, so assassinating Hamas leaders is partly something that they wanted to do anyway,” he told Al Jazeera. “This is an achievement for the Israeli army and for the Israeli politicians.” Since Israeli forces and Hezbollah began exchanging fire across the Lebanese-Israeli border on October 8, the fighting has largely been concentrated a few kilometres inside each country. But on several occasions, Israel’s air force has hit what it said were Hezbollah positions deeper inside Lebanon. Harb said the killing of al-Arouri is a “dangerous escalation” because it took place in Hezbollah’s area of operations, far from the border. Harb predicted Hezbollah would likely step up attacks on Israel in response to the killing but would stop short of escalating the conflict into an all-out war. Meanwhile, at mosques in Arura, the hometown of the slain Hamas leader in the West Bank, Palestinians gathered to mourn al-Arouri’s death. Protests and gatherings also took place in Ramallah and several nearby towns, such as Deir Qaddis. A general strike in Ramallah has also been called for Wednesday.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/2/top-hamas-official-saleh-al-arouri-killed-in-beirut-suburb
Israel promises to fight South Africa genocide accusation at ICJ,"South Africa launched case against Israel, saying the magnitude of death and destruction in Gaza meets the threshold of the 1948 Genocide Convention.","Israel will appear before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague to contest South Africa’s accusation that it is committing genocide against Palestinians in its war with Hamas, an Israeli government spokesman says. South Africalaunched the case against Israel on Friday, saying the magnitude of death, destruction and the extent of the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip meets the threshold of the 1948 Genocide Convention under international law. South Africa also asked the court to order Israel to stop its attacks in Gaza. A spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday accused South Africa of “giving political and legal cover” to the October 7 Hamas attacks on Israel, which triggered the three-month-long war. “The state of Israel will appear before the International Court of Justice at The Hague to dispel South Africa’s absurd blood libel,” Eylon Levy said. “We assure South Africa’s leaders, history will judge you, and it will judge you without mercy,” Levy added. The spokesperson said Hamas was responsible for the war it started and was “waging from inside and underneath hospitals, schools, mosques, homes and UN facilities”. For decades, South Africa hasbacked the Palestinian cause for statehood. It has likened the treatment of Palestinians to those of the Black majority in South Africa during the apartheid era, a comparison that Israel vehemently denies. Clayson Monyela, a spokesperson for South Africa’s Department of International Relations and Cooperation, said in a post on X that lawyers representing South Africa were preparing for the hearing scheduled for January 11 and 12. The announcement comes as fierce fighting continues in southern Gaza with Israeli forces bombarding the city of Khan Younis from the air and ground. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society said on Tuesday that Israeli forces hit its headquarters in Khan Younis, resulting in several deaths and injuries among the displaced people who had been sheltering there. The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza said on Tuesday that more than 200 people had been killed in 24 hours, taking the death toll from the Israeli assault on Gaza to more than 22,000.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/2/israel-promises-to-defend-itself-against-genocide-accusation-at-icj
Israeli army launches attacks on targets in Syria and Lebanon,"As war in Gaza rages, Israel is continuing its campaign against Syrian military and Hezbollah targets, sparking fears of regional spillover.","Israel has launched attacks on positions in Syria and Lebanon, as part of its ongoing campaign against opposing militaries and armed forces in the Middle East. “The [Israeli army] struck military infrastructure belonging to the Syrian Army,” the Israeli military said in a post on the social media platform X on Tuesday. “[Israeli military] fighter jets also struck Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure in Lebanon,” it added, promising it would “continue to operate against any threat to Israel’s sovereignty”. Israel’s military has been engaged in cross-border fighting with Hezbollah and has launched repeated air raids on Syria since its war on Gaza began on October 7, raising fears of the conflict spilling over into the wider region. In response to yesterday's launches toward Israeli territory, the IDF struck military infrastructure belonging to the Syrian Army. IDF fighter jets also struck Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure in Lebanon. The IDF will continue to operate against any threat to Israel's…pic.twitter.com/xSty1eyMkb — Israel Defense Forces (@IDF)January 2, 2024  The latest attacks, which occurred between Monday and Tuesday, marked a spike in tensions between Israel and neighbours it has said have links to its enemy, Iran. Earlier on Tuesday, Syrian state news agency SANA said pre-dawn Israeli attacks came from the direction of the Golan Heights. The air raids targeted “a number of sites in the Damascus countryside”, SANA reported, citing an unnamed military source as saying only “material damage” had been caused. Britain-based war monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that one position targeted near the town of Kanaker housed members from Lebanon’s Hezbollah, the AFP news agency reported. Parts of the southern Lebanese city of Yaroun also came under fire, the Israeli military said on Tuesday, after Hezbollah announced it had fired on Israeli units near the northern Israeli village of Sarit. “What Israel is facing at the moment is fighters in various countries in the region that are mostly backed by Iran,” said Al Jazeera’s Sara Khairat, reporting from Tel Aviv on Tuesday. Syria and Iran are regional allies, with President Bashar al-Assad having received staunch support from Tehran during the war in Syria. Since its formation in 1982, Iran-backed Hezbollah has grown into a powerful “state within a state” in Lebanon, and has also backed Hamas in Gaza. “Of course the biggest threat so far has been from the Iranian-backed group Hezbollah in Lebanon that has been firing every single day,” Khairat said. “This is just showing that despite [Israel’s] continued war in Gaza, these attacks are going to continue. “Certainly there has been a call amongst those in the [Israeli] military to start to look to redirect their efforts especially along that northern border, with Israel itself saying that if diplomatic efforts don’t work then it wouldn’t be afraid to consider other military action against Lebanon,” our correspondent added. Tuesday’s attacks follow closely on the heels of an Israeli air raid nearAleppoat the end of December, which caused some material damage, according to the Syrian Ministry of Defence. Since the Syrian war began, Israel has launched hundreds of air raids on Syrian territory, both on Syrian military and Hezbollah targets. Israel has repeatedly said it will not allow Iran to expand its presence in Syria. In December, an Israeli air raid outside Damascus killed Razi Moussavi, asenior adviserin Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) responsible for coordinating the military alliance between Syria and Iran. Reports from Iran’s news agency INRA said that Mousavi had been part of an entourage accompanying IRGC General Qassem Soleimani at Baghdad airport when he was killed by a US drone attack almost exactly four years ago.

"Israel maintains onslaught as Gaza death toll tops 22,000","Gaza’s health ministry says 22,185 Palestinians have now been killed in Gaza since October 7.","Israeli attacks have continued across theGaza Stripwith little let-up, as the death toll in the enclave rose above the latest milestone of 22,000. The total number of Palestinians killed in Gaza since October 7 now stands at 22,185, while at least 57,000 have been injured, the Ministry of Health said on Tuesday. Meanwhile, air and ground attacks continued, including in southern Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of displaced people have been directed to seek safety. And an attack on a Hamas office inLebanonkilled a senior leader of the group the governs the Gaza Strip. Some two-thirds of those killed in Israel’s bombardment of Gaza are women and children, according to the health ministry. Israel launched its campaign following Hamas’s raid into southern Israel, which killed around 1,140 and saw around 240 taken hostage. Overall, 207 Palestinians have been killed in 15 Israeli attacks over the past 24 hours, the health ministry said. It also reported that 338 people were wounded. Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Khan Younis in the south, said there was “intense bombardment” in the central and southern regions last night and in the early hours of Tuesday morning. “There were reports of massive explosions in these two areas, in Khan Younis and refugee camps in the central part,” he said. The intensity of the bombing and the fact that many roads and much infrastructure were destroyed prevented ambulances from going to the targeted sites and taking people to hospitals. The headquarters of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) in Khan Younis was also attacked on Tuesday, the group said, resulting in the deaths of at least five people. “This is the second attack carried out against this institution,” Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum said, speaking from Rafah. In the central Gaza city of Deir el-Balah, Israeli forces hit a home, killing mostly women and children, local Palestinian outlet Wafa News Agency said. In the Nuseirat refugee camp, also in central Gaza, at least one girl was killed and several others injured after an Israeli drone opened fire on the market. “The Israeli military offensive is directed towards the middle governorates, which have been witnessing systematic destruction of residential neighbourhoods,” Abu Azzoum said. “They have destroyed dozens of houses today, forcing people to flee towards the southern parts of Gaza.” More than one million Palestinians have been displaced from northern Gaza since October 13, when the Israeli military ordered people toevacuateto the south with 24 hours of notice. In central Gaza’s Bureij refugee camp, Hamas’s armed wing, the Qassam Brigades, said it had clashed with Israeli forces in the eastern part of the camp, while also targeting an Israeli Merkava tank. Theal-Quds Brigades, the armed wing of the Islamic Jihad, says that its fighters fought an armed battle with Israeli soldiers in the Bureij refugee camp that resulted in injuries among the soldiers. The armed wing also announced that it targeted the Israeli military with mortar shells in the al-Mahatta area in Khan Younis. The Israeli army said that 31 soldiers have been injured in the Gaza Strip during the past 24 hours. So far, 507 of its soldiers have been killed since the war began. Meanwhile, the Israeli military said it killed Hamas members who were planting mines along Gaza’s coastline and in nearby buildings. The Israeli army said it also killed three Hamas members in an air attack after seeing them enter a building south of Gaza City in the north.    On Tuesday evening, an apparent Israeli attack on a suburb in the Lebanese capital, Beirut,killed senior Hamas officialSaleh al-Arouri and at least five other people. Hamas has vowed that the killing will not “undermine the continued brave resistance” in Gaza. With at least 22,000 Palestinians massacred in Gaza, Israel has lost its “carte blanche” from Western allies, said Adel Abdel Ghafar, a senior fellow at the Middle East Council on Global Affairs. “As scenes of carnage, displaced populations, dead children and starvation fill our screens, the tide is really shifting,” he told Al Jazeera, adding thatmassive pro-Palestinian ralliesacross Europe and the United States have exerted pressure on politicians, with some European countries like Belgium changing their tone on Gaza and calling for a ceasefire, something Israel has firmly rejected. “It’s also very interesting to keep an eye on US politics given that this is an election year and [US President Joe] Biden’s ratings are down,” said Abdel Ghafar. “This will factor into his calculus in this New Year.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/2/israeli-bombardment-ongoing-as-death-toll-surpasses-22000
Turkey arrests dozens suspected of spying for Israel,"Suspects detained in raids for allegedly planning to pursue, assault and kidnap foreign nationals living in Turkey.","Turkey has reportedly detained 33 people suspected of spying on behalf of Israel. The authorities are still searching for 13 other people believed to have links to Israel’s Mossad security service, the Anadolu Agency reported on Tuesday. Ankara has previously warned that it will not allow Israel to strike at Hamas inside Turkey’s borders. The suspects were detained in raids in Istanbul and seven other provinces for allegedly planning to carry out activities that included “reconnaissance” and “pursuing, assaulting and kidnapping” foreign nationals living in Turkey, the agency reported. “We will never allow espionage activities to be conducted against the national unity and solidarity of our country,” Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said on social media. Anadolu did not provide information on the suspects, nor the foreigners who were allegedly targeted. The report came weeks after the head of Israel’s domestic security agency, Shin Bet, said in an audio recording that his organisation is prepared to destroy Hamas “in every place,” including in Lebanon, Turkey and Qatar. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned Israel of “serious consequences” if it pressed ahead with its threat to attack Hamas officials on Turkish soil. Following years of tension, Turkey and Israel moved towards normalising ties in 2022 as they resumed diplomatic ties. But that detente quickly deteriorated during the Israel-Hamas war, with Ankara becoming one of the strongest critics of Israel’s military actions in Gaza. Israel initially withdrew its diplomats from Turkey over security concerns and later announced it was recalling its diplomats for political reasons, citing “increasingly harsh statements” from Turkish officials. Turkey also pulled its ambassador from Israel. Erdogan’s reaction to the Israel-Hamas war was initially fairly muted. But the Turkish leader has sinceintensified his criticism of Israel, describing its actions in Gaza as verging on “genocide”. He has called for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to be prosecuted for “war crimes” andcompared him to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. The Turkish leader, whose government has hosted several Hamas officials in the past, has also said that the Palestinian group – considered a “terrorist organisation” by Israel, the United States and the European Union – is fighting for the liberation of its lands and people. The arrests have come amid a spate of arrests by Turkish security forces. In roughly two weeks before the new year, about 500 people suspected of having ties to the ISIL (ISIS) armed group weredetained in raids across the country. The detentions were thought to be part of a drive by Turkey’s security forces ahead of New Year festivities. An ISIL attack in Istanbul on January 1, 2017,killed 39 people. At the same time, some have also viewed the uptick in arrests as part of a political push in advance of local elections in March. Analysts say that President Erdogan is eager to win back control of Istanbul, Ankara and other major economic hubs that his AK Party has lost.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/2/turkey-detains-33-people-suspected-of-spying-on-behalf-of-israel
What’s next for Netanyahu after top court ruling against judicial overhaul?,"After months of protests, the Supreme Court has nullified a law that aimed to curb its powers and give parliament more sway.","The Israeli Supreme Court has struck down a controversial law that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition government has been pushing for months – but caused uproar and prompted thousands of people to take to the streets in defiant protest. That decision is being seen as a blow to the coalition government which promised to enact sweeping changes that would curb judicial powers but has suffered deep divisions since being sworn in, late in 2022. Those fissures appear to have only deepened, with the top court’s ruling made as Israel wages a devastating war on Gaza that has already killed more than 22,000 people in the besieged enclave, more than a third of them children. So what is the controversy about – and what is next for Israel and Netanyahu? The law was the only one from a package of judicial overhauls by Netanyahu’s government that aimed to limit the Supreme Court’s powers concerning the executive. Since Israel does not have a constitution, it relies on a set of Basic Laws and the legislation in question was an amendment to an existing provision that allowed the Supreme Court to overrule laws that, in its view, did not pass a “reasonableness” test. The new law eliminated the top court’s ability to block laws using that test. Other laws that are part of the planned judicial overhaul would give the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, more power to appoint Supreme Court judges. Before being passed in July, and even after that, the law saw swift and intense opposition in Israel, with thousands of people in Israel and abroad demonstrating for several weeks on end. Thousands of army reservists also threatened to quit. Detractors say the law removes a crucial checks and balances component of Israeli democracy needed in a country with a fragile legal system. Many Israelis also said the amendment weakens the independence of the judiciary at a time when the country is being run by its most far-right and most religiously conservative coalition yet. Western allies, including the United States and the United Kingdom, cautioned Netanyahu and advised his government to “uphold democracy”  as demonstrations raged across the two countries. Although it saw great opposition from inside the Knesset as well, the bill passed with a vote of 64 to 0 after opposition lawmakers boycotted and left the session. In a vote on Monday, 12 of 15 Supreme Court judges ruled for the first time that the court had the power to strike down Basic Laws. Eight judges further voted to nullify this specific “reasonableness” amendment. It is the first time the court will nullify a Basic Law or an amendment to one. In a case summary, the Supreme Court said the government’s passing of the law “completely revoked the possibility of carrying out judicial review of the reasonableness of decisions made by the government, the prime minister, and the ministers,” and added that letting the law stand could cause “unprecedented and severe harm” to Israel’s democracy. Netanyahu’s government has always claimed the law is needed to create balance in government branches and to diversify the bench which it sees as putting minority interests before national ones. But some see the push for the law as an attempt by Netanyahu to avoid sentencing in a drawn-out corruption trial in which he faces charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. Those proceedings were suspended following the start of Israel’s war on Gaza, but resumed early in December. Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing. Netanyahu’s Minister of Justice Yariv Levin, who has shepherded the controversial laws, including the one that the court has struck down, hit out at the judges, insisting that the ruling would not “stay our hand”. Levin also said that the decision by the court to publish its ruling while Israel’s war on Gaza was continuing is “the opposite of the unity required these days for the success of our fighters on the front.” Likud, Netanyahu’s party, said the decision was “unfortunate”. Yet, if the government decides to ignore the Supreme Court ruling, it could end up destabilising the wartime coalition that is leading Israel’s assault on Gaza. Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant has opposed the amendment – and was even temporarily fired over it. On Monday, former defense minister Benny Gantz also called for the Supreme Court ruling to be respected – effectively publicly rejecting Levin’s criticism of the judges. ערב ה-7.10 החברה הישראלית הגיעה למקומות קיצוניים, לפילוג ולשיח שנאה שהיה אסור להגיע אליהם. את פסק הדין חובה לכבד, ואת הלקח מההתנהלות בשנה האחרונה חובה להפנים – אחים אנחנו, לכולנו גורל משותף. אלו לא ימים לניגוחים פוליטיים, אין היום מנצחים ומפסידים. היום יש לנו רק מטרה אחת משותפת… — בני גנץ – Benny Gantz (@gantzbe)January 1, 2024  “The verdict must be respected, and the lesson from the conduct of the last year must be internalised – we are brothers, we all have a common destiny,” he wrote on X. “These are not days for political arguments, there are no winners and losers today.

Israeli raids kill five as lethal operations persist in occupied West Bank,"The Israeli military says four Palestinians were killed in Azzun, while a fifth was shot dead in Qalqilya.","At least five Palestinians have been killed during overnight raids in the occupied West Bank, the Israeli military has said. Four Palestinians were killed in Azzun, while the fifth was shot dead in Qalqilya after allegedly opening fire during a raid, the military said on Tuesday. Casualties and arrests have been rife in the West Bank amid increased activity by Israel amid its war in Gaza. Detailing the latest incidents, the Israeli army posted a photo of three Carlo sub-machine guns they claimed the four men were carrying. The Palestine Ministry of Health also confirmed the deaths in Azzun on their Telegram channel, adding that the bodies of the deceased were taken away by Israeli forces. There was no immediate comment from Palestinian officials on the person killed in Qalqilya. Since the Hamas offensive on October 7, Israeli forces have intensifiedlethal operationsthroughout the occupied West Bank, resulting in more than 320 Palestinian deaths from military actions and settler attacks. Close to 5,000 people have been arrested in the territory since the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza began. Al Jazeera’s Bernard Smith, reporting from Ramallah, said there were at least a dozen raids in the West Bank overnight. Azzun was the most serious, he added. “We know there have been violent confrontations between Palestinians and Israeli security forces there. An IED was thrown at a military Jeep,” he said. The bodies of the four people killed were taken away by Israeli forces, Smith said, noting that such action is “not unusual”. “Since October 7, 46 bodies have been withheld by the Israelis and they got 194 in total since 2016,” he added. Raids also took place in the city of Jenin, Smith reported. “Those raids are happening practically every night in Jenin, a centre of Palestinian resistance.” The United Nations in a report last weekurgedIsrael to cease “unlawful killings” and settler violence in the occupied West Bank. The UN Human Rights Office highlighted a concerning escalation in air raids and military incursions into densely populated refugee camps last week, leading to casualties and extensive damage to civilian infrastructure in the occupied territory.

Sudan’s feared paramilitary leader signals ambition to rule the country,Mohamed Hamdan ‘Hemedti’ Dagalo goes on an African tour to secure regional support and political legitimacy.,"When Sudan’s civil war erupted in April between the army and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the paramilitary group’s leader, Mohamed Hamdan “Hemedti” Dagalo, went into hiding. Many speculated he had been seriously wounded or was even dead until he appeared in a photo-op with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni on Wednesday. The next day, Hemedti visited Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, ostensibly to discuss strategies to end Sudan’s conflict. He also passed through Ghana and Djibouti. UPDATE-  President Museveni, has met with Gen. Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, the former Deputy Chair of the Transitional Sovereignty Council of Sudan, at his country home in Rwakitura. They discussed, among other things, ways to put an end to the continued conflict in Sudan.#UBCNEWSpic.twitter.com/HxFzdIN0t5 — UBC UGANDA (@ubctvuganda)December 27, 2023  Analysts believe Hemedti’s real motive was securing regional support to capture all of Sudan from the army. Last month, the RSF captured Gezira state – a breadbasket for Sudan – giving the group the clear upper hand against the army. But rather than leverage military success in negotiations to end the conflict, Hemedti appears to have ambitions to rule all of Sudan, according to analysts, Sudanese journalists and diplomats. “Hemedti desperately needs people to feel that the RSF is a governing force. I think this is why Hemedti went to meet heads of state,” said Kholood Khair, a Sudan expert and founding director of the think tank Confluence Advisory. “Hemedti will try as much as possible to fashion himself into this idea of being a leader,” Khair told Al Jazeera. On December 9, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), an eight-nation East African bloc,releaseda statement saying Hemedti and army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan would meet face to face in two weeks. But Hemedti went to Uganda the day before he was supposed to meet al-Burhan for ceasefire talks in Djibouti. IGAD postponed the talks for “technical reasons”. On Monday, Hemedti met with Sudan’s former prime minister and the leader of a newlyformedcivilian bloc, the Coordination of Civil Democratic Forces (Taqaddum), Abdallah Hamdok, in Ethiopia. Taqaddum has announced it also invited al-Burhan to meet at another date, but there has been no information about whether that invitation has been accepted. Khair believes Hemedti and al-Burhan are both partaking in – and derailing – mediation efforts to buy time for their military operations. “This is all a red herring … to gain some international kudos while at the same time trying to gain some ground [in the war],” she told Al Jazeera. In October, the RSF captured several army garrisons across the sprawling western region of Darfur, just as the US-backed mediation talks in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, were about to resume after a lengthy hiatus. Jonas Horner, an independent expert on Sudan, told Al Jazeera the RSF’s expansion as it takes more states to the north and east is not sustainable. He noted that the paramilitary has recruited heavily from its tribal base in Darfur in exchange for allowing the fighters to loot cities they capture. But the pillaging of homes, hospitals, United Nations warehouses and markets has led to popular resentment and hatred of the group, he said. “[The RSF’s] atrocities and their hardcore cruelty … is probably their single biggest obstacle and makes the prospect of them governing the country far more difficult,” Horner said. “I think so many Sudanese … are never going to be comfortable with the RSF governing them,” he added. Despite committing a myriad of human rights abuses, the RSF is trying to bring law and order to regions under its control, Sudanese journalist Mohamad el-Fatih Yousif said from Darfur. He told Al Jazeera that the paramilitary has created a department called Civil and Political Management, whose paid employees are responsible for repairing basic services like hospitals, electricity grids and water stations in South Darfur’s capital, Nyala. “There is relative safety right now in Nyala,” el-Fatih Yousif said. “All the RSF fighters that were looting Nyala left. They all went to Gezira state.” The RSF has alsoestablisheda local police force in Sudan’s capital, Khartoum, most of which it controls. Police forces have also been instructed to maintain order throughout Darfur. Many activists and analysts are mocking the group’s ostensible attempt to combat criminality and blame the RSF for most of the theft, violence and lawlessness in the country. This is a farce. Will the RSF's police force arrest RSF forces for the killing, looting, property destruction, occupation of houses, sexual violence, and other crimes in which they've been implicated in Khartoum and other areas?https://t.co/0iM6rcOFQF — Lauren Blanchard (@LaurenBinDC)December 13, 2023  “This is a farce,” tweeted Lauren Blanchard, an expert on Sudan and a specialist in African affairs at the Congressional Research Service. “Will the RSF’s police force arrest RSF forces for the killing, looting, property destruction, occupation of houses, sexual violence, and other crimes in which they have been implicated in Khartoum and other areas?” While almost nobody in northern and eastern Sudan will accept living under Hemedti, European countries will cooperate with the RSF if it captures the entire country, according to one Western diplomat who spoke to Al Jazeera on the condition of anonymity. He said that in the interest of stemming migration from Africa to Europe, the European Union is already signing partnerships with strongman leaders such as Tunisian President Kais Said and an eastern Libyan militia connected to renegade military commander Khalifa Haftar. The EU also previously worked with the RSF on migration as part of the Khartoum Process, a 2014 migration pact between the EU and countries in the Horn of Africa to combat the trafficking and smuggling of human beings. The EU suspended cooperation with Sudan after the RSF spearheaded an attack on a sit-in on June 3, 2019, according to open-source investigations carried out by human rights groups. At least 120 people were killed in what survivors and rights groups called a massacre. “Europe denied that they ever supported the RSF directly, but they did. And I think that they will do so in the future if that is what is necessary,” the diplomat told Al Jazeera. “And if it turns out that the RSF is about to take over all of Sudan, then I think the EU will make the calculation that they have to publicly condemn what the RSF is doing. “But I don’t think [the EU] will stop the RSF or support any country to stop the RSF from taking over the country.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/2/sudans-feared-paramilitary-leader-signals-ambition-to-rule-the-country

Israel says it will pull out thousands of troops from Gaza,"Israel has come under pressure from its principal ally, the United States, to move to a more low-intensity war.","The Israeli military has announced that it will withdraw thousands of its soldiers from the besieged Gaza Strip in the first significant pullback of troops since the war there began in October. Israel has come under increasing pressure from its principal ally, the United States, to move to a more low-intensity war that has fewer civilian casualties. But in the southern city of Khan Younis, fierce fighting has continued as Israel reaffirms its pledge to press on with the war until its goals have been achieved, including destroying the Palestinian group Hamas, which killed around 1,140 people in attacks on southern Israel on October 7, according to Israeli officials. In a statement, the military said on Monday that five brigades, or several thousand troops, were being taken out of the enclave for training and rest. Army spokesperson Daniel Hagari did not say whether the decision meant the war was entering into a new phase during a briefing on Sunday that first announced the troop withdrawal. “The objectives of the war require prolonged fighting, and we are preparing accordingly,” he said. Shlomo Brom, a retired brigadier general previously in charge of strategic planning in the Israeli military, said the troop changes may be due to US pressure and could signal a shift in the way Israel is conducting the war. “The war is not stopping,” said Brom. “It is the beginning of a different mode of operations”. Israeli officials have said they would wage the war in three main stages. The first was intense shelling to clear access routes for ground forces and encourage civilians to evacuate. The second was the invasion of the Gaza Strip that began on October 27. With tanks and troops having now overrun much of the Strip, largely asserting control despite Palestinian gunmen continuing their ambushes from hidden tunnels and bunkers, the military is moving to the third stage, an Israeli official, who could not be named given the sensitivity of the issue, told the Reuters news agency. “This will take six months at least, and involve intense mopping-up missions against the terrorists. No one is talking about doves of peace being flown from Shujayea,” the official was quoted as saying, referring to a Gaza district ravaged by fighting. Separately on Monday, the US announced that it would be taking an aircraft carrier strike group back from the eastern Mediterranean and replacing it with an amphibious assault ship and accompanying warships. Palestinian health authorities say at least 21,978 people have been killed in the Israeli assault on Gaza since October 7. The Israeli military said last week that at least 172 soldiers had been killed since the ground operation began in late October, including 18 by friendly fire and 11 by weapons or equipment malfunctions.    Since the outbreak of the war, the Israeli military has engaged in cross-border battles with the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah. On Monday, Hezbollah said on Telegram that three of its fighters had been killed in southern Lebanon. While it gave no detail about how they were killed, the groups said they “were martyred on the road to [liberate] Jerusalem”. The Israeli military said it hit a series of targets in Lebanon, including “military sites” where Hezbollah was operating. According to Hezbollah and security sources who have spoken to the Reuters news agency, more than 100 Hezbollah fighters and nearly two dozen civilians, including children and the elderly, have died.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/1/israel-says-it-will-pull-out-thousands-of-troops-from-gaza
Israel’s Supreme Court strikes down judicial overhaul law,"The majority of the court’s judges vote to strike down the law, saying it would severely damage Israel’s democracy.","Israel’s Supreme Court has struck down a highly disputed law passed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing government that rolled back some of the high court’s power and sparkednationwide protests. The law, passed in July, was part of a broader judicial overhaul proposed by Netanyahu and his coalition of religious and nationalist partners. Thelegislationbrought before the court had removed one, but not all, of the tools the Supreme Court has for quashing government and ministers’ decisions. It took away the court’s ability to void decisions that it deemed “unreasonable”. Eight of 15 justices ruled in favour of nullifying the law, the court said on Monday. Justice Minister Yariv Levin, a Netanyahu ally and the architect of the overhaul, lambasted the court’s decision, saying it demonstrated “the opposite of the spirit of unity required these days for the success of our soldiers on the front”. The ruling “will not discourage us”, Levin said without indicating whether the government would try to revive his plan in the short term. “As the campaigns are continuing on different fronts, we will continue to act with restraint and responsibility.” Opposition lawmakers praised the ruling. They had argued that Netanyahu’s efforts to remove the standard of reasonability opens the door to corruption and improper appointments of unqualified cronies to important positions. The Supreme Court, in a summary of its decision, said the majority of judges ruled to strike down the law because it would severely damage Israel’s democracy.    The move was a significant blow to Netanyahu and his hardline allies, who argued the national legislature, not the high court, should have the final word over the legality of legislation and other key decisions. But the justices said the Knesset, or parliament, does not have “omnipotent” power. Netanyahu and his allies announced their sweeping overhaul plan shortly after taking office a year ago. It calls for curbing the power of judges, from limiting the Supreme Court’s ability to review parliamentary decisions to changing the way judges are appointed. The government said the changes aim to strengthen democracy by limiting the authority of unelected judges and turning over more powers to elected officials. But opponents see the overhaul as a power grab by Netanyahu, who is on trial on corruption charges, and an assault on a key watchdog. Before Israel launched its latest assault on the besieged Gaza Strip on October 7, hundreds of thousands of Israelis took to the streets in weekly protests against the government. Among the demonstrators were military reservists, including fighter pilots and members of other elite units, who said they would stop reporting for duty if the overhaul was passed. The reservists make up the backbone of the military. Under the Israeli system, the prime minister governs through a majority coalition in parliament – in effect giving him control over the executive and legislative branches of government. As a result, the Supreme Court plays a critical oversight role. Critics said that by seeking to weaken the judiciary, Netanyahu and his allies are trying to erode the country’s checks and balances and consolidate power over the third, independent branch of government.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/1/israels-supreme-court-strikes-down-judicial-overhaul-law
Iran deploys warship to Red Sea amid soaring tensions,"Alborz warship enters Bab al-Mandeb Strait, Iranian media reports a day after Yemen’s Houthis say 10 fighters killed.","Iran’s Alborz warship has entered the Red Sea through the strategic Bab al-Mandeb Strait, Iran’s Tasnim news agency has reported, at a time of heightened tensions over the globally important waterway. “The Alborz destroyer entered the Red Sea … by passing through the Bab al-Mandeb” waterway at the southern tip of the Red Sea, connecting with the Gulf of Aden in the Indian Ocean, the news agency said on Monday. It added that Iran’s naval fleet has been operating in the area “to secure shipping lanes, repel pirates, among other purposes since 2009”. The United States in early December set up a multinational naval task force for the Red Sea following a flurry of missile and drone attacks by Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi rebels on merchant vessels, which led shipping companies to suspend passages through the now highly militarised area.    The Houthis say the attacks were in solidarity with Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip, where Israel is continuing a months-long bombardment campaign. According to the International Chamber of Shipping, 12 percent of global trade passes through the Red Sea, which provides a shortcut past Africa via the Suez Canal. The Tasnim report comes a day after US Navy helicoptersfired on Houthi rebelsattempting to board a cargo ship off Yemen, with the rebels reporting10 fighters dead. It also comes after Sayyed Razi Mousavi, one of the top commanders of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps in Syria, was killed in an Israeli air strike outside of Damascus last week. Al Jazeera’s Resul Serdar, reporting from Djibouti, said that Iran sending a warship to the region was not a “new” development. “From time to time”, there have been Iranian warships operating in this area, he said. “These waters are open to Iranian warships, as they’re open to many countries.” Serdar said “more and more warships” are now amassing in the region, including those belonging to the US and Britain. Separately, Iran’s security chief, Ali Akbar Ahmadian, held a meeting with top Houthi negotiator Mohammad Abdulsalam, according to the state-run news agency IRNA. It is unclear where or when the meeting took place, but Iranian media quoted Ahmadian as saying Tehran praised the Houthis for supporting Palestinians and standing up to Israel. Regional tensions have spiked since the start of Israel’s assault on Gaza following the October 7 Hamas attacks.    On Monday, Britain’s Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said Britain was “willing to take direct action” against the Houthis “to deter threats to freedom of navigation in the Red Sea”. British Foreign Secretary David Cameron had spoken on Sunday with his Iranian counterpart Hossein Amir-Abdollahian about the Red Sea tensions. “I made clear that Iran shares responsibility for preventing these attacks,” he said on social media, noting Tehran’s “long-standing support” for the Houthis. Abdollahian criticised the “double standards” of some Western countries, according to a statement from Iran’s foreign ministry, saying the “Israeli regime cannot be allowed … to set the region on fire” with the Gaza war. The US previously accused Iran of being “deeply involved” in the Houthi attacks. Iran has denied such accusations, saying the Houthi rebels were acting on their own. In 2021, the Alborz repulsed a pirate attack against two oil tankers in the Gulf of Aden. And in 2015, it was one of two Iranian warships sent to the strait “to ensure the safety of commercial ships” in what was seen at the time as a sign of tensions with Saudi Arabia.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/1/iran-deploys-warship-to-red-sea-following-us-navy-attack-on-houthis
Six killed in ambush in disputed area between Sudan and South Sudan,The oil-rich region experiences frequent bouts of violence from rival factions of an ethnic group across both countries.,"Six people, including a senior local administrator, have been killed in an ambush by armed men in the Abyei region, claimed by both Sudan and South Sudan, local officials said. The oil-rich region experiences frequent bouts of violence, where rival factions of the Dinka ethnic group – Twic Dinka from South Sudan’s neighbouring Warrap state, and Ngok Dinka from Abyei – are locked in a dispute over the location of an administrative boundary. Abyei Deputy Chief Administrator Noon Deng and his team came under attack along the road from Abyei to Aneet town when they were returning from an official visit to Rummamer county, where they were celebrating the New Year, government officials said. “His driver and two bodyguards plus two people of national security were all killed,” Tereza Chol, a South Sudanese lawmaker, told Reuters news agency. Bulis Koch, information minister for Abyei Administrative Area, blamed the Sunday evening attack on armed youth from Twic county of Warrap and said the bodies had not been retrieved as of Monday morning. His counterpart in Warrap, William Wol, said it was still early “to point fingers”. The incident is the latest in the region where dozens were killed in ethnic clashes in November. Straddling an ill-defined border between Sudan and South Sudan, Abyei has been claimed by both countries since Juba declared independence from Khartoum in 2011. It has a special administrative status, governed by an administration comprising officials appointed by both countries. South Sudan erupted into civil war shortly after independence, which pitted President Salva Kiir and his allies against his Vice President Riek Machar. A peace agreement signed in 2018 is largely holding, but the transitional government has been slow to unify the various factions of the military.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/1/six-dead-in-disputed-oil-rich-area-between-sudan-and-south-sudan
US sinks Houthi boats in the Red Sea: How did the fight unfold?,Shipping company Maersk halts operations after maritime escalation between the Houthis and US forces.,"The US military says itkilled 10 Houthi fightersand sank three of the Yemeni armed group’s vessels after a clash in the Red Sea. The escalation, mentioned in a US statement on Sunday, follows weeks of Houthi attacks on ships it identified as being linked to Israel that were passing through the Bab el-Mandeb strait into the Red Sea. This was, the Houthi spokesman said, in a bid to pressure Israel to stop its devastating war and siege on the Gaza Strip that has killed more than 21,000 Palestinians. US destroyers have teamed up with a few other nations to try and stop the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea under Operation Prosperity Guardian – though several partners have distanced themselves from the initiative. The Red Sea clash on Monday was the first major direct military engagement between the US military and Houthi fighters. Here is what we know about how it all unfolded: On Sunday at 6:30am Yemen time (03:30 GMT), the container shipMaersk Hangzhouissued a second distress call in a day, reporting being attacked by four “Houthi small boats”, the US Central Command (CENTCOM) posted on X. In response to the distress call, CENTCOM said, the USS Gravely shot down two anti-ship missiles fired at the Maersk vessel then helicopters from the Gravely and the USS Eisenhower were dispatched towards the Maersk Hangzhou. TheHouthisbeganlaunching dronesand missiles towards the southern parts of Israel in October soon after the war broke out on October 7. However, the drones were intercepted or fell short and the Iran-backed group started attacking ships in the Red Sea they said were linked to Israel. Their attackshave disruptedmany ships for making their way to Israel. On December 19, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced amultinational maritime protection forcebut the Houthis have said they willnot back downunless Israel ceases its war on Gaza.  Despiteseveral countriesagreeing to join the US’s marine force, only the United Kingdom has directly contributed warships, leaving Washington to effectively “act alone” against the Houthis, reports Al Jazeera’s Resul Serdar from Djibouti. Serdar added that the US has “not been able to deter the Houthis” so far, with the groupwaging attackseven more frequently. He added that the latest clash marked a serious escalation because the US killed Houthi fighters, not only sank Houthi boats. Such confrontations are sparking fears of aregional escalation. The US’s CENTCOM says that its helicopters warned the Houthi fighters to stay away when they began to attack the cargo ship with small arms fire and tried to board the vessel. At that point, CENTCOM said, the helicopters came under fire and fired back, killing the 10 Houthi crew members of three boats which also sank. The fourth boat escaped and US personnel and equipment did not bear harm, CENTCOM added. “We’re going to act in self-defence going forward,” a White House official said. A spokesman for the Houthis confirmed that 10 of their fighters were “dead and missing” after their boats were attacked.

Together with German shipping company Hapag-Lloyd, Maersk operates almost a quarter of the world’s shipping fleet. Other shipping firms have also responded to the escalating maritime conflict. Shipping firm Evergreen has temporarily stopped accepting Israeli cargo. Firms including CH Robinson, Evergreen, HMM, Ocean Network Express, Wallenius Wilhelmsen and Yang Ming Marine Transport are planning to avoid the Red Sea and increase the number of ships rerouting around Africa’s Cape of Good Hope rather than the Suez Canal. This new route is longer and costlier.

Analysis: Is the Israeli army as militarily successful as it claims?,"As we enter 2024, the Israeli army can claim some successes in the war on Gaza — and also has failures to reckon with.","Coordinated, focused, deadly and brutal, the Hamas attacks of October 7 were a shock to Israeli society. The country’s defence, intelligence and security organisations – sources of national pride – were caught unawares and unprepared. They acted slowly and inadequately, with the whole establishment humiliated. The first military reaction was in line with the Israeli military doctrine of powerful attacks against previously designated targets. It took a few days for everyone to get their act together, create the emergency unity government (that mostly unified belligerent right-wingers) and proclaim a huge mobilisation of 360,000 reservists. Three weeks later, amid continuous indiscriminate bombardment, the Israeli army crossed into Gaza. Then, in more than two months of ground combat, the army cut Gaza in three, surrounding Gaza City and isolating Khan Younis. Most Palestinians fled to the south, where they now crowd Rafah in unbearable conditions. Israel maintains that although it has not yet defeated Hamas, it is close to its proclaimed goal, claiming to have “eliminated” 8,500 fighters. The Israeli military’s showing, however, has been very uneven across many aspects of the armed and diplomatic response. In purely military terms, Israel has achieved a degree of success. It has conducted complex military operations in urban terrain, certainly the deadliest form of warfare, by advancing steadily – yet too cautiously and slowly. The centres of Gaza City and Khan Younis are surrounded on the ground, but the military has so far failed to neutralise Hamas fighting units. In an extremely challenging battle environment, the Israeli army successfully integrated many different units of various backgrounds, training and experience – including a plethora of specialised units that report directly to the General Staff outside of the normal territorial or brigade chain of command. Those complex arrangements demand the presence of higher officers on the front lines to coordinate and avoid potential confusion. Among the 172 Israeli soldiers killed so far, the proportion of senior non-commissioned officers is unusually high, but the number of officers who died in battle is staggering, with no less than four full colonels among the dead. Hamas’s losses are certainly lower than Israel claims. A prudent estimate would put it at 3,500 fighters to date – 20 percent of its front line complement. This would mean a ratio of 20 Hamas fighters killed for each Israeli soldier. In classic warfare, any general would happily accept that proportion as a certain victory. However, not in this war. Hamas fighters are ideologically and religiously motivated, and conditioned to disregard death; the fallen are seen as martyrs, which strengthens the cause. In contrast, Israeli society, which is heavily militarised – almost everyone, except the ultra-religious, serves in the military – has a lower tolerance for the losses of its people. Israelis do not see the tangible results of their sons’, husbands’ and brothers’ deaths. The attitude towards losses is probably best demonstrated by the fact that theGolani Brigade, one of the army’s oldest and most decorated units, was pulled from fighting after 72 of its soldiers died in combat. Finally, Israeli forces who claimed their overwhelming military (and moral) superiority, proved to lack either the capabilities or the willingness to decisively destroy the Hamas tunnel network. Despite demonstrating the mastery of technology toflood tunnels with seawater, the Israelis have yet to deploy that tactic. Besides destroying Hamas, the other main proclaimed goal of the Israeli incursion into Gaza was to liberate the remaining captives. Not only has this aim not been achieved, but Israel managed to kill three captives who tried to give themselves up. In many aspects of military technology, the Israeli military is known as a world leader. Most of its hardware and software perform to the army’s own high expectations, which will certainly boost its post-war exports and help, at least, to partially offset the staggering cost of war. New weapons and systems have been successfully integrated with old ones. The Israeli-built Eitan armoured fighting vehicle was rushed into action a year before its planned introduction into combat units without issue. New products, like theIron Stingsmart mortar, and small, simple and cheap reconnaissance quadcopter drones, have proved valuable in reducing losses in urban fighting. Existing products have demonstrated their versatility and become widespread: small body cameras and gun cams are now deployed on all teams; dogs with live cameras have expanded the possibilities of reconnaissance inside buildings suspected of being booby-trapped. Another undoubted Israeli military success is managing to keep its combat data link communications secret, encrypted in real time – there has been no hint of compromise by Hamas. The already-proven Iron Dome antimissile system has continued to be reliable. Just a few weapons have had issues, such as the much-touted Trophy armoured vehicle active protection system, which proved of mixed or no value in close-quarter combat. Initial overreliance on it cost the Israeli army some casualties in the first phases of the battle. But the Israeli army’s learning curve has been steep and, like in the case of the Merkava tank’s lack of protection from above, remedial action has been applied quickly and successfully. Despite the military’s operational success, none of its technology proved to be a real game changer. The notorious overwhelming Israeli propaganda machinery has tried very hard to sell its official line but with limited success. Calling Hamas “terrorists” caught on in much of the Western world – not as much for the rest of the planet. Attempts to equate Hamas with ISIL (ISIS), an effort aimed particularly at the Arab and Islamic world and reinforced by Israeli military spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Avichay Adraee to the Arab world, appear to have failed miserably. But Israel’s biggest failure was the attempt to make the world believe the claim that “Israel is committed to minimising civilian harm and abiding by international law”. Even Israelis themselves have questioned those claims. Videos of purported Hamas fighters, which showed men – many who were overweight, unfit and older than 40 – surrendering to Israeli forces stripped to their underwear, were laughed at and eventually rebuked. Statements intended to dehumanise Palestinians, like their description as“human animals”, made — among others — by Israeli Major-General Ghassan Aslian, ironically a Druze officer, resulted in more revulsion than solidarity. The Druze are an Arab minority group who have faced discrimination within Israel. However, the biggest failure of the Israeli military campaign must be its deliberate, disproportionate and brutal overreaction – one that has killed tens of thousands of civilians. The exact number would depend on how many Hamas fighters are among the 21,800 killed so far. If the Israeli claim of 8,500 Hamas fighters is true, that would still mean that 13,300 civilians, including 8,600 children, have been killed. If Hamas has lost 4,000 people – a figure I find much more credible – the number of civilians who have been killed intentionally or by the negligence of the Israeli military is well above 17,000. That number is considered unacceptable, under any conditions, by many people across the globe who believe that whenever and however the war ends, those dead civilians will come back to haunt the whole of Israel.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/1/analysis-is-the-israeli-army-as-militarily-successful-as-it-claims

Israeli minister reiterates calls for Palestinians to leave Gaza,Israel’s far-right finance minister says Israelis who would replace the Palestinians would ‘make the desert bloom’.,"Israel’s Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has called for Palestinian residents of Gaza to leave the besieged enclave, making way for the Israelis who could “make the desert bloom”. Smotrich, who has been excluded from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s war cabinet and discussions of day-after arrangements in Gaza, made the comments while speaking to Israeli Army Radio on Sunday. “What needs to be done in the Gaza Strip is to encourage emigration,” he said. “If there are 100,000 or 200,000 Arabs in Gaza and not two million Arabs, the entire discussion on the day after will be totally different,” he said. He added that if the 2.3 million population were no longer there “growing up on the aspiration to destroy the state of Israel”, Gaza would be seen differently in Israel. “Most of Israeli society will say: ‘Why not? It’s a nice place, let’s make the desert bloom, it doesn’t come at anyone’s expense’.” In response, Hamas said Smotrich’s call to displace two million Palestinians and keep about 200,000 in Gaza is “a war crime accompanied by criminal aggression”. In a statement, Hamas added that the international community and the United Nations must take action to stop Israel’s crimes and hold it accountable for what it has done to the Palestinian people.    Sara Khairat, reporting for Al Jazeera from Tel Aviv, said Smotrich’s comments “tie into a narrative that many are starting to believe that Israel wants to re-occupy Gaza”. “Pushing the idea that they want to push the Palestinians out”, Khairat said, would be reminiscent of scenes from the“Nakba” (catastrophe), the ethnic cleansing of Palestine in the wake of the 1948 war that accompanied the founding of the state of Israel. Most Palestinians displaced after the Nakba ended up in neighbouring Arab states, and Arab leaders have said any latter-day move to displace Palestinians would be unacceptable. In a speech on Sunday, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas rejected any move to force Palestinians to leave their homes. “We will not allow displacement, whether from the Gaza Strip or the West Bank,” he said.    Smotrich, whose far-right Religious Zionist Party draws support from Israel’s settler community, has made similar comments in the past, setting himself at odds with Israel’s most important ally, the United States. But his views conflict with the official government position that Palestinians in Gaza will be able to return to their homes after the war. Smotrich’s party, which helped Netanyahu secure the majority he needed to become prime minister for the sixth time almost exactly a year ago, has seen its approval ratings slump since the start of the conflict. Opinion polls also indicate that most Israelis do not support the return of Israeli settlements to Gaza after they were moved out in 2005 when the army withdrew. Israel withdrew its military and settlers from Gaza in 2005 after a 38-year occupation, and Netanyahu has said it does not intend to maintain a permanent presence again, but would maintain security control for an indefinite period. However, there has been little clarity about Israel’s longer-term intentions, and countries including the US have said that Gaza should be governed by Palestinians.

"Assad forces target crowded market, kill two: Syria’s White Helmets","Meanwhile, Israel bombed Aleppo and Neirab, leaving Syrians trapped between two forces raining fire from the sky.","Idlib, Syria —Two civilians, including a child, were killed, and 16 others, including four children, were injured in an artillery attack by Syrian regime forces targeting a popular market in the centre of Idlib city on Saturday evening, according to the Syria Civil Defence. “We received two martyrs and 14 injuries, including two critical cases, at the hospital, and they are now in the operating room,” said Ismail al-Hassan, the head of the emergency department at Idlib University Hospital. Al-Hassan told Al Jazeera that the regime of President Bashar al-Assad had recently intensified its targeting of the area, necessitating a constant state of preparedness to receive any injuries within the city or its vicinity in the event of any bombardment. “For nearly 13 years, we have been working to save civilian casualties targeted by the Assad regime and Russia,” al-Hassan said. The Syria Civil Defence, also known as the White Helmets, said that earlier on Saturday, a child was wounded as a result of artillery shelling targeting the city of Atarib in the western Aleppo countryside. “The timing and location of today’s attack in Idlib indicate that its goal is to kill the largest number of civilians,” said Ahmed Yazji, a board member of the Syria Civil Defence. Yazj told Al Jazeera that the attacks by the Syrian regime and Russia on the Idlib region consistently aim to target vital centres, schools, and hospitals with the intention of killing civilians. “Since the beginning of 2023 until today, we have documented more than 1,200 attacks by the Assad regime andRussiaon the northwestern Syria region, including 27 attacks on schools and 16 attacks on displaced camps,” he said. “The attacks of the Assad regime and Russia on the region can only be described as terrorist attacks seeking to undermine stability in the area.” Idlib province, the last stronghold controlled by Syrian opposition fighters, is considered the most densely populated area in northwestern Syria, hosting 4.5 million people, including 1.9 million living in internally displaced camps, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). “Within moments, the market turned into a pool of blood and thick dust,” said Abdullah Aloush, a displaced person from Khan Shaykhun and the owner of a nearby shop in the targeted area in Idlib city. Aloush told Al Jazeera that the market was targeted at a time when it was crowded with civilians. “Initially, myself and those with me in the shop were helpless, not knowing what to do, before we went out to check on our neighbours and assist the injured.” Earlier on Saturday, Israeli warplanes conductedair strikes on Aleppoand Neirab airports, as well as several points belonging to the Syrian regime south of Aleppo. The Israeli air strikes targeted farms between the villages of Zahabiya and Sheikh Saeed in the Neirab military airport area, housing warehouses and headquarters for Iranian militias. A missile also fell in the area of Aleppo International Airport and Neirab military airport, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, based in London. “As usual, the Assad regime, unable to respond to Israeli raids on its sites, targets civilians in northwestern Syria,” said Mohammed al-Saleh, 34, the owner of a cafe on the street in Idlib that was bombed. Al-Saleh, who was approximately 15m (50 feet) away from the bombing, warned everyone in the cafe not to leave the place for fear of a repeat of the bombing in the area and to avoid new casualties. “At these moments, our feeling can only be described as being in the embrace of death,” said Al-Saleh. “In these days, while people around the world are preparing to celebrate the start of anew year, we in Idlib are preparing to bury our friends and family who were killed today.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/31/assad-forces-target-crowded-market-kill-two-syrias-white-helmets
‘Outraged’: Brazilian Muslims face growing Islamophobia over Gaza war,A survey released last month suggests approximately 60 percent of Brazilian Muslims experienced religious intolerance.,"Sao Paulo, Brazil –It wasn’t unusual for patients to arrive in a foul temper at the hospital emergency room in São Paulo, Brazil, where physician Batull Sleiman worked. After all, every day brought new medical crises, new requests for urgent care. Sleiman had seen it all. But she was not expecting the level of anger she received several weeks ago. A patient had arrived in her examination room frustrated over the time he spent waiting for a doctor’s care. Sleiman recalled his issue was “not urgent”. Still, as she treated him, he accused her of being impolite. “You’re being rude with me because you’re not from Brazil,” Sleiman remembers him saying. “If you were in your country…” Sleiman said she turned away rather than hear the rest. The daughter of Lebanese immigrants, she believes the man reacted the way he did because of one thing: her hijab. “I was surprised and outraged,” Sleiman told Al Jazeera. But, she added, the atmosphere in Brazil had grown more tense since thewar in Gazahad erupted. “I’ve been noticing that people have been staring more at me on the street since October.” But Sleiman is not alone in feeling singled out. As the war in Gaza grinds on, Brazil is one of many countries facing increased fears about religious discrimination, particularly towards its Muslim community. A survey released last month from the Anthropology Group on Islamic and Arab Contexts — an organisation based at the University of São Paulo — found that reports of harassment among Muslim Brazilians have been widespread since the war began. An estimated 70 percent of respondents said they knew someone who experienced religious intolerance since October 7, when the Palestinian groupHamaslaunched an attack on southern Israel, killing 1,140 people. Israel has since led a military offensive against Gaza, a Palestinian enclave, killing more than21,000 people. That response has raised human rights concerns, with United Nations experts warning of a “grave risk of genocide”. While Palestinians are an ethnic group — and not a religious one — the University of São Paulo’s Professor Francirosy Barbosa found that the events of October 7 resulted in incidents of religious intolerance in Brazil, as Palestinian identity was conflated with Muslim identity. She led November’s survey of 310 Muslim Brazilians. Respondents, she explained, reported receiving insults that reflected tensions in the Gaza war. “Many Muslim women told us they are now called things like ‘Hamas daughter’ or ‘Hamas terrorist’,” she told Al Jazeera. The survey, conducted online, also found that many of the respondents also had firsthand experience with religious intolerance. “About 60 percent of the respondents affirmed that they suffered some kind of offence, either on social media or in their daily lives at work, at home or in public spaces,” Barbosa said. Women in particular, the study noted, reported slightly higher rates of religious intolerance. The question ofIslamophobiawas catapulted into the national spotlight this month when a video spread on social media appearing to show a resident of Mogi das Cruzes, a suburb of São Paulo, rushing towards a Muslim woman and grabbing at her headscarf. The video was even broadcast on news outlets like CNN Brasil. One of the women involved, Karen Gimenez Oubidi, who goes by Khadija, had married a Moroccan man and converted to Islam eight years ago. She told Al Jazeera that the altercation involved one of her neighbours: She was upset after their children had argued. “She came down with her brother and was very aggressive. She called me a ‘cloth-wrapped bitch’. I soon realised it was not only about the kids’ fight,” Gimenez Oubidi said. Neighbours attempted to separate the two women. One man in the video, however, grabbed Gimenez Oubidi from behind, wrapping an arm around her throat to hold her down. Gimenez Oubidi identified him to Al Jazeera as her neighbour’s brother. “He said a few times to me, ‘What are you doing now, terrorist?’ He didn’t say it loudly: It was just for me to hear. He knew what he was doing,” Gimenez Oubidi said. She added that the fight her son had had with the neighbour’s child was also over her hijab. The woman who attacked Oubidi, Fernanda — she said she did not want her full name revealed for fear of a public backlash — disputed this account. Fernanda said her son had been hit by Oubidi’s son in the playground, and while she had physically attacked Fernanda, she had not referenced her religion. “I never insulted her for her religion. That simply didn’t happen. I’d never do something like that,” she said. A government report from July noted that religious intolerance “occurs most intensely against those ofAfrican origin, but it also affects Indigenous, Roma, immigrant and converted individuals, including Muslims and Jews, as well as atheist, agnostic and non-religious people”. Brazil is predominantly Christian, home to an estimated 123 million Catholics — more than any other country in the world. But it has a long-standing, if smaller, Muslim population. Academics believe Islam arrived in the country with the transatlantic slave trade, as kidnapped African Muslims continued to practice their religion in their new surroundings. One group of enslaved Muslim Brazilians even launched a rebellion against the government in 1835, called the Malê uprising — a term derived from the Yoruba word for Muslim. Brazil’s Muslim population grew with waves of immigration in the late 19th and 20th centuries, particularly after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. Arab immigrants, particularly from Lebanon, Syria and Palestine, came to know Brazil as their home. The exact number of Muslims in Brazil today is unknown. The 2010 census counted 35,167 people identified as Muslim, but in the years since, other estimates have come out, setting the population as high as1.5 million. Some advocates, however, point to other demographic and political trends as setting the stage for tensions to rise between Muslim and non-Muslim groups. Evangelical Christiansmake up the fastest-growing religious segment in Brazil today, comprising about a third of the population. Their numbers have turned them into asignificant political force. Evangelical voters were credited with helping to elect far-right PresidentJair Bolsonaroin 2016, with polls showing 70 percentsupporting him. During his failed 2022 re-election bid, Bolsonaro repeatedly invoked Christian imagery in his appeals to voters, framing the race as a “fight of good against evil”. Mahmoud Ibrahim, who heads a mosque in Porto Alegre, believes that the us-versus-them mentality has translated into antagonism against his community. At recent protests against the war in Gaza, he said onlookers called him a “terrorist” and “child rapist”. “Evangelicals and Bolsonarists insult us all the time. They even chased a person who was going to our demonstration the other day,” he said. Ibrahim added that he had heard of at least one woman who was left bleeding after attackers attempted to tear her hijab off, causing the pins in the scarf to dig into her skin. Girrad Sammour heads the National Association of Muslim Jurists (ANAJI), a group that offers legal support in cases of Islamophobia. He said the number of reports to ANAJI has always been high, but since the start of the war on October 7, it has exploded. “There was a rise of 1,000 percent in the denunciations that we received,” he told Al Jazeera, crediting some to inflammatory remarks from far-right evangelical pastors. But Barbosa, the survey leader, believes there are ways to lessen the hatred and suspicion directed at Muslim Brazilians. She pointed to a lack of media representation as an example. “Few Palestinian leaders and experts in the Middle East with a pro-Palestine view have been invited by TV shows, for instance, to comment on the conflict in Gaza,” Barbosa said. But she also encouraged Muslim Brazilians to speak up about their experiences, in order to raise awareness. “What is not denounced doesn’t exist for the government,” she said. “Only if the authorities know what is happening will they be able to take adequate measures, like investing in education against religious intolerance.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/31/outraged-brazilian-muslims-face-growing-islamophobia-over-gaza-war
Head of Sudan’s paramilitary RSF visits Djibouti amid ceasefire efforts,Hemedti visits Djibouti as East African countries attempt to broker a ceasefire between the RSF and the Sudanese army.,"The head of Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has visited Djibouti, the nation at the forefront of regional initiatives to facilitate a ceasefire following over eight months of ongoing conflict. Djibouti is the latest stop onMohamed Hamdan Daglo‘s first trip abroad since fighting erupted between the RSF and the Sudanese army in mid-April. His regional tour, which has also taken him to Ethiopia and Uganda, came as diplomats scramble to broker a meeting between Dagalo, known as “Hemedti”, and his rival, Sudanese army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan. The warring generals have not met face to face since theoutbreak of the conflictthat has killed more than 12,000 people by some conservative estimates and forced millions to flee. Hemedti said on X that he discussed the latest developments in the war with Djibouti President Ismail Omar Guelleh.

Pro-Palestine campaigners call for Gaza ceasefire on New Year’s Eve,Activists are asking people to turn the New Year’s countdown in their countries into a countdown for a ceasefire in Gaza.,"Activists have launched a global campaign asking people to turn the New Year’s countdown in their countries into a countdown for a ceasefire in Gaza, which has been under devastating Israeli bombardment since October 7. “New Year’s Eve is a moment of celebration worldwide, and an opportunity to create resolutions for a brighter future. With nearly 30,000 civilians killed, including over 10,000 children, our only New Year’s resolution is to call for a permanent ceasefire,” Countdown2Ceasefire, a London-based grassroots campaign, said in a statement on Thursday. “Our aim is to morph the traditional New Year’s countdown into an influential and resounding countdown for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza.” So far the campaign has successfully been embraced by activists in over 30 countries, including Switzerland, Turkiye, Malaysia, Australia, Tanzania, Mexico and Germany, according to the organisers. While ringing in the new year, these local events calling for a ceasefire will be livestreamed across Countdown2ceasefire’s social media platforms. “A permanent ceasefire is the first step in ending the current deplorable situation and a tangible move towards a future where traumatised communities can rebuild and recover,” Bushra Mohammad, a campaign spokeswoman, said in a statement. Israel’s brutal military offensive in Gaza has killed more than 21,500 people and wounded more than 55,000 others triggering global outrage, with protesters across the world rallying to call for a ceasefire. Many have also expressed their disappointment towards politicians and countries who vetoed or abstained from voting for a ceasefire at the United Nations. Rights organisations including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and Doctors Without Borders also condemned countries vetoing a ceasefire, warning that this would result in a humanitarian disaster. On Saturday, the World Food Programme warned that it’s in a race against time to avert starvation for millions in Gaza. “Only a long-term ceasefire and unhindered humanitarian access can end this,” the UN agency posted on X. Israel has refused to stop the bombing that has destroyed more than 70 percent of Gaza homes and displaced more than 90 percent of the enclave’s 2.3 million people. Countdown2Ceasefire pointed out how people power can make a difference. “As we enter 2024, we look forward to it being the year that our New Year’s resolution, of a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, is fulfilled.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/31/pro-palestine-campaigners-call-for-gaza-ceasefire-on-new-years-eve
What’s the Philadelphi Corridor border zone that Israel wants to control?,Israeli control over the corridor between Gaza and Egypt – as its Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has sought — would mean the de facto full reoccupation of the Gaza Strip.,"Israel has said it wants to take control of the entirety of the border area between Gaza and Egypt as it signals that its brutal war on Gaza is nowhere near the end. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a weekly news conference on Saturday that the Philadelphi Corridor “must be in our hands” and shut down to ensure the security outcome Tel Aviv desires. Israel’s war on the besieged enclave has killed more than 21,000 Palestinians. With the fighting now in its 13th week, what is the significance of the corridor, why does Israel want control and what could be the implications? The Philadelphi Corridor, also known as the Philadelphi Route, is the 14km (8.7-mile) long strip of land that represents the entirety of the border area between Gaza and Egypt. It was established as a buffer zone controlled and patrolled by Israeli armed forces as part of the 1979 peace treaty with Egypt that ended Israel’s occupation of the Sinai Peninsula and reopened the Suez Canal. Its stated purpose was to stop weapons and material from reaching the hands of Palestinians inside the Gaza Strip, which Israel occupied, and to prevent people from moving between the Palestinian lands and Egypt without tough checks. “It must be shut. It is clear that any other arrangement would not ensure the demilitarisation that we seek,” Netanyahu said on Saturday, also signalling the war may last many more months. In 2005, Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip under international pressure and instead turned the densely populated Palestinian land intothe world’s largest open-air prison. Egypt became the main player in control of the corridor, which signifies the only link with the outside world not controlled by Israel – as Tel Aviv maintains a land, sea and air blockade of the strip from all other sides. An agreement after the Israeli disengagement from the area in 2005 allowed Egypt to deploy 750 soldiers and heavy arms to patrol and safeguard the Egyptian side of the corridor, with the responsibility of the other side handed over to the Palestinian Authority. But Hamas was infull controlof the Gaza Strip some two years after the Israeli withdrawal, and things changed. Over the years, Egypt said it kept destroying tunnels dug out by Palestinians to smuggle weapons and people, but Israel has questioned the effectiveness of Cairo’s moves. Now, Israel wants full control of the border area, which includes the crucialRafah crossing, supposedly to ensure its security. But that would amount to a de facto full reoccupation of the Gaza Strip, something Israel and the US have publicly disagreed over. Both Egypt and Hamas have been against Israel regaining control of the corridor, and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has repeatedly said Cairo won’t allow Palestinians to bedisplacedfrom their homeland into Egypt. Netanyahu wishes to reassure his domestic audience – which has grownangry and criticalof his handling of the war and his failure to bring back dozens of captives still in Gaza — according to Rami Khouri, a journalist and distinguished fellow at the American University of Beirut. At the same time, Khouri said, the Israeli PM wants to instil more fear among Palestinians and create fresh leverage for negotiations with the US and Egypt. “So, anything he says has multiple audiences, multiple purposes, and should not be taken at face value,” Khouri told Al Jazeera. “We have to take this as another element that he is throwing in the negotiating pot.” Khouri said Egypt would not agree to Israel retaking control of the corridor and establishing a military presence there decades after it left. He said Netanyahu’s comments can also be viewed within the context of Israel’s constant pursuit of territorial expansionism since its creation in 1948 — even though this has not brought the country security. “The more they expand, the more they control land, the more they try to be secure by taking over people’s lands and driving people out of their homes, the less secure they become because they just instigate greater and more intense forms of resistance by Palestinians and other people, including Hezbollah in Lebanon.” Yes, Israel brought up the idea of another “buffer zone” along its border with the northern part of Gaza with Arab leaders and the US last month as part of its “day after Hamas” plans. Tel Aviv reportedly wants to raise this corridor inside Gaza in order to make sure it won’t suffer another attack like the one on October 7 by Hamas that killed about 1,140 people inside Israel. Earlier this month, White House National Security Council Spokesman John Kirby said Washington opposes “any reduction of the geographic limits of Gaza”. The US has also said it wants the Palestinian Authority to take over security of the Strip, contradicting Israel’s aspirationsfor establishing a direct presence there.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/31/whats-the-philadelphi-corridor-border-zone-that-israel-wants-to-control
"US army attacks three Houthi boats in Red Sea, killing at least 10 fighters",Global shipping giant Maersk suspends operations in the Red Sea for 48 hours after the attack.,"Yemen’s Houthi rebels say they have lost at least 10 fighters after three of their vessels were attacked by US forces in the Red Sea. In a statement on Sunday, the Houthi group said the boats were performing tasks aimed at “establishing security and stability and protecting maritime navigation”. In addition, they said the boats were “performing their humanitarian and moral duty… to prevent Israeli ships or those heading to the ports of occupied Palestine from passing through the Red Sea”. The US military stated earlier on Sunday that it sunk three boats waging an attack on a container ship in the Red Sea as it continued its patrol mission to counter threats from the Houthi rebels.    Helicopters from two US warships – the USS Eisenhower and USS Gravely – shot at the “Iranian-backed Houthi small boats” in self-defence on Sunday morning while responding to an SOS call from the Singapore-flagged vessel Maersk Hangzhou, the US Central Command (CENTCOM) said. The US helicopters sunk three of the boats, killing several of their crew, it said. A fourth boat escaped. Maersk Hangzhou issued its distress call after it was fired at by the Houthi boats, which came as close as 20m (65 feet) and also tried to board it, CENTCOM said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter. As the US helicopters responded, they were also shot at by the Houthi boats, prompting them to return fire, added the CENTCOM statement. Iranian-backed Houthi small boats attack merchant vessel and U.S. Navy helicopters in Southern Red Sea On Dec. 31 at 6:30am (Sanaa time) the container ship MAERSK HANGZHOU issued a second distress call in less than 24 hours reporting being under attack by four Iranian-backed…pic.twitter.com/pj8NAzjbVF — U.S. Central Command (@CENTCOM)December 31, 2023  It was the second alleged Houthi attack on the Maersk Hangzhou in less than 24 hours. Late on Saturday night, CENTCOM said it shot down two ballistic missiles fired by the Houthis as it responded to a separate missile strike on Maersk Hangzhou. In the wake of the attacks, global shipping giant Maersk, which owns the vessel, said it was suspending its operations in the Red Sea for 48 hours, highlighting the continued threat to commercial vessels in the region. Amid Israel’s war on Gaza, Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthis have repeatedly targeted vessels they believe are linked to Israel travelling in the Red Sea, pushing major global shipping companies, such as Maersk, to abandon the waterway. The Houthis havesaid they will continuetheir strikes until Israel’s attacks on Gaza stop. The US on December 19 announced a global naval task force to safeguard shipping in the contentious waters, through which some 12 percent of global trade passes. However, out of the 20 countries the US says have agreed to support the coalition, only the United Kingdom has directly contributed warships, leaving Washington to effectively “act alone” against the Houthis, reports Al Jazeera’s Resul Serdar from Djibouti on the edge of the Red Sea. “There is very little naval presence here,” said Serdar.  And while the presence of the US-led coalition at first seemed to restore some confidence in the route, Houthi attacks on passing vessels have not stopped. Increasingly, the group is using anti-ship ballistic missiles to target vessels, US Vice Admiral Brad Cooper told The Associated Press news agency, adding that the US is “clear-eyed that the Houthi reckless attacks will likely continue”.    Al Jazeera’s Serdar said it was clear that the US naval forces have “not been able to deter the Houthis” so far, with the group waging attacks even more frequently. He said the latest clash marked a serious escalation because the US not only sunk Houthi boats but killed Houthi fighters. Such confrontations are sparking “huge panic” among Yemenis who fear the conflict could spill into their territory, he said. “That could cause another war that would damage the region,” said Serdar. The unrest in the Red Sea comes as anger grows throughout the Middle East over the devastation in Gaza, where at least 21,822 Palestinians, including 8,800 children,have been killedby Israel military attacks in under three months. The war began when Hamas carried out a shock cross-border attack on Israeli territory on October 7 that killed about 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to Israel. The US, which has provided staunch military and diplomatic backing to Israel throughout the conflict, has seen its assets targeted as well,facingmore than 100 attacks from Iran-backed groups in Syria and Iraq since the outbreak of the war. Amid concerns that Yemen’s Houthis could next target crucial submarine communications cables running under the Bab al-Mandeb Strait that power internet networks, Yemen’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it is committed to protecting these networks. “Yemen’s decision to prevent the passage of Israeli enemy ships does not concern ships belonging to international companies licensed by Maritime Affairs – Sanaa to execute marine cable works,” the ministry said. However, it added that ships “executing submarine cable works” should “obtain the necessary permits and approvals”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/31/us-forces-sink-houthi-boats-in-red-sea-after-attack-on-maersk-vessel
Israel detains Palestinians in renewed West Bank incursions,At least four Palestinians detained and 17 others injured from Israeli drone strikes on Nur Shams refugee camp in Tulkarem.,"Israeli forces have arrested at least four Palestinians and wounded 17 others after conducting nightlong raids in the occupied West Bank cities during which they fired drones, according to Al Jazeera’s Nida Ibrahim. Two overnight drone attacks on the Nur Shams refugee camp in Tulkarem caused the injuries, said Ibrahim, reporting from Ramallah, citing medical sources. During the raids, Israeli forces also blocked the entrance to two hospitals in the area, delaying many of the wounded from receiving treatment. It was the fourth time Israeli forces had stormed the area in less than a week, said Ibrahim, as they pursued a small group of armed men they regularly clash with during such incursions.    In Tulkarem, Israeli military vehicles fired “live rounds and flares” over the camp, while stationing snipers on the top of local buildings, reported the Palestinian Wafa news agency. Israeli forces raided several other Palestinian towns overnight, including near Jericho, Hebron, and occupied East Jerusalem, in operations that are becoming a near-nightly occurrence. On Friday, Israel arrested at least 14 Palestinians from West Bank towns. During the incursions, Israeli forces arrested at least four Palestinians, according to Ibrahim, adding to more than 4,800 they have taken from the West Bank and East Jerusalem since the Gaza war broke out on October 7. Israel regularly holds Palestinians in jail without charge under a system of administrative detention that rights groupssayis a tool to “persecute Palestinians”. Ibrahim said Palestinians view the raids as a reminder of “who has the upper hand — who has the control” over their lives. Since October 7, Israeli military raids and settler attacks have killed over 300 Palestinians, including 79 children, prompting the United Nations last week tourge foran end to the “unlawful killings”. More than 500 people have been killed in the occupied territory this year, according to​ the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, making it “the deadliest year on record” for Palestinians.

Israeli bombardment destroyed over 70% of Gaza homes: Report,Experts say the besieged strip is unrecognisable and its bombing is the most destructive in modern history.,"Israel’s relentless bombardment of Gaza for nearly three months has destroyed 70 percent of the homes in the besieged Palestinian enclave, according to the Government Media Office. No further details were provided but an earlier report said more than 200 heritage and archaeological sites were destroyed in the Israeli bombardment considered the most destructive in modern history. About 300,000 out of 439,000 homes have been destroyed in Israeli attacks, a Wall Street Journalreportsaid. Analysing satellite imagery, the report added that the 29,000 bombs dropped on the strip have targeted residential areas, Byzantine churches, hospitals and shopping malls and all civilian infrastructure has been damaged to an extent that they cannot be repaired. “The word ‘Gaza’ is going to go down in history along with Dresden [Germany] and other famous cities that have been bombed,” Robert Pape, a political scientist at the University of Chicago who has written about the history of aerial bombing, told WSJ. In nearly two months, the offensive has wreaked more destruction than the razing of Syria’s Aleppo between 2012 and 2016, Ukraine’s Mariupol, or, proportionally, the Allied bombing of Germany in World War II. It has killed more civilians than the United States-led coalition did in its three-year campaign against the ISIL (ISIS) group. Between 1942 and 1945, the Allies attacked 51 major German cities and towns, destroying about 40-50 percent of their urban areas, Pape told The Associated Press news agency. “Gaza is one of the most intense civilian punishment campaigns in history,” said Pape. “It now sits comfortably in the top quartile of the most devastating bombing campaigns ever.” Corey Scher of the CUNY Graduate Center and Jamon Van Den Hoek of Oregon State University told the AP, “Gaza is now a different colour from space. It’s a different texture.” The Israeli military campaign in Gaza, experts say, also now sits among the deadliest in recent history, killing more than 21,500 people and wounding 55,000. More than 1,000 children had their limbs amputated in the Israeli attacks since October 7.    The Israeli army claims it has been targeting Hamas fighters, who carried out a deadly attack inside Israel on October 7. Some 1,200 people were killed in that attack which triggered the current phase of the conflict. Hamas says its attack was in response to continued Israeli blockade of Gaza and expansion of settlement in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. Palestinians see the Israeli settlements – which are considered illegal under international law – to be the biggest hurdle in the realisation of their future state. The level of destruction is so high because “Hamas is very entrenched within the civilian population”, Efraim Inbar, head of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security, a think tank, told the AP. But experts have criticised Israel for bombing Gaza – which is one of the most densely populated areas in the world housing 2.3 million people on 365sq km (141sq miles) of land. Media reports and rights groups say an overwhelming majority of those killed are civilians – more than 70 percent of them children, women and elderly. More than 90 percent of the enclave’s population is now displaced, with aid groups warning of hunger and outbreaks of disease. Delivery of aid has been restricted by Israel worsening the crisis.    Meanwhile, the Israeli military has said little about what kinds of bombs and artillery it is using in Gaza. From blast fragments found on-site and analyses of strike footage, experts are confident that the vast majority of bombs dropped on the besieged enclave are US-made. They say the weapons include 2,000-pound (900kg) “bunker-busters” that have killed hundreds in densely populated areas. US news network CNN reported on December 14 that about half of all the Israeli munitions dropped on Gaza were imprecise “dumb” bombs, which pose a greater threat to civilians. Earlier this week, an Israeli military official admitted that the high death toll from a Christmas Eve attack on a refugee camp in central Gaza was the result of the use of improper munitions, highlighting military tactics that have created high numbers of civilian casualties. The Israeli news outlet +972 also previously reported that the Israeli military has loosened its standards regarding acceptable civilian harm from attacks, resulting in a higher portion of civilians killed than in previous rounds of military assaults. Human Rights Watch has accused Israel of using banned white phosphorous. Israel has denied the claims. The Israeli army has reiterated that every strike is cleared by legal advisers to make sure it complies with international law. “We choose the right munition for each target – so it doesn’t cause unnecessary damage,” said the army’s chief spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/31/israeli-bombardment-destroyed-over-70-of-gaza-homes-media-office
Netanyahu says Gaza-Egypt border zone should be under Israeli control,The Israeli prime minister also predicts the war in Gaza and on other regional fronts would last many months.,"The border zone between the Gaza Strip and Egypt should be under Israel’s control, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said, as he predicted thewar in the Palestinian enclaveand on other regional fronts would last many months. As Israel entered the 13th week of its war in Gaza on Saturday, Netanyahu held a news conference where he renewed his promise to eliminate Hamas and bring home all Israelis held captive in Gaza. “The Philadelphi Corridor – or to put it more correctly, the southern stoppage point [of Gaza] – must be in our hands. It must be shut. It is clear that any other arrangement would not ensure the demilitarisation that we seek,” he said.    Israel has said it intends to destroy Hamas in Gaza and demilitarise the territory to prevent any repeat of the October 7 cross-border killing and kidnapping spree by the armed group. “The war is at its height. We are fighting on all of the fronts. Achieving victory will require time. As the [Israeli army] chief of staff has said, the war will continue for many more months,” Netanyahu said. He also added a rare threat to attack Iran directly over the near-daily exchanges of fire across the Israel-Lebanon border. “If [the Iran-backed Lebanese armed group] Hezbollah expands the warfare, it will suffer blows that it has not dreamed of – and so too Iran,” Netanyahu said without elaborating.    The war has triggered fears of a regional conflagration amid rising tensions with other Iranian-aligned groups in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen. Israel’s relentless bombing and ground offensive on Gaza since October 7 has killed at least 21,672 people, most of themwomen and children, with thousands of others buried under the rubble. The military operation has alsodisplacedalmost the entire 2.3 million population of the besieged territory. About 1,140 people were killed by Hamas in Israel in the October 7 attacks.

Israeli air raids target Syrian city of Aleppo as regional tensions rise,Syrian defence ministry says the ‘aerial aggression’ came from the Mediterranean and hit a number of places.,"Israel has targeted Iranian military positions in Syria’s Aleppo with an air raid, causing some material damage, according to the Syrian Ministry of Defence. “Israel carried out an aerial aggression from the direction of the Mediterranean Sea, west of Latakia, targeting a number of points south of the city of Aleppo,” the statement said on Saturday. The Syrian state media, citing a military source, said “the Israeli enemy carried out an air attack… targeting a number of points south of the city of Aleppo” at about 5:20pm (14:20 GMT) on Saturday. Pro-government radio station Sham FM said the attacks were near Aleppo’s airport, but did not damage it. “It seems these attacks in Aleppo were conducted from the sea,” Al Jazeera’s Ali Hashem reported from Naqoura in southern Lebanon. “Warplanes were situated over the Mediterranean when they launched the missiles towards several targets in the city of Aleppo.” During more than a decade of war in Syria, Israel has launched hundreds of air raids on its territory, primarily targeting Iran-backed forces including Lebanese Hezbollah fighters, as well as Syrian army positions. But Israel intensified its attacks since its military operation in Gaza began on October 7, causing tensions across the Middle East. Hashem said the Aleppo attack was “not unprecedented”. “On several occasions, there were attacks on Aleppo, on Damascus, and yesterday [Friday] there was an attack on Albu Kamal, an area on the border between Syria and Iraq,” he said. “It seems this is part of a pattern, because the group that was linked to Albu Kamal was linked to the Iranian IRGC commander who was killed in Damascus just days ago,” he added. On Monday, an Israeli air raid outside the Syrian capital Damascuskilled a senior adviserin Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Sayyed Razi Mousavi was responsible for coordinating the military alliance between Syria and Iran.    The attack on Aleppo came after another Israeli air raid on a border town in southern Lebanon earlier on Saturday. The attack followed Iran-backed group Hezbollah claiming responsibility for three attacks on Israeli military bases on the border, Al Jazeera’s Hashem reported. “There were several Israeli air raids mainly on the town of Bint Jbeil … According to reports, there are no casualties,” he said. “Another town closer to the border of Israel was also hit by an Israeli attack in a residential area. This raises the risk of civilian casualties on a daily basis,” he said. Israel and Hezbollah, along with a handful of smaller armed groups that operate in southern Lebanon, have settled into a steady rhythm oftit-for-tat exchangessince the Gaza assault began. At least 21,672 Palestinians, most of them women and children, have been killed in Gaza in nearly three months of Israeli operation, which has also displaced nearly the strip’s entire 2.3 million population. The attacks in Syria and Lebanon also come amid fears that Israel’s war in Gaza could expand into a wider regional conflict.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/30/israeli-air-raids-target-syrian-city-of-aleppo-as-regional-tensions-rise
Turkey Super Cup final in Saudi Arabia called off amid Ataturk T-shirt row,Istanbul rival teams Galatasaray and Fenerbahce were scheduled to play in Riyadh on Friday.,"The Turkish Super Cup final between Galatasaray and Fenerbahce scheduled to be played in Saudi Arabia’s capital Riyadh was called off over an apparent disagreement about the players’ jerseys. The Turkish Football Federation (TFF) and the two teams – who returned to Istanbul on Saturday after Friday’s postponed match – said the decision was made because of “some problems” in the event’s organisation. Haberturk television and other Turkish media said players from both Istanbul football teams wanted to wear T-shirts that featured an image of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the revered founder of the modern Turkish republic, during a prematch warm-up, but were not authorised to do so by Saudi organisers. Turkish media also reported that Saudi authorities did not allow banners featuring political slogans and Ataturk T-shirts to be displayed ahead of the match, including those with Ataturk’s “peace at home, peace in the world” slogan. The clubs refused to play in the final at the King Saud University venue, which is also known as Al-Awwal Park stadium. The organisers said that the cancellation was the result of the teams not adhering to match regulations.

The organisers also said that it had been agreed that Turkey’s national anthem would be played in the stadium and its national flag displayed in the stands. There has been no announcement yet on where or when the final will be held. A joint statement by the TFF and the clubs posted on X said: “The 2023 Super Cup … has been postponed to a later date as a result of a joint decision we made with our clubs, due to some problems in its organisation.” It also expressed “gratitude to the football federation of the host country and the relevant institutions for their efforts in organising” the event.

Biden administration bypasses Congress on weapons sales to Israel,"For the second time in a month, the US approves munitions for Israel while calling for an end to mass civilian deaths.","The administration of United States President Joe Biden has once again bypassed Congress to greenlight an emergency weapons sale to Israel, which has only intensified and broadened its attacks on the Gaza Strip despite growing international outrage. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Congress that he had made a second emergency determination in less than a month, covering a $147.5m sale of equipment to Israel, the State Department said on Friday. “Given the urgency of Israel’s defensive needs, the secretary notified Congress that he had exercised his delegated authority to determine an emergency existed necessitating the immediate approval of the transfer,” it said. “The United States is committed to the security of Israel, and it is vital to US national interests to ensure Israel is able to defend itself against the threats it faces.” The package includes ancillary items, including fuses, charges and primers that Israel would require to make the 155mm shells that it had previously purchased, function. Friday’s emergency determination, which is rare but has been used by at least four previous US administrations, means that a requirement for a potentially lengthy congressional review for foreign military sales will be bypassed. Reporting from Washington, DC, Al Jazeera’s Patty Culhane said it was important to point out the broader context of the messaging. “We’ve been hearing from all the top Biden administration officials for weeks that it is time for Israel to move to a lower-intensity conflict. In essence, stop the mass bombing. Stop the mass deaths of civilians,” she said. “So, in that context – knowing that is what they say they want – they are now selling to Israel the exaction munitions they need to continue a high-intensity campaign.” Israel will also be purchasing 155mm M107 projectiles, which are artillery shells that will cause widespread destruction in a densely populated area such as Gaza, Culhane reported. “They didn’t say exactly how many [shells] were going to be in this $147.5m package. But, in previous packages, it really does mean that thousands and thousands of bombs will be going to Israel.” Ensuring Israel gets weapons to continue its intense phase of the war, while also urging it to lower the intensity of fighting, is “strategically self-defeating” for Washington, according to Al Jazeera’s senior political analyst Marwan Bishara, who called Friday’s decision “astounding”. “One really has to look deep to see if there is any meaningful explanation for why the Biden administration wants to bypass Congress in order to expedite weapons to a country that is involved in war crimes,” he said on Saturday. The move was “morally scandalous” given that the war has caused record damage and killed tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians, Bishara said, but it is also “politically suspect in the sense that why would you want to bypass Congress twice in the same month? What is the urgency to bypass your own guidelines?” On December 9, the Biden administrationmade another emergency determinationto approve the sale to Israel of nearly 14,000 rounds of tank ammunition worth more than $106m. Basem Naim, a senior Hamas official, criticised the US’s role in the war, saying: “While these crimes have been committed with Israeli hands, they were sponsored and backed up by the US administration.” In a televised statement on Saturday, he added that the group holds the Biden administration “accountable for their direct role in sponsoring and orchestrating this ongoing genocide against our people”. The move to expedite more weapons comes as Biden’s request for an enormous $106bn package that includes aid for Ukraine, Israel and other perceived national security needs has yet to pass Congress, as it is entangled in a debate over US immigration and border security policies. The Biden administration has tried to counter criticism over the mounting death toll in Gaza and continued US arms sales to Israel by saying it constantly maintains contact with Israel to stress the importance of minimising civilian casualties. However, Luciana Zaccara, an associate professor in Gulf politics at Qatar University, told Al Jazeera it was pursuing a “dual-track” approach when it comes to the war. “On the one hand they are trying to convince the public opinion that the US is really concerned about civilian casualties but also they keep sustaining Israel (militarily),” he said. “It is totally contradicting … it is hard to understand how this is in the national interest.” The policy was especially perplexing in light of “mounting pressure” in the US, including among Democrats, against the war as civilian casualties in Gaza continue to rise, Zaccara said. The Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday that the war “is generating destruction comparable in scale to the most devastating warfare in the modern record”. By mid-December, Israel had dropped 29,000 bombs, munitions and shells on Gaza, destroying or damaging nearly 70 percent of homes, the report said. Some Democratic lawmakers have suggested further significant aid to Israel should be contingent on concrete promises by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to curb civilian casualties in Gaza. More than 21,000 Palestinians have now been killed in the besieged enclave since October 7, most of them children and women, in what has been widely described as collective punishment. Thousands more are missing. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), said on Saturday that Israeli authorities continue toimpose “severe restrictions” on humanitarian accessdespite deliveries of aid from Egypt and through the Rafah crossing. He also said they are “creating a stream of baseless misinformation” to accuse aid agencies over gaps in deliveries. Meanwhile, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned again that theconflict could spread to the wider regionif not halted immediately.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/30/biden-administration-bypasses-congress-on-weapon-sales-to-israel
"Israel-Hamas war: List of key events, day 85","South Africa files case of genocide against Israel, as attacks on Gaza, occupied West Bank and southern Lebanon continue – here is the latest.","Here’s how things stand on Saturday,December 30, 2023:   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/30/israel-hamas-war-list-of-key-events-day-85
South Africa files case at ICJ accusing Israel of ‘genocidal acts’ in Gaza,"Israel, which has been accused of meting out collective punishment on Palestinians, has rejected the case at the UN court.","South Africa has filed a case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), accusing it of crimes of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza after nearly three months of relentless Israeli bombardment has killed more than 21,500 people and caused widespread destruction in the besieged enclave. In an application to the court on Friday, South Africa described Israel’s actions in Gaza as “genocidal in character because they are intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group”. “The acts in question include killing Palestinians in Gaza, causing them serious bodily and mental harm, and inflicting on them conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction,” the application said. The ICJ, also called the World Court, is a UN civil court that adjudicates disputes between countries. It is distinct from the International Criminal Court (ICC), which prosecutes individuals for war crimes. As members of the UN, both South Africa and Israel are bound by the court. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has compared Israel’s policies in Gaza and the occupied West Bank with his country’s past apartheid regime of racial segregation imposed by the white-minority rule that ended in 1994. Several human rights organisations have said that Israeli policies towards Palestinians amount to apartheid. PRESS RELEASE:#SouthAfricainstitutes proceedings against#Israeland asks the#ICJto indicate provisional measureshttps://t.co/WedDXvtBD4pic.twitter.com/VCCDyORrLy — CIJ_ICJ (@CIJ_ICJ)December 29, 2023  South Africa said Israel’s conduct, particularly since the war began on October 7, violates the UN’s Genocide Convention, and called for an expedited hearing. The application also requests the court to indicate provisional measures to “protect against further, severe and irreparable harm to the rights of the Palestinian people” under the Convention. “South Africa is gravely concerned with the plight of civilians caught in the present Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip due to the indiscriminate use of force and forcible removal of inhabitants,” a statement from South Africa’s Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO) said, adding that the country has “repeatedly stated that it condemns all violence and attacks against all civilians, including Israelis.”    “South Africa has continuously called for an immediate and permanent ceasefire and the resumption of talks that will end the violence arising from the continued belligerent occupation of Palestine,” the statement added. Israel has rejected global calls for a ceasefire saying the war would not stop until the Hamas group, whose October 7 attack triggered the current phase of the conflict, was destroyed. Some 1,200 people were killed in the Hamas attack in Israel. The Palestinian group has said its attack was against Israel’s 16-year-old blockade of Gaza and expansion of settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories. Settlement expansions pose the biggest hurdle in the realisation of a future Palestinian state comprising Gaza, occupied West Banka and East Jerusalem. In the latest development in Israel’s war on Gaza, tens of thousands of newly displaced Palestinians in the centre of the Palestinian enclave on Friday were forced to flee further south as Israel expanded its ground and air offensive in the centre of the enclave. Israel has faced global condemnation for the mounting toll and destruction and is accused of meting out collective punishment on the Palestinian people. The court application is the latest move by South Africa, a vociferous critic of Israel’s war, to ratchet up pressure after its lawmakers last month voted in favour of closing down the Israeli embassy in Pretoria and suspending all diplomatic relations until a ceasefire was agreed. Al Jazeera’s Gabriel Elizondo, reporting from the United Nations headquarters in New York, said the move was “clearly a very important step to try to hold some accountability to Israel.” “Now that South Africa is pushing this to the ICJ, it will be on [the UN’s] agenda to try to make a ruling on this very important question,” he added. On November 16, a group of 36 UN experts called on the international community to “prevent genocide against the Palestinian people”, calling Israel’s actions since October 7 a “genocide in the making”. “We are deeply disturbed by the failure of governments to heed our call and to achieve an immediate ceasefire. We are also profoundly concerned about the support of certain governments for Israel’s strategy of warfare against the besieged population of Gaza, and the failure of the international system to mobilise to prevent genocide,” the experts said in a statement. Israel has rejected South Africa’s move as “baseless”, calling it “blood libel.” “South Africa’s claim lacks both a factual and a legal basis, and constitutes despicable and contemptuous exploitation of the Court,” Israel’s minister of foreign affairs, Lior Haiat, said in a statement posted on X. “Israel has made it clear that the residents of the Gaza Strip are not the enemy, and is making every effort to limit harm to the non-involved and to allow humanitarian aid to enter the Gaza Strip,” the statement added. “It does rally public opinion to the reality of what’s going on in Palestine, not just in Gaza but also in the West Bank,” said Al Jazeera’s senior political analyst Marwan Bishara. According to Article 2 of the Genocide Convention, genocide involves acts committed with the “intent to destroy, either in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group.” “Where the disagreement lies is whether there is intent or no intent,” Bishara said. “The three leading Israeli officials have declared the intent, starting with Israeli President Herzog when he said there are ‘no innocents’ in Gaza, the defence minister who said Israel will impose collective punishment on the people of Gaza because they are ‘human animals’,” Bishara said, adding that prime minister Netanyahu also used a biblical analogy in a statement widely interpreted as a genocidal call. The Palestinian ministry of foreign affairs welcomed South Africa’s move, and called on the ICJ to take immediate action to “prevent further harm to the Palestinian people”. “Israel’s stated policy, acts and omissions are genocidal in character are  committed with the requisite specific intent to the destruction of the Palestinian people under its colonial occupation and apartheid regime in violation of its obligations under the Genocide Convention,” a statement by the ministry said. “The State of Palestine appeals to the international community and the Contracting Parties to the Convention to uphold their obligations and support the Court in the proceedings.”   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/29/south-africa-files-case-at-icj-accusing-israel-of-genocidal-acts-in-gaza
Tens of thousands forced to flee again as Israel expands Gaza offensive,Israel has escalated its unprecedented air and ground offensive in central Gaza forcing displaced Palestinians to flee again towards south.,"Tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians in Gaza have been forced to flee again towards the south after Israel intensified assaults in the centre of the besieged enclave killing more than 180 people in the past 24 hours. The Israeli army on Friday said in a post on X that it was “expanding the operation in the Khan Younis area” of Gaza, previously sheltering hundreds of thousands of people displaced from the north – initially the focus of Israel’s ground assault. Israeli shelling near El Amal hospital in Khan Younis killed 41 people over the past two days, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said on Thursday, adding that the casualties in repeated Israeli attacks near the facility include “displaced persons seeking shelter”. The UN humanitarian office said an estimated 100,000 more displaced people had arrived in the already-teeming southern border city of Rafah in recent days following the intensification of fighting around both Deir el-Balah in central Gaza and Khan Younis to its south. Earlier this week, Israeli forces ordered Palestinians out of the crowded central districts of Bureij, Maghazi and Nuseirat, as tanks advanced from the north and east. Attacks on those areas have intensified in recent days, with many residents fleeing to the already-crowded Deir el-Balah, pitching makeshift tents made from sheets of plastic on whatever open ground they could find. “We suffered a lot. We had the whole night without shelter, under rain and it was cold, we were with our kids and elderly women,” Um Hamdi, a woman cooking porridge over an open woodfire, surrounded by children, told the news agency Reuters. Nearby, grey-bearded Abdel Nasser Awadallah stood inside a wooden frame set up to be wrapped in plastic to make a tent, and spoke of the family he had lost. “I buried my children, a child 16-year-old, another one aged 18. Something I really can’t believe, I buried my children at 6:00am while their bodies were still warm. Also my nephew was two years old, I buried him, I buried my wife,” he said. Addressing the UN Security Council on Friday, the Palestinian UN envoy Majed Bamya said the widescale destruction of Gaza by Israeli operations has made it clear their sole goal is forced displacement. “They want to make sure that Palestinians in Gaza have no homes to return to,” he said. “They want to make sure they have no life to return.” “They want to make sure that life in Gaza is no longer possible, with one aim, what they call ‘voluntary migration’ … the codename for forced displacement. These are the options for Palestinians: Destruction or displacement, death or displacement,” he said. On Christmas Eve, the Maghazi refugee camp witnessedone of the deadliest attackssince Israel launched its military offensive on October 7. While the official number of those who were killed stands at 90, residents of the camp near Deir el-Balahtold Al Jazeerathat in reality, the figure is much higher as entire residential blocks were wiped out. Israel issued arare apologyon Thursday for killing civilians in the massive air raid that triggered one of the biggest exoduses of the war so far, saying the munitions used were not appropriate for a packed refugee camp and that the high death toll “could have been avoided”. The UN says more than 90 percent of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have been displaced, and many are now fleeing for the third or fourth time. Many now live in cramped shelters in the 365sq km (141sq miles) of land or in makeshift tents around the southern city of Rafah, on the border with Egypt – which has also not been immune from Israeli attacks. Rafah was hit by new air raids on Friday as Egypt prepared to host a high-level Hamas delegation for talks to try and end the nearly 12-week war that has devastated the besieged Palestinian territory. Reuters journalists at the scene of one air raid that obliterated a building in Rafah saw the head of a buried toddler sticking out of the rubble. The child screamed as a rescue worker shielded his head with a hand, while another swung a sledgehammer at a chisel, trying to break up a slab of concrete to free him. Neighbour Sanad Abu Tabet said the two-storey house had been crowded with displaced people. After morning broke, relatives came to collect the dead wrapped up in white shrouds. Israel’s relentless aerial bombardment and ground invasion in Gaza have killed at least 21,507 people, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s health ministry. Egypt has taken more of a leading role in pushing for a ceasefire, including introducing a plan to end the fighting. It includes captive and prisoner exchanges between Israel and Hamas. Egypt’s State Information Services chief Dia Rashwan said the plan was “intended to bring together the views of all parties concerned, with the aim of ending the shedding of Palestinian blood”. Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan said on Thursday that the group will not release more Israeli captives without a “complete and full ceasing of aggressive activities against our people through negotiations that are aligned with our people’s interest”. #Gaza– Israeli soldiers fired at an aid convoy as it returned from Northern Gaza along a route designated by the Israeli Army – our international convoy leader and his team were not injured but one vehicle sustained damage – aid workers should never be a target.@UNRWA — Thomas White (@TomWhiteGaza)December 29, 2023  The director of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees in Gaza (UNRWA), Thomas White, said on Friday that a UN aid convoy had come under fire by the Israeli military on Thursday. While there were no casualties, White condemned the attack on humanitarian workers. “Essentially, we are delivering aid under fire,” White told Al Jazeera, explaining that the incident took place as a convoy was returning from northern Gaza along a route designated by the Israeli Army. “They took that route, they encountered some tanks, and those tanks used heavy machine guns to fire at the vehicles,” White said, adding that while there was some damage to one of the vehicles, UNRWA staff was not injured. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UNRWA, on Friday slammed Israeli forces for firing at the aid convoy.In a post on X, Lazzarini said “shooting” and “other attacks” on aid workers and convoys obstruct “lifesaving” operations in the Strip. A “total siege” imposed by Israel since the war began on October 7, and following years of crippling blockade, has deprived Palestinians in Gaza of food, water, fuel and medicine. Thesevere shortageshave been only sporadically eased by humanitarian aid convoys entering primarily via Egypt. International bodies say supplies being let in through Israeli inspections are a small fraction of the enclave’s vast needs. Last week Israel bowed to international pressure to open a second crossing it said would double the number of supply trucks daily to 200, but just 76 were able to enter on Thursday, according to the United Nations, compared with 500 before the war. Last week, a UN-backed reportwarnedthat the entire 2.3 million population of Gaza is facing crisis levels of hunger, with 576,600 people at catastrophic – or starvation – levels. UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths described on social media what he called “an impossible situation for the people of Gaza, and for those trying to help them”. “You think getting aid into Gaza is easy? Think again,” he wrote Friday on X.   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/29/tens-of-thousands-forced-to-flee-again-as-israel-expands-gaza-offensive
Pressure on Netanyahu amid row over Israel’s plan for ‘day after’ Gaza war,"As Israeli military pounds Gaza and conducts raids in occupied West Bank, Hamas says no deal on captives until ‘aggression’ stops.","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces growing pressure from his right-wing coalition government amid sharp disagreements over the currentIsraeli-Palestinian conflict, which is nearing its 90th day with no end in sight to the war or a deal for a pause in hostilities. Netanyahu cancelled a meeting of Israel’s war cabinet on Thursday night that was meant to discuss the plan for the“day after”the war after fierce opposition to the meeting from far-right members of the coalition. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir of the ultranationalist Jewish Power party said the subject was outside of the war cabinet’s mandate. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich’s Religious Zionist party announced it was holding its own meeting in protest over his exclusion from the discussion. Ben-Gvir and Smotrich are in the larger security cabinet but are not part of the war cabinet, whose main members are Netanyahu, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant and opposition leader Benny Gantz. “[Smotrich] didn’t want that discussion [on the day after] to take place,” Al Jazeera’s Alan Fisher, reporting from occupied East Jerusalem, said on Friday. “He is very much against the Palestinian Authority [PA] having any rule in Gaza post the war.” Under such pressure, Netanyahu decided the war cabinet would not discuss the issue, which will now be taken up by the security cabinet on Tuesday. The United States has suggested thePA should rule over Gazaafter Israel achieves its stated goal ofeliminating Hamas, whose October 7 assault on southern Israel triggered the war. “Netanyahu cancelled the war cabinet, worried it would fracture his coalition, fracture his government and put his position as prime minister at risk,” Fisher said. The war cabinet was also meant to “discuss a deal with Hamas – negotiated by the Americans, the Qataris and the Egyptians – about exchanging captives for Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails”, our correspondent added. Ahmed Helal, the Middle East and North Africa director at Global Counsel, told Al Jazeera the cancellation of the war cabinet meeting had been a “long time coming” as the military establishment and political elite have grown further apart. “The military elite has grown increasingly uncomfortable over the past 10 years, and they’re not pacifists by any means – they are not doves. But they understand what is strategically important for Israel, and they have been pushing against the overly militarist ambitions of the civilian government,” Helal said. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is scheduled to make another trip to the Middle East next week to discuss the Gaza war, in which the Israeli military has killed more than 21,000 people in Gaza alone. The revised death toll from Hamas’s attack on Israel stands at 1,139. The top US diplomat is likely to face regional Arab allies increasingly pushing for a ceasefire, Natali Tocci, director of the Italian think tank Istituto Affari Internazionali, told Al Jazeera. “At the moment, we don’t see the US actually putting pressure on Israel for a ceasefire,” Tocci said. “However, as that Egyptian role is actually increasing … in calling for a ceasefire, Blinken will basically find himself in between a rock and a hard place.” Egypt, which borders the Gaza Strip, has taken more of a leading role in pushing for a ceasefire, including introducing aplan to end the fighting. It includes captive and prisoner exchanges between Israel and Hamas. Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan said on Thursday that the group will not release more Israeli captives without a “complete and full ceasing of aggressive activities against our people through negotiations that are aligned with our people’s interest”. A Hamas delegation is to visit Cairo on Friday to consider the Egyptian plan to end the war, the Agence France-Presse news agency reported, citing a Hamas official.

Turkey arrests dozens of ISIL suspects in raids across country,The arrests were made across 37 provinces amid drive by Turkey’s security forces ahead of New Year celebrations.,"Turkey has announced it has arrested 189 people suspected of having ties to the ISIL (ISIS) armed group as the government continues to detain people across the country. Turkey’s interior minister, Ali Yerlikaya, said on social media platform X on Saturday that the suspects were arrested as part of “Operation Heroes-38”, which took place simultaneously in 37 provinces. The detentions come amid a drive by Turkey’s security forces ahead of New Year festivities, although some also view it as part of a political push ahead of local elections duein March. Analysts say that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is keen to win back control of Istanbul, Ankara and other major economic hubs that his AK Party has lost. Yerlikaya had said on Friday that the detentions had thwarted planned attacks on churches and synagogues in Istanbul. 3️⃣7️⃣ İlde DEAŞ Terör Örgütüne yönelik eş zamanlı olarak düzenlenen “KAHRAMANLAR-38” Operasyonlarında 1️⃣8️⃣9️⃣ şahıs yakalandı❗ Aziz Milletimizin Bilmesini isterim ki;Ülkemizin huzuru, birlik ve beraberliği için teröristlerin hiçbirine göz açtırmayacağız.

Beyond Maghazi: What controversial weapons has Israel used in Gaza war?,"From dumb bombs and bunker busters to white phosphorus, the register of allegations against Israel is growing.","An Israeli official on Thursday acknowledged that the country’s military had used inappropriate munitions during anattack on the Maghazi refugee campthat killed at least 90 people earlier this week. The official said that Israel’s military would investigate what happened. But while little is known about the specific munitions used in Maghazi, this is far from the first time that Israel’s army has faced criticism over the alleged or confirmed use of controversial weapons in its war on Gaza. Israel has said its goal is to “completely eliminate” Hamas, which attacked southern Israel on October 7, but the reality on the ground has been the elimination of generations of Palestinians and their entire neighbourhoods. Israel’s war has killed more than 21,300 Palestinians, including at least 8,200 children, in Gaza. Another 7,000 people are missing, presumably buried under the rubble of the 313,000-plus homes that have collapsed from Israeli warfare. Al Jazeera looks at some of the weapons that have been used in Israel’s “indiscriminate” bombardment of the Gaza Strip: The term ‘dumb bombs’ refers to munitions that are not guided, but are free to fall and destroy wherever they land. Earlier this month, CNN reported thatnearly halfof the Israeli munitions used on Gaza have been “dumb bombs”, citing research by the United States Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Somewhere between 40-45 percent of the munitions Israel has dropped on Gaza have been unguided, but these munitions are less accurate and carry a greater risk of inflicting civilian casualties. Marc Garlasco, a former war crimes investigator for the United Nations,calledthe US intelligence assessment “shocking”. “The revelation [that] almost half of all bombs dropped on Gaza by Israel are unguided dumb bombs completely undercuts their claim of minimising civilian harm,” Garlasco wrote on social media. Other reports have said Israel has regularly usedpowerful bombsin the densely populated Strip, despite the increased risk of civilian casualties. Generously provided to Israel for its war on Gaza by its friend the United States,BLU-109 bombsare designed to penetrate hardened structures before exploding. The bombs can carry a warhead weighing more than 900kg (1984 pounds) and have previously been used by the US in conflicts including the war in Afghanistan. “Many people are now questioning in Congress whether continuing to give these “bunker bombs”is a good idea and also calling for more transparency,” Al Jazeera’s Heidi Zhou-Castro said. This level of weaponry has been used by the US before, but mainly in open areas. To do so in a densely populated area can only lead to one thing – high casualties. US arms to Israel since the start of the war have also included 15,000 bombs and 57,000 (155mm) artillery shells. And there’s more: 5,000 unguided MK-82 bombs, more than 5,400 MK-84 bombs, and about 1,000 GBU-39 small-diameter bombs. There are also about 3,000 Joint Direct Attack Munitions or JDAMs – a guidance kit that uses GPS to turn unguided bombs into precision-guided munitions, effectively making the dumb bombs “smart”. However, their effectiveness depends on the quality of intelligence received. “If the intelligence is faulty, even the most accurate weapon will hit the wrong target,” Elijah Magnier, a military analyst covering conflicts in the Middle East, told Al Jazeera. AnAmnesty Internationalinvestigationreleasedearlier this month found that the Israeli military used US-made JDAMs to bomb two homes in Gaza in October, killing 43 members of two families. In other cases, weapon functionality is also crucial, as technical malfunctions can cause smart bombs to miss their targets, and human error during the targeting process can lead to the misidentification of marks. “In various conflicts, there have been reports of secondary strikes occurring shortly after an initial strike, hitting rescue workers and civilians rushing to help the wounded, significantly increasing civilian casualties,” Magnier said. Earlier in the war Israel used smart bombs in Gaza as part of a broader military strategy “aimed at accurately targeting militant infrastructure to achieve military objectives” Magnier said, but “with no attempt to limit civilian casualties and infrastructure damage”. “The effectiveness of these weapons in achieving strategic objectives without causing disproportionate harm is impossible”, Magnier added. “The principle of distinction, a cornerstone of [international humanitarian] law, requires the invading Israeli army to always distinguish between combatants and military targets on the one hand, and civilians and civilian objects on the other and to target only the former.” Use of the colourless chemical weapon is restricted under international humanitarian law, with conditions that it must never be fired at, or in close proximity to, a populated civilian area or civilian infrastructure. However, evidence of its use by Israel in the war on Gaza wasreportedby Human Rights Watch (HRW) early in the conflict. Highly combustible, it can cause fires and smoke to spread quickly. “Airbursting white phosphorus spreads the substance over a wide area, depending on the altitude of the burst, and it exposes more civilians and infrastructures than a localised ground burst,” Ahmed Benchemsi, communications director for HRW’s Middle East and North Africa Division, told Al Jazeera. Last month a doctor from al-Shifa Hospital told theToronto Starhe had seen patients with deep wounds, with “third and fourth-degree burns, and the skin tissue is impregnated with black particles and most of the skin thickness and all the layers underneath are burned down to the bone”. Dr Ahmed Mokhallalati said these weren’t phosphorus burns, “but a combination of some kind of incendiary bomb wave and other components”, feeding into claims that Israel also uses war totest unknown weapons. But what makes white phosphorous even more dangerous,said Nada Majdalani, the Ramallah-based Palestine director for EcoPeace Middle East, is the presence of rain in the air. “As Gaza enters the rainy season, we expect the rain to fall as acid rain, contaminated with white phosphorus,” Majdalani said. People who use plastic sheets to collect rainwater to drink directly, amid a shortage of drinking water, could be particularly at risk, she said. This month, HRW said in a statement that Israel was deliberately depriving Palestinians of access to food, water and other basic necessities. Under international humanitarian law, creating a situation of hunger with intent against a civilian population isa war crime. Omar Shakir, Israel and Palestine director at HRW, said: “Israel has been depriving Gaza’s population of food and water, a policy spurred on or endorsed by high-ranking Israeli officials and reflecting an intent to starve civilians as a method of warfare. “World leaders should be speaking out against this abhorrent war crime, which has devastating effects on Gaza’s population,” he added. Just a month after the war began, all of northern Gaza’s bakeries closed due to a lack of supplies such as flour and fuel, the UN reported on November 8. By early February, if the war continues, Gaza could be facing a famine, according to a report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a body that measures hunger risks.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/29/beyond-maghazi-what-controversial-weapons-have-israel-used-in-gaza-war
‘No way to leave’: Sudan paramilitary traps civilians in breadbasket state,"After capturing Gezira state two weeks ago, the Rapid Support Forces have prevented civilians from fleeing.","When Sudan’s second largest city, Wad Madani, fell to the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on December 18, Afnan Hind and her family fled to a nearby town to stay with relatives. But the paramilitary group came there too and prevented residents from leaving. Hind and her family were trapped by a group that kills civilians, rapes women and girls, and loots citizens of their wealth. Days later, she said, RSF fighters stormed their apartment to steal a car parked outside. “My uncle just gave them the keys without resistance. He feared for [the girls in the house],” Hind, 21, told Al Jazeera. “There was immense terror of what the RSF were going to ask for.” According to civilians, UN agencies and local monitors, the RSF is obstructing people from leaving towns and cities in Gezira state, whose capital is Wad Madani. Gezira is the breadbasket for the rest of Sudan and was a haven for hundreds of thousands of displaced people who relocated from the war-torn capital, Khartoum, earlier in the war, which began in April. About300,000people fled – many for a second time – to regions under army control when the the paramilitary attacked Gezira, but many are now denied passage through RSF checkpoints. Those stuck in Gezira said the RSF has committed a myriad of human rights abuses, including subjecting women and girls to sexual violence and killing people for refusing to leave their homes. However, many people don’t have a way to escape, even if the RSF lets them. “The RSF came to our village and looted all the markets and all the cars,” Hind said. “We are left with no food and no way to leave.” ‘No way out’ Four days after the RSF entered Gezira, Mohamad Ahmed* and his family were looking to flee. They wanted to go south to nearby Sennar state, yet the road was too dangerous due to clashes between the army and the RSF. Ahmed said his family decided to walk to a nearby coast where they found a boat to take them to safety. “The boat basically takes 60 people and it works with paddles. It’s a really old boat,” Ahmed told Al Jazeera. “We are really blessed because we were so exhausted and it seemed that there was no way out for sure.” Others haven’t been so lucky, according to Alain Ouattera, the deputy head of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Sudan. He told Al Jazeera that people still in Gezira face a worseningcholeraoutbreak and the RSF’s attacks may have spoiled a harvest required to feed people across Sudan. He added that the armyimpedesaid shipments to RSF-controlled areas, compounding the challenges of delivering life-saving supplies to civilians stuck in Gezira. “For us to get aid to [civilians in Gezira], we have to cross all these regions under [the Sudanese army’s control]. But to get the travel permit required to take aid from one state to the other takes ages,” Ouattera said. “It’s not only risky to get supplies [to civilians], but it’s also so challenging because of all the impediments.” Humanitarian corridors Relief agencies, civil society groups and the UN are calling for the RSF to establish safe corridors out of Gezira. “The idea is to have a sort of humanitarian corridor not only for us to access people but also for people to safely leave active conflict zones,” Ouattera said. The Sudanese journalist syndicate also recentlycalledon all international bodies to “facilitate safe passage for hundreds of thousands of women, children and elderly civilians stranded in hazardous regions”. But Yousif Ezat, the RSF’s spokesperson, told Al Jazeera that fighters are not preventing people from fleeing or looting cars. He claimed the RSF was cracking down on highjackers by confiscating cars and trucks from drivers unable to prove they own their vehicle. “To my knowledge, all roads are open out of Gezira state,” he said. The UN envoy for Sudan, Clementine Nkweta-Salami, echoed calls for warring parties to establish safe corridors. “Parties to the conflict must allow civilians safe passage. People fleeing conflict – especially women, children and those with special needs – must be able to do so safely,” shetweetedon Thursday. Trying to govern? The RSF is trying to trap civilians in Gezira to prove that they can govern, according to Kholood Khair, a Sudanese expert and the founding director of the think tank Confluence Advisory. She told Al Jazeera that the RSF wants to give the impression that “everything is fine” even though most people fear for their lives under its rule. “It’s clear the RSF is trying to set up some kind of governance model, but we are also hearing real-life accounts … of people feeling desperation, anxiety and stress. These reports counter any narrative that the RSF and their supporters are putting out about their ability to make people feel safe,” Khair said. Women in particular risk being subjected to sexual violence. Just last month, local monitorsreportedthat the RSF shot and killed one woman for resisting rape. She was three months pregnant. Yara Kau*, 21, said her family forced her to flee from Wad Madani. They had already tried to drive out of the city together, but they were turned back at RSF checkpoints, she said. On Tuesday, Kau, her younger sister and two male relatives escaped on foot. They walked 40km (25 miles) towards a small town on the outskirts of Gezira. Along the way, two RSF fighters stopped and robbed them. They also threatened to hurt them, but they let them ago after seeing Kau’s sister break down into tears and clasp her Quran. Hours later, they reached a family friend who gave them his car, so they could drive for the last stretch of their journey. Kau is now in Sudan’s eastern city of Kasala, but she misses her parents, who are still in Wad Madani. “I was never scared of the RSF shooting me dead. Getting raped was the only thing urging me to flee from these maniacs,” Kau told Al Jazeera. “My whole family urged us to leave because we are girls.” * Some names have been changed to protect people from reprisals.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/29/after-sudans-violent-paramilitary-captured-gezira-state-on-december-18-the-group-has-set-up-checkpoints-around-the-city-and-prevented-civilians-from-fleeing

Iran says it executes four people accused of links to Israel’s Mossad,Three men and one woman accused of being ‘saboteurs’ were hanged for their ‘collaboration with the Zionist regime’.,"Iran has executed three men and one woman who were convicted for their alleged links to Israel’s Mossad spy agency, according to media affiliated with the judiciary. “Four members of a sabotage group related to the Zionist regime … were hanged this morning” in Iran’s northwestern province of West Azerbaijan, the judiciary’s Mizan news agency reported on Friday. Mizan identified those executed as three men – Vafa Hanareh, Aram Omari and Rahman Parhazo – and one woman, Nasim Namazi, who were sentenced to death on charges of “moharebeh”, an Islamic legal term meaning “waging war against God”, and “corruption on Earth” through their “collaboration with the Zionist regime”, referring to Israel. The group “committed extensive actions against the country’s security under the guidance of the Mossad”, Mizan reported. The four were charged with kidnapping Iranian security forces to extract intelligence and were also accused of setting fire to the cars and apartments of some agents. Several others working with the same group were each sentenced to 10 years in jail, Mizan said, without providing additional details. Iranian intelligence put the group under surveillance for at least four months, starting in January 2022 until their arrest that May, when they were “transferred from a neighbouring country” to Iran, according to the state-run news agency IRNA. Iran does not recognise Israel and the two countries have engaged in a shadow war for years. On December 16, a man convicted of working for Mossad was executed in the southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchistan. The Islamic republic hanged four people in December 2022 who had been convicted of collaborating with Israel’s intelligence services. Iran accuses Israel of carrying out a wave of attacks and assassinations targeting its nuclear programme. In August, Iran accused Israel of being behind “one of the largest sabotage plots” targeting its defence industry and missile production. According to rights groups, including Amnesty International, Iran executes more people per year than any other nation except China. In May, United Nations human rights chief Volker Turk said Iran had an“abominable” track recordof executions in 2023 with an average of more than 10 people hanged each week. More than 600 people have been executed by Iran so far this year, already the highest figure in eight years, said the Norway-based Iran Human Rights group in a November report. In 2015, Iran carried out 972 death sentences, according to the UN. Iran has issued death sentences and executed people detained during last year’s anti-government protests, which were triggered in September afterthe death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old who was arrested by “morality police” in Tehran for allegedly not adhering to a mandatory dress code for women.

UN deplores aid barriers as Israel’s Gaza onslaught steps up,"Dire humanitarian crisis worsens, as at least 30 people reported killed in air strikes on refugee camps in central Gaza.","The United Nations has warned that it is becoming increasingly difficult to get desperately needed aid into Gaza. The UN’s humanitarian aid chief on Friday called out the “impossible situation” facing people in Gaza and those trying to help them, as the humanitarian situation on the ground worsens and dozens more civilians are reported killed in Israeli attacks. “You think getting aid into Gaza is easy? Think again,”Martin Griffithssaid in a post on the social media platform X, expressing frustration at how life-saving assistance is being hampered from entering the war-torn Strip. Griffiths listed 14 obstructions to getting humanitarian relief into the enclave, including: constant bombardments and aid convoys coming under fire; three layers of inspections before an aid truck can enter the Palestinian territory; a constant list of rejected items; and aid workers themselves being killed and displaced by the war. “This is an impossible situation … The fighting must stop,” he said. You think getting aid into Gaza is easy? Think again.pic.twitter.com/CH4GuY6XUb — Martin Griffiths (@UNReliefChief)December 29, 2023  Illustrating his point, Israeli soldiers fired on an aid convoy on Friday as it returned from northern Gaza along a route designated by the Israeli army, according to Thomas White, the director of the UH agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, in Gaza. “Our international convoy leader and his team were not injured but one vehicle sustained damage – aid workers should never be a target,” White said in a post on X. The persistent difficulty in getting humanitarian relief into Gaza comes despite the United Nations Security Council passing aresolutionlast week to boost aid. Israel’s war has killed more than 21,300 Palestinians and displaced 85 percent of the population since October 7. Amid the bombardments, a military blockade on the enclave and the restrictions on aid shipments are imperilling the health of hundreds of thousands of people. Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Rafah in southern Gaza, describes displaced and famished people from the central and northern parts of the Strip forced to queue for hours for food assistance. “Five refugee families were staying with us, but now we’re refugees just like them,” a man sheltering at a school in Rafah told Al Jazeera, without giving his name. “I don’t know what to do. We are peaceful civilians and have no connection to what’s happening. We have children, and we can’t find milk, food or water. We can’t even find a plastic sheet.” Mahmoud reported: “Most of the population of Gaza has been displaced multiple times in the past three months, fleeing with whatever they can carry …UN facilities are packed full, several times beyond their maximum capacity.” Aid groups say the situation is desperate, and UN agencies have warned that 40 percent of Gaza’s populationis facing an imminent risk of famine. “Doctors Without Borders [Medecins Sans Frontieres, or MSF] warns that an epidemic is inevitable, and with most hospitals and clinics out of service, when people do fall ill they will have nowhere to go,” Mahmoud said. In central Gaza, Israeli forces continue to push people south as they target sites that include refugee camps, amid which Tel Aviv insists Hamas fighters are hiding. About 35 people were reported killed in air strikes on Nuseirat and Maghazi refugee camps on Friday. “The Israeli army seems to be stepping up its aerial bombardment,” Mahmoud said. “There is a sense of frustration as this is happening days after theresolutionwas passed by the UN Security Council. People are now seeing more bombs, less food and less humanitarian aid.” The UN says 150,000 people are being forced to leave central Gaza after the Israeli army issued evacuation orders, telling people to once again move further south. Meanwhile, on Friday morning in southern Gaza, 20 seriously ill patients in Gaza are expected to be allowed to leave for medical treatment in Egypt, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said on the social media platform Telegram. Among the patients listed is a one-month-old girl who is suffering from a head injury. Medical officials from Gaza have made repeated pleas that patients with serious medical conditions be allowed to leave for life-saving treatment outside the besieged territory.

Dozens of people killed as Israel carries out strikes across Gaza,"Israeli forces attack cities, towns and refugee camps, killing up to 80 people and forcing thousands more to flee.","At least 20 Palestinians have been killed, including women and children, when an Israeli strike hit a residential building near Kuwait Specialty Hospital in Rafah as the besieged Gaza Strip reeled from a barrage of attacks throughout the day that killed dozens. “The air strike has completely flattened the residential building that is full of displaced people,” Al Jazeera correspondent Tareq Abu Azzoum said, reporting on the aftermath of the Israeli strike on Thursday near Kuwaiti hospital. “Until now, rescue operations by the ambulances and civil defence teams continue to pull the people from under the rubble.” Palestinian authorities said on Thursday that at least 50 people had been killed as Israel bombards every corner of Gaza, where more than 21,320 Palestinians have been killed and nearly 90 percent of the population displaced. Israel has stepped up attacks across the length and breadth of Gaza, targeting Beit Lahiya, Khan Younis, Rafah and Maghazi on Thursday despite global outrage and calls for a ceasefire amid the mounting death toll.    Palestinians in the besieged enclave said they havenowhere safeto flee. Ashraf al-Qudra, spokesman for Gaza’s Ministry of Health, said on Thursday that more than 200 people had been killed in 24 hours withentire familieswiped out. More than 55,000 Palestinians have been wounded since Israel launched a military offensive in the wake of Hamas attacks on October 7 in southern Israel, which killed nearly 1,200 people – the country’s deadliest attack since its founding in 1948. Israel’s assault on Gaza has become one of the most destructive in modern history, enacting an enormous humanitarian toll and drawing accusations of a campaign ofcollective punishmentagainst Palestinian civilians. An Israeli official on Thursday blamed the high death toll in the Christmas Eve attack on the Maghazi refugee campon improper munitions. More than 70 people were killed in the attack, which caused a global outrage. Nearly three months into the fighting, Hamas fighters continue to put up stiff resistance against Israeli forces, including in northern Gaza, where continuous Israeli strikes have left the area unrecognisable. An Israeli siege has also severely restrictedaccess to food, fuel, water and electricity, and UN officials have said an estimated 25 percent of people in Gaza are starving. “It’s already hard enough as it is, finding your daily meal, finding drinkable water, with this amount of people gathered in one city,” Gaza resident Mohammed Thabet told Abu Azzoum after the strike inRafah. “Being this close to the Egyptian border in the far south of the Gaza Strip, people feel like they have nothing else they can do, like you just have to wait and hope for the best.”    Asked if he felt safe in southern Gaza, Thabet said, “After everything we saw, not at all. There is nowhere safe in Gaza.” The United States has played anindispensable rolein Israel’s war, providing it withweapons packagesand strong diplomatic support as Israel comes under growing pressure to bring the fighting to an end.

"End ‘unlawful killings’ in occupied West Bank, UN tells Israel",Latest UN report warns the situation in the territory is rapidly deteriorating and calls for accountability.,"The United Nations has called on Israel to end “unlawful killings” and settler violence in the occupied West Bank, warning of a rapidly deteriorating human rights situation during intensified Israeli raids. In a report published on Thursday, the UN Human Rights Office detailed a “sharp increase” in air strikes and military incursions into densely populated refugee camps, resulting in deaths, injuries and widespread damage to civilian infrastructure in the occupied territory. “The use of military tactics means and weapons in law enforcement contexts, the use ofunnecessary or disproportionate force, and the enforcement of broad, arbitrary and discriminatory movement restrictions that affect Palestinians are extremely troubling,” UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said in a statement.    Violence across the West Bank and occupied East Jerusalemhas flaredsince Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip began on October 7. More than 21,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed, most of them civilians, after about 1,200 people were killed in Hamas attacks in southern Israel. Since then, the UN has verified the deaths of at least 300 Palestinians in the West Bank, including 79 children, the report said. Of these, 291 were killed by Israeli forces, eight by settlers and one was killed by either soldiers or settlers. Nearly 4,800 Palestinians have been arrested since the war on Gaza began. Since October 7, the UN has documented a “sharp rise in settler attacks”, including “shootings, burning of homes and vehicles, and uprooting of trees”. “I call on Israel to take immediate, clear and effective steps to put an end to settler violence against the Palestinian population, to investigate all incidents of violence by settlers and Israeli Security Forces, to ensure effective protection of Palestinian communities against any form of forcible transfer,” Turk said.    “The dehumanisation of Palestinians that characterises many of the settlers’ actions is very disturbing and must cease immediately,” his statement added. Ajith Sunghay, the head of the UN Human Rights Office in the occupied Palestinian territories, told Al Jazeera that a lack of accountability – and in some cases incitement from Israeli officials – has led to a spike in both settler violence and violence committed by Israeli forces in the West Bank. “I think that’s extremely important to underscore – where there is impunity violations will continue to happen,” Sunghay said. “These statements [from Israeli officials] embolden settlers, give them a sense of security. It gives them a certain kind of permission to do what they want to do,” he added. #UNreport: Türk warns of rapidly deteriorating human rights situation in the West Bank, calls for end to violence. Read the report here 👉https://t.co/BGZChZobZg#OPT#WestBank#Jerusalem#ENDViolencehttps://t.co/Zk5NQ5zdEO — UN Human Rights OPT (@OHCHR_Palestine)December 28, 2023  The report was released as Israeli forces beganone of the largest incursionsin the West Bank since the war started, launching a coordinated overnight assault on 10 cities, including Ramallah, the administrative headquarters of the Palestinian Authority. The raids, which continued until early on Thursday, targeted Palestinian money exchange outlets. A Palestinian man was also killed by Israeli forces on Thursday near a checkpoint west of the city of Bethlehem. Mustafa Barghouti, the general secretary of the Palestinian National Initiative party, believes the growing raids in the West Bank are an attempt by Israel to reoccupy the territory “completely”. “They are marginalising the Palestinian Authority, depriving it of all its authorities,” Barghouti told Al Jazeera. “There is no security control by the Palestinian Authority because the Israeli army invades all cities, all [of] Area A that was supposed to be under the Palestinian Authority,” he said. “This is a clear message from [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu. He’s saying there’s no place any more for any independent Palestinian authority here. He’s reoccupying the West Bank as he is trying to reoccupy Gaza.” Barghouti added that despite the Israeli claims that its raids are to fight against “terrorism”, the real goal is to “provoke an intifada [uprising]”. “Netanyahu knows very well if he leaves his position as prime minister, he will go to jail,” he said, referring to the corruption charges the Israeli leader is now on trial for. “This man wants to extend the war in Gaza, to expand it, to continue it as long as possible.” Also on Thursday, UNICEF said 2023 has been the deadliest year for children in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem with 124 Palestinian and six Israeli children killed there since the start of the year. “At least 83 children have been killed in the past 12 weeks – more than double the number of children killed in all of 2022, amid increased military and law enforcement operations,” Adele Khodr, UNICEF’s regional director for the Middle East and North Africa said in a statement. “More than 576 have been injured, and others have reportedly been detained.”   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/28/end-unlawful-killings-in-occupied-west-bank-un-tells-israel-2
Israel says improper munitions cause of high death toll in Maghazi attack,The admission by an Israeli official to Kan public broadcaster comes as Israel has been accused of using ‘dirty’ bombs on Gaza.,"An Israeli military official has said that the high death toll from an attack onMaghazi refugee campin central Gaza was the result of the use of improper munitions, showing a spotlight on Israel’s military tactics that have created high numbers of civilian casualties. Speaking to the Israeli public broadcaster Kan, a military official on Thursday said that the raid on Maghazi, which killed at least 70 people, used munitions that were not appropriate for a packed refugee camp. “The type of munition did not match the nature of the attack, causing extensive collateral damage which could have been avoided,” the official told the Israeli Kan public broadcaster. “The [Israeli army] regrets the harm to those who were uninvolved and is working to learn lessons from the incident,” the official added.    The statement on the bombing, which the Israeli military had previously said was being investigated, comes amid reports that Israel has regularly usedpowerful bombsin the tightly packed strip, despite the increased risk of civilian casualties. Earlier this month, the US news outlet CNN reported thatnearly halfof the Israeli munitions used on Gaza have been unguided “dumb bombs”, citing a US intelligence assessment. Such munitions are less accurate and carry a greater risk of inflicting civilian casualties.

Palestinian authorities say that more than21,000 peoplehave been killed in Israel’s assault on Gaza, more than half of them women and children. The current round of fighting was preceded by months of rising tensions, but began on October 7 when the Palestinian armed group Hamas launched an attack on southern Israel that authorities there said killed more than 1,100 people and took more than 240 peoplecaptive.    The attack on Maghazi is not the first to raise questions about theindiscriminate natureof Israel’s bombardment, which has transformed entire neighbourhoods in Gaza into mountains of rubble. On Thursday, nearly 100 people have been killed in attacks on various locations across Gaza. Palestinian authorities said that at least 90 peoplewere killedin Israeli attacks on a residential block in the Jabalia refugee camp earlier this month, and in early December, Israeli attacks killed 700 Palestinians in asingle day. Palestinians in the besieged enclave say they have nowhere safe to flee from Israel’s relentless bombardment, which has alsotargeted areasthat Israeli authorities had told civilians to move towards to avoid fighting.

UN agency says 40 percent of Gaza’s population ‘at risk of famine’,UNRWA warned the besieged enclave is ‘grappling with catastrophic hunger’ as Israel continues to bomb from north to the south.,"The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees has warned that not enough aid is entering besieged Gaza, leaving 40 percent of its population “at risk offamine” amid Israeli curbs on entry of much-needed aid trucks to enter the enclave. The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) on Thursday renewed its warning that the besieged enclave is “grappling with catastrophic hunger”, as it reiterated calls for a “humanitarian ceasefire” as non-stop Israeli bombs rained from the north to the southern part of the enclave. “Every day is a struggle for survival, finding food and finding water,” Thomas White, director of UNRWA affairs in Gaza was quoted as saying on X, formerly known as Twitter. “The reality is, we need more aid. The only remaining hope is a humanitarian ceasefire,” the agency said on X. A “total siege” imposed by Israel since the war began on October 7, and following years of crippling blockade, has deprived Palestinians in Gaza of food, water, fuel and medicine. The severe shortages have only been sporadically eased by humanitarian aid convoys entering primarily via Egypt. Last week, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution on more aid for Gaza after days of delays, but aid groups and rights advocates described theresolution as “woefully insufficient” and “nearly meaningless”. The latest stark warning by the UN agency on the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in Gaza came as Israeli troops on Thursdaycontinued to heavily bombard the territory, with the centre of fierce combat with Hamas fighters steadily moving south – where hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians are sheltering. Air and artillery attacks and house-to-house fighting have become heaviest in the southern city of Khan Younis. Ashraf al-Qudra, spokesman for the Health Ministry in Gaza, reported more than 200 deaths “including entire families” over the past 24 hours in attacks across the territory. More than 80 percent’s of Gaza’s 2.4 million people have been driven from their homes, the UN says, and many now live in cramped shelters or makeshift tents in the far south, in and around the city of Rafah near the Egyptian border. ""Every day is a struggle for survival, finding food and finding water""@TomWhiteGaza 📍#Gazais grappling with catastrophic hunger. 40% of the population are now at risk of famine. The reality is, we need more aid. The only remaining hope is a humanitarian#ceasefirehttps://t.co/8a5a4AjBt3 — UNRWA (@UNRWA)December 28, 2023  Earlier, UN World Health Organisation (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called for “urgent steps to alleviate the grave peril” facing Gaza’s people, including “terrible injuries, acute hunger and … severe risk of disease”. Last week, a UN-backed reportwarnedthat the entire 2.3 million population of Gaza is facing crisis levels of hunger, with 576,600 people at catastrophic – or starvation – levels. According to the report, published by 23 UN and non-governmental agencies, the proportion of households in Gaza affected by high levels of acute food insecurity is the largest ever recorded globally, eclipsing even the near-famines in Afghanistan and Yemen of recent years. Israel’s relentless aerial bombardment and ground invasion have killed at least 21,320 people, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s health ministry. Eylon Levy, the Israeli government spokesperson, has accused the UN of a failure to provide aid to civilians in Gaza. He claimed that Hamas hijacks aid and that the “UNRWA covers up for it”, and blamed the UN’s logistics for the closure of the Israeli-controlled Karem Abu Salem border crossing (called Kerem Shalom in Israel) this week. Israel has not provided any proof for its allegations against the UN agency. Earlier this week, Israel said it would not renew the visa of a UN staff member in the country and will also deny the visa request of another UN employee as the global body has criticised Israel’s targeting of civilians and hospitals during the Gaza war. An overwhelming majority of the more than 21,000 Palestinians killed are civilians. Israeli officials have brushed off international calls for a ceasefire – saying it would amount to a victory for Hamas. The United States – while providing crucial support for the offensive – has urged Israel to take greater measures to spare civilians and allow in more aid. But humanitarian workers say the amount of food, fuel and medical supplies entering is still far below what is needed.

Leader of Sudan’s RSF visits Ethiopia in rare foreign trip as war rages,The trip by the paramilitary group’s leader comes a week after his forces captured the North African nation’s second largest city.,"The leader of Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, has visited neighbouring Ethiopia, where he has had discussions on the end of the war between the RSF and Sudan’s army. Dagalo, known as “Hemedti”, landed in Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa, on Thursday in the second stop of his first known public foreign trip since the war erupted on April 15. The trip comes weeks after RSF fighters captured the country’s second-largest city, Wad Madani, once a hub for hundreds of thousands of people displaced by the eight-month war. Thursday’s meeting was preceded by Hemedti’s meeting with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni at Museveni’s country home on Wednesday. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said he had received the RSF leader and his delegation “for a discussion on securing peace and stability in Sudan”, posting pictures of them seated around a restaurant table. Hemedti was received by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Demeke Mekonnen at the airport in Addis Ababa.    Hemedti posted pictures of his arrival and a meeting with Demeke on X. “We discussed the need to bring a swift end to this war, the historical crisis in Sudan and how to best alleviate the hardships of the Sudanese people,” Hemedti wrote. US- and Saudi-brokered talks have failed to end the conflict, which has killed more than 12,000 people and forced more than seven million people toflee their homes. Last month, Human Rights Watch accused the RSF of carrying out mass ethnic killings in Darfur. Posts by Hemedti and Ethiopia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs showed him exiting an aircraft belonging to Royal Jet, a United Arab Emirates airline, that flight records show had flown from Abu Dhabi to Uganda’s Entebbe airport on Wednesday morning. The UAE has been Hemedti’s most important foreign ally since before thecurrent conflict. In November, a Sudanese general accused the UAE of backing the RSF and funnelling supplies through countries that included Uganda. The UAE responded by saying it supported diplomatic dialogue in Sudan and the conflict’s end while Uganda said the accusations were false.    Hemedti is next expected to visit Kenya, a source close to the RSF told the Agence France-Presse news agency. Al Jazeera could not confirm the planned stop through official sources. “After having visited Uganda and Ethiopia, Hemedti will go to Nairobi in order to try to rally the member states of IGAD to his cause before going to Djibouti to meet General al-Burhan,” the source was quoted as saying, referring to Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, theleader of Sudan’s armed forces. IGAD,the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, is a bloc representing eight East African countries. It has been trying to bring al-Burhan and Hemedti together since the outset of the war. Both sides in Sudan’s war have been accused of war crimes.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/28/leader-of-sudans-rsf-visits-ethiopia-in-rare-foreign-trip-as-war-rages
Israel embassy pulls ‘inappropriate’ video imagining Hamas attack on Seoul,South Korea objected to footage posted by Israeli embassy depicting hypothetical abduction of a mother in Seoul.,"The Israeli embassy in South Korea has deleted a video it produced showing an imaginary attack on Seoul by masked assailants it seemed to liken to Hamas, after concerns raised by the South Korean government. The video, which was posted on the Israeli embassy’s social media channels on Tuesday, was deleted on Wednesday, South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency reported. The Ministry Of Foreign Affairs confirmed to the AFP news agency on Thursday that it asked the Israeli embassy to take it down. “The killing and kidnapping of Israeli civilians by Hamas cannot be justified, but the Israeli Embassy’s production and distribution of a video drawing parallels to the security situation in another country was deemed inappropriate,” South Korea’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement. “We have conveyed our position to the Israeli Embassy in South Korea, and the Israeli side has taken measures to delete the video in question.” Sanad, Al Jazeera’s fact-checking agency, verified the existence of the video, which has since been pulled down. Describing the clip, Yonhap said the footage showed a South Korean woman in the capital on Christmas Day watching her daughter sing carols at a school talent show when her mobile phone issues an air raid warning. Sounds of gunfire and explosions are heard through the city. The woman – covered in blood – is then abducted by an armed assailant, and forcibly separated from her daughter, it described. The footage is accompanied by details of Hamas’s attack on southern Israel on October 7 and subtitles that read: “Imagine if it happened to you. What would you do?” Israel has repeatedly vowed to keep up its campaign to destroy the Palestinian armed group in retaliation for the attack, which killed 1,139 people, according to a revised tally by Israeli authorities. Hamas also kidnapped about 240 people, and Israel says 129 captives are still being held in Gaza. Israel has since relentlessly bombarded the besieged Gaza Strip, killing more than 21,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children and destroying thousands of buildings including hospitals and schools, creating a dire humanitarian crisis. The Israeli embassy said its video was to help South Koreans understand how Israelis feel. “We have reconstructed the horrifying terrorist incident that took place on October 7th to help South Koreans in East Asia, far away from Israel, understand the current war situation,” Israel’s ambassador in Seoul Akiva Tor said in a now-deleted social media post, South Korean broadcaster YTN reported.

"‘Unparalleled’: Israeli army raids Ramallah, more occupied West Bank cities",Israeli forces also ‘seize $2.5m’ from money exchange shops in largest operations in area since October.,"Israeli forces have launched their most intense raids yet on cities in the occupied West Bank as they pressed on with one of the largest incursions in the territory since Israel’s war on Gaza began in October. At least one person was killed after Israeli troops launched a coordinated overnight assault on 10 cities including Hebron, Halhul, Nablus, Jenin, Tulkarem, el-Bireh, Jericho and notably the centre of Ramallah, which is the administrative headquarters of the Palestinian Authority. The raids, which continued until early on Thursday morning, targeted Palestinian money exchange outlets. “This was a raid like we haven’t seen in the centre of Ramallah, like no other. Since October 7 we haven’t seen a raid of this size,” Al Jazeera’s Imran Khan said, reporting from near the scene on Thursday. He said the “unparalleled” raid began at 1am on Thursday (23:00 GMT Wednesday) and lasted for about four hours, with “at least 20 vehicles” entering Ramallah. Israeli forces used tear gas and stun grenades to clear a street and then blocked off the area, before using a “controlled explosion” toentera money exchange shop, Khan added. The Palestine Monetary Authority said Israeli forces raided the headquarters of six exchange companies under its control across the occupied West Bank at dawn. “The Israelis arrested a number of the owners of these companies and seized sums of money from their safes, after blowing them up,” it said in a statement, adding that it considers the attack “an act that violates all international norms, laws, charters and agreements, and aims to undermine confidence in the Palestinian banking and banking sector”.    According to Khan, three of the shops that were raided were in Ramallah. “The Israelis say [the money exchanges] have been used by the resistance movements to finance their activities,” he said. “In total, they actually seized about $2.5m in those raids.” At the same time, fierce clashes broke out in al-Manara Square in the centre of Ramallah. One person was shot and killed and at least 15 others were injured during confrontations between Israeli soldiers and Palestinians. “We treated and transported four injured Palestinians who were shot in the chest, shoulder, leg and sensitive areas with .223 calibre rounds,” Majd Omar, a paramedic with the Palestinian Life Society in Ramallah, told Al Jazeera. He said they were able to get some of the injured to the hospital while others were transported by the Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS). PRCS said one Palestinian was injured after being shot by Israeli forces in Nablus city. Nine people were injured in a separate raid on Halhul city, where two people were detained, the Palestinian news agency Wafa reported.    Although Israeli raids are not unusual in the occupied West Bank, their scale, frequency and intensity have increased in recent weeks. On Thursday, United Nations human rights chiefVolker Turksaid the situation in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem was rapidly deteriorating. “The use of military tactics and weapons in law enforcement contexts, the use of unnecessary or disproportionate force, and the enforcement of broad, arbitrary and discriminatory movement restrictions that affect Palestinians are extremely troubling,” he said in a statement. Palestinian NGOs said Israeli forces arrested at least 25 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, including former prisoners, overnight and on Thursday morning. Rami Khouri, a distinguished fellow at the American University of Beirut, told Al Jazeera the raids were confirmation that the Israelis are moving to prevent the occupied West Bank from erupting in confrontation against Israel amid the war in Gaza. “They don’t want the West Bank to emerge now as the next [front],” he said, adding that the raids are trying to end Palestinian resistance in the occupied West Bank. According to Mouin Rabbani, a Middle East analyst, the escalation of violence in the occupied West Bank is part of an agenda of some Israeli officials “to permanently consolidate” Israel’s rule over the Palestinian territory. “They are out to deliberately provoke the Palestinians to seek to create as much conflict as possible,” he told Al Jazeera. “They are even out to provoke the security forces of the Palestinian Authority, because in their view, should they become involved in a conflict, that would then give Israel a pretext to simply eliminate the Palestinian Authority altogether.” Violence across the West Bank has flared since Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip began on October 7. In that time, more than 300 people have been killed in raids there and nearly 4,800 Palestinians have been arrested. In the Gaza Strip, more than 21,000 people have been killed and at least 55,000 wounded in Israeli attacks since October 7.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/28/unparalleled-israeli-army-raids-ramallah-more-occupied-west-bank-cities
Israeli minister Gantz says situation on Lebanon border ‘demands change’,Comments from the Israeli war cabinet member are the latest to hint at the possibility of an escalation with Hezbollah.,"Senior Israeli minister Benny Gantz says the situation on the country’s border with Lebanon “must change”, hinting at the possibility of military escalation with thearmed group Hezbollah. Gantz, a member of Israel’s emergencywar cabinet, told reporters on Wednesday the chance of a diplomatic solution to exchanges between Israel and armed groups in southern Lebanon is fast running out. “The situation on Israel’s northern border demands change,”Gantztold a news conference. “The stopwatch for a diplomatic solution is running out, if the world and the Lebanese government don’t act in order to prevent the firing on Israel’s northern residents, and to distance Hezbollah from the border, the [Israeli military] will do it.”    The remarks are the latest to raise concerns that Israel’s military campaign in Gaza could explode into a wider regional conflict, drawing in Iran-backed groups such asHezbollah. Israel and Hezbollah, along with a handful of smaller armed groups that operate in southern Lebanon, have settled into a steady rhythm of tit-for-tat exchanges since the current round of fighting between Hamas and Israel started on October 7, when the group launched an attack on southern Israel that killed more than 1,100 people. Since then, Israel has been relentlessly bombing Gaza in a “genocidal” campaign, killing more than 21,000 people, most of them women and children, and displacing nearly its entire 2.3 million residents. The Israeli offensive in Gaza triggered tensions along the Israel-Lebanon border, as intermittent exchange of fire between Israeli forces and Hezbollah were reported in the deadliest clashes since the two sides fought a full-scale war in 2006.    Tens of thousands of people in Israel and Lebanon have alsobeen displaced,and more than 150 people, most of them Hezbollah fighters, killed on the Lebanese side since the exchanges began, according to a tally by the AFP news agency. The figure includes 20 civilians, including three journalists, the agency said. On Tuesday, a Hezbollah attack injured 11 people in northern Israel while an Israeli attack on Bint Jbeil killedthree people, including one Hezbollah fighter. “Israeli warplanes are currently targeting towns that are even very far from the border,” Al Jazeera correspondent Ali Hashem reported from Bint Jbeil. “The fact is that this area is now becoming a complete warzone, it’s becoming very dangerous, very risky, to go around, with the fact that you’re always anticipating an Israeli drone,” he added. Thus far, however, such exchanges have stopped short of a more serious confrontation that would come with asteep costfor both sides, as well as civilian populations who live in communities near the Israel-Lebanon border. The limited nature of the fighting had eased initial concerns about a larger war. But in recent weeks, Israeli officials have suggested that they could take stronger actions against Hezbollah, even as Israel’s campaign in Gaza comes under growing scrutiny. Speaking on Wednesday on a tour near the border, Israel’s Foreign Minister Eli Cohen said Israel may target Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, a move that would almost certainly spark a larger conflict with the formidable armed group with stronglinks to Iran. “We will operate to make the most of the diplomatic option,” Cohen said. “If it doesn’t work, all options are on the table.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/27/israeli-minister-gantz-says-situation-on-lebanon-border-demands-change
Turkey’s Erdogan says Netanyahu no different than Hitler as Gaza is bombed,The Turkish president asks if what the Israeli leader is doing in the besieged enclave is ‘any less than what Hitler did’.,"Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has compared Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Adolf Hitler, likening Israel’s assault on Gaza to Nazi Germany’s killing of Jews. In remarks at an awards ceremony in capital Ankara on Wednesday, Erdogan asked what difference there was between Netanyahu andHitler. Netanyahu later responded by pointing to Turkey’s own history of alleged rights abuses. “They used to speak ill of Hitler. What difference do you have from Hitler? They are going to make us miss Hitler. Is what this Netanyahu is doing any less than what Hitler did? It is not,” Erdogan said. “He is richer than Hitler, he gets the support from the West. All sorts of support comes from the United States. And what did they do with all this support? They killed more than 20,000 Gazans,” he said.    Erdogan’s remarks have come as Turkey ratchets upcriticism of Israel, reversing a trend of growing ties between the two nations before Israel’s assault on Gaza took a devastating humanitarian toll that has sparked outrage across the region. The Turkish leader has previously levelledharsh criticismat Netanyahu and Israel, calling Israel a “terror state” with “unlimited” Western support in November. Under Hitler’s rule, Nazi Germany embarked on an effort to systematically eliminate European Jews, killing six million through death and labour camps, mass shootings, and a variety of other methods. The Israeli prime minister later hit back at Erdogan, criticising Turkey for its own record of alleged rights abuses at home and in its conflict withKurdish armed groups.    “Erdogan, who commits genocide against the Kurds, who holds a world record for imprisoning journalists who oppose his rule, is the last person who can preach morality to us,” Netanyahu said in a statement. Despite such firm criticism, Turkey has maintained commercial ties with Israel throughout its nearly three-month assault on Gaza in a “genocidal” campaign that has killed more than 21,000 people, wounded 55,000 others and displaced almost the entire 2.3 million population. The Israeli bombings began on October 7 when the Palestinian armed group Hamas launched an attack on southern Israel, killing more than 1,100 people and taking about 240captives.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/27/turkeys-erdogan-says-netanyahu-no-different-than-hitler-as-gaza-is-bombed
"Turkey hits 71 targets in Iraq, Syria in retaliation for soldiers’ deaths",Twelve Turkish soldiers were recently killed during fighting with banned Kurdistan Workers Party in northern Iraq.,"Turkey has hit 71 sites allegedly linked to Kurdish groups in Syria and northern Iraq during air raids launched this week in retaliation for the deaths of 12 Turkish soldiers in Iraq, the defence minister has said. In a video message posted on X, Defence Minister Yasar Guler claimed on Wednesday that at least 59 Kurdish fighters were “neutralised” in the attacks. Ankara uses that term to refer to killed or captured fighters of the banned Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). Twelve Turkish soldiers were killed during fighting with the PKK in northern Iraq, the Ministry of Defence said on Saturday, prompting Turkey to conduct numerous air raids and operations in the region. “Our pain is great, but our determination is complete,” Guler said. “We avenged [the deaths] of our precious children and we will continue to do so.” The military operations intensified over the past 36 hours, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday, as he pledged to avenge “our martyrs”. Turkish officials said that on Friday, fighters affiliated with PKK attempted to infiltrate a Turkish base in northern Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdish region. Six Turkish soldiers were killed in the ensuing firefight. The following day, six more Turkish soldiers were killed in clashes with Kurdish fighters. A spokesperson for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said at least eight civilians were killed in the air raids in northeast Syria on Monday. Turkey insists it takes care to avoid civilian casualties and harm to cultural heritage. The PKK, which maintains bases in northern Iraq, has led a decades-long rebellion against the Turkish state and is considered a terror organisation by Ankara, the European Union and the United States. More than 40,000 people have been killed since the start of the conflict in 1984. Turkey and the US, however, disagree on the status of the Syrian Kurdish groups, which have been allied with Washington in the fight against the Islamic State (ISIL) group in Syria. The PKK is viewed as a national security threat by Turkey, which controls areas in northern Syria and has military bases in Iraq’s north in a bid to push alleged PKK and affiliated groups from its border.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/27/turkey-hits-71-targets-in-iraq-syria-in-retaliation-for-soldiers-deaths
Who are the Israeli refuseniks picking jail over the Gaza war?,"Tel Aviv teen Tal Mitnick is the latest Israeli to refuse to fight against Palestinians, and he is willing to pay a price.","He’s a baby-faced 18-year-old with a heart full of idealism. When Tel Aviv teen Tal Mitnick refused to enlist in the Israeli army, he was put on trial: on Tuesday, he was taken to military prison to serve a 30-day sentence. Standing alone in a country on a determined war footing is an agonising decision. But, speaking at Tel Hashomer, a base near the Gaza fence in central Israel, Mitnick staunchly defended his decision. “I believe that slaughter cannot solve slaughter,” he said. “The criminal attack on Gaza won’t solve the atrocious slaughter that Hamas executed. Violence won’t solve violence. And that is why I refuse.” Tal Mitnick, an activist in the Mesarvot network showed up today at Tel Hashomer base and was sentenced to 30 days in military prison. Listen to what he had to say before he walked in. Support him and other refusniks:https://t.co/drRtLjk4U3pic.twitter.com/zu1XZJqmhG — Mesarvot מסרבות (@Mesarvot_)December 26, 2023  The statement appeared on the X account of Mesarvot, a support network connecting refuseniks in a campaign against the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories. In an earlier interview posted on the account, Mitnick laid out his universalist stance on the conflict. The solution, he said, would not come from corrupt politicians in Israel or from Hamas. “It will come from us, the sons and daughters of the two nations,” he said. Friends came out in support of Mitnick, holding placards with phrases like: “You cannot build heaven with blood”, “An eye for an eye and we all go blind” and “There is no military solution.” Military service is mandatory for most Jewish Israelis, viewed as a rite of passage. In the country’s highly militarised society, so-called refuseniks risk being labelled traitors. No. Generally speaking, refuseniks may end up serving repeated prison services, ordered to return to recruitment centres again and again. Some wind up doing months behind bars before they are eventually discharged. The Israeli military does have a conscientious objectors committee, but exemptions are usually only granted on religious grounds – the ultra-Orthodox Haredi Jews, for instance, are legally exempt. Refusing to serve as a matter of political principle is not considered a valid objection. Earlier this year, Amnesty International released a report on Yuval Dag, a 20-year-old who had made his political objections clear before his summons. The army classified his refusal as disobedience and sentenced him to 20 days at Neve Tzedek military prison in Tel Aviv. The rights group named four other individuals – Einat Gerlitz, Nave Shabtay Levin, Evyatar Moshe Rubin and Shahar Schwartz  – who were repeatedly detained in 2022. Conscientious objectors commonly serve five months or more in prison – a high price to pay for young people doing what they believe to be right. Many objectors come to their decision after participating in protest movements, whether on LGBTQ rights, climate change or Israel’s occupation, violence and discrimination against Palestinians — a system that many rights groups have compared with apartheid. In 2003, a group ofIsraeli Air Force pilotsprovoked national fury when they refused to take part in operations in the West Bank and Gaza. Submitting a letter to the media, they branded attacks on the territories as “illegal and immoral”. The case was noteworthy, involving elite army members like Brigadier General Yiftah Spector, considered a legend in the forces for his attack on Iraq’s nuclear reactor in 1982. The government accused the pilots of “pretentious snivelling”. That same year, the country’s elite commandoes also defied orders to carry out attacks on the occupied territories. Setting out their position in a letter, 15 reservists from the Sayeret Matkal unit, often compared with the British army’s SAS, said: “We will no longer corrupt the stamp of humanity in us through carrying out the missions of an occupation army. “In the past, we fought for a justified cause (but today), we have reached the boundary of oppressing another people.” In 2007, swimwear modelBar Refaelimarried a friend to avoid military service, later telling the press that “celebrities have other needs”. Later, to avoid damage to the companies she worked for, she agreed to participate in an enlistment campaign. The case ignited a debate on how easy it is to dodge conscription. Yes, but it was not linked to the occupation. In early March, about 700 reservist soldiers – including some top brass – resigned en masse during widespread protests over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s judicial overhaul. Critics accused him of curtailing Supreme Court powers to shield himself from corruption charges. Explaining his refusal to serve in the army, Dag said that reservists had resigned because they were afraid of living in a dictatorship. But, he pointed out, “We need to remember that in the occupied territories there has never been democracy. And the anti-democratic institution that rules there is the army.” Responding to rebellion in the ranks, Netanyahu said: “There’s no room for refusals.” Military service was, he said, “the first and most important foundation of our existence in our land …The refusals threaten the foundation of our existence.” Netantahu’s view is not unusual. Across the political spectrum, with the exception of some left-wing and Arab groups, parties condemn the refusal to serve for a number of reasons. Left wingers worry about polarisation, claiming that refusing to serve will encourage right-wing resistance to removing settlements. Right wingers believe that refusal helps the enemies of Israel. The right to conscientious objection to military service is protected by international law, enshrined in Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). The UN Commission for Human Rights has stated that states must “refrain from subjecting conscientious objectors to imprisonment and to repeated punishment for failure to perform military service”. However, it is common practice in Israel, not only to imprison objectors, but to repeat sentences several times. In 2003, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention said that international law banned “double jeopardy”. Selective objection is not an option. In 2002, the Israeli High Court of Justice ruled that allowing soldiers not to serve in the occupied territories would “loosen the links that hold us together as a people”. The case had been brought by a group called Courage to Refuse, who said their duties would involve “dominating, expelling, starving and humiliating an entire people”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/27/who-are-the-israeli-refuseniks-picking-jail-over-the-gaza-war
Israeli strikes kill Hezbollah fighter as violence on Lebanon border grows,"War planes attacked a house in Bint Jbeil, killing three people, Lebanon’s state media says.","An Israeli air attack on a south Lebanon border town has killed three people. The bombing late on Tuesday targeted a house in the town of Bint Jbeil, killing a Hezbollah fighter and two relatives, according to the Iranian-linked Lebanese armed group. The strikes followed a series of attacks by Hezbollah on Israeli posts close to the border. The border area between Lebanon and Israel has seenescalatingexchanges of fire since the Israeli-Gaza war began on October 7. Lebanon’s National News Agency (NNA) on Wednesday identified those killed as Ali Bazzi, his brother Ibrahim and sister-in-law Shourouk Hammoud. “Enemy warplanes raided, before midnight (22:00 GMT), a house … in the centre of the town of Bint Jbeil”, about 2km (1.2 miles) from the border, killing the three and injuring another family member, NNA said. A relative told the AFP news agency that Ibrahim Bazzi was an Australian citizen who had flown in for a visit about a week ago. Hezbollah announced that Ali Bazzi was one of its fighters.    The recent rise in violence between Israel and Hezbollah has been largely confined to the border area, although Israel has conducted limited air raids deeper into Lebanese territory. “This is the first time Bint Jbeil has been hit since 2006,” reported Al Jazeera’s Ali Hashem from the town. “But seven other southern Lebanese towns are being hit on a daily basis by Israeli warplanes. It’s a war zone.” Israel has been pushing for Hezbollah to withdraw north of the Litani River, which lies about 30km (20 miles) north of the border. On Tuesday, Israel’s military said an antitank missile fired by the Iran-backed armed group injured nine soldiers as they went to assist a civilian injured in an earlier attack. On Wednesday, Israel’s army radio and media reported that 18 missiles had been fired at northeast Israel from the Lebanese border. The Israeli military shot down eight of the missiles heading towards the Rosh Hanikra kibbutz as sirens sounded in the area. The attacks caused no injuries or damage, the reports said. Since hostilities began, more than 150 people have been killed on the Lebanese side, most of them Hezbollah fighters, but also more than a dozen civilians, three of them journalists.

But it can’t do more without escalating tensions.,"Operation Prosperity Guardian (OPG), theUnited States Navy-led coalitionof the willing intended to allow international shipping to continue navigating safely through the Red Sea, is set to activate within days. Including allies from Europe and the Middle East, as well as Canada and Australia, the operation has been snubbed by three important NATO countries, France, Italy and Spain. What is the exact task of OPG? The official line, “to secure safe passage for the commercial ships”, is too vague for any naval flag officer to feel comfortable getting into. Admirals want politicians to give them precise tasks and clear mandates needed to achieve the desired results. Defining the threat seems easy, for now: antiship missiles and drones of various types carrying explosive warheads have been targeting merchant ships on the way to and from the Suez Canal. All were fired from Yemen, by the Houthi group also known as Ansar Allah which now controls most of the country, including the longest section of its 450km-long Red Sea coast. All missiles were surface-launched, with warheads that can damage but hardly sink big cargo ships. The Houthis at first announced that they wouldtarget Israeli-owned ships, then expanded that to include all those using Israeli ports, ultimately to those trading with Israel. After several attacks where the Israeli connection appeared very distant or vague, it is prudent to assume that any ship could be targeted. All missiles neutralised by US and French warships so far were shot down by sophisticated shipborne surface-to-air missiles (SAM), proving that the modern vertical-launch systems guided by the latest generation phased array radars work as designed. Many nations earmarked to participate in OPG have ships with similar capabilities. Almost all also carry modern surface-to-surface missiles that can attack targets at sea or land. If the task of OPG were to be defined narrowly, only to prevent hits on merchant ships, it could be performed using the centuries-old principle of sailing in convoys with the protection of warships. In a convoy, slow, defenceless commercial cargos sail in several columns at precisely defined distances from each other — led, flanked and tailed by fast warships that can take on any threat. The system is effective, as the United Kingdom, Russia, Malta, and many other countries saved by convoys in World War II can attest. But every strategy has its limitations. A convoy is big and cumbersome, extending for miles to give behemoth ships a safe distance from each other and to enable them to manoeuvre if needed. Whatever the protective measures taken, huge tankers and container carriers – longer than 300 metres (984 feet) – still present big targets. Captains of commercial ships are generally not trained in convoy operations, and most have no experience operating in large groups or under military command. Their escorts, even if well-armed, carry a limited number of missiles and must plan their use carefully, allowing for further attacks down theshipping laneand ultimately leaving a war reserve for the defence of the ship itself. Once they expend some of the missiles, they need to replenish them – a task that is possible at sea but done much more quickly and safely in a friendly port out of reach of Houthi missiles. To clear the critical 250 nautical miles (463km) along the Yemeni coast leading to or from the Bab al-Mandeb strait, advancing at assumed 15 knots (28kmph) — as convoys always sail at the speed of the slowest units — ships would be exposed to even the shortest-ranged Houthi missiles and drones for at least 16 hours. And before even trying to make the dash, they would be particularly vulnerable in the staging areas in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden where ships would spend some time gathering, forming the convoy and setting under way. The Houthi missile threat is now known to be high, and their arsenal is substantial. Naval planners must be worried by their ability to mount concentrated prolonged attacks simultaneously from several directions. This was demonstrated in the very first attack, on October 19, when the Houthi launched four cruise missiles and 15 drones at USS Carney, a destroyer that is still operating in the Red Sea and will be part of OPG. The attack, probably planned to test the Houthis’ attack doctrine and enemy response, lasted nine hours, forcing the crew of the target ship to maintain full readiness and concentration for a prolonged period to intercept all incoming missiles. Every admiral would tell his political superiors that military necessity would call for attacks on Houthi missile infrastructure on the ground in Yemen: fixed and mobile launch sites, production and storage facilities, command centres and whatever little radar infrastructure there exists. A proactive response to the missile threat, in other words, to destroy the Houthi ship-targeting capability, rather than the reactive one limited to shooting missiles down as they come in. In theory, attacks against Houthi missile infrastructure could be based on satellite and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) reconnaissance and carried out by missiles launched from the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean and armed drones from distant land bases. But the only realistic chance at meaningful success would require the use of combat aircraft, bombers based on the two US Navy nuclear carriers in the region. Attacks against targets in Yemen would have a clear military justification. But they would also carry a clear political risk: that of the West, particularly the US, being seen in the Arab and Islamic world as actually entering the Gaza war on the side of Israel. After all, the Houthis say their attacks on Red Sea ships are aimed at getting Israel to end the war. Aware of the perils of such a development that could easily cause the conflict to spread, the US has tried to tread carefully, engaging with regional powers, and sending messages that it wants no escalation. It even openly demanded of its ally Israel that it limit civilian suffering and end the conflict as quickly as possible — to no avail. The White House and the Pentagon are now walking on hot coals. If they do nothing, the Red Sea route will quickly close, causing US, European and Asian economies significant damage. If the half measures they currently propose, just escorting convoys without attacking missile sites on land, fail to secure safe passage, they will have lost face and failed in preventing an economic downturn. And if the US is eventually forced to attack, it will have directly contributed to a dangerous escalation that may be difficult to contain. Mindful of all these dilemmas, France, Italy and Spain are playing it safe: they will “unilaterally” deploy their frigates to the Red Sea to “protect the ships of their respective nations”. Should the US Navy ultimately attack Yemen, the Europeans will be able to claim that they did not contribute to the intensification of the war, shoving all the responsibility to the US.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/27/analysis-in-the-red-sea-the-us-has-no-good-options-against-the-houthis

US eyes reports Iran has accelerated uranium enrichment,Tension has risen between Washington and Tehran amid the Israel-Gaza war.,"The United States has expressed deep concern over reports that Iran has accelerated its production of weapons-grade uranium. The comments from a White House National Security Council spokesperson came late on Tuesday in response to a report issued by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that warned that Tehran has accelerated production of the high-grade material. “Iran’s nuclear escalation is all the more concerning at a time when Iran-backed proxies continue their dangerous and destabilising activities in the region, including the recent deadly drone attack and other attempted attacks in Iraq and Syria and the Houthi attacks against commercial shipping vessels in the Red Sea,” the US spokesperson said. The United Nations atomic watchdog’s report to member states said that Iran has increased the rate at which it is producing near weapons-grade uranium in recent weeks, reversing a previous slowdown that started in in mid-2023. Iran had previously slowed the rate at which it was enriching uranium – the process of raising the level of uranium-235, the isotope used in nuclear fission –  to 60 percent purity. Uranium enriched at 60 percent is just a step away from weapons-grade levels of 90 percent. Nuclear power stations require 3.67 percent. The IAEA said its inspectors had verified the increased rate of production since the end of November at facilities in Natanz and Fordow to about 9kg (20lb) per month, the same level of production that Iran was maintaining in the first half of 2023 before a drop to 3kg (6.6lb) per month in June. Iran’s atomic energy chief dismissed the concern on Wednesday, insisting that Iran has done “nothing new” and is working “according to the rules”. Iran’s atomic energy chief Mohammad Eslami on Wednesday dismissed the IAEA warnings, according to Iranian media. “We did nothing new and are doing the same activities according to the rules,” he said. Iranian officials have consistently stated they have no plans or intentions regarding the creation of nuclear weapons.    Iran appeared to have slowed its enrichment programme earlier this year as a gesture as informal talks with the US over a nuclear treaty resumed. But the Israel-Gaza war has raised tensions between Washington and Tehran. A confidential IAEA report released last month indicated that Iran’s estimated stockpile ofenriched uraniumhad reached more than 22 times the limit set out in a 2015 accord between Tehran and world powers, limiting Iran’s nuclear activities in exchange for lifting sanctions. Iran’s total enriched uranium stockpile was estimated at 4,486.8kg (9,891.7lb) as of October 28, up by 693.1kg (1,528lb) from August, the report said. The limit in the 2015 deal was set at 202.8kg (447lb). However, that accord fell apart in 2018 when then-president Donald Trump pulled the US out of it. President Joe Biden has tried to revive the accord through talks in Vienna, but the process has been at a standstill since the summer of 2022. Antagonism was already on the rise ahead of Hamas’s October 7 assault on Israel, with Iran offering support to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In September, the IAEAcomplainedthat Tehran had effectively barred several of its most experienced inspectors from monitoring the country’s nuclear programme.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/27/us-frets-over-irans-accelerated-uranium-enrichment-programme
Six killed in Israeli strike on refugee camp in occupied West Bank,Ambulances say they were blocked by Israeli forces after attack on Nur Shams refugee camp near Tulkarem.,"At least six Palestinians have been killed in an Israeli drone strike during a raid on a refugee camp in the north of the occupied West Bank, while Israeli forces expanded their operations across the territory. The overnight drone strike hit a group of Palestinians in theNur Shams refugee campnext to the town of Tulkarem, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) and health officials said on Wednesday. Six bodies were taken to a local hospital, along with a number of people who were injured in the attack, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. The six victims were reportedly young men between the ages of 16 and 29, who were standing and watching while the raid took place, said Al Jazeera’s Imran Khan, reporting from Nur Shams on Wednesday. “The drone came from above, and the men simply didn’t stand a chance. This was a deliberate kill shot,” he said. The incursion was the “second-biggest raid” on the refugee camp in 24 hours, said Al Jazeera’s Alan Fisher, reporting from occupied East Jerusalem. Ongoing clashes were reported in Tulkarem and Nur Shams until about 7am (05:00 GMT) on Wednesday, he said. “We were told there were snipers on the roof, that the Israelis had moved into Nur Shams to try and arrest people that they say were ‘wanted’.” The raids in the refugee camp for a second night in a row have left people increasingly worried about what might happen later in the evening, Fisher added.    After the strike in Nur Shams, PRCS said the Israeli military blocked ambulances from transporting the dead and wounded. “People tried to help [the victims], but for at least an hour and a half, the Israelis wouldn’t allow ambulances to get in,” Al Jazeera’s Khan said. “Eventually, they had to pick up the bodies and take them down to where the ambulances were. Of course, at that stage, it was too late. These people were dead.” Al Jazeera spoke to sources at the local hospital who said an Israeli soldier went into an ambulance and stabbed a man in the neck. He is now being treated in an intensive care unit. The Israeli military also conducted raids in the cities ofBethlehem, Jenin, Hebron and Tubas overnight. Three people were injured in the Dheisheh refugee camp in Bethlehem, the Palestinian news agency Wafa reported. At least 12 people were detained by Israeli forces across the occupied West Bank in overnight raids, the Commission of Detainees and Ex-Detainees Affairs and the Palestinian Prisoner’s Club said in a statement. Violence across the West Bank has flared since Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip began on October 7. In that time, more than 300 people have been killed in raids there and more than 4,700 Palestinians have been arrested. In the Gaza Strip, at least 20,915 people have been killed and 54,918 wounded in Israeli attacks since October 7. The revised death toll from Hamas’s attack on Israel stands at 1,139. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said his forces will not lower the intensity of fighting and are instead “deepening operations in southern Gaza”, while Herzi Halevi, the Israeli army’s chief of staff, said the war on Gaza will continue for “many months”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/27/six-killed-in-israeli-strike-on-refugee-camp-in-occupied-west-bank
"‘Will rebuild Gaza’: In freezing Rafah, a Palestinian mother’s 2024 dreams","Rania Sakallah’s family had a four-bedroom home in Gaza City, filled with love; and a garden with lemon, mango and guava trees. Now their next meal is uncertain.","Rania Sakallah is holding onto happy memories. Shortly before the war started, she and her family enjoyed a day out together at Sheikh Ijlin beach in the south of Gaza City. They stopped at the Tropical Restaurant to eat chicken pizza. Her twin son and daughter were about to embark on their final year of studies at Al-Azhar University. There was a lot to look forward to. Now they face the bleakest of starts to 2024. Huddled in a freezing room in the southern border town of Rafah with other family members – 11 people in total – the future resembles a gaping void and the Gaza City home Rania and her husband Hazem had built together possibly reduced to rubble. “I don’t sleep all night,” says Rania. “I lie awake all night thinking: What are we going to do? Where are we going to go?” Rania and Hazem, an accountant with the Palestinian Authority, decided to flee Gaza City on October 13, leaving behind their four-bedroom home. “Because we were so scared, we didn’t take much,” says Rania. Carrying a few bags with clothes and tinned food, they walked the 33km (20 miles) to Khan Younis, taking turns to push Rania’s 75-year-old mother, who had recently suffered a stroke, in her wheelchair. For about 50 days, they stayed inKhan Younis, sleeping on the floor of Rania’s brother’s shop as Israel launched some of the most intense air attacks of the entire war on the Israeli-declared “safe zone” in early December. Chased by bombs, they hit the road again, joined by the families of Rania’s brother and sister, scrambling for accommodation in Rafah, just as the heavy winter rains began. Rania and her family are far from alone. According to the United Nations, half of Gaza’s population of 2.2 million is now crammed into schools, public buildings and makeshift camps in Rafah and nearby al-Mawasi. The most desperate are in the streets. Although southern Gaza is supposed to be the enclave’s last refuge, Israelcontinues to poundthe area. With aid trucks only able to bring in scant supplies, disease and extreme deprivation are rife, says Rania. Talking on the phone to Al Jazeera, Rania described the battle for survival in Rafah. “Life has tired us out. It has become impossible,” she says. “It’s not just me. It’s like a million Palestinians just like me. And some of them are in an even worse situation.” More than half a million people in Gaza have run out of food and are now at immediate risk ofstarvation, UN agencies said last week. Deliveries of food, water and medicine were stopped at the start of the war, with November’s pause in fighting allowing more aid to enter via Rafah – still, only 10 percent of food needs are being met right now. In Rafah, life revolves around getting enough food and water to survive another day. “When we want to make bread, the first challenge is finding the flour,” says Rania. Even that basic ingredient has become scarce, with family members queueing for hours at a school run by UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency), which is sheltering thousands and distributing some food aid. Sometimes people leave empty-handed. It is still possible to buy food, she says. But with supplies running low, prices of basics like fava beans, chickpeas and cheese have skyrocketed, rendering them inaccessible for most people. Once food has been secured, members of the family have to search for firewood outside, as fuel and gas are now impossible to get hold of. Rania uses an old oil drum as a stove to cook. Water only comes on tap once a week, on Fridays, but is sometimes too dirty even to shower, let alone drink. The mixture of poor nutrition and dirty water is making people ill, sparking outbreaks of diarrhoea, gastroenteritis and skin infections. Rania does not leave the house without a face mask. As the weather gets colder, catching flu or respiratory infections can mean death. Many of those sheltering at the UNRWA school where she queues for food are ill, she says. There is a room in the school offering medical assistance but it is unable to provide any treatment beyond paracetamol. “You’re not going to get help if you go there,” she says. But going to thehospital is not an optioneither. Right now, Rafah’s Abu Yousef al-Najjar Hospital and the Kuwaiti Hospital are operating beyond capacity on barely any medical supplies. Fuel supplies needed for generators, cut off at the beginning of the war, are still heavily restricted. Overcrowding and poor sanitary conditions have spawned a whole new set of health hazards. On average, 160 people sheltering in UNRWA schools share a single toilet and there is one shower unit for every 700 people, according to UN figures. Doctors report that many are infected with parasites. Infectious dysentery, causing vomiting and diarrhoea, is now widespread. Cases of contagious illnesses like chickenpox, measles and viral meningitis are also rising fast. “I’m trying for there not to be illness in my family,” says Rania. “We’re thinking we could be losing one of our loved ones at any moment and we are scared.” With no electricity, Rania’s phone call with Al Jazeera required careful preparation, involving a one-hour walk to the nearest UNRWA school to charge her phone. Once a connection was established, it repeatedly threatened to drop. This is nothing unusual these days – sometimes it takes Rania dozens of attempts to reach her ailing mother and father, who joined the family in Deir el-Balah when she left for Rafah, Rania tells Al Jazeera. Right now, the internet is usually only available for 10 minutes at a time. Rania’s children, Rana and Mohammed, both 22 years old, feel like their dreams have been shattered, their world now reduced to a single room in a war zone, with no means of communicating properly with the outside world. Rana was about to qualify as a dentist, while Mohammed was studying software engineering. “I tell them to find other places where they can finish outside Gaza but they ask how they can do this. There’s not even any internet for them to look for universities,” Rania says. In any case, she wonders if they would be accepted anywhere without a certificate. Gaza has endured repeated phone and internet blackouts due to strikes on telecommunications infrastructure, deliberate shutdowns and power cuts since the war started on October 7. Under blockade for the past 16 years, the enclave has often been compared with an open-air prison, even before the war. On the cusp of the New Year, Rania, Hazem and the twins are praying for peace. Right now, the only certainty Rania has is that she will not leave Gaza — at a time many Israeli politicians have suggested that the people of Gaza move into Egypt’s Sinai desert. Egypt has rejected the proposal. Rania’s sister, Aya, also sharing the room in Rafah, stuck it out for as long as she could in Gaza City, eventually forced to leave with her husband and their son, all holding white flags and their identity papers aloft so they would not be shot as they walked south. One uncle who stayed behind was killed by the bombs. Rania does not even know if the family home, with her beloved garden full of lemon, mango and guava trees, is still standing. But, she says, she is prepared to live in a tent amid the rubble of the destroyed city. “Every day my kids ask me when we are going to go back to Gaza City,” she says. “Why would we go to Sinai? Sinai is a desert.” “If Gaza too is a desert, I’d rather return there and rebuild it.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/27/freezing-in-rafah-a-gaza-familys-war-time-displacement-and-hopes-for-2024
Turkish parliament’s foreign affairs commission approves Sweden’s NATO bid,Panel’s approval clears another hurdle in Sweden’s accession process to the bloc in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.,"The Turkish parliament’s foreign affairs commission has approved Sweden’s NATO membership bid. The decision, taken on Tuesday, is a key step towards enlarging the military alliance after 19 months of delays in which Ankara demanded security-related concessions from Stockholm. The commission, controlled by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s ruling Justice and Development Party (AK Party),voted to backthe bid made by Sweden last year after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The next step is a vote by the full parliament, in which the AK Party and its allies hold a majority. Sweden’s NATO membership is expected to pass, and then the measure would go to Erdogan. If he signs it into law, he wouldconclude a processthat has taken nearly two years and frustrated some of Ankara’s allies in the West. Commission head Fuat Oktay, however, played down expectations for a speedy vote in the full Grand National Assembly, telling reporters that the speaker would decide on a timing for the vote. Parliament also has a two-week recess in early January. “The decision to submit it to the general assembly has been made now, but this should not be interpreted as [a sign] that it will pass the general assembly with the same speed. There is no such thing,” Oktay said. In a statement after the commission’s approval, Swedish Foreign Minister Tobias Billstrom said Sweden welcomed the move and looked forward to joining NATO. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg also hailed the approval by the Turkish parliamentary commission. “I welcome the vote by the Turkish parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee to ratify Sweden’s NATO membership,” Stoltenberg said, urging Turkey and fellow holdout Hungary to complete their ratifications “as soon as possible”.    All NATO members, which now number 31, are required to approve new memberships. Erdogan raised objections in May last year to both Swedish and Finnish requests to join the alliance over what he said was their protection of people whom Turkey accuses of being “terrorists” and over their defence of trade embargoes. Turkey ratified Finland’s bid in April but kept Sweden waiting until it took more steps to crack down on local members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which Turkey, the European Union and the United States list as a terrorist group. In response, Stockholm introduced a bill that makes being a member of a “terrorist organisation” illegal. Sweden and NATO members Finland, Canada and the Netherlands also took steps to relax arms-export policies affecting Turkey. While NATO member Hungary has also not ratified Sweden’s membership, Turkey is seen as the main roadblock to adding the Scandinavian nation to the military alliance and bolstering its defences in the Baltic Sea region. Erdogan had also linked Turkey’s ratification of Sweden’s membership with the US approval of sales ofF-16 fighter jetsto Turkey. After a call with US President Joe Biden this month, he said Washington was considering the ratification to move on the request.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/26/turkish-parliaments-foreign-affairs-commission-approves-swedens-nato-bid
Houthis say they carried out drone attack on Israeli port of Eilat,"Houthis claim responsibility for drone attack on Israeli port city of Eilat, Red Sea commercial vessel.","Yemen’s Houthi rebel group has said that it carried out drone attacks targeting the Israeli port city of Eilat, as well as a commercial vessel in the Red Sea, as the Iran-backed group steps up attacks that it says are a means of pressuring Israel to end its war in Gaza. Speaking on Tuesday, Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said the group conducted drone attacks on Eilat and “other areas in occupied Palestine”. Sarea said the group also launched missiles at an MSC United vessel in the Red Sea after it rejected three warning calls. MSC Mediterranean confirmed that MSC United VIII, which was en route from King Abdullah port in Saudi Arabia to Karachi, Pakistan, came under attack on Tuesday but that the crew was safe. The shipping company says it is conducting an assessment and reported the incident to the US-led naval coalition in the Red Sea. The statement comes several hours after a British maritime group said it received reports of an incident involving a vessel off the coast ofYemen, saying that drones were sighted and an explosion was heard. The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) on Tuesday said the incident took place about 60 nautical miles (111km) outside of Yemen’s Hodeidah port. “A commercial shipping vessel came under attack by two suicide drones,” Al Jazeera correspondent Resul Serdar reported from Djibouti, located in east Africa across the sea from Yemen. “It [UKMTO] says the drones didn’t cause any damage on the ship. The ship is now safe, continuing its voyage, and they are in constant communication with the naval coalition formed by the United States.”    The incidents come amid high tensions in the Red Sea, wherethe Houthishave been targeting commercial vessels in solidarity with the Palestinians for weeks. The UKMTO report followed two other explosions that struck a vessel off of Hodeidah earlier on Tuesday. The US has said the Houthis, who control wide swaths of northern Yemen, have launched more than 100 drone and missile attacks, targeting 10 commercial shipping vessels with links to dozens of countries.    The group has also launched missiles and drones at Israel, which has unleashed adevastating assaulton the besieged enclave of Gaza where it is battling the Palestinian armed group Hamas following a deadly assault on southern Israel on October 7. Israel’s assault on Gaza has killed more than 20,000 Palestinians and sparked concerns about the possibility of a wider regional escalation. The Houthi raids in the Red Sea have causedsignificant disruptionsalong the vital shipping route, causing some companies to reroute their vessels at considerable expense. The US recently announced asecurity coalitionto protect commercial shipping from such raids, conducting patrols in an effort to deter further attacks. “The United States, just to safeguard that vital maritime route, is increasing its naval presence in the region,” said Serdar, noting that a US destroyer was refuelling in Djibouti on Tuesday.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/26/uk-maritime-group-reports-drones-explosion-off-yemen-coast
Deadly Christmas in Syria’s Idlib after Russian attack kills five in family,A couple and their three children were killed; a fourth child is in critical condition.,"Idlib, Syria ــ A couple and three of their children were killed in Russian air raids targeting a house in a farm near the town of Armenaz in western Idlib on Monday evening, according to the Syrian Civil Defence. Another child, the sole survivor, was injured. “We live in this small region of Syria as legitimate targets to satisfy the criminal instincts of both Russia and the Assad regime,” said Walid Ahmed Murad, 32, who lost his sister, her husband, and their children in the Alata farm air raid. He was referring to the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Murad told Al Jazeera that his sister Fatima and her husband Anas had fled Aleppo six years ago after the Assad regime took control, only to return to their hometown in Jabal Zawiya in Idlib countryside before moving to the farm three days ago for job opportunities in sheep farming. “They were very happy to find work that could help them live under their difficult economic conditions,” Murad said. The three children who died — Amina, Khalid, and Mohammed —”were among the kindest children you could meet, and I will miss them forever,” he said. Hamza, his sister’s fourth child and the only one still alive, is in critical condition. Earlier in the day,another civilian was killed, and five others were injured, including three children, in a missile attack by Syrian regime forces on civilian homes, a rural school, public facilities and agricultural lands in the city of Sarmin in eastern Idlib. The Syrian Civil Defence, a volunteer emergency rescue group also known as the White Helmets, said that since the beginning of 2023 until December 17, their teams have responded to 1,232 attacks by Syrian regime forces, Russian forces, and their allied militias. These attacks resulted in the death of 161 people, including 46 children and 23 women, while 681 people were injured, of which 214 were children and 95 were women. Idlib, the last province controlled byopposition fightersin Syria, is governed by a March 5, 2020 ceasefire agreement between Turkey and Russia. However, this agreement is occasionally violated by Syrian government forces and Russia. “Today’s massacre is evidence that Russia can never be on the side of peace and a party that brings security to Syrians. The international community must put an end to Russian terrorism that transcends borders,” said Nada al-Rashid, a board member of the Syrian Civil Defence. Al-Rashid told Al Jazeera that villages in eastern and southern Idlib are systematically targeted by regime forces, undermining stability in the region and imposing a state of terror and fear, leading to displacement waves. “The continued massacres by the Assad regime and Russia against Syrians increase the danger of living in dozens of cities and towns, imposing a reality of continuous suffering, especially in the harsh winter that ravages camps lacking the basic necessities of life, weak infrastructure, and a clear decline in humanitarian response,” al-Rashid said. While much of the world marks Christmas and prepares for the New Year, these celebrations are absent for the people of northwest Syria due to continuous bombing and the deteriorating economic situation in an area with a population of 4.5 million, including 1.9 million living in internally displaced persons (IDP) camps, according to the latest statistics from United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). “Russia celebrates Christmas in its criminal way by killing children and women in Idlib,” said Obadah al-Daher, 21, a displaced civilian from Maarat al-Numan city living in the town of al-Dana town near the Syria-Turkey border. Al-Daher enters his fourth year today away from his land and home after leaving them at the beginning of 2020 following a military campaign led by the Syrian regime, supported by Russia and Iranian militias. The campaign resulted in the control of Maarat al-Numan city and its countryside, leading to the displacement of most residents to northern Idlib. “With the beginning of each year, we hope to return to our homes and for the Assad regime and Russia to be held accountable for the crimes they committed and continue to against us,” al-Daher said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/26/deadly-christmas-in-syrias-idlib-after-russian-attack-kills-five-in-family
Israel grants Intel $3.2bn for new $25bn chip plant,"Deal with US chipmaker is ‘largest investment ever’ in Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says.","Israel’s government has agreed to give Intel Corp a $3.2bn grant for a new $25bn chip plant it plans to build in southern Israel, both sides have said. The news on Tuesday comes as Israel remains locked in anintense waron the Gaza Strip, which has killed close to 21,000 Palestinians since October 7, and ushered global calls to boycott Israeland companies that benefit from its occupation of Palestinian lands. Israel’s deal with Intel is a big show of support by a major US company and a generous offer by the Israeli government at a time when Washington – which is Israel’s biggest supporter – has increased pressure on Tel Aviv to take further steps to minimise civilian casualties in Gaza. In addition to the grant that amounts to 12.8 percent of the total investment, the chipmaker also committed to buying 60 billion shekels ($16.6bn) worth of goods and services from Israeli suppliers over the next decade, while the new facility is expected to create several thousand jobs. In June, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicised news of the deal – which remained unconfirmed by Intel until now – heralding the decision to build a new chip plant as “unprecedented”, adding that “this is the largest investment ever in the State of Israel”. Intel operates four development and production sites in Israel, including a manufacturing plant in Kiryat Gat, 42km (26 miles) from the Gaza Strip. An expansion plan for the Kiryat Gat site is an “important part of Intel’s efforts to foster a more resilient global supply chain, alongside the company’s ongoing and planned manufacturing investments in Europe and the United States”, Intel said in a statement. The plant produces Intel 7 technology, or 10-nanometer chips, and employs nearly 12,000 people in the country while indirectly employing another 42,000 more. Israel’s finance and economy ministries said Intel’s investment, especially in this period and in light of the global competition to attract significant investments in the field of chips, is a significant expression of confidence in the country’s economy. They said the investment has direct fiscal benefits for Israel that will be significantly higher than the state’s grant. “This investment, at a time when Israel wages war against utter wickedness, a war in which good must defeat evil, is an investment in the right and righteous values that spell progress for humanity,” Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said. Intel first established a presence in Israel and 1974. At some $9bn, Intel’s exports account for 5.5 percent of total high-tech exports. Intel, one of around 500 multinationals in Israel and which bought Israeli self-driving auto technologies firm Mobileye for $15.3bn in 2017, declined to say what technology will be produced at the new Fab 38 plant where Intel says construction has already begun. The Fab 38 plant is due to open in 2028 and operate through 2035. Under CEO Pat Gelsinger, Intel has invested billions in building factories across three continents to restore its dominance in chipmaking and better compete with rivals AMD, Nvidia and Samsung. The new Israeli plant is the latest investment by the chipmaker in recent years.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/26/israel-grants-intel-3-2bn-for-largest-ever-25bn-chip-plant-investment
Could Israel’s Gaza war drag Iraq into another conflict?,,"Iraq has increasingly become a scene for strikes between Iran-backed forces and the United States amid Israel’s brutal war on Gaza, with concerns mounting about a serious escalation. The US said Tuesday it launched attacks onIran-aligned groups in Iraq, amid a chaotic 24 hours in the region that also saw a senior Iranian general assassinated in Syria. Let’s take a look at the main recent developments, and talk about what they could mean for Iraq and the wider region. In the early hours of Tuesday, the US military said it launched strikes against three sites used by Kataib Hezbollah, a major Iran-aligned armed group, and other unnamed affiliated groups in Iraq. It came roughly half a day after Kataib Hezbollah, which is part of the umbrella group Islamic Resistance in Iraq, claimed responsibility for a major attack on a US base in Erbil in northern Iraq. Crucially, Washington said three US soldiers were injured in the attack which used a one-way suicide drone, with one service member suffering critical injuries. The US says its presence in Iraq and Syria is mostly aimed at combating a resurgence by the ISIL (ISIS) militant group. US bases in Iraq and Syria have come under more than100 attacksby Iran-aligned forces since the start of the Gaza war on October 7, but the attacks had not left any US service members seriously injured before. The US Central Command, charged with operations in the Middle East, claimed its strikes on Tuesday “destroyed the targeted facilities and likely killed a number of Kataib Hezbollah militants” without causing civilian casualties. The strikes by the Iraqi groups came hours after Iran’s top commander in Syria, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Brigadier-General Razi Mousavi, wasassassinatedby strikes in broad daylight. Three missiles, widely believed to have been launched by Israel, targeted his home in Sayyida Zeinab south of the Syrian capital. The district is where the most important Shia shrine in Syria is located, drawing millions of pilgrims each year. The IRGC service members operating in Syria are known in Iran as “defenders of the shrine” and Mousavi was in charge of coordinating them. A senior member of the elite extraterritorial Quds Force of the IRGC, he was also a major actor in supporting the “resistance axis” in the Levant, having been active there since the 1980s. Mousavi was close to Qassem Soleimani, Iran’s top general and a main architect of its regional influence, who wasassassinatedby a US drone strike in Iraq in 2020. Top Iranian officials and military commanders, including President Ebrahim Raisi, have vowed that Mousavi will be avenged. This is all happening while other members of the Iran-backed axis, including Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Yemen’s Houthi movement, have been striking at Israel in astated effortto stop its war that has killed over 20,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children. The situation in Iraq is unstable and ripe for further escalation, but neither Iran nor the US is eager for a full-scale war, according to Tehran-based Middle East researcher and author Ali Akbar Dareini. “So far, both Iran and the US have acted within the framework of rational actors, because they are aware of the dangers of an all-out military conflict,” he told Al Jazeera. Dareini pointed out that the US has an upcoming presidential election, while its international standing has taken a hit andpublic opinionhas shifted against its support for Israel as the devastation in Gaza has been laid bare. “In an election year, it would completely eliminate Biden’s chances for re-election if American soldiers are killed. And a wider military confrontation would lead to more instability and a conflict whose repercussions will be unpredictable and would incur hefty costs for both sides,” he said. “So, I don’t expect to see an all-out war, but there is always a risk of miscalculations.” On the other hand, the analyst said, Israel has been eager to pit Iran against the US in a military conflict, especially as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could view this as a way to strengthen his political position amidfalling confidenceabout his leadership abilities. For its part, the Iraqi government can only hope and try to contain the situation, but its authority will be limited, according to Dareini. “The situation has grown complicated in a way that I find it unlikely that the Iraqi government can exert total control over this.” The Iranian general’s assassination on Monday and all the ensuing strikes come days before the fourth anniversary of Soleimani’s killing on January 3. Each year, Iran has renewed itspromiseto avenge the highly influential figure, and this year the anniversary is coinciding with one of the deadliest wars in recent decades involvingIran’s archenemy Israel. For this year’s anniversary, Soleimani is expected to be feted as the “al-Quds martyr” to highlight his championing of the Palestinian cause over decades. Analyst Dareini said an Iranian retaliation for the killing of Mousavi in Syria is inevitable, but it remains to be seen whether Tehran will choose to strike – directly or through its axis – in the coming days or exercise patience for operational purposes. “I think both are likely, but a response is certain, because a non-response would only be seen as serving to embolden the other side and encourage it to ramp up its aggression,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/26/could-israels-gaza-war-drag-iraq-into-another-conflict
India’s navy deploys warships to Arabian Sea after tanker attack,Guided missile destroyers to ‘maintain deterrent presence’ after Israel-linked vessel hit off Indian coast.,"The Indian Navy has dispatched guided missile destroyers to the Arabian Sea after an attack on an Israel-linked chemical tanker off its coast, the Ministry of Defence said. Three stealth-guided destroyers were deployed “in various areas of the sea” to “maintain a deterrent presence” considering the “recent spate of attacks in the Arabian Sea”, the ministry said in a statement late on Monday. It was also using long-range maritime patrol aircraft for “domain awareness”, it said. The United States claimed that the December 23 strike on MV Chem Pluto in the Indian Ocean was “fired from Iran”, an accusation that Tehran hasdismissedas baseless. The attack came as a US-led task forcesought to countersimilar threats to maritime shipping in the Red Sea posed by Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi rebels. Amid the uptick in maritime strikes, this was the first that the US has sought to directly pin on Iran. It was also the first on a vessel outside the Red Sea. “We can see that militarisation is increasing, not only in the Red Sea, but also in the Arabian Peninsula,” said Al Jazeera’s Resul Sardar, reporting from Djibouti. “These are the regional ramifications of the war on Gaza,” he reported on Tuesday. The Indian Navy said it was investigating the nature of the attack on MV Chem Puto, which “anchored safely” in the financial capital, Mumbai, on Monday. An initial assessment “pointed to a drone attack”, the ministry said. But “further forensic and technical analysis will be required to establish the vector of attack, including type and amount of explosive used”. The vessel had been “cleared for further operation” by its company, according to the ministry.    MV Chem Pluto, a Japanese-owned tanker carrying 21 Indians and one Vietnamese citizen, was hit on Saturday while travelling 200 nautical miles (370km) off the coast of India, according to the Pentagon. The attack sparked a fire, which was put out, but caused no casualties. The Houthis have pledged to target any Israel-linked vessel in the Red Sea, through which some 12 percent of all global trade passes, in solidarity with Gaza which has been bombarded by land, sea and air by the Israeli military.  Sardar said that despite the new US-led task force, there still hasn’t been an increase in ships trying to pass through the Red Sea, adding that dozens of cargo ships remain stranded in Djibouti. Since October, the Houthis have waged attacks on more than a dozen vessels, pushing some of the world’s largest firms to abandon the route. The attack in the Indian Ocean, far away from the Red Sea, has raised concerns about even broader risks to maritime shipping amid the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Washington hasaccused Tehranof being “deeply involved” in the Houthi operations. But Iran insists that it is not coordinating with the Houthis and plays no role in the attacks. “The resistance [Houthis] has its own tools … and acts in accordance with its own decisions and capabilities,” Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri told the Mehr news agency on Saturday.

US launches strikes on Iraq over drone attack blamed on Iran-aligned forces,"Baghdad condemns strikes that killed an Iraqi security force member and wounded 18, as ‘hostile’ acts.","The Iraqi government has condemned air strikes by the United States military on its territory as “hostile acts” after the Pentagon said it hit sites used by pro-Iran forces to target US forces. The US strikes killed one member of the Iraqi security forces and wounded 18 people, including civilians, the government in Baghdad said on Tuesday, calling them an “unacceptable attack on Iraqi sovereignty” that would “harm bilateral relations”. Launched early on Tuesday, the US air strikes targeted three sites used by Kataib Hezbollah, a Shia armed group, and its affiliates, said US National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson. The strikes were a response to a Kataib Hezbollah attack the day before on Erbil airbase that wounded three US service members, one of them critically, according to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. Austin said the “necessary and proportionate” strikes were intended to “disrupt and degrade” the capabilities of the Iran-aligned groups responsible for attacks against US personnel. Today, at@POTUS’ direction, U.S. military forces conducted necessary & proportionate strikes on 3 facilities used by Kataib Hezbollah & affiliated groups in Iraq. These precision strikes are a response to a series of attacks against U.S. personnel in Iraq & Syria by… — Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III (@SecDef)December 26, 2023  “While we do not seek to escalate [the] conflict in the region, we are committed and fully prepared to take further necessary measures to protect our people and our facilities,” Austin said. US forces have repeatedly targeted sites used by Iran and its proxy forces in Iraq and Syria in response to dozens of attacks on American and allied forces in the region since the October 7 outbreak of theIsraeli-Palestinian war. US officials on Tuesday said the US military would continue to retaliate if US forces were targeted. “The United States will act at a time and in a manner of our choosing should these attacks continue,” said Watson. Austin said: “Let me be clear – the president and I will not hesitate to take necessary action to defend the United States, our troops, and our interests. There is no higher priority.” The US Central Command said early assessments of the US military’s latest strikes indicated they destroyed the targeted facilities and likely killed several Kataib Hezbollah fighters, without killing any civilians. The strikes are the latest indication of how Israel’s war in Gaza is reverberating across the Middle East, where there is widespread outrage over the mounting Palestinian death toll. Palestinian officials say that more than 20,674 people have been killed and 54,536 wounded in Israeli attacks since October 7, when the Palestinian armed group Hamas launched a surprise multipronged assault on southern Israel. The revised death toll from Hamas’s attack stands at 1,139. US officials have reported at least 103 attacks against its troops in Iraq and Syria since mid-October. Iran has not commented on the latest strikes but has previously denied directing proxy groups to attack US forces in the region.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/26/us-strikes-iraq-after-blaming-iran-backed-groups-for-drone-attack
"Israel intensifies Gaza strikes, killing 250 Palestinians in 24 hours",More than 100 people have been killed in an Israeli strike on the Maghazi refugee camp with families still trapped in rubble.,"Israel has intensified its assault on the Gaza Strip, killing more than 100 people at the Maghazi refugee camp, with Palestinian authorities reporting that 250 people have been killed in awave of strikesover 24 hours. “My entire family is gone. All five of my brothers are gone. They didn’t leave me any brothers. … All of them!” a wailing woman said on Monday at the Maghazi refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip. Palestinians lined up to touch the shrouded bodies of those killed in Israeli strikes on the camp in a funeral on Monday, commemorating dozens of people who were killed, many of them women and children. An Al Jazeera reporter in Gaza said the figure has now reached more than 100. The Government Media Office in Gaza said seven families were wiped out in the Israeli attack on a residential square in the camp. “The Israeli army doesn’t spare civilians,” Zeyad Awad, a resident of Maghazi, told Al Jazeera. “My child said to me, ‘Help me! What’s happening? I can’t breathe,’” he added. The night beforeChristmasin Gaza was marked by some of the most intense bombardments in the current round of fighting between Israel and the Palestinian armed group Hamas with Israeli strikes levelling buildings and leaving families trapped beneathpiles of rubble.    “This is a three-story building that was targeted, and another house here and another house here. According to the family, he told me that five of his family members are still under the rubble,” Al Jazeera correspondent Hind Khoudary reported from Maghazi, adding that one of those trapped is a baby. “He also told me that there has been no ambulances or civil defence since yesterday and he can’t do anything about it. He’s trying to dig with his own bare hands,” she added. Israeli strikes also killed scores of people in areas such as Khan Younis, Bureij and Nuseirat. About 500 people have been injured by Israeli strikes over the past day.    Reporting from Rafah in southern Gaza, Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum said the death toll in the Maghazi strike had risen to 106.

Israel’s Netanyahu heckled inside parliament by families of Hamas captives,Prime minister booed when he promises to bring the captives home but adds that ‘more time’ needed.,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been heckled and booed by the families of captives held by Hamas in Gaza during an address to parliament. “Now! Now!” the families chanted from the gallery on Monday when Netanyahu promised to bring the captives home but added that he has been told by Israeli field commanders that “more time” was needed. “We wouldn’t have succeeded up until now to release more than 100 hostages without military pressure,” Netanyahu said. “And we won’t succeed at releasing all the hostages without military pressure.” A deal brokered in late November by the United States, Qatar and Egypt saw the release of more than 100 of theestimated 240 captivestaken to Gaza during attacks by Hamas on October 7 on southern Israel.    Israel says 129 captives are still held in Gaza. Three of them weremistakenly killedby Israeli forces this month. “We won’t stop until victory,” Netanyahu said over the cries of the protesters in parliament. The family members of the captives sat in the chamber looking down on the prime minister, holding posters of their relatives behind the Plexiglass of the gallery and intermittently interrupting him. Netanyahu’s address came after his Likud party reported that he visited the Gaza Strip on Monday and promised to ramp up Israel’s assault there. Shortly after his return, Netanyahu said the war was far from over. He said it was false media speculation that his government might end the fighting. “We’re not stopping. We’re continuing to fight, and we’re intensifying the fighting in the coming days. It’s going to be a long war that’s not close to ending,” the Israeli leader said. Israel’s Ministry of Finance said the war, which it foresees lasting through February, will likely incur an additional cost of at least $14bn in the 2024 budget. Meanwhile, about three months of Israeli bombardment has killed more than 20,674 Palestinians and wounded 54,536 – most of them women and children.

Israel denies visas to UN staff as it hits back against Gaza war criticism,Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen accuses the UN of ‘hypocrisy’ as his country faces criticism for its war tactics in Gaza.,"Israel will not renew the visa of a United Nations staff member in the country and will also deny the visa request of another UN employee as the country yet again expresses its displeasure of the global body, which has criticised Israel’s targeting of civilians and hospitals during the Gaza war. An overwhelming majority of the more than 20,000 Palestinians killed are civilians. “We will stop working with those who cooperate with the Hamas terrorist organization’s propaganda,” Eli Cohen, Israel’s minister of foreign affairs, posted on X on Monday. “We will no longer remain silent in the face of the UN’s hypocrisy!” he said. Israel has accused the UN of being biased. Cohen described the UN’s conduct as “a disgrace” since the war erupted on October 7 after Hamas carried out deadly attacks inside Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed. The UN has criticised Hamas for the October 7 attacks and repeatedly called for the release of the captives taken by the group. UN officials have criticised Israel’s targeting of residential areas, schools and hospitals and its curbs on aid deliveries during a complete siege imposed on Gaza in the wake of the October 7 attacks. More than 100 journalists, about 270 medical personnel and at least 134 UN staff have been killed in Israeli strikes. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has repeatedly called for a ceasefire and decried the dire humanitarian crisis. The UN, aid groups and rights groups have warned that Palestinians are now facing hunger. The UN chief this month invoked Article 99 of the UN Charter, a move aimed at formally warning the Security Council of a global threat posed by Israel’s war on Gaza. The UN General Assembly has overwhelmingly voted for a humanitarian ceasefire several times since the war began, but votes at the UN Security Council have been vetoed and stalled by Israel’s close ally the United States. It abstained in the vote on the latest resolution, allowing it to pass on Friday, but the measure has been criticised as“insufficient”. The Israeli foreign minister accused the UN chief, the UN human rights commissioner and the UN Women agency of legitimising “war crimes and crimes against humanity”, publishing “unsubstantiated blood libels” and ignoring the “acts of rape committed against Israeli women” for two months. But human rights organisations have also slammed Israel for its war tactics, calling it “collective punishment” of Gaza’s 2.3 million people. Media reports have also debunked Israeli claims that Hamas ran a command centre under al-Shifa Hospital, Gaza’s largest medical facility, which was crippled by Israeli shelling. Israel has justified attacks on UN schools, universities and hospitals, saying they were used by Hamas, but it has provided no proof for its claims. The latest incident is only one in aseries of instancesof Israel clashing with the UN over the war in Gaza in ways that are uncommon for member states of the global body. This month, Israel announced its decision to revoke the residence visa of Lynn Hastings, the UN humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories, who left the country last week. “Someone who did not condemn Hamas for the brutal massacre of 1,200 Israelis … but instead condemns Israel, a democratic country that protects its citizens, cannot serve in the UN and cannot enter Israel!”  Cohen wrote on X. Hastings had criticised Israeli restrictions on much-needed aid deliveries. “The conditions required to deliver aid to the people of Gaza do not exist,” she said on December 4. “If possible, an even more hellish scenario is about to unfold, one in which humanitarian operations may not be able to respond,” she said, referring to the resumption of Israel’s bombardment on Gaza at the end of a one-week pause in fighting between Israel and Hamas. On October 25, Israel’s ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, warned that his country would refuse visas to UN officials after Guterres criticised Israel for ordering civilians to evacuate from northern Gaza to southern Gaza and said Hamas’s attacks on Israel did “not happen in a vacuum”. “I am shocked by the misrepresentations by some of my statement … as if I was justifying acts of terror by Hamas. This is false. It was the opposite,” Guterres said without mentioning Israel’s name.    Besides denying visas and accusing the UN chief of being unfit to run the agency, Cohen alsosaidthis month that he had instructed the Israeli mission to the UN to oppose the advancement of the annual budget of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA). The agency has repeatedly warned that aid work in Gaza is at a breaking point as the Israeli siege continues. Israel imposed a total siege in the wake of October 7 attacks, cutting off electricity, water and food. The Palestinian enclave has been called an “open air prison” due to Israel’s land, air and sea blockade imposed since 2007. UNRWA has taken in about 1.2 million civilians – two-thirds of all displaced people in Gaza – in its shelters across the strip. Since the war began, more than 100 UNRWA staff have been killed and over 40 of the agency’s buildings in Gaza have been damaged in Israeli strikes. Last week, Cohen accused the agency of perpetuating “the conflict” and called on countries of the world to “stop years of turning a blind eye to the incitement to terrorism and Hamas’s cynical use of the agency’s facilities and the residents of the Gaza Strip as human shields.” Israel has also repeatedly targeted Francesca Albanese, the UN’s special rapporteur for the occupied Palestinian territories, who has criticised Israel for violating international laws and occupying Palestinian territories. World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has also been attacked for what Israel said was publishing inaccurate reports. Israel has not provided proof for its claims. In October, Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, Meirav Eilon Shahar, told reporters that her country had been “let down” by the global body, saying its agency chiefs had not done enough to condemn Hamas and growing anti-Semitism. “We’ve shared information quite widely, and we do expect the international community and international organisations, including WHO but not only, to condemn Hamas for using these protected facilities [such as hospitals] for military use,” she said. Guterres has reiterated that “the grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the appalling attacks by Hamas.” “And those appalling attacks cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/25/israel-denies-visas-to-un-staff-as-it-hits-back-against-gaza-war-criticism
Israeli air strike in Syria kills top Iranian military adviser,Sayyed Razi Mousavi was responsible for coordinating the military alliance between Syria and Iran.,"An Israeli air strike outside the Syrian capital of Damascus has killed a senior adviser in Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), according to reports from Iranian state media. Sayyed Razi Mousavi, one of the top IRGC commanders in Syria, was killed on Monday. He was responsible for coordinating the military alliance between Syria and Iran, an important part of Iran’s regional network of allies andproxiesknown as the “Axis of Resistance”. Mousavi “was killed during an attack by the Zionist regime a few hours ago in Zeinabiyah district in the suburbs of Damascus,” Iran’s official IRNA news agency reported, using a different name for Sayyida Zeinab south of the Syrian capital. In a statement read on state TV, the IRGC said that the “usurper and savage Zionist regime will pay for this crime”.    Iran’s state television interrupted its regular news broadcast to announce that Mousavi had been killed, describing him as one of the most experienced IRGC advisers in Syria. The strike comes amid fears that Israel’s war with the Palestinian armed group Hamas in Gaza could expand into a wider regional conflict, pulling in Iran-backed groups such asHezbollahin southern Lebanon. “Mousavi is one of the oldest IRGC commanders in Syria and Lebanon, he’s been functioning in this area since the 80s,” Al Jazeera correspondent Ali Hashem reported from southern Lebanon. “According to our sources, Mousavi was the target of several assassination attempts by Israel. However, this was the time when the assassination attempt succeeded. The Israelis accuse him of being an instrumental figure within the network of arms smuggling from Iran to Syria, to Iraq to Syria, and to end with Hezbollah in Lebanon, and also as very influential within what Iran calls the Axis of Resistance,” Hashem added. Reports from IRNA said that Mousavi was “among those accompanyingQassem Soleimani,” the head of the IRGC’s elite Quds Force, who was killed in a United States drone attack in Iraq in 2020. Soleimani had played a central role in the coordination of Iran’s regional activities. Iranian media reported that PresidentEbrahim Raisicalled the strike “a sign of the Zionist regime’s frustration and weakness in the region for which it will certainly pay the price”. There was no immediate comment from Israel’s military, but Barak Ravid, a reporter for US news site Axios, quotes an unnamed Israeli official who says that Israel is preparing for retaliation that could include rocket fire from Syria and Lebanon. The US and Israel have for years carried out attacks against what they describe asIran-linked targetsin Syria, where Tehran’s influence has grown since it backed PresidentBashar al-Assadin the war that erupted in Syria in 2011. Earlier this month, Iran said Israeli strikes had killed two IRGC members in Syria who had served as military advisers there.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/25/israeli-air-strike-in-syria-kills-top-iranian-general
Egypt sets out ambitious Israel-Gaza ceasefire plan,Israel’s divided war cabinet to discuss proposal. Hamas reported to reject suggestion of sharing power in Gaza.,"Egypt has presented what is described as an ambitious plan to end the war in Gaza with a ceasefire. The proposal, which was presented to Israel, Hamas, the United States and European governments on Monday would see Israel fully withdraw from the Gaza Strip, all captives held by Hamas, and many Palestinian prisoners, freed, and a united technocratic Palestinian government installed in the enclave. The proposal, developed with the Gulf state of Qatar, includes several rounds of captive and prisoner exchanges, reports Al Jazeera’s Bernard Smith from Tel Aviv. In the first phase, Hamas would free all civilian captives in return for the release of Palestinian prisoners over a truce of 7-10 days. During the second stage, Hamas would release all female Israeli soldiers in return for more Palestinian prisoners, taking place during another weeklong truce. In the final phase, the warring parties would engage in “a month of negotiations to discuss the release of all military personnel held by Hamas in exchange for a lot more [Palestinian] prisoners and Israel pulling back to Gaza’s borders”, said Smith. Close to 8,000 Palestinians are held by Israel on security-related charges or convictions, according to Palestinian figures. Throughout the ceasefire, Egypt would also lead talks to reunite Palestinian factions Hamas and the Palestinian Authority, who would then jointly appoint a government of experts to run the West Bank and Gaza, ahead of future elections,reportsThe Times of Israel. The plan appears to be preliminary, and there are already suggestions that it could struggle to gain traction with either side. Israel’s war cabinet was due to discuss the proposal on Monday, even as its military continued pounding Gazaover the Christmas holiday, killing at least 100 Palestinians within 12 hours.    Experts noted that the cabinet, which has been under intense pressure to bring home the remaining captives, is divided and may struggle to accept some of the deal’s terms. “One challenge is a ceasefire versus a truce,” Mohammed Cherkaoui, a professor of conflict resolution at George Mason University, told Al Jazeera. “Palestinians are talking about a full-fledged ceasefire. The Israelis are hearing a ‘truce,’ a pause.” Cherkaoui added that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would also have to pull back from its stated mission of eradicating Hamas. “On the one hand [Netanyahu] is still negotiating with Hamas indirectly, but at the same time his main dream is to eradicate Hamas.” “He lives in two separate worlds and he needs to unify them,” said Cherkaoui. A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the Associated Press that Netanyahu and his hawkish government were unlikely to accept the full proposal. Meanwhile, Reuters reported that Hamas and the allied Islamic Jihad have rejected the proposal that they relinquish power in the Gaza Strip, quoting Egyptian security sources. But later a Hamas official denied rejecting the Egyptian deal. Izzat al-Risheq, a member of Hamas’s political bureau, said in a statement that the group had “no knowledge” of the information published in the Reuters report.    Israel is entering its12th weekof a devastating air and ground campaign in Gaza that has killed more than 20,400 Palestinians, including 8,200 children. Air strikes have wrecked much of the besieged enclave, taking out entire blocks and neighbourhoods, anddisplaced1.9 million Palestinians who now live in “catastrophic” conditions with little food, water and medicine, the United Nations warns.

Pope decries ‘appalling harvest’ of civilian deaths in Gaza,"In Christmas message, Pope Francis says Israeli strikes are reaping an ‘appalling harvest’ of innocent civilians.","Israel’s bombardment of Gaza is reaping an “appalling harvest” of innocent civilians, Pope Francis said in his Christmas message. In his Christmas Day “Urbi et Orbi” (to the city and world) address on Monday, the head of the Catholic Church also called the October 7 attack on Israel by Hamas “abominable” and again appealed for the release of about 100 hostages still being held in Gaza, as he appealed for an end to hostilities. Speaking from the central balcony of St Peter’s Basilica to thousands of people in the square below, the 87-year-old Francis called for an end to conflicts, political, social or military, in places including Ukraine, Syria, Yemen, Lebanon, Armenia and Azerbaijan, and he defended the rights of migrants around the world. “How, many innocents are being slaughtered in our world! In their mothers’ wombs, in odysseys undertaken in desperation and in search of hope, in the lives of all those little ones whose childhood has been devastated by war. They are the little Jesuses of today,” he said. He gave particular attention to the Holy Land, including Gaza. Overnight on Christmas Eve,Israeli air raids killed at least 78 peoplein one of the besieged enclave’s deadliest nights of Israel’s 11-week-old battle with Hamas, according to Palestinian health officials. “May it [peace] come in Israel and Palestine, where war is devastating the lives of those peoples. I embrace them all, particularly the Christian communities of Gaza and the entire Holy Land,” Francis said.    “I plead for an end to the military operations with their appalling harvest of innocent civilian victims, and call for a solution to thedesperate humanitarian situationby an opening to the provision of humanitarian aid,” he said. Last week, a United Nations-backed body said in a report that the entire 2.3 million population of Gaza was facingcrisis levels of hungerand that the risk of famine was increasing every day. The Vatican, which has diplomatic relations with both Israel and the Palestinian Authority, believes a two-state solution is the only answer to the long-running conflict. Francis called for “persevering dialogue between the parties, sustained by strong political will and the support of the international community”. Dedicating an entire paragraph of his message to the weapons trade, Francis said: “And how can we even speak of peace, when arms production, sales and trade are on the rise?” He called for more investigation of the armaments trade. “It should be talked about and written about, so as to bring to light the interests and the profits that move the puppet strings of war,” he said. Israel has pounded the Gaza Strip since the cross-border attack by Hamas on October 7, killing at least 20,424 Palestinians, mostly women and children, and injuring 54,036 others, according to local health authorities. About 1,140 people were killed in Israel in the Hamas attack. The Israeli onslaught has left Gaza in ruins, with half of the coastal territory’s housing damaged or destroyed and nearly two million people displaced within the densely populated enclave amid shortages of food, clean water and medicines.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/25/pope-decries-gazas-appalling-harvest-of-civilian-deaths
‘Massacre’ as Israel steps up Gaza bombardment for Christmas,The attack is one of the deadliest of the nearly three-month-long war.,"More than 100 people have been killed in Israeli air raids overnight in central Gaza. At least 70 people were killed in strikes in central Gaza’s Maghazi refugee camp, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said late on Sunday. Attacks on the Bureij refugee camp saw the number of casualties rise to more than 100. Health Ministry spokesperson Ashraf al-Qudra said the death toll at the Maghazi refugee camp was likely to rise. “What is happening at the Maghazi camp is a massacre that is being committed on a crowded residential square,” he said. Bodies have been piling up at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. Dozens more are reported to be injured, and several houses have been destroyed in the attack. Families have been digging through the rubble in an attempt to find survivors. The bombs fell on homes and buildings, reported Hani Mahmoud from Rafah in southern Gaza, destroying neighbourhoods and infrastructure, such as roads leading in and out of the refugee camps. With the Bureij refugee camp also pounded overnight, some 100 people have been killed in the last 12 hours, he added. The vast majority of the victims are women and children. “We were all targeted,” said Ahmad Turokmani, who lost several family members, including his daughter and grandson. “There is no safe place in Gaza anyway.”    Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from Rafah in southern Gaza, said the Maghazi refugee camp is one of the most densely populated areas in the middle of the Gaza Strip. He said it was one of the places the Israeli military had previously told the Palestinians in Gaza to evacuate to. Now the camp has been “completely flattened”, he said. “The vast majority of the casualties right now have been among civilians, including [a] two weeks [old] baby that has been killed in cold blood in this genocide,” said Azzoum. He compared the attack with one on theJabalia refugee campin northern Gaza last week, in which at least 90 people were killed. The Maghazi camp wasattacked last monthas well when at least 50 Palestinians were killed. Azzoum said the camp’s surrounding areas had been subjected to intense Israeli shelling in the last couple of days. The nearest hospital to the camp is Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital but health facilities have been rendered non-functional across Gaza as Israel continues to bombard the territory for a third month, killing more than 20,400 Palestinians since October 7 and displacing more than 80 percent of the 2.3 million people who live there. “The entire medical care system in Gaza Strip is deteriorating and [is] on the edge of collapse,” said Azzoum. Hamas called the air attack on the Maghazi camp “a horrific massacre” and said it was “a new war crime”. Israel’s military spokesperson’s office said it was looking into reports of the attack. Since theUN Security Council resolutionpassed on Friday, boosting aid to Gaza, the scale of air raids has only increased in magnitude, Mahmoud noted. “There is a huge gap between the sheer level of destruction being caused by Israeli forces and the promise of more aid,” he remarked.

Iran dismisses US accusations of tanker attack off India,"The US accusations are meant to ‘distract’ from Washington’s complicity in Israel’s ‘crimes in Gaza’, Iran’s FM says.","Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has dismissed accusations of the United States that Tehran struck a chemical tanker in the Indian Ocean, as tension rises globally over threats to maritime shipping. A spokesperson for the ministry dismissed the accusation out of hand at a news conference on Monday. He asserted that the US claim that an Iran-launched drone had hit a Japanese-owned tanker as it sailed near India was false. Global trade has been hit hard as Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have launched a flurry of attacks on ships in the Red Sea. The Houthis say the campaign, targeting what they say are Israeli-linked vessels, is intended to force Israel to halt its bombardment of Gaza. “We declare these claims as completely rejected and worthless,” said Nasser Kanaani when asked about the US accusation. “Such claims are aimed at projecting, distracting public attention, and covering up for the full support of the American government for the crimes of the Zionist regime [Israel] in Gaza,” he added. The attack on Saturday hit the MV Chem Pluto, a Japanese-owned tanker travelling 200 nautical miles (370km) off the coast of India, according to the US Pentagon. The tanker was “Israel-affiliated” and had been on its way from Saudi Arabia to India, reported maritime security firm Ambrey. Amid the recent spate of maritime assaults, it is the first that the US has sought to directly pin on Iran. It is also the first on a vessel outside the Red Sea.    The US, which is leading a global task force to counter the Houthi threat, has repeatedlyaccusedIran of being “deeply involved”. However, Iran insists that it is not coordinating with the Houthis and plays no role in the attacks. “The resistance [Houthis] has its own tools … and acts in accordance with its own decisions and capabilities,” Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Ali Bagheritoldthe Mehr news agency on Saturday. “The fact that certain powers, such as the Americans and the Israelis, suffer strikes from the resistance movement … should in no way call into question the reality of the strength of the resistance in the region,” he added. Amid the tension, Iran’s navy has taken delivery of long-range cruise missiles as well as reconnaissance helicopters, according to the country’s state media.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/25/iran-dismisses-us-claim-it-hit-tanker-near-india
Israel hits Bethlehem in Christmas raids on occupied West Bank,Dozens have been arrested as Israeli forces stormed Jenin and areas around Nablus.,"Christmas day in the occupied West Bank began with an attack on the Jenin refugee camp and several arrests. The raid on Monday morning followed several others across the territory, which saw dozens of arrests and the shooting in the neck of a 17-year-old boy. Among towns hit was Bethlehem. Jenin, commonly viewed as a symbol of Palestinian resistance to occupation, has been repeatedlytargetedby Israeli forces since its war with Hamas in Gaza began on October 7. On Monday, the Jenin-based Freedom Theatre, a popular symbol of peace and hope that was recently raided and vandalised by Israeli soldiers, described how Israeli forces lit up the sky “with flare bombs” whilst raiding the camp. Christmas Day begins with another attack on Jenin Refugee Camp, as the Israeli army lights up the sky with Flare bombs. 25.12.23#MaydayCreated by@freedom_theatre&@artistfrontline#Jenin#JeninUnderAttack#Palestine#Theatre#جنينpic.twitter.com/u44NnedJUg — The Freedom Theatre (@freedom_theatre)December 25, 2023  Reporting from the Jenin refugee camp, Al Jazeera’s Imran Khan said that the Israeli army raided at least 10 houses saying they were looking for Palestinians to arrest. However, no detentions were made. “Israeli forces did call for Palestinian fighters to come out and give themselves up but that didn’t happen either. Residents are telling us that this is simply a campaign of harassment,” Khan said. “Jenin refugee camp is now the most raided camp in the occupied West Bank. The Israeli forces are destroying any symbol of resistance or nationalism in the camp.” While the raids in the camp and Jenin region have now reportedly ended, at least nine young men were arrested in the al-Jalama village, northeast of Jenin. Regions in and near Nablus, Jericho, Ramallah and Bethlehem – which Christians believe is the birthplace of Jesus Christ – were also raided overnight by Israeli forces, Al Jazeera’s Hamdah Salhut reported. In the village of Burqa, northwest of the city of Nablus in the occupied West Bank, Israeli forces arrested at least 20 people, including senior citizens. Moreover, Palestinian news agency Wafa said that a 17-year-old boy was injured after he was hit in the neck when Israeli forces fired live ammunition during a raid in the town of Aqaba, north of Tubas. Wafa reported that Israeli forces also arrested another resident of Tubas before withdrawing from the town. The West Bank has seen surging violence and arrests in parallel to Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip which has killed more than 20,000 Palestinians. Israel says it is targeting Hamas in Gaza, but the violence in the West Bank is taking place despite Hamas having limited presence in the territory. Israeli incursions into the West Bank have killed at least 303 Palestinians since October 7. In addition to the activities of Israel’s military, attacks byIsraeli settlersare also on the rise. At least 700,000 Israeli settlers live in illegal, fortified, Jewish-only settlements across the West Bank and East Jerusalem, the majority of which were built either entirely or partially on private Palestinian land. Attacks, which have increased exponentially over the past three months, include shootings, stabbings, rock throwing and beatings, as well as arson and serious damage to homes, vehicles and agricultural land. The United Nationsnotedthat “in nearly half of all incidents, Israeli forces were either accompanying or actively supporting the attackers”. Rights groups, Palestinians, and some in the international community have slammed Israel for not doing enough to stop settler violence. Earlier this month, countries like Belgium and the United Statesannouncedthey would impose visa restrictions on “extremist” Israeli settlers involved in undermining peace, security or stability in the occupied West Bank. At a cabinet meeting on Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu’s government ratified a decision to assign $21m to support new settlements in the occupied West Bank.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/25/israel-intensifies-occupied-west-bank-raids-on-christmas-day
Analysis: Has the US-led Red Sea force calmed shippers amid Houthi attacks?,"Maersk will resume shipping through the Red Sea but concerns remain. Meanwhile, France, Spain and Italy have dropped out of the force.","The United States-ledmultinational naval forcethat was to protect and secure maritime traffic through the Red Sea from attacks by Yemeni Houthi rebels appears significantly weakened – even if not quite dead in the water – before it ever sailed together. Less than a week after the announcement of Operation Prosperity Guardian (OPG), France, Italy and Spain have pulled out of the nearly fully-created force touted to include warships from more than 10 nations. The decision to cobble together what is essentially an anti-Houthi coalition was almost forced on Washington. In early November, a US destroyer shot down several missiles fired from Yemen but the US tried to maintain a business-as-usual pose and not advertise that it was engaging the Yemeni group. As long as thecombative Houthistried, unsuccessfully, to lob missiles at Israel, a country attacking Yemeni’s Arab and Muslim brethren, the US could maintain that the whole affair was not a serious regional escalation. But when their repeated attacks on ships headed to and from the Suez Canal threatened the security of international maritime routes, the US was forced to act. The US Navy already has a huge number of ships in the region, so why would it need to ask friendly nations to contribute more? One reason is that even with such a large force, the US cannot spare many ships for the task. The other is political unwillingness to be the only nation attacking Yemen as it would likely be interpreted, especially in the Middle East, as direct military action in aid of Israel. US political and military dilemmas are largely conditioned by geography and Yemen’s control of the strategically important choke point where the Indian Ocean funnels into the Red Sea. The Bab el-Mandeb passage is only 29km (16 nautical miles) wide at its narrowest point. Its approaches are bristling with warships: More than 35 from at least 12 nations that do not border the Red Sea are now in positions from which they could reach the strait in less than 24 hours. Nations along its African and Arabian shores have at least as many in their harbours. Many of these ships were already in the region before 7 October. The northwestern parts of the Indian Ocean leading into the Gulf of Aden and theBab el-Mandebare probably the most notorious pirate-infested waters of the 21st century. The civil war and breakdown of Somalia’s central government created maritime piracy on an unprecedented scale. Somali pirates venture out to sea in fast small boats, armed with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades and intercept commercial shipping heading towards and from Bab el-Mandeb in three directions: from the Far East, passing south of India; from the Gulf, sailing around the Arabian Peninsula; and north to south along African shores. Shipping companies demanded protection and the international community, aware of the need to keep shipping lanes open and secure, provided it. Every month, 200 ships cross the Suez in each direction carrying no less than 3 million containers. Since 1990, the Combined Task Force 150 (CTF-150) had been engaged in anti-piracy missions. More than 30 nations, mostly Western but also including Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Thailand, Singapore and Turkey, took part and usually kept at least four warships on station, rotating every three to four months. In 2022, a new force, the CTF-153, took over. When the latest war in Gaza started, the force was comprised of US destroyers USN Carney and USN Mason, Japanese destroyer JDS Akebono and a South Korean one, ROKS Yang Man Chun. In anticipation of the arrival of stronger assets, the US ships immediately moved into the Red Sea, and both have on several occasions intercepted Houthi missiles and drones. The US Navy hurriedly deployed two aircraft carrier task groups – which include anti-aircraft and anti-submarine cruisers and destroyers, helicopter carriers, assault ships and other offensive and defensive assets – to the wider region. It is almost certain that the White House did not immediately have a concrete action plan for involvement in the Gaza conflict, but the decision to deploy to the region naval and air power capable of taking on all potential adversaries was militarily prudent. Meanwhile, the White House also engaged in diplomacy. The US and Iran exchanged indirect statements, assuring each other they did not seek confrontation. Iran announced that it had not been informed of the October 7 Hamas attacks on Israel, and the US did everything to avoid alienating Iran. In return, Tehran nudged the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah into refraining from a full-scale offensive. The de-escalation seemed to be working. But then the Houthis, considered to be an Iranian proxy in much the same way as Hezbollah, decided to attack in the Red Sea, demanding Israel end its war on Gaza. They launched long-range missiles at Israel and naval missiles at US Navy destroyers that had entered the Red Sea. Both operations failed, with all missiles and drones being on several occasions intercepted and shot down. The US Navy was convinced that its two destroyers could handle the situation, possibly being reinforced in time by a couple more. But when tankers and container ships in the Red Sea started taking hits almost daily, the escalation was undeniable. Many of the world’s biggest shipping companies shifted from going through the Suez Canal to the longer and more expensive route around Africa. Commercial carriers now introduced a $700 surcharge on each container sailing the longer route. Counting just those laden with Asian manufactured goods heading to Europe, the additional cost is a staggering $2bn per month. That increase gets passed on to the final customers – leading to inflation. In addition, the longer travel will soon cause distribution delays, shortages and general disruption of the economy, which every nation will feel. Themarkets demanded actionand the US optimistically believed it could assemble a robust force of up to 20 participating nations to carry out Operation Prosperity Guardian. Within days, high hopes were drowned in refusals. The Pentagon believed that China, a country with major interests in keeping open the sea lanes that take its exports to Europe, would join in, especially as it already has a self-supported task force of one destroyer and one frigate in the western Indian Ocean. But Beijing replied that it had no interest in joining the OPG. Refusals also came from major Arab navies straddling Red Sea shores: Saudi Arabia and Egypt. They hinted that they did not want to be seen engaging an Arab country in this situation. The US apparently showed understanding for their position, confident that it will have no problem in attracting enough ships. Meanwhile, France, Italy and Spain have indicated they will not join a mission under US command – only if it is a European Union or NATO force. That leaves the US with the United Kingdom, Norway, the Netherlands, Greece, Canada and Australia as nations that are still, officially, on board with the OPG. Most already have ships either in the Indian Ocean or in eastern Mediterranean and could reach the Red Sea within a few days, enabling the OPG to take charge and start escorting commercial shipping before the New Year. The first reaction of the merchant marines came on Sunday when the Danish shipping major Maersk announced that its vessels would resume transit through the Red Sea under OPG escort. If OPG can provide safe passage, it would boost its support could influence conteiner companies like MSC and CGN, petroleum giant BP and others to return to the shortest route. But Maersk made it clear that it could return to the longer route around Africa depending on how safety conditions evolve. Regardless of the number of participating countries, Operation Prosperity Guardian will not be just a simple act of escorting ships through the southern Red Sea. In the last few days there have been several worrying signs of a potential major escalation that could easily open another front involving major regional actors.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/25/analysis-has-the-us-led-red-sea-force-calmed-shippers-amid-houthi-attacks
"‘Our hearts in Bethlehem’, says Pope in Christmas Eve mass, shadowed by war",The pontiff opens Christmas celebrations with a message for peace in the Holy Land amid Gaza’s deadliest-ever war.,"Pope Francis has kicked off global Christmas celebrations with a lament – that Jesus’s message of peace is being drowned out by the “futile logic of war” in the very land he was born. Israel’s deadliest-ever war on Gaza cast a shadow as the pontiff presided over the evening Mass on Sunday, attended by 6,500 people at St Peter’s Basilica at the Vatican. “Tonight, our hearts are in Bethlehem, where the Prince of Peace is once more rejected by the futile logic of war, by the clash of arms that even today prevents him from finding room in the world,” said the Catholic leader.    The 87-year-old pontiff said thereal message of Christmasis peace and love, urging people not to be obsessed with worldly success and the “idolatry of consumerism”. He spoke of “the all-too-human thread that runs through history: the quest for worldly power and might, fame and glory, which measures everything in terms of success, results, numbers and figures, a world obsessed with achievement”. “Tonight, love changes history,” he said, draped in white robes. Bethlehem, the biblical city in the occupied West Bank where Christians believe Jesus Christ was born in a manger more than 2,000 years ago,effectively cancelledthe annual Christmas celebrations that normally draw thousands of tourists. The town did away with its giant Christmas tree, marching bands and flamboyant nativity scene this year, settling for just a few festive lights. In the centre of town, a huge Palestinian flag has been unfolded with a banner declaring, “The bells of Bethlehem ring for a ceasefire in Gaza.” “A lot of people are dying for this land,” said Nicole Najjar, an 18-year-old student. “It’s really hard to celebrate while our people are dying.” Francis spoke hours after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged to fight deeper into the Palestinian enclave of Gaza after his troops endured one of the worst days of losses of their ground war. The Health Ministry in Gaza said an Israeli attack late on Sundaykilled at least 70 peoplein the Maghazi refugee camp in central Gaza and destroyed several houses. A total of at least 20,424 people, most of them women and children, have been killed in the enclave since the war began, according to the territory’s Health Ministry. “Bethlehem is celebrating Christmas with sadness and sorrow because of what’s happening in Gaza and in all the West Bank, all Palestinian territories,” said Palestinian Minister of Tourism Rula Maayah. The Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, Pierbattista Pizzaballa, arrived on Sunday at the Church of the Nativity, clad in a traditional black and white keffiyeh. “Our heart goes to Gaza, to all people in Gaza but a special attention to our Christian community in Gaza who is suffering,” he said. “We are here to pray and to ask not only for a ceasefire, a ceasefire is not enough… violence generates only violence.” Francis has made numerous appeals for a ceasefire in the conflict raging in Gaza and has called for the release of all captives. When the Christmas Eve Mass ended, the pope, pushed in a wheelchair, moved down the basilica with the life-sized statue of baby Jesus on his lap and flanked by children carrying bouquets. The statue was placed in a manger in a nativity scene in the basilica. At noon (11:00 GMT) on Monday, Francis will deliver his Christmas Day “Urbi et Orbi” (to the city and the world) message and blessing.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/24/our-hearts-in-bethlehem-pope-says-in-christmas-eve-mass-shadowed-by-war
"50,000 women pregnant in Gaza amid ‘decimation’ of its health system",WHO chief says the enclave’s infrastructure is being destroyed as UN agency warns of soaring healthcare needs.,"The United Nations estimates that around 50,000 pregnant women are currently living in Gaza, with more than 180 births taking place every day amid the “decimation” of its healthcare system. In a statement on Sunday, the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA) said its doctors and midwives “are doing everything possible to provide care for post-natal and high-risk pregnant women at the seven operational UNRWA health centres” – down from 22 before the bloodiest-ever Israeli assault on Gaza began. Also on Sunday, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) decried the “decimation” of Gaza’s health system while commending health professionals there for continuing to work under extreme circumstances. “The decimation of the Gaza health system is a tragedy,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus posted on X, formerly Twitter. “In the face of constant insecurity and inflows of wounded patients, we see doctors, nurses, ambulance drivers and more continue striving to save lives,” he added, reiterating calls for an immediate ceasefire.

At the same time, hospitals, protected under international humanitarian law, have repeatedly been hit by Israeli strikes since the war erupted. As of December 20, the WHO registered 246 Israeli attacks on healthcare infrastructure in Gaza, including hospitals and ambulances. Earlier this week, WHO described“unbearable” scenesof largely abandoned patients begging for food and water after its teams visited two badly damaged hospitals in northern Gaza where the war is the bloodiest. The UN body said only nine out of 36 hospitals were partially functional in the whole of the besieged territory – none in the north – asIsrael continued to target medical facilities. Around 80 percent of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents have been displaced to southern Gaza, with tens of thousands crammed in UN schools or shielding against the cold in makeshift tents. At least 20,424 Palestinians have been killed in the 11-week war – 166 in the past 24 hours, according to officials in Gaza. Tens of thousands are wounded while many bodies remain trapped under rubble.   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/24/50000-women-pregnant-in-gaza-amid-decimation-of-its-health-system
Iran summons Russia’s envoy again over islands dispute,This is the second time the Russian envoy to Tehran is being summoned over the same issue.,"Tehran, Iran –Iran has once more summoned the Russian envoy to Tehran after Moscow signed another joint statement with Arab nations calling for negotiations over three disputed islands that the United Arab Emirates claims as its own. The Russian envoy was summoned to the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to receive Tehran’s “strong protest” over the statement, the state-run IRNA news website said late on Saturday. At the Foreign Ministry, the Russian envoy was reportedly told that respect for the territorial integrity of nations is a fundamental tenet in relations between any two countries. IRNA also said the official was told the three disputed islands “forever belong to Iran” which renders anyoutside claimsunacceptable. The islands in the strategic Strait of Hormuz, namely the Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa, have been governed by Iran since 1971 when its navy took control of them after British troops withdrew from what is today the UAE. The UAE claims them as part of its territory as well and has recently received increasing support on them from Russia and China, which Tehran also counts among its allies.  Iran had summoned theChinese envoyto Tehran over a similar joint statement with Arab nations of the region in December 2022 and had also summoned theRussian ambassadorin July over an almost identical joint statement. Russia’s joint statement this week, signed during the sixth edition of the Russian-Arab Cooperation Forum in Morocco, supported “peaceful solutions and initiatives aiming to resolve the conflict through bilateral negotiations or the International Court of Justice, according to international law and the UN Charter”. The Foreign Ministry spokesman, Nasser Kanaani, had condemned it earlier this week, and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian raised the issue with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, who had led the delegation to Morocco. The Iranian Foreign Ministry said Lavrov told Amirabdollahian that Russia has always respected Iran’s territorial integrity and “this official policy by Moscow must never be doubted”. Maybe Russia should talk to Japan? The joint statement also irked some Iranian lawmakers, who took to social media to try to make it clear that the issue is non-negotiable. Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, Iran’s parliament speaker, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, that increasinglywarming tieswith Russia are based on mutual respect and any claims that threaten Iran’s territorial integrity will be met with a “serious response”. “Russia must be careful about the West taking advantage of its mistakes,” he wrote. Ghalibaf also pointed out that Iran has not remained idle on the islands, and has been undertaking a variety of efforts topopulate and developthem. He promised that the parliament would legally back efforts to develop the islands. Other lawmakers had harsher words for both Moscow and Abu Dhabi. “It looks like the language of kindness must change, at least with the UAE,” Hadi Beiginejad wrote on X. Another MP, Ebrahim Rezaei, said “if they suggest negotiations, then we also invite the Russians to negotiate with Japan over the Kuril Islands”, in reference to a dispute over four islands between Russia and Japan.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/24/iran-summons-russias-envoy-again-over-islands-dispute
"Sudan’s civilians pick up arms, as RSF gains and army stumbles","Young men are grabbing weapons to fight with the army, defend their cities, raising fears of deepening ethnic conflict.","When the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) called on young men to enlist last June, Zakariya Issa* went to the nearest recruitment centre. He was one of thousands of young people who trained for 10 weeks inWad Madani, a city just south of the capital Khartoum. In September, he was deployed with 500 people to fight the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a group stronger than the army and backed by the United Arab Emirates. Many of his friends and peers were killed or wounded within a couple of weeks. “I lost five of my friends,” Issa, 20, told Al Jazeera from Saudi Arabia, where he now lives. “They were more than friends. They were my brothers.” The Sudanese army and allied groups are relying on young men with little or no military training to fight as foot soldiers against the RSF. Over the past week, recruitment has picked up across River Nile State since the RSF captured Wad Madani, Sudan’s second-largest city. River Nile state is a traditionally privileged region that has produced many of the political and military elites in Sudan’s modern history. But now, army officers and figures from Sudan’s political Islamic movement, which ruled for 30 years under former autocratic president Omar al-Bashir, are calling on young men from this region to thwart the RSF. New recruits told Al Jazeera that they are motivated to pick up weapons due to the risk that the RSF could attack their cities, loot their belongings and subject women to sexual violence. Most view the RSF – which is primarily made up of tribal nomadic fighters from Sudan’s neglected province of Darfur – as invaders and occupiers. While the group has evicted thousands of people from their homes, army supporters are also exploiting ethnic undertones to recruit young men. “I picked up a gun to defend myself, my ethnic group and my homeland,” said Yaser, 21, from Shendi, a city in River Nile State where thousands of people have reportedly picked up weapons in recent days. “The RSF are not just at war with the army. They are at war with civilians,” he told Al Jazeera. ‘Cannon fodder’: Civilians arming themselves After Wad Madani fell to the RSF, civilians across eastern and northern Sudan were devastated. The city was a haven for internally displaced people who fled Khartoum and surrounding towns earlier in the war. They are now on the move again. “People mostly think that thearmy can’t protect themnow,” said Suleiman al-Sadig,* a lawyer from Atbara, a city in River Nile State. Recent RSF advances have compounded the panic. Photos and videos surfacing across social media show what appear to be children and young men arming themselves in River Nile State. According to residents and journalists, some of those recruits have gone to Wad Madani to fight the RSF, while others are staying behind in case of an attack. The video from Al Matama shows SAF commanders arming kids/teens. At least they look like kids to me. This is both insane and negligent on so many levels.#KeepEyesOnSudanpic.twitter.com/JelIxVwdT6 — s🌻 (@justshayxo)December 21, 2023  “The calls to get armed are not coming from the army. They’re mostly coming from civilians themselves,“ al-Sadig, told Al Jazeera. Sulieman Baldo, the founder of the Sudan Transparency and Policy Tracker think tank, believes arming young men is irresponsible. “For me, these young recruits are really cannon fodder for ideological reasons,” he told Al Jazeera. “Sudan’s [political] Islamic movement is pushing for this kind of mobilisation in areas that are beyond the RSF’s control.” In one photo on social media, which Al Jazeera could not independently verify, one of the young recruits is seencapturedby the RSF and tied to the windshield of a car. A former soldier, who is in close contact with officers in the army, added that new recruits are often the first people to die in battle. “They have no combat or military background and they just carry weapons. They die quickly,” he told Al Jazeera. Ethnic targeting Over the last two decades, River Nile State has attracted many young men from Arab and non-Arab tribes in search of work and stability. Many were uprooted by the state-backed Arab tribal militias – later repackaged as the RSF – which crushed a mostly non-Arab rebellion in Darfur in 2003. These young men are now being accused of spying on behalf of the RSF based on their ethnicity and tribal affiliations. According to local monitors, many have been arrested, tortured and even killed by military intelligence and by civilians carrying arms in northeastern cities. On December 19, Zeinab Noon* spoke with her male cousins who are all between the ages of 16 and 20. They told her that they captured RSF spies in Shendi. “[They said] they’re torturing them, so there is a sense of paranoia,” Noon, who lives outside of Sudan, told Al Jazeera. “I don’t think they know [for sure if they’re really spies].” The Darfur Network for Human Rights (DNHR), a local monitoring group, said in astatementthat these attacks are “linked to incitement to ethnic violence” in River Nile cities. Jawhara Kanu, a Sudanese expert with the United States Institute for Peace, said that the ethnically targeted attacks risk pushing vulnerable people from Darfur and Kordofan, a province in central Sudan, into the arms of the RSF. “These people are going to find themselves in a situation where they are going to be tortured [by parties aligned] with SAF unless they choose to join the RSF for protection.” Ending the war Despite growing calls to bear arms, some activists are pushing for an end to the war and for young men not to fight. So far, their efforts appear to be in vain, according to al-Sadig from Atbara. He said that there was a protest held in his city on December 23. Young men were demanding that the governor arm them, so that they could defend their city and join the army in battles across the country. RSF abuses in Wad Madani are also fuelling calls for mobilisation. More than 300,000 people are fleeing the city, mostly on foot. RSF fighters are also reportedly looting cars, hospitals, homes and markets,adding to a hunger crisis. In one video circulating on social media and which Al Jazeera could not independently verify, an RSF fighterdeclaresthat it is “his right” to rape women in cities he conquers. Al-Sadig says that news of abuses travels wide and is terrifying civilians in the River Nile region. “Every single day, young men are being told by people in their community that the RSF is going to come and get you and that they will take your homes, kill your children and rape your women,” he told Al Jazeera. Non-violent activists like al-Sadig hope that the war will stop soon. On December 22, local mediareportedthat top army chief Abdel Fatah al-Burhan had agreed to sit down with RSF leader Mohamad Hamdan “Hemedti” Dagalo. While an agreement could spare Sudan further bloodshed, al-Sadig is waiting to see where the RSF attacks next. He told Al Jazeera that he will pick up a weapon if he has to. “I don’t want to pick up arms. But if the RSF targets my home, or my children or my wife, then of course I will defend them,” he said. *Some names have been changed for safety reasons.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/24/sudans-civilians-pick-up-arms-as-rsf-gains-and-army-stumbles
"Israeli strikes kill UN staff, more than 70 of his extended family in Gaza","Issam Al Mughrabi, his wife and children killed along with more than 70 of his family members, the UN says.","A United Nations official has been killed along with more than 70 members of his extended family in an Israeli air strike near Gaza City, as hundreds of people have been killed in intensified bombardment since Friday’s UN Security Councilresolutionthat has been criticised as “woefully insufficient”. Issam Al Mughrabi, 56, who worked for the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for three decades was killed along with his wife and children in an Israeli air strike on Friday. “For almost 30 years, Issam has worked with UNDP through our Programme of Assistance to the Palestinian People,” UNDP administrator Achim Steiner said in astatement. “The loss of Issam and his family has deeply affected us all. The UN and civilians in Gaza are not a target.” Offering his condolences to Issam’s family and colleagues the World Health Organization’s chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus stressed in a post on X that “humanitarians should never be victims” and called for a ceasefire. So saddened by this tragedy@ASteiner. My deepest condolences to all who knew and loved Issam and his family, you and everyone at@UNDP. Humanitarians should never be victims. We need a#CeasefireNOWin#Gaza.https://t.co/E2r6BCQSBlhttps://t.co/C7NuyHSLcG — Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (@DrTedros)December 23, 2023  Since Israel’s war on Gaza began on October 7, 136 staff members of the UN have been killed. On Friday, the international agency’s secretary-general Antonio Guterres said that throughout the UN’s history, they had never witnessed the death of their staff in such large numbers. “Most of our staff have been forced from their homes,” he added in a post on X, paying tribute to UN members working in Gaza. The death of the veteran UN staff member and his family members comes as Israeli air strikes continue to kill hundreds of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. In the early hours of Sunday, a 13-year-old child was also killed by an Israeli drone near El Amal Hospital in Khan Younis, according to the Palestine Red Crescent Society. More than 8,000 children have been killed in Gaza since the Israel-Hamas war began on October 7. Gaza’s Ministry of Health said thatat least 166 Palestinianswere killed in the past 24 hours in Gaza. Reporting from Rafah in southern Gaza, Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud said that Saturday overnight, more residential areas in Deir el-Balah city, where people from places such as the Bureij and Nuseirat refugee camps were ordered to evacuate, came under heavy bombardment, and homes were destroyed. He said the eastern side of the Gaza Strip was also experiencing fierce airstrikes. “As of now, the search for people under the rubble is ongoing,” Hani said. Meanwhile, Al Jazeera’s Alan Fisher highlighted how it has also been a difficult weekend for the Israeli army in Gaza, with five soldiers killed on Friday and eight on Saturday, due to fierce fighting in the Strip. “You’ve heard from the Israelis suggesting that in northern Gaza, they had military control. The fact that they are still losing soldiers, that rockets are still being fired from Gaza towards Israel, would suggest that they don’t have that control and that means that this phase of the war is likely to go on for longer,” Fisher said, reporting from Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank. On Friday, the UN passed a resolution after days of delays that watered down the language. It called for aid delivery but could not agree on a ceasefire. Aid groups say the relentless bombardment and the fierce fighting between the Israeli army and Hamas have impeded aid delivery in the besieged enclave where people are facing hunger. “The real problem is that the way Israel is conducting this offensive is creating massive obstacles to the distribution of humanitarian aid inside Gaza,” UN chief Guterres said. “An effective aid operation in Gaza requires security, staff who can work in safety, logistical capacity, and the resumption of commercial activity. These four elements do not exist,” he added. UNRWA director Thomas White shared similar concerns and highlighted that conditions on the ground for aid workers should be secure, for aid deliveries to be carried out. “We need a ceasefire that will stop the killing of civilians and destruction of civilian infrastructure in Gaza,” he said.

"What are Palestine’s unique Christmas rituals, disrupted by Israel’s war?",This year’s Christmas will have rubble-laden mangers and silent processions amid the war between Israel and Hamas.,"Through carols, cookies and Christmas lights, December 25 is marked by jubilation and celebration of the birth of Jesus for more than 2 billion Christians worldwide. However, a silent night falls on the 50,000Christians in Palestine– a number that is in rapid decline. The safety of Christians in Palestine was shaken by the bombardment of Gaza’s oldest Greek OrthodoxChurch of Saint Porphyriusin October, which killed at least 18 people including children. Israeli forces alsoshot and killedan elderly Christian mother and her daughter in a Catholic church in Gaza on Saturday. This year, the many gleeful rituals that characterise Christmas in Palestine will be replaced by simpler ceremonies, mourning and prayer, shining a harsh light on the current reality of the region. The Lutheran Church, for instance, has the Baby Jesus in amanger of rubbleand destruction. Many Christian schools of thought believe that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in the now Israeli-occupied West Bank. “Jesus was born on our side ofthe wall,” Palestinian pastor Reverend Munther Isaac told Al Jazeera. Isaac added that the narrative of the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem is backed by archaeology as well as scripture such as Luke’s Gospel. “It’s the year 2023, and you’ve got, on Christmas day, all over the world, millions of, so many, hundreds of millions, if not more, of Christians going to church, reading about Bethlehem, singing about Bethlehem and thinking maybe of Bethlehem as a mythical place, as a fairytale, not realising it’s a real place with people, with a Christian community that has kept the tradition alive for 2,000 years.” “While the family of Jesus lived in Nazareth back then, they travelled from Nazareth to Bethlehem for that [census] registration,” Isaac narrated, with thoughtful pauses between his sentences. Isaac drew parallels between the story of the birth of Jesus and the current situation in Palestine. “We’ve always been under empires. We’ve always been displaced,” said Isaac, explaining that Jesus was born when Palestine was under the Roman empire. An imperial decree of the empire ordered the family of Jesus to register for the census in Bethlehem, added Reverend Mitri Raheb, another Palestinian pastor from Bethlehem. King Herod ordered the massacre of infant boys, leading to the family of Jesus escaping to Egypt as refugees, explained Isaac. According to the Bible, Jesus was born in Bethlehem and then placed in a manger. The Church of Nativity was built at this location and its grotto holds great religious significance, pulling Christians from all over the world into the city of Bethlehem every Christmas.  One of the most important Christmas rituals in Palestine is the procession of the patriarch from Jerusalem. This procession takes place on December 24 for Catholics andJanuary 6for Orthodox patriarchs. The designated procession route that has been followed throughout the Ottoman Empire and the British mandate is now engraved in tradition, Isaac explained. The patriarch is received from Jerusalem in Bethlehem and then the procession walks through the streets of the old town in Bethlehem until it reaches the Church of Nativity, where prayers are held. Israeli authorities and Palestinian police escort the procession, depending on the territory the procession passes through. The arrival of the procession is a celebrated festivity, welcomed by several scout groups and musical bands from all over Palestine. People leave their homes to walk around the city and witness the spirit of Christmas. This year, the bands and scouts will not be present, instead, the procession will be silent. Once the procession reaches the church, prayers begin at 5pm local time and last until midnight, with the midnight mass being broadcast for the world to see, Raheb said. The Manger Square in Bethlehem is also decorated with a large Christmas tree and performances are held there. This year, there is no Christmas tree at Manger Square. Instead, “the civil society and some artists are working on a new kind of crib that is made out of rubble as a sign to what’s happening in Gaza”, said Raheb. He added that a video will be screened on the wall of the Nativity Church, showing what is happening in Gaza. As a child, Isaac would excitedly visit Jerusalem with his parents for Christmas shopping. Several markets sell festive clothes and decorations for the holiday season. It is a tradition to buy the best clothes from Jerusalem and save them for Christmas. “You know how in America you go to a big mall? We used to go to Jerusalem. We can’t any more,” Isaac said, alluding to the stringentpermit rulesin the region, which constrict the mobility of Palestinians. Christmas is a time when families meet, in Palestine and elsewhere. While family could mean a small group of immediate relatives in the West, “When I say ‘family’ in Bethlehem, I say all 200 or so members of the Isaac family in our town – the clan,” said Isaac. After an initial large gathering of all family members, individual homes are visited. Feasts of rice and meat are enjoyed and homemade desserts and delicacies are exchanged. These include ka’ek, or ma’amoul – semolina shortbread cookies filled with dates or nuts. Large Christmas trees are a cynosure in every church, where parties and banquets are organised. This year, the parties have been cancelled and “no one is in the mood to … decorate a Christmas tree”, Isaac said. Isaac explained that Christmas is a national holiday for all Palestinians, not just a Christian holiday. The Palestinian Authority considers it a national holiday and government offices are typically closed on Christmas day. Several Palestinian Muslims visit Bethlehem on Christmas to attend the parade and take pictures with the Christmas tree. “Jesus was from Bethlehem, after all. And this means a lot to us as Palestinians,” said Isaac.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/24/what-are-palestines-unique-christmas-rituals-disrupted-by-israels-war
"US says Houthi drones shot down, as UK brands Iran ‘malign influence’",UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron says escalating attacks by Iran-backed groups cannot be tolerated.,"The United States has announced that it shot down four drones launched by Yemen’s Houthis, as the United Kingdom’s top diplomat branded the rebel group’s ally Iran a “malign influence”. The USS Laboon guided-missile destroyer downed the drones as they were travelling towards the vessel and there were no injuries or damage, US Central Command (CENTCOM) said on Saturday. The USS Laboon also responded to distress calls from a Norwegian-flagged oil tanker and an Indian-flagged crude oil tanker that came under attack. “These attacks represent the 14th and 15th attacks on commercial shipping by Houthi militants since October 17,” CENTCOM said in a post on X. The Houthis also fired two anti-ship ballistic missiles into international shipping lanes in the Southern Red Sea but no vessels were hit in the attacks, CENTCOM said. Separately, the US Defense Department said a drone launched from Iran struck a Liberia-flagged, Japanese-owned chemical tanker in the Indian Ocean early on Saturday. No casualties were reported. The UK Maritime Trade Operations agency earlier said a drone had exploded near a vessel in the Bab al-Mandeb Strait, off the coast of Yemen. Reporting from Djibouti in east Africa, Al Jazeera’s Resul Serdar, highlighted that this incident portrays how the war on Gaza is not only a regional war. Referring to the Pentagon and the UK’s statement on the drone in the Indian Ocean, Serdar said that it is still “not clear whether it attacked the vessel or whether it was conducting surveillance activities.” But he noted that the US statement is coming just days after Washington officials said thatIran was deeply involved in the Red sea attacksconducted by the Houthis. The Houthis, who control large parts of Yemen, have waged an escalating campaign of drone and missile attacks on commercial shipping since the start of the war in Gaza, in what the rebel group has characterised as a show of support for Palestinians facing Israeli bombardment. The US on Tuesday launched a multinational security force, dubbedOperation Prosperity Guardian, to protect shipping amid escalating attacks in the waterway, one of the world’s busiest trade routes. Foreign Secretary David Cameron also condemned Iran for supporting the Houthis and other armed groups. In an interview published in the Sunday Telegraph newspaper, Cameron said Tehran has been a “thoroughly malign influence in the region and in the world”. “You’ve got the Houthis, you’ve got Hezbollah, you’ve got the Iranian-backed militias in Iraq that have actually been attacking British and American bases, troops. And, of course, Hamas,” the former UK prime minister said. “So you’ve got all of these proxies, and I think it’s incredibly important that, first of all, Iran receives an incredibly clear message that this escalation will not be tolerated.” Tehran has acknowledged supporting the Houthis politically but denied arming the group. Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri on Saturdaydismissed the accusationsthat Tehran has provided the Houthis with weapons and intelligence, saying the rebel group has its “own tools” and acts “in accordance with its own decisions and capabilities”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/24/us-says-it-downed-houthi-drones-as-uks-cameron-brands-irans-malign-influence
‘Did not ask for ceasefire’ in Gaza: Biden after phone call with Netanyahu,"White House says the two leaders discussed Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, including its ‘objectives and phasing’.","United States President Joe Biden says he did not ask Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for a ceasefire in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza in a telephone call between the two leaders. “I had a long talk with Netanyahu today [Saturday] and it was a private conversation,” Biden told reporters on Saturday. “I did not ask for a ceasefire,” he said, in response to a shouted question. In a statement later, the White House said Biden and Netanyahu discussed Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, including its “objectives and phasing”. Biden “emphasised the critical need to protect the civilian population including those supporting the humanitarian aid operation, and the importance of allowing civilians to move safely away from areas of ongoing fighting,” said the statement. “The leaders discussed the importance of securing the release of all remaining hostages.” The call between the two leaders came a day after the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) passed a resolution calling for the scaling up of aid for Gaza but fell short of calling for a ceasefire or a pause in weeks-long fighting. The resolution, which demanded “immediate, safe and unhindered” deliveries of life-saving aid to Gaza “at scale”, was passed after UNSC members wrangled for days over its wording and toned down some provisions at Washington’s insistence.    The US and Russia abstained from the vote, whose impact on the ground, aid groups fear, will beclose to nil. “This resolution has been watered down to the point that its impact on the lives of civilians in Gaza will be nearly meaningless,” Avril Benoit, the executive director of Doctors Without Borders, said in a statement. “The way Israel is prosecuting this war, with US support, is causing massive death and suffering among Palestinian civilians and is inconsistent with international norms and laws,” Benoit added. The US also opposed the demand to create a UN monitoring mechanism for aid, assuring Israel would continue to have a role in inspecting deliveries. Netanyahu on Saturday “expressed his appreciation” for the stance taken by the US at the UN, his office said. He also “made it clear that Israel will continue the war until all its goals are completed”. Israel has continued to bomb Gaza for nearly 80 days, withmore than 200 people killedin the past 24 hours. Gaza’s Health Ministry said the death toll since the start of the attacks rose to 20,258 on Saturday, most of them being women and children.    According to UN estimates, the war has displaced 1.9 million of Gaza’s 2.3 million population. The UN has described the situation in Gaza as “beyond catastrophic”, with residents struggling to find food, fuel and water, while living in crowded shelters or tents. In a post on X, the UN relief agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said it “cannot deliver meaningful aid” while the Israeli bombardment of Gaza continues. “It is extremely tragic that politics stand in the way of 2.2 million people’s survival in Gaza,” UNRWA spokesperson Tamara al-Rifai said at a news conference on Saturday.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/23/did-not-ask-for-ceasefire-in-gaza-biden-after-phone-call-with-netanyahu
Gaza media office says 100 journalists killed since Israeli attacks began,Palestinian journalist Muhammed Abu Hweidy latest to be killed in Israeli attack on his home in the east of Gaza City.,"At least 100 journalists have been killed since Israel’s war on Gaza began on October 7, according to new figures released by the government media office in Gaza. Palestinian journalist Muhammed Abu Hweidy was the latest to be killed in an Israeli air raid on his home in the east of Gaza City on Saturday, the media office said. “The number of journalists killed has risen to 100, men and women, since the start of the brutal war on the Gaza Strip, after the martyrdom of journalist Mohammed Abu Hweidy in an Israeli airstrike in the Shujaiya neighborhood,” the office said on Telegram social media. Palestinian officials in Gaza say the number could be much higher. However, according to a tally by the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 69 journalists have been killed in the conflict, including Al Jazeera Arabic’s cameramanSamer Abudaqa.    More than 50 media premises or offices in Gaza have been completely or partially destroyed by Israeli attacks. Hundreds of Palestinian journalists and their families have been forcibly displaced to the south. The media workers were also forced to abandon their reporting equipment in offices in the north to live and report underdifficult conditionsamid frequent communication blackouts. Journalists working in areas of armed conflict are protected under international humanitarian laws, which Israel is accused of violating repeatedly. Palestinian journalists have said Israel isdeliberately targetingthem to silence their stories. Tim Dawson, deputy general secretary at the International Federation of Journalists, told Al Jazeera it is becoming “impossible to ignore such a terribly, terribly high toll” of journalists. “I don’t think we have seen a death toll of journalists to this concentration in any conflict that I can think of. There were about 1,000 journalists in Gaza at the beginning of this conflict. And while there are slightly different counts of precisely how many have died, if between seven-and-a-half and 10 percent have died, that is an extraordinarily high number,” he said. Dawson said the journalists in Gaza “only have cameras, microphones and notebooks and continue doing their work despite this absolutely mind-blowing death toll”. When asked by Al Jazeera if Israel is targeting journalists, he said some Palestinian journalists have told him they “received threatening calls from people” purporting to be from the Israeli military, “warning them that they are going to be targeted or that their families are going to be targeted in the coming days”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/23/gaza-media-office-says-100-journalists-killed-since-israeli-attacks-began
More than 200 dead in 24 hours in Gaza as Israeli raids turn ‘more intense’,"Death toll in Gaza during the 11-week assault hits 20,258 while 53,688 others are wounded.","At least 201 Palestinians have been killed and nearly 370 wounded by Israeli forces in the past 24 hours in Gaza as the assault on the besieged enclave nears its 12th week. Bombing in central Gaza’s Bureij refugee camp killed at least eight Palestinians, including children, on Saturday while another attack on Jabalia camp is believed to have killed dozens more. The death toll in Gaza during the11-week assaulthas hit 20,258 while 53,688 others are wounded, the Palestinian health ministry said on Saturday. Thousands more bodies are believed to be trapped under the rubble across the strip.    Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from Rafah, said the Israeli attacks across Gaza “have become much more intense”. “The bombardment and the shelling of the northern parts of the territory continue as dead bodies have been found decomposed after days of fighting in the ground in these areas,” he said. Al Jazeera TV said the decomposed bodies, some of them left unattended for 20 days in the rubble and streets, were finally buried by Gaza’s Civil Defence team on Saturday. Almost all of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have been displaced and forced to live in flimsy tents or on the streets in the southern part of the strip, wherewidespread hungerhas been reported. Israel has long urged the Palestinians toleave northern areasof Gaza but its forces have also been bombarding neighbourhoods in central and southern parts of the tiny coastal enclave. “Where should we go to? There is no place safe,” Ziad, a medic and father of six, told the Reuters news agency by phone. “They ask people to head to [the central Gaza city of] Deir el-Balah, where they bomb day and night.”    Israel has said 144 of its soldiers have been killed since it launched its ground incursion on October 20, two weeks after Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on its soil, killing 1,147 people and taking 240 captives into the enclave. More than 100 captives are still believed to be in Gaza after a number of people were exchanged during a weeklong truce last month. The Israeli government says of those still in Gaza, 22 are dead. Hamas on Saturday said it had lost contact with a group it said was responsible for five of the Israeli captives due to Israeli bombardment. There is a possibility the captives were killed during an Israeli raid, Abu Ubaida, spokesman of Hamas’s armed wing, the Qassam Brigades, said. There was no immediate response from Israeli authorities about Hamas’s statement. Drawing on various information sources, an Israeli government-appointed committee has been declaring some hostages dead in absentia. Hamas has not confirmed these accounts but has warned Israel that “time is running out” for the captives. Osama Hamdan, Hamas representative in Beirut, on Saturday, said there will be no negotiations with Israel on the exchange of captives until the onslaught on Gaza stops. “If Israel wants to recover its prisoners alive, it must stop the war,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/23/over-200-dead-in-24-hours-in-gaza-as-israeli-attacks-become-more-intense
"Yemen warring parties commit to ceasefire, UN-led peace process, says envoy","Rival groups commit to new ceasefire and engage in UN-led peace process to end the nine-year war, says UN special envoy for Yemen.","The warring sides in the long-running conflict in Yemen have committed to steps towards a ceasefire and engage in a United Nations-led peace process, according to the UN special envoy for Yemen. The announcement by Hans Grundberg on Saturday marks the latest step to end a nine-year war that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and triggered one of the world’s worsthumanitarian crises. Following a series of meetings between the Saudi-backed Yemeni government and Iran-aligned Houthis in Saudi Arabia and Oman, a statement by Grundberg’s office said he “welcomes the parties’ commitment to a set of measures to implement a nationwide ceasefire, improve living conditions in Yemen, and engage in preparations for the resumption of an inclusive political process”. The envoy “will now engage with the parties to establish a roadmap under UN auspices that includes these commitments and supports their implementation”, the statement said. The plan, along with a ceasefire, will also include the two sides’ commitment to resume oil exports, pay all public sector salaries, open roads in Taiz and other parts of Yemen, and “further ease restrictions on Sanaa Airport and the Hodeidah port”, it added.    Yemen has been gripped with conflict since the Houthis took control of capital Sanaa in 2014, triggering a Saudi-led military intervention in support of the government forces the following year. A UN-brokered ceasefire that took effect in April 2022 brought a sharp reduction in hostilities in the country of 30 million people. The truce expired in October last year, though fighting largely remains on hold. In September, Houthi officialsvisited Riyadhfor the first time since the war broke out. That followed a first round of Omani-mediated consultations between Riyadh and Sanaa. The peace initiatives gained momentum after regional rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran agreed to re-establish ties in a deal brokered by China.

Famine by February: How bad is Gaza’s hunger crisis under Israeli attacks?,A UN-backed report has recorded mounting starvation in Gaza while aid remains restricted.,"Weeks of restricted access to food in the Gaza Strip have culminated in severehunger and growing risks of faminein the besieged enclave. Since early October, Israeli attacks across Gaza havedamaged local bakeriesand food warehouses, along with roads that are used to transport humanitarian aid. Israel’s total blockade on the enclave has also restricted food, water and fuel from entering in the first place. How bad is starvation in Gaza and what is the food supply like since the war? Here is what we know. More than 90 percent of Gaza’s 2.3 million population is facing high levels of acutefood insecurity, according to an Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) report on Monday. The IPC, which measures hunger risks, also reported on Thursday that 2.08 million people in Gaza are facing “acute food insecurity” that can be classified in the organisation’s phase three of risk or above. The IPC has five phases of acute food insecurity, ranging from none (phase one) to catastrophe or famine (phase five). Phase three and five are considered crisis and emergency. “Acute” food insecurity is a short-term phenomenon and tends to stem from unusual or man-made shocks, compared with “chronic” food insecurity, which is long term and a result of insufficient means for living. Between December and February, Gaza’s entire population is projected to fall under phase three or above, according to the United Nations-backed report. If current hostilities and limited aid continue, Gaza is also at risk of experiencing a famine by early February. The IPC definition of famine is when at least 20 percent of the population in an area falls under phase five of acute food insecurity.  Families in Gaza have had to cope with deteriorating quality and declining quantities of food, along with an inability to cook meals due to fuel shortages. Spending a day without eating any food has become usual. In early December, the World Food Programme (WFP) reported that nine out of 10 people across the enclave skip meals for long periods. Nutritionally vulnerable groups such as pregnant women are at heightened risk, whilebaby formulaand milk have been in severely short supply for toddlers who rely on it. Even preparing meals requires finding alternatives to cooking gas, and aside from using firewood or cardboard, at least 13 percent of displaced people have been forced to burn solid waste, says the WFP. Hunger has also quickly escalated since a brief truce ended in early December. Just 12 days after it ended, the WFP found that at least half of internally displaced people surveyed knew someone who had resorted to consuming raw meat. Access to water is also scarce, with less than two litres (0.5 gallons) available for each person per day – far short of the 15 litres needed to survive, according to the WFP.  Since October 7, the number of trucks carrying food that entered Gaza in a month fell by more than half, compared with at least 10,000 trucks before the war. Over two months of war, only 1,249 trucks carrying food assistance reached Gaza, the WFP reported on December 6. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs also reported that over the first 70 days of the war, only 10 percent of the food needed for Gaza’s entire population entered the enclave. The WFP has recommended that at least 100 trucks carrying just foodand waterenter Gaza a day, but on most days since the war even the total amount of trucks entering has been less than that. The agency also noted that damaged roads near Rafah at the border with Egypt – where must aid is now dispersed from – cannot accommodate this increase. At the height of aid supply during the truce lasting from November 24 to December 1, some 200 trucks entered daily, while the WFP was only able to reach about 10 percent of Gaza’s population with in-kind and cash-based food assistance. Even once food aid is supplied, access to a sufficient share has not been possible. A report from the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR) and Al Mezan, a human rights organisation based in Gaza’s Jabalia refugee camp, on December 14 found that people near Rafah’s food distribution centres would often have to wait in line for 10 hours, and sometimes still returned home empty-handed. “I have to walk three kilometres to get one gallon [of water],” Marwan, a 30-year-old Palestinian, who fled south with his pregnant wife and two children on November 9, told Human Rights Watch. “And there is no food. If we are able to find food, it is canned food. Not all of us are eating well.” Still, Gaza’s population primarily relies on humanitarian assistance for food, followed by local markets and assistance from friends or relatives. With rising shortages across all of these, support from relatives is also dwindling, according to the WFP. As more of Gaza’s population is pushed into shelters in southern governorates, which are also under intense bombardment, competition for food is expected to increase, said the IPC. Fighting across the Gaza Strip, and especially in the northern governorates, has particularly made it difficultto accessfood and aid. Local farmlands, flour mills, bakeries and warehouses have also been directly damaged by Israeli bombardments. Only a month after fighting broke out, all of northern Gaza’s bakeries closed due to lack of supplies such as flour and fuel, the UN reported on November 8. Risks of being hit by Israeli strikes also resulted in movement restrictions for those seeking to leave their homes for food.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/23/famine-by-february-how-bad-is-gazas-hunger-crisis-under-israeli-attacks
Israel says Gaza war is like WWII. Experts say it’s ‘justifying brutality’,"Netanyahu has compared the Gaza war with World War II. But this narrative is ahistorical, ignores the roots of the conflict and dehumanises Palestinians, say experts.","Israel’s campaign ofrelentless bombardmentagainst the Gaza Strip had been raging for three weeks when the country’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was asked to address the heavycivilian death tollin the Palestinian enclave. Netanyahu, who had earlier evoked the 9/11 attacks on New York’s Twin Towers and the Pentagon in 2001 to describe the deadly Hamas assault on southern Israel on October 7, looked to the second world war for validation, on this occasion. The hawkish Israeli premier referred to the time in 1945 – he mistakenly mentioned 1944 – when a British air raid, which had been targeting a Gestapo site, erroneously hit a school in Copenhagen killing 86 children. “That is not a war crime,” he told reporters. “That is not something you blame Britain for doing. That was a legitimate act of war with tragic consequences that accompany such legitimate actions.” Since then, the Allied campaign against Nazi Germany and Japan during World War II has become something of an historical precedent for an Israeli state seeking to justify the large-scale killings of the people of Gaza as it ostensibly pursues Hamas fighters. Israel’s ambassador to the United Kingdom, Tzipi Hotovely, has compared Israel’s campaign with the devastatingAllied bombing of Dresden, which, conducted over three nights in 1945, was intended to force the Nazis into surrender, and led to the deaths of some 25,000-35,000 Germans. Non-state affiliated advocates of Israel have also drawn similar comparisons. Yet, these attempts erase the roots of the Israel-Palestine conflict in theexpulsion of 750,000 Palestiniansfrom their land during the creation of Israel in 1948, the destruction of 500 towns and villages at the time, and the subsequent illegal occupation of Palestinian territory. They also ignore how World War II led to a new international law regime, and serve to dehumanise Palestinians while justifying Israel’s decades-long violence and discrimination — described by many international rights groups as akin to apartheid — against Palestinians, say historians and analysts. Israeli historian and socialist activist Ilan Pappé told Al Jazeera that these efforts by Israel are aimed “as a justification for its brutal policies towards” Palestinians and that they represent an old playbook used by the country. He cited the instance when former Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin compared the then-leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), Yasser Arafat, to Hitler, and war-torn Beirut to Berlin, followingIsrael’s invasion of Lebanonin 1982. “I feel as a prime minister empowered to instruct a valiant army facing ‘Berlin’ where, amongst innocent civilians, Hitler and his henchmen hide in a bunker deep beneath the surface,” Begin said in a telegram to then-United States President Ronald Reagan in early August 1982. But Begin’s words prompted criticism from many in his own country, with Israeli novelist Amos Oz writing that “the urge to revive Hitler, only to kill him again and again, is the result of pain that poets can permit themselves to use, but not statesmen”. Reaching into the past to legitimise modern-day conflicts can also be ahistorical. Scott Lucas, a specialist in US and British foreign policy at the University of Birmingham, said the relentless use of World War II by Israel and its supporters to mitigate criticism of its bloody war on Gaza suggests that Israel wants to “wish away the post-1945 pledge – by lawyers, NGOs, activists and politicians – to say we need a better system so civilians do not suffer needlessly in war zones”. He added that Israel’s decision to opt out of membership of theInternational Criminal Court (ICC)and its attempts to “actively … undermine [the authority] of the United Nations”, founded after the horrors of World War II and the Holocaust, make its claims to be part of an Allied-like struggle disingenuous. Israel hasrepeatedly accusedthe UN’s agencies and its officials, including Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, of bias because they have called for a ceasefire. Meanwhile, Israeli bombs have killed more UN staff members in Gaza since October 7 than in any conflict in the history of the organisation. “Civilians will be killed in wartime,” Lucas acknowledged, but added that Israel appeared to be breaching the international lawrequirement of proportionality. In essence, a military whose war leads to civilian deaths, including through attacks on hospitals, schools and shelters – targets Israel has repeatedly struck during this war – must be able to show proportionate military gains through those strikes. That’s a bar Israel hasn’t met, according to many experts. “You are currently having an excessive number of civilians who are being killed because there are not adequate protections that are being applied by the power that is carrying out the attack,” Lucas said. “And that’s what the Israelis should be judged by. Bringing in World War II and other narratives is [just] peripheral.” Israel’s supporters continue to argue that the parallel with World War II holds. Jake Wallis Simons, editor of the London-based Jewish Chronicle, said that there were “two points of similarity” between the conflicts. “The first is a sense of existential threat both during World War II and in the attacks by Hamas upon Israel,” claimed Wallis Simons. “The other is the nature of the aggressor.” He described Hamas’s actions as “barbarism”. But UN experts, international human rights groups and many nations around the world have warned that it is Israel’s actions since October 7 – more than 20,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, and almost the entire population of 2.3 million people has beendisplaced– that could constitute modern-day genocide. Earlier this week, Human Rights Watch accused Israel of usingfood as a weapon of war. Israel has maintained ablockadeon Gaza since 2007, and since the start of the current war, has made it even more difficult for aid to enter the Strip. Right at the start of the current war, Israel also imposed a strict block on the entry of fuel and water – a restriction it has largely kept in place. Against that backdrop, it’s useful for Israel to project World War II onto the conflict with Palestine, suggested German-Palestinian academic Anna Younes. It helps Israel dehumanise Palestinians and blunts sensitivity towards their suffering. “By conflating Israel with Jewishness, it’s easy to project Nazism … onto Palestinians, but also onto all of their supporters,” Younes told Al Jazeera. “Nazism has thus become a globalised Eurocentric rhetorical vessel for everything … which doesn’t deserve empathy and context, and is free to be killed.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/23/israel-gaza-war-wwii-palestine
"Israel-Hamas war: List of key events, day 78",UN Security Council passes resolution to boost aid delivery to Gaza – here are other major updates.,"Here’s how things stand on Saturday,December 23, 2023:   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/23/israel-hamas-war-list-of-key-events-day-78
Iran rejects US claims it is ‘deeply involved’ in Houthi attacks in Red Sea,Tehran responds to US allegations it is providing the Yemeni rebel group with weapons and tactical intelligence.,"Tehran has denied claims by the United States that it is “deeply involved” in attacks by Houthi rebels on commercial ships in the Red Sea, amid reports of another Israel-affiliated merchant vessel being struck. Iran’s deputy foreign minister on Saturday dismissed the accusations, saying the Houthis were acting on their own. The Houthis, who control large parts of Yemen including the capital Sanaa, have launched more than 100 drone and missile attacks, targeting 10 merchant vessels in the Red Sea, according to the Pentagon. The group has described the attacks as a show of support for Palestinians facing Israeli bombardment in Gaza. Tehran’s support for the Yemeni rebel group includes both weapons and tactical intelligence, the White House said on Friday as it presented newly declassified intelligence purporting to show Iranian involvement in the attacks. “The resistance [Houthis] has its own tools… and acts in accordance with its own decisions and capabilities,” Iran’s deputy foreign minister Ali Bagheri told Mehr news agency. “The fact that certain powers, such as the Americans and the Israelis, suffer strikes from the resistance movement… should in no way call into question the reality of the strength of the resistance in the region,” he added. Tehran has said it supports the Houthis politically but denies sending the group weapons.  The Iranian statements came after White House national security spokeswoman Adrienne Watson on Friday called the situation in the Red Sea “an international challenge that demands collective action”. “We know that Iran was deeply involved in planning the operations against commercial vessels in the Red Sea,” Watson said in a statement. “This is consistent with Iran’s long-term material support and encouragement of the Houthis’ destabilising actions in the region.” The White House said that visual analysis showed nearly identical features between Iran’s KAS-04 drones and the unmanned vehicles used by the Houthis, as well as consistent features between Iranian and Houthi missiles. Al Jazeera could not independently verify the White House’s claims. Al Jazeera correspondent Resul Serdar, reporting from Djibouti, said the Houthis have asserted that they have developed their own intelligence facilities over the years “that have proven to be quite effective”. “However, US officials are insisting that the Houthis do not have the radars and that they rely on technology provided by Iran. Otherwise, these missiles that are thrown by the Houthis would just drop into the water,” Serdar added. On Saturday, a Liberian-flagged chemical products tanker became the latest vessel struck, though the attack has yet to be claimed by any group. British maritime security firm Ambrey and the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) said the ship was hit by an unmanned aerial vehicle 200km (120 miles) southwest of Veraval, India “Some structural damage was also reported and some water was taken onboard. The vessel was Israel-affiliated. She had last called Saudi Arabia and was destined for India at the time,” the firm said on its website. The Houthi attacks have effectively rerouted a large portion of global trade by forcing freight companies to sail around Africa, imposing higher costs and delays to deliveries of energy, food and consumer goods. More than a dozen shipping companies, including the Italian-Swiss giant Mediterranean Shipping Company, France’s CMA CGM and Denmark’s AP Moller-Maersk, have suspended transit through the Red Sea due to the attacks. Washington earlier this week announced the launch of amultinational force, involving more than 20 countries, to protect vessels transiting the Red Sea. Last week, a US guided-missile destroyer shot down 14 attack drones believed to have been fired from Houthi-controlled regions of Yemen. The Houthi leadership has warned that they will strike back at “American battleships” and “American interests” if they are attacked.

RSF files second war crimes complaint with ICC over Gaza journalists killed,Latest complaint by Paris-based press freedom group asks the court in the Hague to probe the deaths of seven Palestinian journalists.,"Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has filed its second complaint with the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes committed by the Israeli army against Palestinian journalists in Gaza. The latest complaint by the Paris-based press freedom group filed on Friday asks the court in the Hague to investigate the deaths of seven Palestinian journalists killed in the besieged enclave from October 22 to December 15. The list of journalists includes last week’s killing of Al Jazeera Arabic cameraman, Samer Abudaqa. “RSF has reasonable grounds to believe that the journalists named in this complaint were the victims of attacks amounting to war crimes,” a statement issued by the group said. “According to the information collected by RSF, these journalists may have been deliberately targeted as journalists. It is for this reason that RSF is describing these deaths as intentional homicides of civilians.”    The RSF filed its first ICC complaint since the war began on October 31 over the death of seven other journalists. The group says it has confirmed the deaths of 66 Palestinian journalists since October 7 when the Israeli assault began. More than 20,000 Palestinians have been killed since. The other journalists named in the RSF complaint are Asem Al-Barsh, a radio journalist for Al Najah who was killed by sniper fire, and his colleague Bilal Jadallah of the Palestinian Press House, who fell victim to a direct missile attack on his car. Montaser Al-Sawaf, a cameraman for the Turkish Anadolu Agency, and photojournalist Rushdi Al Siraj were also killed in Israeli air raids on their homes. Hassouna Salim of the Quds News agency was killed by a missile after receiving death threats, and photojournalist Sari Mansour died in the same attack, according to RSF.    Al Jazeera’s Abudaqa “appears to have been killed by a precision shotfired from a drone”, the RSF said. The incident, which the Al Jazeera Media Network has alsodecided to refer to the ICC, took place on December 15, when Abudaqa and Al Jazeera correspondent Wael Dahdouh were reporting on the bombing of a school used as a shelter for displaced people in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip. Dahdouh – who lost his wife, son, daughter and grandson in aprevious Israeli bombing– was wounded in the attack but managed to reach a hospital, where he was treated for minor injuries. Rescue teams were unable to immediately reach Abudaqa and others at the site as they needed approval from Israeli forces to bulldoze through the debris to get to the location. By the time first responders arrived five hours later, the journalist had bled to death.    The RSF said it also supported the complaint filed by Al Jazeera Media Network about the fatal shooting of Palestinian journalist Shireen Abu Akleh in Jenin in the north of the Occupied West Bank on May 11, 2022. Targeting journalists is a war crime under Article 8 of the Rome Statute. “In view of the massacre of journalists in Gaza and the targeting to which they seem to be subjected, we call on ICC prosecutor Karim Khan to clearly state that he is making it a priority to elucidate the crimes committed against journalists in Gaza and to prosecute those responsible,” RSF Secretary-General Christophe Deloire said in the statement.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/22/rsf-files-second-war-crimes-complaint-with-icc-over-gaza-journalists-killed
UN Security Council passes resolution on increased Gaza aid delivery,"The US abstains on resolution that it lobbied to weaken over the course of several days, allowing it to pass.","The United Nations Security Council has passed a resolution to boost humanitarian aid to Gaza, followingseveral delaysover the last week as the United States lobbied to weaken the language regarding calls for a ceasefire. The resolution, which calls for steps “to create the conditions for a sustainable cessation of hostilities”, passed on Friday with 13 votes in favour, none against, and the US and Russia abstaining. The vote came amid international calls to bring the months-long conflict to an end, as Israeli forces pummel Gaza with one of the most destructive campaigns in modern history and humanitarian conditions in the besieged strip reachcritical levels. More than 90 percent of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents have been displaced, and conditions under Israeli siege and bombardment havebeen describedby UN officials as “hell on earth”.    Intense negotiations took place over the last week, with other member states searching for language that would avoid US objections that have doomed previous resolutions on Gaza in the 15-member body, where the US is one of five countries thathold a veto. The original draft called for “an urgent and sustainable cessation of hostilities” and gave the UN increased control over aid deliveries into Gaza. The adopted resolution opts for less equivocal language on a ceasefire and maintains Israel’s control over all aid. “This was tough, but we got there,” US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield said following the vote. While a trickle of aid trucks have delivered much-needed assistance to Gaza, aid groups say that truly addressing the strip’s humanitarian crisis will not be possible as long as hostilities continue. “The real problem is that the way Israel is conducting this offensive is creating massive obstacles to the distribution of humanitarian aid inside Gaza. An effective aid operation in Gaza requires security, staff who can work in safety, logistical capacity, and the resumption of commercial activity. These four elements do not exist,” UN chiefAntonio Guterrestold reporters following the vote.    Before the vote, Russia proposed an amendment strengthening the language around a ceasefire, saying that thedraft resolutionhad been “neutered” by the US. “By signing off on this, the council would essentially be giving the Israeli armed forces complete freedom of movement for further clearing of the Gaza Strip,” Russia’s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the council before the vote. Thomas-Greenfield accused her Russian counterpart of hypocrisy, pointing to Russia’s own destructive invasion of Ukraine that began in February 2022. But the US has facedaccusations of a double-standardover its position on Gaza, with critics saying that the US has spent months railing against Russia for violations of international law in Ukraine while providing Israel with weapons and diplomatic support, even as it faces similar accusations over its conduct in Gaza. The US vetoed a UNSC resolution calling for a ceasefire earlier this month, and was one of the few dissenting votes when theUN General Assemblypassed a ceasefire resolution by an overwhelming margin last week. “The vast majority of Security Council members, and members of the General Assembly, all want a ceasefire, a complete halting of the bombardment of Gaza, in order to facilitate aid,” Al Jazeera correspondent Gabriel Elizondo reported from UN headquarters. Earlier this week, the UN called for an investigation into allegations of the killing ofunarmed Palestiniansby Israeli troops in the strip, and hospitals, UN schools, medical workers, mosques, andchurcheshave also been targeted. Israel has said that it is working to dismantle Hamas, the Palestinian armed group that governs Gaza and launched a deadly attack on southern Israel on October 7 that killed more than 1,000 people, most of them civilians, and took more than 240captive. More than 20,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, have been killed since the current round of fighting began.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/22/un-security-council-passes-resolution-on-increased-gaza-aid-delivery
Turkey carries out mass detention of ISIL suspects,Ankara has stepped up operations against armed groups since early October.,"Turkey has arrested hundreds of people suspected of having links to ISIS (ISIL). The roundup was carried out in operations across 32 provinces, Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said on Friday. Ankara has ramped up operations against the armed group and Kurdish groups during the war in Gaza and after a bomb exploded near government buildings at the start of October. The majority of the suspects were arrested in Ankara, Istanbul and Izmir, the country’s three biggest cities, Yerlikaya said on the social messaging platform X. The nationalities of the detainees have not been revealed. The operation was carried out simultaneously across the country, said the minister, who shared footage that showed police entering apartments and buildings and dragging suspects into vehicles. 32  İlde DEAŞ Terör Örgütüne yönelik eş zamanlı olarak düzenlenen “KAHRAMANLAR-34” Operasyonlarında 3⃣0⃣4⃣ şahıs yakalandı❗ Aziz Milletimizin huzuru, birlik ve beraberliği için teröristlerin hiçbirine göz açtırmayacağız.

It wasforged from an alliancebetween an al-Qaeda offshoot and elements of Iraq’s defeated Baath Party. At its peak in 2014, its fighters controlled one-third of Iraq and Syria. But the group lost its grip on the territory after campaigns by US-backed forces in Syria and Iraq as well as Syrian forces backed by Iran, Russia and various paramilitaries. Although beaten back, some ISIL fighters remain in hiding, mostly in remote areas of Syria and Iraq, from which they continue to carry out attacks. Turkey continues to be targeted and has been hit by a string of deadly bombings since 2015. One attack in Istanbul on January 1, 2017, killed 39 people in a nightclub. Ankara has ramped up its crackdown against people in the country with possible links to ISIL ever since. It is assumed that the latest detentions may have been made with one eye on the coming New Year’s celebrations. In May, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced that the country’s intelligence forces had killed the suspected leader of ISIL, Abu al-Hussein al-Husseini al-Qurashi. “This individual was neutralised as part of an operation by the Turkish national intelligence organisation in Syria,” Erdogan said. “We will continue our struggle with terrorist organisations without any discrimination.” In recent weeks, Turkish authorities have also carried out operations against the outlawed Kurdistan Worker’s Party, or PKK, which Ankara considers a terrorist organisation. The Kurdish fightersclaimed responsibilityfor detonating a bomb near Turkish government buildings in Ankara on October 1. “For the peace and unity of our people, we will not allow any terrorists to open their eyes,” Yerlikaya said on Friday. “We will continue our battle with the intense efforts of our security forces.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/22/turkey-detains-over-300-people-linked-to-isil
What’s the latest UN Gaza resolution that the US has agreed to?,The US has heavily amended the UAE-led UN draft resolution on Gaza as casualties and hunger rise in the enclave.,"After a week of diplomatic back and forth, the United States has signalled that it is ready to support a United Nations Security Council resolution. Here is what we know about the draft resolution. The original draft was put forth by the United Arab Emirates mission to the UN on December 15 and it called for a cessation of hostilities and unhindered flow of aid into the Gaza Strip. It also said that the UN would exclusively monitor aid that enters Gaza through routes from outside states. Additionally, it called for an “immediate and unconditional release of all hostages”. Initially, the US did not want the word “cessation” in the resolution. As a result, the language was substituted with “suspension of hostilities”. However, Washington was unconvinced despite the first round of revisions andvoting was delayed. Now, the problem was with the UN monitoring of aid entering Gaza. PassBlue, an independent organisation that monitors the UN, posted on X that US diplomats were reportedly in agreement with the UN monitoring of aid until Israel saw the draft resolution. The USUN diplos were apparently OK with this para in the Gaza draft text, until#Israelsaw it.Israel wants to keep full control of humanitarian aid getting into Gazahttps://t.co/gzJpxQBq4G — PassBlue (@pass_blue)December 20, 2023  Before Thursday, Arab and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) members proposed new language to the US pertaining to the clause that talks about the UN monitoring aid entering Gaza, Al Jazeera’s Rami Ayari posted on X. It's late and I'll be going to sleep shortly but here's the state of play on negotiations regarding the#UNSCdraft reso on#Gazaaid scale-up. Following Blinken's calls with his Egyptian and Emirati counterparts, ambassadors of the three countries have been trying to resolve the…https://t.co/kBGqf2Aex4 — Rami Ayari (@Raminho)December 21, 2023  By then, a vote on the draft resolution had already been postponed seven times in three days, Al Jazeera’s Gabriel Elizondo reported. However, the voting did not take place as scheduled for Thursday either – and wasdelayed to Friday. With the help of Arab states, the US amended the draft. US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield said: “We’re ready to vote on it. And it’s a resolution that will bring humanitarian assistance to those in need.” The original draft, which mentioned a “cessation of hostilities”, was changed to call for an “urgent suspension of hostilities to allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access and for urgent steps towards a sustainable cessation of hostilities”. But the US-amended draft drops all references to a pause in fighting. Instead, it calls for “urgent steps to immediately allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access, and also for creating the conditions for a sustainable cessation of hostilities”. The original draft also said the UN will “exclusively monitor all humanitarian relief consignments to Gaza provided through land, sea and air routes” from countries not party to the war. Instead, the amended draft resolution asks UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to appoint a senior humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator to, in turn, establish a mechanism for accelerating aid to Gaza through states that are not party to the conflict. The coordinator would also have responsibility “for facilitating, coordinating, monitoring, and verifying in Gaza, as appropriate, the humanitarian nature” of all the aid. The initial draft resolution had demanded that Israel and Hamas allow and facilitate “the use of all land, sea and air routes to and throughout the entire Gaza” for aid deliveries. That was changed to “all available routes,” which some diplomats said allows Israel to retain control over access to all aid deliveries to all 2.3 million people in Gaza. Israel monitors the limited aid deliveries to Gaza via the Rafah crossing with Egypt and the Israel-controlled Karem Abu Salem (Kerem Shalom) crossing. To pass, the resolution needs at least nine votes in favour out of the 15 member states, and no vetoes by the US, France, China, the United Kingdom or Russia — the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. While Thomas-Greenfield told reporters that the draft is now “a resolution we can support”, she declined to specify whether the US will vote in favour or abstain. The vote, however, was delayed until Friday after Russia – also a veto power – and some other council members complained during closed-door talks about the amendments made to appease Washington, diplomats said. Russia’s UN ambassador Vassily Nebenzya declined to speak to reporters after the meeting. Now that the language that initially called for a “cessation of hostilities” has been diluted significantly, there is no guarantee that permanent members Russia and China will be on board. Russia and China previouslyvetoeda US-led resolution on October 25, which called for a “humanitarian pause” instead of a “ceasefire”. Gaza urgently needs food as its entire population is experiencing ahunger crisis, a UN-backed report says. A significantly large proportion of households is experiencing food insecurity and the threat of famine is rising. While the clause of unhindered aid access sounds promising in theory, the delivery of food and other assistance lagged Gaza’s needs even before the war. More than two months of fighting have created a further backlog of assistance requirements. Meanwhile, Israel has so far not lived up to the aid commitments it has made. Earlier, ahumanitarian pausewas brokered between Israel and Hamas to allow for a prisoner and captive exchange, alongside allowing for more humanitarian aid to enter Gaza. But even during the pause,about 200 aid trucksentered Gaza every day, compared with the500 trucksthat would enter daily before the outbreak of violence on October 7. The UN said the flow of aid during the truce was no match to the needs of Gaza’s civilians.Hunger in the enclavehas only worsened since, so it is unclear whether the UN and other agencies can — without a pause in fighting — meet the enclave’s humanitarian needs. Israel has also previously ignored UNSC resolutions. On November 15, the Security Councilpassed a resolutioncalling for “urgent and extended humanitarian pauses and corridors” throughout the Gaza Strip. But Israel’s envoy to the UN immediately declared that the resolution held “no meaning” for his country. It was more than a week later that Israel and Hamas finally agreed to a brief truce that lapsed in early December.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/22/whats-the-latest-un-gaza-resolution-that-the-us-has-agreed-to
US ready to back diluted resolution on more aid to Gaza as UN vote delayed,"UN Security Council vote is expected on Friday after four postponements, countries’ disagreements over language of text.","The United States has indicated it will back a watered-down United Nations Security Council resolution on theIsraeli-Palestinian warto call for more humanitarian aid for Gaza, after a week of negotiations and four postponements, but some countries want a stronger text that would include the now-eliminated call for a truce. The UNSC once again delayed a vote on theresolutionon Thursday, after the revised draft was discussed behind closed doors for more than an hour by council members. Some nations want a stronger text as the latest draft removes calls for the “urgent and sustainable cessation of hostilities”. Given the significant changes, many countries said they needed to consult their capitals before a vote, which is expected on Friday. The latest draft, seen by journalists, calls for “urgent steps to immediately allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access, and also for creating the conditions for a sustainable cessation of hostilities”. As the high-level diplomatic talks were under way on Thursday, UN agencies said that Gaza’s entire population of 2.3 million people is at “imminent risk of famine” as battles rage between Israeli forces and Palestinian fighters across most of the enclave. On Friday, the Ministry of Health in Gaza said that 20,057 Palestinians have been killed and 53,320 wounded in Israeli attacks since October 7, when the current conflict broke out. US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told reporters on Thursday that “if the resolution is put forward as is, then we can support it”. She denied that the draft had been watered down, saying it was “very strong” and “fully supported by the Arab group”. The UNSC vote on the United Arab Emirates-sponsored resolution was set to take place on Monday but has been delayed every day this week because of disagreements over language. The latest draft does not call for an end to the fighting, a change made to appease Washington, which has vetoed previous calls for a ceasefire. Diplomatic sources say “the Russian and Palestinian ambassadors are not happy with these changes at all, and now we are back to the drawing board, essentially”,  Al Jazeera’s Gabriel Elizondo reported from UN headquarters in New York. Although the changes suited the US, “clearly, there are other members that are saying these changes go too far for what they are willing to vote for”, he said.    “Some of this language is slightly absurd,” International Crisis Group analyst Richard Gowan told the AFP news agency. “Other council members have to decide if they will swallow a weak text for the sake of a deal, or if this is just too thin to bother with.” Middle East analyst Mouin Rabbani told Al Jazeera the dilemma is that “any resolution that could make a meaningful difference in terms of the situation on the ground in the Gaza Strip is certain to be vetoed by the United States”. “And any resolution that the United States feels that it is able to support is going to be essentially meaningless for the besieged population,” he added. Another key sticking point concerns aid deliveries. The resolution originally called for the UN to “exclusively” monitor all aid going into Gaza. The latest version of the draft substitutes that with having “a senior humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator” overseeing whether relief deliveries that are not from parties to the conflict are humanitarian goods. The language in the original text condemning the indiscriminate attacks againstcivilians in Gazahas also reportedly been removed from the latest draft. “In effect, the US is voting for the continuation of the siege, for the continuation of the mass killings in the Gaza Strip. And most importantly, the idea of humanitarian assistance without a ceasefire is absolutely meaningless and illusory,” Rabbani told Al Jazeera. Thomas-Greenfield said the US negotiated the new draft with the UAE and with Egypt, which borders Gaza. This bypassed the 13 other UNSC members, several of whom objected to being left out, according to diplomats speaking to The Associated Press news agency on condition of anonymity because the consultations were private. On December 8, Washingtonvetoeda UNSC resolution demanding an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza. The 193-member UN General Assembly overwhelminglyapproveda similar, though nonbinding, resolution on December 12.

"A Biden-Netanyahu rift? ‘Distraction’, Palestinian rights advocates say",Palestinian rights supporters dismiss reports of US-Israel disagreements as Biden maintains staunch backing of Gaza war.,"Washington, DC –Rock-solid. Unwavering. Unshakeable. After months of describing his commitment to Israel in fervent terms, United States PresidentJoe Bidenshifted his rhetoric this month — and issued his most firmly worded criticism of the country since the start of the war in Gaza. At a December 12 fundraiser, Biden warned that Israel is losing international support because of its “indiscriminate bombing” in the Palestinian territory. Those two words launched hundreds of headlines. The “rifts” between Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had finally “spilled into public view”, CNN wrote. The Washington Post signalled the two leaders were headed for a “collision”. But Palestinian rights advocates have questioned how much of a “rift” exists — or whether Biden’s words were merely a means of allaying criticism without taking substantial action. Biden has faced intense scrutiny for his support of Israel’s military offensive in Gaza, which has killed more than20,000 Palestinianssince October 7. And the US remains one of the last countries in the world to oppose ending the war. The president’s statement on December 12, however, did not signal a shift in policy. Rather, his administration has reasserted that it will draw “no red lines” to restrict Israel’s actions or what it does with US military aid. Some advocates, therefore, argue that the reported disagreements between Biden and Netanyahu are inconsequential so long as the US continues to back Israel. “It doesn’t matter whether Biden and Bibi [Netanyahu] like each other or not because, at the end of the day, American money is still being transferred to fund the Israeli army. Weapons are still being sent with or without Congress’s approval,” said Laura Albast, a Palestinian American organiser in the Washington, DC, area. “Biden did not come out and call for a ceasefire.”    Albast said the Biden administration is engaging in occasional criticism of Israel to address growing domestic concerns about the atrocities in Gaza. She noted that Biden’s popularity in the US has plunged during the war, particularly among young people. A Monmouth University poll this week showed Biden’s approval rating at a record low of 34 percent. Among voters under 34, that number tumbled to 23 percent. “They think that average voters in the United States are not critical thinkers, so they’re putting together this theatre,” Albast said. Hours after Biden made his comments about Israel’s “indiscriminate bombing” of Gaza, the US voted against a United Nations General Assembly resolution callingfor a ceasefirein Gaza. Days earlier, Washington had also vetoed asimilar measurein the UN Security Council. Still, US officials have said on several occasions that they are raising concerns with their Israeli counterpart over civilian harm in Gaza. “It’s clear that the conflict will move and needs to move to a lower-intensity phase, and we expect to see and want to see a shift to more targeted operations,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters on Wednesday. But the bombing nevertheless appears to be intensifying despite Washington’s demand. More than 5,000 Palestinians have been killed since the fighting resumed on December 1 after a brief truce.

He called reports of a feud between Biden and Netanyahu a “distraction”. “This is an attempt by the Biden administration to distance themselves from the genocidal policies of Netanyahu, which they have supported from the beginning,” Zahr told Al Jazeera. Adam Shapiro, the director of advocacy for Israel-Palestine at Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN), said the Biden administration was fully committed to the Israeli war in Gaza since its earliest days. But as the “horrific” reality of theIsraeli offensivebecomes more apparent, the Biden administration does not know how to disengage from it, he added. “It’s a ship without any kind of direction at this point. It’s like a drowning man, in a way, who’s just flailing,” Shapiro said. “That’s how I interpret all these random statements that come out from the administration. Meanwhile, the reality continues: Israel does what it wants. The weapons continue to flow.” Since the war broke out on October 7, some points of contention have emerged between the Israeli and US governments. They have, for example, articulated different visions for post-war Gaza. The US wants thePalestinian Authorityto eventually govern the territory, but Israel wants Gaza to remain under its security control. Disagreements about the future, however, have not shaken Washington’s support for the ongoing war, the scale and intensity of which puts Palestinians at “risk of genocide“, according to UN experts.    US officials, including Biden, have also emphasised the need for a two-state solution to the conflict, putting them again at odds with Netanyahu’s government, which opposes the establishment of a Palestinian state. But on Tuesday, the US was one of four countries, along with Israel, to vote against a UN General Assemblyresolutionreasserting Palestinians’ right to self-determination. The measure was backed by 172 other nations. To Zahr, the vote is yet another example of how US policy remains behind Israel even whenBiden’s rhetoricappears to diverge from that of Israeli leaders. “How can you dare to say that you want to be an honest broker, that you want to create ‘peace’ between Palestinians and Israelis when you say you believe in the right to self-determination of one party and not the right to self-determination of the other?” Zahr said. “This is a clown show of foreign policy.” Shapiro, meanwhile, said the Biden administration was committing “unforced errors”. Its position towards the bloodshed in Gaza undermines its credibility and the principles it claims to support on the world stage, he explained. “This administration is so tied up in a pretzel; it doesn’t know the beginning from the end.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/22/a-biden-netanyahu-rift-distraction-palestinian-rights-advocates-say
"Entire Gaza population facing hunger crisis, famine risk: UN-backed report","The proportion of households affected by acute food insecurity is largest ever recorded globally, the report says.","The entire 2.3 million population of Gaza is facing crisis levels of hunger and the risk of famine is increasing each day, a United Nations-backed report says. The proportion of households in Gaza affected by high levels of acute food insecurity is the largest ever recorded globally, according to the report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) published on Thursday. Theextent of hungerin Gaza has eclipsed even the near-famines in Afghanistan and Yemen of recent years, according to figures in the report. “It doesn’t get any worse,’’ the World Food Programme’s chief economist, Arif Husain, said. “I have never seen something at the scale that is happening in Gaza and at this speed – how quickly it has happened in just a matter of two months.” #GazaUrgent action is needed. Hostilities, including bombardment, ground operations & besiegement of the entire population have caused catastrophic levels of acute food insecurity. There is a risk of Famine. Read more ➡️https://t.co/b358hNlY4ipic.twitter.com/e9C155XqAP — The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (@theIPCinfo)December 21, 2023  The report by 23 UN and nongovernmental agencies found that the entire population in Gaza is in a food crisis with 576,600 people at catastrophic – or starvation – levels. “It is a situation where pretty much everybody in Gaza is hungry,” Husain said. “People are very, very close to large outbreaks of disease because their immune systems have become so weak because they don’t have enough nourishment,” he said. The report said every single person in Gaza is expected to face high levels of acute food insecurity in the next six weeks. The 23 agencies forecast that in the “most likely scenario”, the entire population of the Gaza Strip would be at “crisis or worse” levels of hunger by February 7 after four months of war. Under the IPC’s five-phase food insecurity classification, crisis in phase three, emergency is phase four and catastrophe or famine is phase five. “This is the highest share of people facing high levels of acute food insecurity that the IPC initiative has ever classified for any given area or country,” the report said. The international humanitarian organisation CARE called the figures “alarming”. The humanitarian situation in Gaza has deteriorated rapidly since Israel began a major military operation on October 7 with heavy air strikes and a ground offensive laying waste to wide areas of the enclave. “There is a risk of famine, and it is increasing each day that the current situation of intense hostilities and restricted humanitarian access persists or worsens,” the IPC for Gaza said. The IPC sets the global standard for determining the severity of a food crisis using a complex set of technical criteria. The report warned that the risk of famine is “increasing each day”, blaming the hunger on insufficient aid entering Gaza.    Trucks bringing aid from Egypt have delivered some food, water and medicine, but the UN says the quantity of food is just 10 percent of what is needed for the territory’s inhabitants, most of whom are displaced. Distribution of aid within Gaza has been hampered by military operations, inspections of aid demanded by Israel, communications blackouts and shortages of fuel. Some desperate Palestinians in Gaza havejumped onto aid trucksto try to grab scarce supplies of food and other goods. There have been reports of residents eating donkey meat and emaciated patients begging for food. Meanwhile, the death toll from Israel’s relentless bombardment of Gaza has surpassed 20,000, 70 percent of them women and children. About 1.9 million Gaza residents – more than 80 percent of the population – have been driven from their homes. More than a million are cramming UN shelters. The war has also pushed Gaza’shealth sector into collapse. Only nine of its 36 health facilities are still partially functioning – and all are located in the south, the World Health Organization said on Thursday.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/21/entire-gaza-population-facing-hunger-crisis-famine-risk-un-backed-report
"Israel’s war on Gaza deadliest in modern history for journalists, CPJ says",The Committee to Protect Journalists says concentration of reporters killed in Gaza ‘unparalleled’ in the group’s history.,"As Israeli forces pound the Gaza Strip, journalists are being killed at a rate with no parallel in modern history, a press freedom watchdog says. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ)saidon Thursday that 68 media workers have been killed in the 10 weeks of fighting – 61 of them Palestinian, four Israeli and three Lebanese. Among them is Al Jazeera cameramanSamer Abudaqa, who was killed in an Israeli drone strike last week while reporting from a school in Khan Younis. “More journalists have been killed in the first 10 weeks of the Israel-Gaza war than have ever been killed in a single country over an entire year,” the CPJ said in a statement. “More than half the deaths – 37 – occurred during the first month of the war, making it the deadliest single month ever documented by CPJ since it began recording journalist fatalities in 1992,” it added.    The statement came asPalestinian reportersin Gaza continue to work under brutal conditions, facing constant bombardment, displacement and possible targeting by Israeli forces. The report drew attention to what CPJ called “an apparent pattern of targeting of journalists and their families by the Israeli military”, noting that it had recorded at least one instance in which a journalist was killed while wearing clearly marked press insignia with no fighting in the surrounding area. “The concentration of journalists killed in the Israel-Gaza war is unparalleled in CPJ’s history and underscores how grave the situation is for press on the ground,” CPJ President Jodie Ginsberg said. “Local Palestinian journalists continue to report from Gaza while living in fear for their lives.”    The concentration of journalistskilled in Gazaoutpaces that of other conflict zones, such as Ukraine, Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, it said. The CPJ said Iraq was the only country to approach the current death toll in Gaza when in 2006, 56 journalists were killed in the wake of the United States invasion of the Gulf country three years earlier. Another Al Jazeera journalist,Wael Dahdouh, lost his wife, son, daughter and grandson in an Israeli bombing last month and was wounded in the attack that killed Abudaqa. Al Jazeera has said itwill referAbudaqa’s killing to the International Criminal Court (ICC), stating that the strike took place within a context of “recurrent attacks on the Network’s crews working and operating in the occupied Palestinian territories and instances of incitement against them”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/21/israels-war-on-gaza-deadliest-in-modern-history-for-journalists-says-cpj
Analysis: Why is Israel’s military killing so many of its own?,"The perils of urban warfare, coupled with operational issues within the army, appear to be hobbling Israel’s advance.","The Israeli army’s reaction to the Hamas attacks of October 7 has so far gone through four distinct phases. The first, which started within hours of the incursion into the territory of Israel, was mostly aerial bombardment as revenge and preparation for next steps. The second phase saw the infantry and artillery enter the northern areas of the Gaza Strip from three directions, advancing towards Gaza City to cut it off from the remainder of the Palestinian territory. In the third phase, Israel’s army completed the encirclement at the fringes of the city, making some limited advances, probes towards the centre. In the current, fourth phase, Israeli soldiers are making slow progress towards the centre of Gaza City, engaging in proper urban fighting. Having accomplished the blockade of the largest city in the north, Israel has repeated the same staged approach in the centre, and fighting inKhan Younisis now also in phase four. So far, fighting has been limited to conventional ground combat, with both sides operating as analysts had expected. Thethreat of tunnel warfarehas not yet materialised. To confirm my assessments of the fighting so far — especially as I observe it from a distance — I spoke to a retired United States general with whom I spent time on the ground during intense urban fighting in Fallujah in Iraq in 2004. He shared my view of the dangers and difficulties of full-scale MOUT, the US abbreviation for “military operations in urban terrain” that Israel is pursuing. He made two very interesting observations on casualties. First, the learning curve for the attackers is very steep, as expected. No training can prepare soldiers for the real conditions of fighting in narrow streets, being attacked from all sides including from above, and having to worry about tunnels as well. The general noted that “most efficient weapon in urban warfare is experience”, explaining that every ordnance is designed for a certain imagined and ideal situation that never exists on the ground. “In training a soldier learns what, say a hand grenade, is supposed to do and what its lethal range is. But till he has thrown a few from one room to another, he cannot imagine the force of the blast or the distance that the shrapnel goes bouncing off concrete walls”. Until each fighter and each unit engaged gain that crucial experience, they will take higher casualties. Thedeath of nine Israeli soldiersin a single incident in Shujayea on December 12 is a textbook example illustrating the general’s warning. Two officers and two soldiers from the Golani Brigade, one of the Israeli army’s most experienced units, were ambushed by Qassam Brigade fighters as they entered a building. An improvised explosive device (IED) blocked their exit route and Hamas fighters finished them off with hand grenades and machine-gun fire. As a second Israeli team tried to rescue their comrades, they too triggered IEDs and were then killed by crossfire from the building they were in and from the higher floors of the neighbouring one. The American general’s second poignant warning regards the numbers. While attackers in modern warfare can expect between three and five wounded for each soldier killed, the ratio in MOUT is probably twice as high. Extreme dangers of urban combat do not affect only soldiers. Civilians who are caught in the areas of house-to-house fighting also get killed — some by bombs from the air, others by soldiers on the ground. The Israeli air force has not shown much thought for sparing civilian lives when bombing Gaza; Most of the Palestinians killed, now more than 20,000, fell victim to aerial bombardment. Israel admitted that 50 percent of the bombs used were “dumb” ones. They can only be aimed by pointing the aircraft before release and can stray 50-to-100 metres (164-328 feet) from their aiming point. For Israel, it might be acceptable to kill Palestinian civilians with imprecise bombing, but not Israeli soldiers. But Israel has already killed one of every eight of its combat casualties through imprecise bombing. On December 12 the military command admitted that of the 105 troops killed by that point — the current figure being 137 — 20 were killed by “friendly fire” and other incidents involving Israeli soldiers killing each other. Of those 20 soldiers, 13 died from Israeli air force bombs, either through mistaken identification and location of the troops or by bombs falling far away from the aiming point. The majority of those bomb casualties occurred in the earlier phases of the war when distances between troops and their enemy were still considerable. But in urban fighting foes are often 10 or 20 metres (33-66 feet) away, so the only acceptable way to support them is to use precisely guided smart bombs. The current Israeli rate of advance seems to be slow. Such a modest rate of movement might be deliberate, to minimise casualties. But if days ahead demonstrate an ease in the bombardment of the centres of Gaza City and Khan Younis, that might be a first sign that the Israeli air force is running out of smart bombs. Another incident also demonstrated the extreme perils of urban warfare: On December 15 Israeli soldiers killed three Israeli captives who managed to escape and were trying to cross over to the very unit that machine-gunned them to death. Israel was shocked, as the civilians, for a change, were Israeli civilians, not Palestinians who are regularly killed by armed Israeli soldiers and police. But how could soldiers shoot people who were so non-soldierlike?  Shirtless, to show they had no weapons; in civilian trousers; carrying a makeshift white flag, a symbol of surrender and peace; and speaking in Hebrew? Under pressure from its stunned citizens, the Israeli military will certainly investigate all circumstances in detail, but some things are clear. Even in the heat of battle killing of civilians, especially ones displaying intent to give themselves up may indicate several unwanted issues that mar the operational performance of any army. These include a lack of proper training to distinguish between combatants and non-combatants; blatant disregard for the lives of the purported enemy showing intent to surrender; and extreme battle stress without psychological support for war-weary soldiers. Other possible factors include disregard by the higher command of the conditions on the battlefield and a failure to rotate out of combat the units that may have been engaged in heavy fighting, especially if the unit suffered casualties; and failure of the chain of command or the appointment of commanders of a character unfit to follow orders and take decisions. Aside from Hamas, the Israeli military clearly has issues within its ranks to deal with. At the same time, it seems unsure how much it can count on support from their Prime Minister. There are signs that many higher officers distrust Benyamin Netanyahu and would rather have in his place someone who would show more respect for the military than for his own political goals. They won’t admit it, but another ceasefire might be the respite that Israel’s military needs.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/21/why-is-israels-military-killing-so-many-of-its-own
"No functional hospital left in northern Gaza, WHO says",The UN agency describes the situation as ‘beyond catastrophic’ with patients begging for food and water.,"Northern Gaza has been left without a functional hospital due to a lack of fuel, staff and supplies, the World Health Organization (WHO) says asIsrael has targeted medical facilities. The United Nations health agency on Thursday said it had led missions to two badly damaged hospitals, al-Shifa and Ahli, in the north of the enclave. It described “unbearable” scenes of largely abandoned patients begging for food and water. “Our staff are running out of words to describe the beyond catastrophic situation facing remaining patients and health workers,” said Richard Peeperkorn, the WHO representative for the occupied Palestinian territory. Only nine out of 36 health facilities were partially functional in the whole of Gaza, according to the WHO. All those facilities are concentrated in southern Gaza. “There are actually no functional hospitals left in the north,” Peeperkorn told reporters via video link from Jerusalem.    Describing Ahli Arab Hospital as a “shell of a hospital”, Peeperkorn said it resembled a hospice providing very limited care. About 10 staff, all junior doctors and nurses, continue to provide basic first aid, pain management and wound care with scant resources, he said. “Until two days ago, it was the only hospital where injured people could get surgery in northern Gaza and that was overwhelmed with patients needing emergency care,” he said. “There are no operating theatres any more due to the lack of fuel, power, medical supplies and health workers, including surgeons and other specialists.” The bodies of victims from recent Israeli attacks were lined up in the hospital’s courtyard because they could not be given safe and dignified burials, he said. In addition to Ahli Arab Hospital, northern Gaza had only three other minimally functioning health facilities: al-Shifa, al-Awda and Assahaba Medical Complex, which Peeperkorn said were sheltering thousands of displaced people. Some patients at Ahli had been waiting for surgeries for weeks or if they had been operated on, they faced the risk of a postoperative infection due to the lack of antibiotics and other drugs, he added. “All these patients cannot move and need to be transferred urgently to have a chance to survive,” he said, reiterating the WHO’s call for a humanitarianceasefire. “This is needed now to reinforce and restock remaining health facilities, deliver medical services needed by thousands of injured people and those needing other essential care, and, above all, to stop the bloodshed and death.” Peeperkorn made the comments as increasingly frantic diplomatic efforts are under way to secure another pause in the war, which has already killedmore than 20,000 Palestinians, 70 percent of them women and children. The grim milestone was passed on Wednesday when the UN Security Councilpostponed a key voteon a draft resolution to boost humanitarian aid for Gaza for a third time to avoid a veto from the United States, which traditionally shields its ally Israel from UN action. The council is due to vote on a pause in hostilities and aid delivery to the Gaza Strip on Thursday.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/21/no-functional-hospital-left-in-northern-gaza-who-says
Will the US again veto the UNSC resolution on Gaza?,Intense negotiations have dragged on to ensure the US does not veto the UAE-led humanitarian resolution.,"A United Nations Security Council (UNSC) vote to call for the suspension of hostilities in Gaza and deliver humanitarian aid there has beenpostponedfor a third day in a row. The delays come as the UN chief has sounded an alarm about the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the besieged Palestinian enclave, which has been facing relentless Israeli bombardment since October 7. More than 20,000 Palestinians have been killed and tens of thousands are going hungry due to an Israeli blockade. Here is a recap of the developments surrounding the draft resolution: The United Arab Emirates circulated a “final version” of a draft resolution late on Friday. The first version of the draft was circulated on December 8 after theUnited States vetoeda resolution calling for a Gaza ceasefire. In short, this is what Friday’s draft called for: The draft now looks quite different after several changes. The revisions are owing to adiplomatic back and forththat has continued for days.

Security Council Report, an independent think tank that monitors the UNSC, said this language was added following requests from several members, including France, Japan, the United Kingdom and the US. The draft circulated on Friday was expected to come to a vote as early as Monday, depending on negotiations between the UAE and the US. “We have engaged constructively and transparently throughout the entire process in an effort to unite around a product that will pass,” an anonymous US official told the Reuters news agency. “The UAE knows exactly what can pass and what cannot. It is up to them if they want to get this done.” The resolution put forth by the UAE on December 8 called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and wasvetoed by the USwhile the UK abstained. All the other 13 Security Council members voted for it. The negotiations that followed have focussed on ensuring that the US does not veto the resolution again. Diplomats reported that the US wanted to tone down the language on a cessation of hostilities. Al Jazeera’s Rami Ayari reported that the voting was pushed to a later time on Monday and he was told “cessation” would be replaced with “suspension” after the US objected to the language. Security Council Report added that the UK had requested substituting “immediate” cessation of hostilities with language calling for an “urgent and sustainable” cessation of hostilities. Language calling “for an urgent and sustainable cessation of hostilities” had appeared in the draft that was put forth on Friday. Ayari later reported that voting had been pushed to Tuesday morning to allow more time for negotiations. “The US is eager to avoid using their veto again, according to several sources,” the Al Jazeera correspondent wrote.

That may be replaced with ""suspension…https://t.co/1LO38iuJWm — Rami Ayari (@Raminho)December 18, 2023  On Tuesday, an updated draft was circulated, and “cessation” was changed to “suspension”. Besides this, the clause that talks about the UN monitoring aid initially said the UN would notify the Palestinian Authority and Israel of the humanitarian nature of the aid without prejudice to inspections carried out outside Gaza by states that are not party to the conflict. In the new version, it adds that the UN would notify authorities without prejudice to any inspection that does not unduly delay the provision of humanitarian aid to Gaza. Akbar Shahid Ahmad, the senior foreign affairs reporter from the HuffPost, posted on X that a Muslim diplomat said a US veto was likely. Ayari reported that Washington remained unswayed despite the revisions, and the vote was delayed again to Wednesday morning. Security Council Report said that during the negotiations, “the US apparently objected to references to Israel as ‘the occupying power’ and to language that Washington believed could be read as imposing binding legal obligations under the UN Charter.” US Department of State spokespersonMatthew Millersaid Washington would welcome a resolution that fully supports addressing the humanitarian needs of the people in Gaza but the details of the text matter. The US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, reportedly met with US President Joe Biden on Wednesday. Ahmad posted on X that a diplomat told him Israel was heavily involved in the US decision-making on aid inspections. He also reported that Biden had instructed the US mission at the UN to veto a Security Council resolution on Gaza on Thursday, according to a diplomat. He added that the diplomat said the main sticking point for Biden was transferring control of the aid inspections to the UN, “a step the US has advocated for in other warzones”. PassBlue, an independent organisation that monitors the UN, posted on X that US diplomats were all right with the UN’s monitoring of aid until Israel saw it.

Security Council Report also reported that part of the negotiations involved other member states suggesting ways to make the aid monitoring system quicker so it doesn’t add another layer to the aid provision to Gaza. The US came back with a rewrite that essentially removed the UN aid monitoring mechanism. Voting on the resolution has been further delayed until Thursday. The UAE’s ambassador to the UN, Lana Zaki Nusseibeh, has voiced optimism for the resolution to pass. “I am optimistic, and if this fails, then we will continue to keep trying because we have to keep trying,” Nusseibeh told reporters. “There is too much suffering on the ground for the council to continue to fail on this. … We have a resolution, and we need to build on that.” Ayari wrote on X that Arab countries and members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation had proposed new language to the US on aid monitoring by the UN. They are awaiting Washington’s response, but “the initial signals are not good. If there had been agreement then the updated text would have been circulated to #UNSC members already,” Ayari said.

Israeli attack kills Palestinian border crossing chief: Gaza officials,"Bassem Ghaben, director of Israeli-controlled Karem Abu Salem crossing, was working to bring humanitarian aid into Gaza.","An Israeli air raid has killed a Palestinian border crossing director in southern Gaza, according to Palestinian officials and Hamas. Bassem Ghaben, the director of the Israeli-controlledKarem Abu Salemcrossing – called Kerem Shalom in Israel – was killed along with three other people by Israeli fire, Gaza health and border authorities said on Thursday. He had been working to facilitate the flow of humanitarian aid into the enclave through the crossing, which opened on Friday, said Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from the southern city of Rafah some 3km (1.86 miles) from the checkpoint. Mahmoud said the attack showed that Israel’s military is not only targeting infrastructure and homes, but also places that Palestinians rely on for “humanitarian aid they need for their survival”. “This is part of an ongoing systematic campaign of destruction,” our correspondent said. “It is unclear if the crossing is going to continue to work”. Israel’s military indicated it was not involved in the Karem Abu Salem attack, saying it was not “familiar” with the incident. The crossing, located on the southern tip of Gaza bordering Israel, had been approved to temporarily reopen on Friday to increase the flow of aid into Gaza, where 1.9 million people are displaced and in desperate need of food, water, and medicine. Previously, aid had been limited to the Rafah border crossing with Egypt. The border chief’s killing came as Israeli raids pounded all areas of the besieged strip, hitting 230 targets in just 24 hours, according to the Israeli army. The most intense bombardment took place in the northern part of the enclave, where there are no functional hospitals. The World Health Organization (WHO said on Thursday that only nine out of 36 health facilities are still partially functioning in the enclave, and all of them are based in southern Gaza. Strikes also hit the southern town of Khan Younis, killing 55 people in the past 24 hours, according to the Palestinian Wafa news agency. Israel has now ordered Palestinians to leave large swaths of the southern city, sparking widespread fear, Mahmoud reported. Israeli attacks have struck parts of Rafah, where most displaced Palestinians have sought shelter.    One elderly Palestinian man in Rafah told Al Jazeera he had never seen the level of violence Gaza is enduring in his entire life.  “I’m 76 years old and I’ve lived through many wars and conflict. But I’ve never seen anything like this,” he said. “The sheer level of destruction and systemic killing of civilians is shocking.” Ten weeks of Israeli attackshave killedmore than 20,000 Palestinians, including 8,000 children. Rescuers have warned that, due to continuing bombardment, they are unable to reach many of the wounded in northern Gaza.

Greece to join US-led coalition to protect Red Sea shipping from Houthis,The maritime alliance wants to counter threats that the Yemeni rebel group says are a response to Israeli ‘crimes’ in Gaza.,"Greece will send a warship to support a United States-led naval coalition in the Red Sea, becoming the latest country to join the alliance to counter threats from Yemen’s Houthis. Defence Minister Nikos Dendias announced the move in a televised address on Thursday, saying Greece, as a major shipping nation, has a “fundamental interest” in addressing the “massive threat” to maritime transport. The naval task force, announced by the US on Tuesday, initially listed 10 member nations to help patrol the waters to deter the Iran-aligned Houthis, who have attackedmore than a dozen vesselsthey claim were linked to Israel amid the war on Gaza. The Houthis say they will halt their attacks only if Israel’s“crimes in Gaza stop”. The original members of the Red Sea task force – called Operation Prosperity Guardian – include the United Kingdom, Bahrain, Canada, France, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Seychelles and Spain. Since then, Denmark has also joined the alliance, according to the Reuters news agency. Meanwhile, the European Union member states haveagreedto contribute through the European Naval Force. Australia stopped short of committing its warships to the alliance but said on Thursday it would send 11 military personnel to support the mission. Despite the Western show of force, the Houthis have promised to continue their attacks on vessels travelling to or from Israel for as long as the Gaza war goes on, saying operations will not cease even if the US mobilises “the entire world”. On Wednesday, Houthi leader Abdel-Malik al-Houthi warned the group would not hesitate to strike US warships if Washington targeted it. “We will not stand idly by if the Americans are tempted to escalate further and commit foolishness by targeting our country or waging war against it,” al-Houthi said in a televised speech. “Any American targeting of our country will be targeted by us, and we will make American battleships, interests, and navigation a target for our missiles, drones, and military operations,” he added. In recent months, Houthi drone attacks and attempted hijackings have pushed more than a dozen shipping firms to suspend operations in the Red Sea, through which 12 percent of all global trade passes.    On Thursday, the foreign minister of Egypt, which has not formally joined the maritime coalition, said countries on the Red Sea have a responsibility to protect the contentious waters and that Cairo would do its part to ensure “freedom of navigation”. “We continue to cooperate with many of our partners to provide suitable conditions for the freedom of navigation in the Red Sea,” said Sameh Shoukry at a news conference.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/21/greece-denmark-australia-to-support-red-sea-task-force
UN calls for probe as Israeli army accused of killing unarmed Palestinians,UN rights office calls for investigation into ‘possible war crime’ amid reports Israeli forces allegedly ‘executed’ 11 Palestinian men in Gaza.,"The United Nations human rights office has called for an independent inquiry into allegations that Israeli forces “summarily executed” at least 11 Palestinian men in Gaza in what it called “a possible war crime”. “The Israeli authorities must immediately institute an independent, thorough and effective investigation into these allegations, and if found to be substantiated, those responsible must be brought to justice and measures implemented to prevent any such serious violations from recurring,” said the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in astatementon Wednesday. Disturbing information on summary killings of at least 11 unarmed Palestinian men in front of their family members in Al Remal neighbourhood.#Gaza#opt#IHL#humanrightshttps://t.co/Gf0GdyDPAZ — UN Human Rights OPT (@OHCHR_Palestine)December 20, 2023  Al Jazeera spoke to several witnesses to Tuesday’s raid during which Israeli troops allegedly surrounded and stormed a residential building, going floor to floor to separate the men from the women and children, and then shooting dead 11 of the men in front of their family members. The men were in their 20s and 30s, survivors said. “They saw us, men and their wives and children. My brother-in-law tried to speak and explain all in the house are civilians, but they shot him dead,” one survivor told Al Jazeera of the attack on families who were sheltering in al-Adwa building in Gaza City’s Remal neighbourhood. The soldiers “forced their way into every home, killed the men and detained the women and children. We do not know their whereabouts. They did the same on every floor. All women were rounded up in one room. By the time they reached us on the sixth floor, they started shooting all men,” a woman said, adding that her father-in-law and son were shot and killed instantly. Survivors also said that the Israeli soldiers also attacked the women and children after ordering them into a room in the residential block also known as Annan building. “The Israeli soldiers rounded up all the women in one room, then fired three mortar shells on us, then kept shooting their machine guns at us,” a wounded woman said. “I was hit with a bullet in my hand, my daughter in her head, my younger daughter was killed and my son is blind. My husband was executed in cold blood. All my other daughters suffered severe injuries, broken bones and flesh torn open. We were all hit by bullets or shrapnel,” she added. Analyst Tamer Qarmout, an assistant professor at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies, welcomed the UN call for an investigation into the “unlawful killings”, telling Al Jazeera that the key issue is how such probes are going to be conducted. None of the entities that could investigate alleged Israeli crimes against Palestinians is currently allowed into the Gaza Strip, Qarmout noted. Other witnesses recalled that the men were forced to strip before being shot, and one man said that “even young boys were not spared. They were all battered and bludgeoned. They suffered broken bones and are in hospital.” There has been no comment from the Israeli military on the attack.

WFP temporarily halts food aid in parts of Sudan as fighting spreads,"UN food agency has been regularly providing assistance to more than 800,000 people in al-Jazirah state.","The United Nations food agency has temporarily suspended food assistance in some parts of Sudan’s al-Jazirah state where it was supporting more than 800,000 people, as fighting spreads south and east of the country’s capital, Khartoum. About 300,000 people have fled the previously peaceful state in a matter of days, since clashes erupted last week, the World Food Programme (WFP) said on Wednesday. This includes thousands of displaced people who have leftWad Madani, Sudan’s second-largest city and the capital of al-Jazirah state, in recent days as paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) advanced. “A place of refuge has now become a battleground in a war that has already taken a horrific toll on civilians,”saidEddie Rowe, WFP representative and country director in Sudan, where the national army and RSF have been locked in conflict since April. Earlier this week, humanitarians reported that all fieldwork within al-Jazirah state had been put on hold until further notice due to the security situation. WFP staff had been regularly providing aid to more than 800,000 people in the state, including many who had escaped the fighting in Khartoum.    “We are committed to supporting the people of Sudan in their hour of greatest need, but the safety of our staff and partners must be guaranteed,” said Rowe. He added that teams are working to provide food aid in locations where it is still possible and resume planned assistance in other areas when conditions allow. WFP said the decision was taken on safety grounds. But it described it as a “major setback” to humanitarian efforts in the country’s breadbasket. “We already lost our homes in Khartoum and watched as our lives were destroyed before our eyes. Now we are forced to flee yet again, leaving behind what little we had left,” said Karim Abdelmoneim, WFP’s emergency coordinator for al-Jazirah state. “Hundreds of thousands are fleeing on foot, with nowhere to go. We are so worried about those who already lived through the horrors in Khartoum, and now find themselves trapped in Wad Madani with no way out.” On Wednesday, UN rights chief Volker Turk said: “I am very alarmed by recurring reports of widespread abuses and violations of human rights in recent days amid fighting between the Sudan Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces in Wad Madani.” The UN high commissioner for human rights also voiced concern over the “dire” humanitarian situation in the wider al-Jazirah state. WFP said if the conflict spills over into Sudan’s grain-producing region, it would have dramatic consequences on agricultural production and food availability in the coming months. “Sudan’s breadbasket must remain for what it was intended – farming, not fighting. Otherwise, we may see an even more catastrophic hunger crisis as the lean season gets underway in May 2024,” Rowe warned. Nearly 18 million people in Sudan are acutely food insecure during the ongoing harvest season, a time when food is typically more available, WFP said.

"UNSC struggles with Gaza truce vote delays, Israel orders mass evacuations","Palestinians await long-delayed UN Security Council vote on aid delivery as death toll in besieged Gaza exceeds 20,000.","The United Nations Security Council is due to vote on a pause in hostilities in the Israel-Palestinian conflict and aid delivery to the Gaza Strip after several failed attempts to agree on the language of the resolution, as Israel ordered the evacuation of a swathe of the besieged enclave’s south. Members of the UNSC remain engaged in high-level diplomacy in hopes of avoiding another United States veto of a new UN resolution on the delivery of desperately needed aid to Gaza, where Palestinian authorities have said thedeath tollin Israel’s war against Hamas has exceeded 20,000 people. The vote, delayed three times, is now expected on Thursday, said Ecuador’s UN Ambassador Jose Javier De la Gasca Lopez-Dominguez, the current UNSC president. The failure to pass a Security Council resolution will mean applying “dangerous double standards”, Jordan’s Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi warned on Thursday. Safadi said the draft text is focused on speeding up aid shipments to Gaza that the kingdom believes Israel is obstructing to prevent sufficient life-saving assistance from getting through. “Just within the past three days, there have been seven different delays or postponements in this UN Security Council vote onhumanitarian aidgetting into Gaza,” said Al Jazeera’s Gabriel Elizondo, reporting from the UN headquarters in New York on Wednesday. “The main sticking point, we believe, is the language in the draft about a monitoring mechanism being implemented. Essentially, it would be the United Nations that takes the lead in overseeing and facilitating aid entering Gaza and then its distribution to the people who need it the most,” he said. Currently, Israel inspects all aid entering the strip and decides what to let through, but the new draft calls for the establishment of a mechanism for exclusive UN monitoring of aid deliveries. “Everyone wants to see a resolution that has impact and that is implementable on the ground,” said Lana Zaki Nusseibeh, UN ambassador for the United Arab Emirates, which sponsored the resolution, after the council agreed to another delay on Wednesday. The US has also been struggling to change the text’s references to a “cessation” of hostilities in Israel’s war. Nusseibeh voiced hope that a resolution calling for the “suspension” of hostilities in Gaza would eventually pass in the UNSC. “I am optimistic, and if this fails then we will continue to keep trying because we have to keep trying,” she told reporters. “There is too much suffering on the ground for the council to continue to fail on this … we have a resolution and we need to build on that.”  The UNSC vote was initially postponed from Monday and then pushed back to Tuesday and then Wednesday. The draft text on the table on Monday called for an “urgent and sustainable cessation of hostilities”, but this language was watered down to appease the US. The latest version seen on Wednesday called “for the urgent suspension of hostilities to allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access, and for urgent steps towards a sustainable cessation of hostilities”. US National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby also reportedly raised two other issues on Wednesday that are not in the text: condemnation of Hamas’s October 7 incursion into Israel, and Israel’s right to self-defence. On December 8, Washingtonvetoeda UNSC resolution demanding an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza. The 193-member UN General Assembly overwhelminglyapproveda similar, though nonbinding, resolution on December 12. As diplomats grappled with the resolution, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA) said the Israeli military ordered the immediate evacuation of an area covering some 20 percent of central and southern Khan Younis city on Wednesday. “A large number of people are going to be affected by this order and will end up being displaced,” said Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Khan Younis. Before Israel’s offensive, the area was home to more than 111,000 people and now includes 32 shelters housing more than 141,000 people displaced from northern Gaza by the war. Israel had initially told civilians to leave the north of Gaza for “safer” areas in the south. Palestinian officials on Wednesday said at least 20,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the current war broke out on October 7, including at least 8,000 children and 6,200 women.

‘Seen as less human’: Why has Islamophobia surged amid Israel’s Gaza war?,Hate crimes and complaints are at record levels. Al Jazeera speaks to Professor John Esposito to better understand why.,"Hate crimes against Muslims and those perceived to be Muslim in the United Kingdom are up by 140 percent compared with this time last year, according to British police. The United Kingdom anti-Islamophobia organisation Tell MAMA has received a sevenfold increase in reports ofIslamophobiasince October 7, whenHamas fighters attacked southern Israel, killing 1,139 people and taking 240 others captive, including women and children. Since then,more than 20,000 Palestinianshave been killed in Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, including at least 8,000 children, according to health officials in the enclave. In the United States, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a Muslim civil rights group, said it had received 2,171 complaints of Islamophobia and anti-Arab bias since October 7, a 172 percent increase since the previous year. Last monththree men were shotin Vermont, and around the same period, Stuart Seldowitz, a former adviser to President Barak Obama, was captured on videotaunting and threateninga fast food vendor in Manhattan with Islamophobic abuse. While the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has a lengthier definition of Islamophobia (PDF), the UK’s All-Party Parliamentary Group on British Muslims uses the following definition: “Islamophobia is rooted in racism and is a type of racism that targets expressions of Muslimness or perceived Muslimness.” The incidents accompanying the recent statistics range from verbal harassment to violence against Palestinian human rights supporters and represent “an unprecedented surge in bigotry”, CAIR’s Research and Advocacy Director Corey Saylor said in a statement released to Al Jazeera. “Islamophobia and anti-Arab racism are out of control in ways we have not seen in almost ten years.” Saylor says that in the US, the last large wave of Islamophobia was during US President Donald Trump’s announcement in December 2015 of aban on visitorsfrom a set of Muslim-majority nations. On October 15, six-year-old Palestinian-American boyWadea Al-Fayoumewas stabbed to death at his Illinois home by the apartment’s landlord in what police said was an anti-Muslim hate crime, reportedly in response to the Hamas attack on Israel. The UK has witnessed anti-Muslim language being used at universities and schools, including people being called “terrorists”, reports Tell MAMA. Other incidents have included acts of vandalism. It is alarming that vandals targeted Acton Mosque three times in just two weeks. Vandals also targeted a Syrian cafe with red paint on October 23. Tell MAMA will continue to engage with the Met Police and others to offer our support and assistance.https://t.co/RcJDBoxSYq — Tell MAMA UK (@TellMamaUK)November 8, 2023   Here, in conversation with Al Jazeera, John L Esposito, author of more than 50 books – including Islamophobia: The Challenge of Pluralism in the 21st Century (2011) – explains what Islamophobia is, and how Israel’s war on Gaza has led to an explosion in incidents. Esposito is also a distinguished university professor of Religion and International Affairs, and Islamic Studies at Georgetown University in Washington, DC, in the US. Al Jazeera: We have textbook definitions of what Islamophobia is, but what can it look like in daily life? John Esposito:Islamophobic attacks can be anything from abusive language used against someone who looks visibly Muslim – like a woman wearing a hijab; or it could be more covert, like not hiring a fully qualified professional based on their perceived Muslimness. In the current climate, since Israel’s war on Gaza began in October, there have been growing incidents where people have had theiremployment terminatedfor showing their support for a free Palestine. Islamophobia can of course escalate, in the killing of individuals like theyoung boy in Illinois, and as we’ve seen it violently play out in attacks on communities and mosques, like the [2019]mosque attack in Christchurch, New Zealand. That’s just one example; there are so many more. Al Jazeera:In your opinion, what would you say are the roots of Islamophobia? John Esposito:The trigger for this narrative goes back to theIranian Revolution[1979]. Remember that was when many people also finally had live TV [news], and would put on their TV every day. They’d see people in Iran shouting “Death to America”, which would lead viewers to think all Iranians, and then the wider Muslim world, must hold this belief. But it was really 9/11 that became a major catalyst for Islam and Muslims to be seen as a global threat. We now saw the “Global War on Terrorism“, [Osama] bin Laden and al-Qaeda, which played a major role in the growth of Islamophobia, as Muslims and Islam came to be seen as violent and dangerous. Then of course most recently there was theIslamic State[ISIL, or ISIS], which had an enormous amount of media coverage, far more than it ever should have, essentially allowing a minority to falsely portray who Muslims are. And now in this recent war in Gaza, we’ve seen Hamas being equated to ISIS, which somehow helps fuel attacks against Palestinians as they are being painted with the same brush as an extremist group. The result has been Israel’s totally disproportionate war and genocide. Al Jazeera: You’ve mentioned the media. What role does it play? John Esposito:I’d say it’s hugely responsible for the rise in Islamophobia. The media has always cared about headlines. There’s a famous line that I often quote, “If it bleeds, it leads”, and news organisations’ focusing reporting on “terrorist” attacks has been exploited by far-right political and religious leaders and media commentators who are quick to speak out about Islam and Muslims, without checks or balances. A great example of it is in the current war. Initial reports that were coming out of Israel mentioned the beheading of babies. [US] President [Joe] Bidenwithdrew his statementconfirming its falsehood the day after, but by that point, the story had already been repeated countless times on mainstream media and social media. I was told when I first came to Washington, “Remember, if you throw it up against the wall three times, it’ll stick”, and you know that’s what’s happened here. An unverified piece of news is repeated more than three times, and by the time it’s retracted, it’s already stuck in people’s heads, feeding into this Islamophobic narrative of who these people are and what they are capable of doing. Al Jazeera: But you’ve also said it’s no longer just mainstream media that’s responsible? John Esposito:Yes absolutely, there are also well-funded anti-Muslim social media campaigns. There is astudyby the Center for American Progress, called Fear, Inc. [August 2011], that documents $42.6m flowing from seven foundations over 10 years (the first decade of the century) to support Islamophobic authors and websites. Then there’s another by CAIR and the Center for Race and Gender at UC Berkeley. It’s called the Confronting Fear report [2016] and that concluded that between 2008 and 2013, 33 Islamophobic groups had access to $205,838,077to reinforce their misinformation. Al Jazeera: Is social media making it easier to be Islamophobic? John Esposito:Social media has had an enormous impact. It can create a reality where any claims can be presented as a fact. I certainly see that now with regard to the war in Gaza, and the example I gave about beheading babies. Al Jazeera: How has the current war between Israel and Hamas added, if at all, to the Islamophobic rhetoric? John Esposito:Israeli politics has used the Islamophobic rhetoric to create a devastating impact in portraying Muslims and Arabs as the enemy and denying their fundamental rights, and so justifying an indiscriminate war whose victims are being viewed as less valuable than other human beings. We know the October 7 attacks were carried out by members of Hamas, but [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu claims that these attacks represent all that Hamas is. In fact, Hamas has also been a major political movement that governed in Gaza for many years and continues to be a political movement. Netanyahu and hisJewish fundamentalist government officials– as well as several European and Western governments, allies with Israel – even equate all Palestinian demonstrations and organised opposition with being supportive [of armed groups]. Unfortunately, the initial unwavering support of Israeli policies, by the US and UK as well as other countries, has added to the Israeli narrative that allMuslims and all Arabs are the enemy. Early in the war, members of the Israeli government referred to Palestinians as “human animals“. Netanyahu even quoted from the Old Testament, describing Palestinians as the “Amalek”, the Jews’ archetypal enemy. (The Amalek could transform themselves into animals to avoid capture). He says this to justify his policy that has increasingly been labelled by many in the international community as genocide and war crimes. All of these denigrating charges both reflect and feed the dangerous growth of Islamophobia in many parts of the world. Al Jazeera: Are there any other reasons that may have led to spikes in Islamophobia? John Esposito:Yes, Netanyahu’s government legitimates this all-out war in Gaza by simply comparing Hamas to ISIL [ISIS], which it is not. By doing this, Israel is feeding Islamophobia, by fuelling the notion that this is a war against a Muslim “terrorist” organisation, not Palestinian people. ISIS was a transnational movement whose vision and mission was to create a caliphate in the Middle East, whereas Hamas’s roots and issues have been an integral part of the history of Palestinians. It goes back to the violent displacement of 750,000 Palestinians and the destruction of 500 Palestinian villages, their society, culture, and political rights. The result was the Nakba, the catastrophe. How can people in the world understand what today many Palestinians refer to as the Second Nakba if they have no knowledge of it? The international community’s inability to respond to, and object to, Israel’s continued absorption of Palestinian territory that has created an apartheid country must be recognised and rectified. Al Jazeera: Are there ways to stop Islamophobia from escalating? John Esposito:There needs to be better education, not just in our schools and universities and seminaries, but also of our political leaders, our policymakers. It’s important to be educated enough to be able to distinguish between the teachings of Islam and mainstream Muslims and the actions of the militant fundamentalist minority, like al-Qaeda and ISIS [ISIL]. There are people who are very well educated – I’m talking about professionals who are doctors, dentists, lawyers, et cetera – but their understanding of Islam is limited to what they’ve seen on TV. But conversations are being had and understanding is shifting. People are now paying attention. In addition, inter-faith programmes and dialogue today are increasing a multi-faith perspective and understanding and this can lead to a reduction of anti-religious violence, hostility and crimes. Although the internet has been a significant source of Islamophobia, it also has been and can be a source for understanding, tracking and countering Islamophobia. This is why our centre at Georgetown created The Bridge Initiative: Protecting Pluralism and Countering Islamophobia. We track and provide information on the globalisation of Islamophobia every day. Al Jazeera: Is education enough? John Esposito:It’s a start, but other changes need to include what our leaders say and how they say it. This matters tremendously. Governments and political leaders are in a position of trust, and if they make anti-Muslim statements, as we’ve seen in the language used in this war by Netanyahu and his allies – or create domestic and foreign policies that imply Muslims are the enemy, as we’ve seen across Europe in France, Austria, Germany and the US – then it will only continue to fan the flames of Islamophobia. In the case of the current war in Gaza, it is imperative to remember that “those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it”. That’s what we are seeing now.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/21/seen-as-less-human-why-has-islamophobia-surged-amid-israels-gaza-war
"Meta ‘stifling’ pro-Palestine voices on social media, rights group says","‘Censorship’ of hundreds of posts on Facebook, Instagram during Gaza war furthers ‘erasure of Palestinians’ suffering’.","Social media giant Meta has systematically censored pro-Palestine voices during the current Israel-Palestinian conflict, according to a new report by Human Rights Watch (HRW). Thereportalleges that Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, has pulled down or suppressed hundreds of pro-Palestine posts due to flawed content moderation policies, poor implementation, and “undue government influence”. “Meta’s censorship of content in support of Palestine adds insult to injury at a time of unspeakable atrocities and repression already stifling Palestinians’ expression,” said Deborah Brown, HRW’s acting associate technology and human rights director. “Social media is an essential platform for people to bear witness and speak out against abuses while Meta’s censorship is furthering the erasure of Palestinians’ suffering.” HRW said it went through more than 1,000 cases of Meta censorship in 60 countries, documenting a pervasive “pattern of undue removal and suppression of protected speech, including peaceful expression in support of Palestine and public debate about Palestinian human rights”. In dozens of cases, Meta took down newsworthy posts documenting Palestinian suffering or death. It justified these decisions by referencing its restrictions on “violent and graphic content, violence and incitement, hate speech, and nudity and sexual activity”. For hundreds of other posts, Meta applied its “Dangerous Organizations and Individuals” (DOI) policy, whichaimsto stop “organisations or individuals that proclaim a violent mission” from having a presence on the platform. HRW said Meta had misused this policy to broadly “restrict legitimate speech around hostilities between Israel and Palestinian armed groups”. In other cases, Meta deleted or suspended users’ accounts, limited users’ engagement, or “shadow banned” them, making their posts less visible without telling them, HRW added. Nearly a third of censored posts could not be appealed because of glitches in the appeals system, leaving users without access to redress, HRW said.    HRW’s concern with Meta’s content policies tracks with previous independent investigations and rulings from the company’s oversight body. In 2021, a Meta-commissioned report found that the company’s flawed content moderation policies had stopped Palestinians from sharing “information and insights about their experiences as they occurred”, having a negative “human rights impact”. On Tuesday, Meta’s independent oversight board criticised the company for removing posts that showed human suffering in the ongoing Gaza war. It restored two such posts, including an Instagram video of the aftermath of a strike on or near al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. The board’s co-chair Michael McConnel said it was important for the platform to keep such posts up because they provide “timely and diverse information about ground-breaking events”. These posts may even constitute “important evidence of potential grave violations of international human rights and humanitarian law,”, McConnel said. In 2022, Meta said it would make changes to its content moderation policies based on recommendations from its oversight board, but it has failed to follow through, HRW alleges. “Instead of tired apologies and empty promises, Meta should demonstrate that it is serious about addressing Palestine-related censorship once and for all by taking concrete steps toward transparency and remediation,” Brown said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/21/meta-stifling-pro-palestine-voices-on-social-media-hrw
"Gaza death toll surpasses 20,000 as UN Security Council delays vote on aid",The grim milestone comes as the UN’s top decision-making body postpones a key vote on Gaza aid for the third time.,"At least 20,000 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip since Israel began bombarding the enclave more than 10 weeks ago, according to Palestinian officials. At least 8,000 children and 6,200 women are among those killed, Gaza’s Government Media Office said on Wednesday. The grim milestone was passed as the United Nations Security Council postponed a key vote on a bid to boost humanitarian aid for Gaza for the third time to avoid a veto from the United States, which traditionally shields its ally Israel from UN action. Since a seven-day truce collapsed on December 1, the war has entered a more intensive phase with ground combat previously confined to the northern half of the territory now spread across its length. When asked about the ever-growing casualty count, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said it is “clear that the conflict will move and needs to move to a lower intensity phase”. “We expect to see and want to see a shift to more targeted [Israeli] operations with a smaller number of forces that’s really focused in on dealing with the leadership of Hamas, the tunnel network and a few other critical things,” he said. “And as that happens, I think you’ll see as well the harm done to civilians also decrease significantly.” Air strikes continued across Gaza on Wednesday with at least 46 people killed and dozens wounded in Israeli attacks on the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, according to the enclave’s Ministry of Health. In Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, where hundreds of thousand of people have been pushed since early December by Israel’s continued onslaught, air strikes hit a building near a hospital close to an Al Jazeera crew reporting live on air, killing at least 10 people. “More air strikes are conducted, more victims fall due to the expansion of the Israeli military operations in the areas that are supposed to be safe zones where the majority of Gazans have been urged to flee,” Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum said in reporting from Rafah. “The air strike took place in an area considered to be very densely populated, and it’s a miracle that no more than this number of people were killed,” he added. The UN Security Council vote on a bid to boost aid to the Gaza Strip and ask the UN to monitor humanitarian aid deliveries there has been delayed at the request of the US, diplomats said. According to the United Arab Emirates envoy to the UN, Lana Nusseibeh, the vote will take place on Thursday. “Everyone wants to see a resolution that has impact and is implementable on the ground, and there are some discussions going on on how to make that possible,” Nusseibeh, whose country drafted the resolution, told reporters in New York. The text aims to dilute Israel’s control over all humanitarian aid deliveries to the 2.3 million people of Gaza. The initial text has been reportedly modified to soften calls to end the fighting in Gaza to avoid yet another veto from the US. “We want to make sure that the resolution … doesn’t do anything that could actually hurt the delivery of humanitarian assistance, make it more complicated. That’s what we’re focused on,” Blinken told reporters on Wednesday. “I hope we can get to a good place.” Currently, Israel monitors the limited humanitarian aid and fuel deliveries to Gaza via the Rafah crossing from Egypt and the Israel-controlled Karem Abu Salem crossing, known as Kerem Shalom in Hebrew. On Wednesday, the first aid convoy entered Gaza directly from Jordan with 750 metric tonnes of food. The World Food Programme said half of Gaza’s population is starving and only 10 percent of the food required has entered Gaza since the war began on October 7. The US and Israel oppose a ceasefire, believing it would benefit only Hamas. Washington instead supports pauses in fighting to protect civilians and allow the release of captives taken by Hamas. Separately on Wednesday, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyehpaid his first visit to Egyptfor more than a month in a rare personal intervention in diplomacy amid hopes that the Palestinian group and Israel could agree terms for another truce. Haniyeh arrived in the Egyptian capital to meet with Cairo’s spy chief and other Egyptian officials who are acting as key mediators. Meanwhile, Israeli officials have indicated in talks with US and Qatari representatives that they could be open to a truce. The Hamas leader last travelled to Egypt in early November before the announcement of the only pause in the fighting so far, a weeklong truce that saw the release of about 110 of 240 captives taken by Hamas into Gaza on October 7. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller armed group that is also holding captives in Gaza, said its leader would also visit Egypt in the coming days to discuss a possible end to the war. A source briefed on the negotiations said envoys were discussing which of the captives still held by Palestinian groups could be freed in a new truce and what prisoners Israel might release in return, the Reuters news agency reported. But there remains a huge gulf between the two sides’ publicly stated positions on any halt to the fighting. Hamas rejects any further temporary pause and says it will discuss only a permanent ceasefire. Israel has ruled that out and says it will agree only limited humanitarian pauses until Hamas is defeated. US President Joe Biden said he did not expect an Israel-Hamas deal for the release of captives held in Gaza to be struck soon. “We’re pushing,” Biden told reporters during a trip to Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

Iraq’s governing Shia alliance strengthened in provincial elections,"The Iran-aligned coalition wins 101 out of 285 seats, and is boosted in advance of parliamentary elections in 2025.","Iraq’s governing Shia alliance has reportedly emerged as the biggest winner in the country’s provincial elections. The loose coalition of Shia groups, called theShia Coalition Framework (CF), took 101 of 285 council seats in the December 18 vote, Iraqi state mediareports. The election result is seen as a boon to the Iran-aligned groups, which have been steadily gaining influence, in advance of a parliamentary election scheduled for 2025. CF already forms the biggest bloc in Iraq’s parliament. The grouping ran three lists in the provincial election, but said they would govern together after the vote, the first such agreement in a decade. The victory will strengthen the CF’s influence over Iraq’s powerful provincial councils, which are responsible for appointing regional governors and allocating health, transport and education budgets. The Shia alliance’s top list, which won 43 seats, brings together several of Iraq’s most influential Iran-allied military-political groups, including the Badr Organisation and Asaib Ahl al-Haq. The second list, which took 35 seats, is headed by former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. The third, winning 23 seats, includes moderate Shia leader Ammar al-Hakim and former Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi. Together, the allied lists will control 101 seats in the provincial assemblies, more than any other bloc. The CF’s electoral success was aided in part by a boycott from one of its main rivals, the populist Shia leader Moqtada al-Sadr. Al-Sadr, whose partyresignedfrom parliament in 2022 after failing to form a governing coalition, called on his supporters to stay away from the polls so as not to grant legitimacy to a “corrupt” ruling class. Other contenders in Monday’s vote included Sunni business mogul Khamees Khanjar, whose list won 14 seats, and deposed Sunni Parliament Speaker Mohammed Halbousi, who took 22 seats, including winning the most votes in Baghdad and Anbar province. A host of local lists and smaller groups won the remaining seats. Despite fears of violence, the voting process unfolded largely peacefully, barring a few scattered incidents. In the al-Sadr bastion of Najaf, a stun grenade was hurled at a polling station, although it caused no injuries. Iraq’s election commission said six million peoplevotedin the polls, with a turnout rate of 41 percent. The results of the provincial polls, Iraq’s first in a decade, reflected the balance of power in a country where groups close to neighbouring Iran have steadily gained influence. They are a positive sign for Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, who counts on the winning CF alliance as his government’s main backer. Following the vote count, al-Sudani urged quick action to address the country’s development challenges. “I congratulate the political forces and successful candidates in the Provincial Council Elections,”saidal-Sudani on the social media platform X. “I hope this trust quickly transforms into tangible public service, contributing to the implementation of government plans for development, reconstruction, and service provision,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/20/iraqs-ruling-shia-alliance-tops-provincial-elections
Nearly 66 percent of jobs lost in Gaza since Israel-Hamas war broke out,"UN labour agency, Palestinian bureau note major spillover effect in occupied West Bank with one-third jobs wiped out.","Nearly 66 percent of jobs have been lost in the Gaza Strip since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas on October 7, according to new data from the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the Palestinian statistics office. Palestinians have seen their employment reduced by two-thirds in the Gaza Strip – equivalent to 192,000 jobs – since the outbreak of the war, the ILO and Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) said on Wednesday. The spillover effect on the economy of the occupied West Bank was also significant, with a one-third reduction in employment – equivalent to 276,000 jobs. Thedevastating lossin the job market in Gaza exacerbates the already dire conditions which prevailed in the blockaded territory even before the current conflict, “rendering it essentially uninhabitable”, the report said. Palestinians in Gaza have long grappled withpersistently high rates of poverty,vulnerability and one of the highest unemployment rates in the world, it noted. “The crisis has caused a huge distortion in the Palestinian economic structure,” said PCBS president Ola Awad. “The unemployment rate in the Gaza Strip now exceeds three-quarters of the labour force, and around a third of the West Bank’s labour force is unemployed, reaching the highest level of unemployment in decades.” This “humanitariancatastropheof epic proportions” that has wreaked havoc on the labour market will result in life-long hardship for the population and a complete dependency on international aid, the organisations said.  Peter Rademaker, ILO’s deputy regional director for Arab states, told Al Jazeera from Geneva that Palestinians in Gaza “will be in poverty for many months and years to come” because of Israel’s war on the enclave. “The labour market wasalready very depressedin the occupied West Bank and Gaza even before the war,” he said. “[As the war goes on] many people in Gaza and also West Bank will have no income, no wages. Nobody’s going to pay them any money and they will increasingly have to rely on international assistance,” added the deputy director. This will leave the people of Palestine in a state of dependency and in competition for a share of global distributions of aid money for many years to come. “Unfortunately, the authorities have no public financing to provide social assistance, so it’s going to have to come from the outside,” he explained. “As we all know, many crises are raging globally, and the chances of Palestine receiving the international aid it needs are not necessarily very high.” Nearly 40,000 buildings, or about 18 percent of all pre-conflict structures have been damaged or destroyed in the Gaza Strip since the conflict started, a UN assessment showed last week.

Are Houthi Red Sea attacks hurting Israel and disrupting global trade?,The Houthis attack ships in one of the busiest maritime routes as they demand that Israel end its brutal war in Gaza.,"Some of the largest shipping companies in the world have been forced to reroute their vessels at considerable costs after Yemen’s Houthi group targeted ships headed towards Israeli ports in solidarity with Palestinians. The Iran-aligned group has demanded that Israel allow humanitarian aid to enter Gaza, which has been reeling from more than two months of Israeli siege and bombardment. The Yemeni group has also called on Israel to end its brutal war on Gaza that has killed over 19,000 Palestinians. The United States on Tuesday announced theformation of a 10-nation coalitionto deter the attacks that threaten to disrupt trade passing through one of the busiest maritime routes in the world. Let’s take a look at who the Houthis are, just how much they are disrupting global trade, and what they can hope to achieve from it. The Houthis rebelled against Yemen’s internationally recognised government in 2014, starting fighting that led to a civil war that caused adevastating humanitariancrisis in the impoverished Arab nation. For years, with backing from Iran, they fought a military coalition led by neighbouring Saudi Arabia that also included Western and regional allies. However, the Yemeni conflict became a stalemate, with Saudi Arabia deciding to begin peace talks with the group after years of war. Also known as Ansar Allah, they now remain in control of most parts of Yemen, including the capital Sanaa and some of the western and northern parts close to Saudi Arabia. They command aconsiderable military arsenal, which includes a variety of drones and missiles – including ballistic antiship missiles that they have for the first time ever successfully used against vessels in the Red Sea. Earlier this year, Saudi Arabia agreed with Tehran, a close Houthi ally, to restore formal diplomatic ties after a seven-year rift. With the Yemeni talks and Iran rapprochement hanging in the balance, the kingdom has not joined the US-led military alliance. Other Arab heavyweights like the United Arab Emirates and Egypt have not joined either. The Houthis first launched missiles and drones at southern Israel in October, but they either did not reach their far-away targets – some 2,000km (1,240 miles) away – or were intercepted by Israel and its allies. But as Tel Aviv kept refusing international calls for a ceasefire, they significantlyramped up their strikes, leveraging their position near the Red Sea, and especially close to the narrow Bab al-Mandeb Strait that connects the Gulf of Aden to the southern part of the sea. They haveseized and kept in their portsa commercial vessel, they have attacked several more trade ships carrying everything from vehicles to foodstuffs, and the Pentagon claims some of their projectiles were travelling in the direction of US warships before being shot down. The Houthis have said ships with no links with Israel will have nothing to worry about, and they will only target vessels owned by Israel or taking goods to and from Israel. But tracking ownership of ships can be difficult, and some targeted companies have denied having ties with Israel. The Bab al-Mandeb is where 12 percent of the total global seaborne trade of oil, as well as 8 percent of liquified natural gas, passed through in the first half of 2023, according to the US Energy Information Administration. That is 8.8 million barrels per day of oil and 4.1 billion cubic feet per day of LNG. More than 17,000 ships pass through it each year, some heading to the Suez Canal that takes them to the Mediterranean and acts as the link between Asia and the West. Denmark’s AP Moller-Maersk, which accounts for 15 percent of the global container freight market, has been among several of the largest global names in the shipping industry toopt out of taking the route. Together with Germany’s Hapag-Lloyd, which has also pulled out, they account for almost a quarter of the market. Container rates for shipments from North Asia to the United Kingdom, which go through the Red Sea and Suez Canal, have hit record highs this year, according to assessments by S&P Global Platts. Underwriters are charging more to insure ships planning to take the route as well. Some shipping companies are choosing the only other maritime alternative – to take a much longer route around Africa. But that can mean increased costs, and it can add up to two weeks to their journey. The complications for shipping companies come amid another unfortunate incident for them as the vital Panama Canal has also faced a sharp decrease in the traffic it can handle due to drought. Israel, the first direct intended target of the Houthis, has already felt an impact from the disrupted maritime trade. Traffic through its southern port of Eilat, located in the city which is also a tourist destination, has come to a halt, and the foreseeable future seems uncertain as the war rages. Egypt, which was already facing anailing economybefore the war, could suffer heavily from the slowed trade, in addition to decreased transit fees for cargo going through the Suez Canal, something it is highly dependent on. Europe and states in the Mediterranean are poised to suffer the most losses if the current situation persists in the long term, as many of the ships taking cargo to and from those countries have been affected. The Houthis have steadily consolidated their power within Yemen over the years. It was inevitable for them to wish to secure recognition from the international community as the legitimate government in Yemen as well, according to Thomas Juneau, an assistant professor at the Graduate School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Ottawa. “They will not obtain that for the foreseeable future, but at the very least they want to force the international community to deal with them as the de facto governing authority in the country,” he told Al Jazeera. “In the context of the Gaza war, they want to demonstrate that they are a key member of the Iran-led ‘axis of resistance’ by showing their support for Hamas. As such, I expect their efforts to disrupt maritime traffic in the Red Sea to continue.” For their part, the Houthis have promised that theUS-led task force will not deter themand they are capable of turning the Red Sea into a “graveyard”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/20/are-houthi-red-sea-attacks-hurting-israel-and-disrupting-global-trade
Hamas head in Cairo as momentum builds towards new Israel-Hamas truce talks,"The visit comes as Israel’s government signals it is open to another truce, but key sticking points remain.","The head of Hamas’s political bureau has arrived in Cairo for talks on the Gaza war, as hopes grow that the Palestinian group and Israel could agree terms for another ceasefire. Ismail Haniyeh arrived in the Egyptian capital on Wednesday to meet with Cairo’s spy chief and other Egyptian officials, who are acting as key mediators. Meanwhile, Israeli officials have indicated in talks with US and Qatari representatives that Tel Aviv could be open to a truce deal. Haniyeh planned to discuss “stopping the aggression” in Gaza, a Hamas source told the AFP news agency. The world is pressing both Israel and the Palestinian group to agree terms to halt the bombardment in Gaza, which after 10 weeks of devastating Israeli attacks haskillednearly 20,000 people, including 7,729 children, and left 1.9 million displaced and in need of water, food and medicine. During a truce that ran from November 24 to December 1, international agencies were able to ship in desperately needed aid. Israel released240 Palestinian prisonersand Hamas returned 100 Israelis and others taken captive during its attacks on October 7, which killed around 1,200 and sparked Israel’s vicious retaliation on the enclave. Hamas took a total of 240 Israeli captives in an unprecedented assault on Israeli territory on October 7 that also killed 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians, Israel says, kicking off the current war. Israel has since continued to pound Gaza, claiming it must wipe out Hamas. But the two sides have recently relaunched indirect talks, mediated by Egypt and Qatar, aimed at instituting another ceasefire and freeing more captives in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. The talks in Cairo will also include a potential “agreement for the release of [Palestinian] prisoners”, the source said. Haniyeh’s visit comes after Israel’s government signalled that it could be open to agreeing another truce. Pressure is mounting on it to bring home the 129 captives Hamas still holds.    Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, speaking to captives’ families on Tuesday, said intensive diplomatic efforts were underway to bring back their relatives. This included aMonday meetingin Warsaw between Israel’s intelligence chief, Qatar’s prime minister, and the head of the US’s CIA, in which officials hammered out possible ceasefire conditions. That meeting was “quite positive”, said Al Jazeera’s Hashem Ahelbarra, reporting from Doha. He added that Qatari negotiators, who were the main brokers in the previous temporary ceasefire, are now “in touch with both Hamas and the Israelis on the potential to resume talks”. Israeli media reported that Tel Aviv is pursuing a “humanitarian” deal to secure the release by Hamas of female and elderly captives, as well as any that are physically or mentally ill. The government reportedly believes such a group would number 30-40 captives. However, the demands of Israel and Hamas reveal that there are major sticking points to any new deal remaining. Hardliners in the Israeli government and military officials are eyeingmore months of combat. Netanyahu, who is under significant political pressure at home, has pledged to continue Israel’s military offensive until achieving “full victory” over Hamas. Hamas, for its part, has said it will not release any more captivesuntil the Israeli bombardment ends. Haniyeh, speaking to Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian on Tuesday night, seemed to hold firm to this position, saying the group was ready for another deal, but only if Israel first ceased its attacks. “The problem this time is different interpretations from Israel and Hamas,” said Ahelbarra. “Hamas insists this time the deal cannot be a prisoner exchange solely – it has to be based on a permanent ceasefire.” In an interview with Al Jazeera, Hamas official Ghazi Hamad said that once the war stopped, Hamas is ready to negotiate a significant compromise on the exchange of prisoners. “Our vision is very clear: We want to stop the aggression,” he said. “What is going on in the ground is a big catastrophe.” However, he added that brief pauses in the conflict would not be in the interest of Hamas or Palestinians. “Israel will take the card of the hostages and after that they will start a new round of mass killing and massacres against our people,” he said. “We will not play this game.” However, Ahelbarra noted that there are “strong indications that there is a push by all parties to come up with an agreement” in the upcoming days.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/20/hamass-haniyeh-in-cairo-amid-new-ceasefire-push
‘Barely a drop’: UN warns water shortages a deadly risk for Gaza children,"Water and sanitation services are at the point of collapse with large-scale disease outbreaks looming, UNICEF warns.","Limited access to clean water and sanitation amid Israel’s relentless bombardment pose a grave risk to children in Gaza, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has warned. Huge masses of displaced people herded into the southern Gaza Strip by the war are accessing only 1.5 to 2 litres of water per day, well below the recommended requirement for survival, the UN agency stated on Wednesday. The crisis, antagonised by limited aid deliveries and the destruction of infrastructure, puts huge numbers of vulnerable children at risk of disease, it added. Pushed by Israel’s continued onslaught across the enclave, hundreds of thousands of people, around half of them estimated to be children, have been pushed into the city of Rafah since early December, and are in desperate need of food, water, shelter, medicines and protection, UNICEF said. As demand continues to rise, water and sanitation systems in the city are in an extremely critical state. UNICEF says that 3 litres are required daily for survival. The amount rises to 15 litres if water required for washing and cooking is also counted. “Access to sufficient amounts of clean water is a matter of life and death, and children in Gaza have barely a drop to drink,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. “Children and their families are having to use water from unsafe sources that are highly salinated or polluted. Without safe water, many more children will die from deprivation and disease in the coming days.” Using unsafe water and lack of hygiene is a “dramatic” risk factor for children, who are more vulnerable to waterborne disease, dehydration and malnutrition, according to UNICEF. Humanitarian aid deliveries simply do not meet theneeds of the populationfor basic survival. This causes a shortage in water and hygiene products that is further compounded by the fact that a large percentage of sanitation facilities have been either destroyed or simply cannot accommodate the large number of displaced Palestinians congregating in specific locations. “We are doing everything we can to meet the needs of the people in Gaza, but the equipment and supplies we’ve managed to provide are far from enough,” said Russell. “The constant bombing, along with the restrictions on materials and fuel allowed into the territory, are preventing critical progress. We urgently need these supplies to repair damaged water systems.” Doctors and aid workers have beenwarningof the spread of disease and epidemics, since the start of Israel’s“indiscriminate” bombing campaignafter Hamas’s October 7 Hamas attacks. According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO), from November 29 to December 10, cases of diarrhoea in children under five jumped 66 percent to 59,895, and increased by 55 percent for the rest of the population. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairssaidlast week that the WHO has reported cases of meningitis, chickenpox, jaundice and upper respiratory tract infections as well. The UN health agency cautioned that the figures likely did not provide the full picture because of a lack of complete information with thehealth systemand other services in Gaza near collapse.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/20/un-warns-lack-of-clean-water-in-gaza-poses-deadly-risk-for-children
Kuwait’s new emir Sheikh Mishal takes oath of office,"The new leader, seen as a reformist, pledged to adhere to constitutional principles and fight corruption.","Kuwait’s new emir, Sheikh Mishal al-Ahmad al-Sabah, has been formally sworn in before parliament to begin his rule over the wealthy Gulf monarchy. The new emir, who took over after the passing of his half-brother, Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmad al-Sabah, on Saturday, took the oath of office during a special session of the National Assembly on Wednesday morning. In his inaugural address, Sheikh Mishal pledged to safeguard the country and its people, adhere to constitutional principles and fight corruption. “I swear by Almighty Allah to respect the constitution and the laws of the state, to defend the liberties, interests and properties of the people and to safeguard the independence and territorial integrity of the country,” he declared. The 83-year-old Sheikh Mishal is Kuwait’s third ruler in just over three years. He has already been de facto leader since 2021 when the frail Sheikh Nawaf handed over most of his duties. Sheikh Mishal previously served as deputy chief of the National Guard from 2004 to 2020 and head of State Security for 13 years after joining the Ministry of Interior in the 1960s. As he takes the helm of the OPEC oil producer, he is expected to preserve key Kuwaiti foreign policies, including support for Gulf Arab unity and Western alliances. Good relations with Saudi Arabia are seen as one of his top priorities. The new emir may also look to expand ties to China as Beijing seeks a bigger role in the region. Political analyst Hussain Jamal told Al Jazeera that Kuwait’s foreign policy would likely “remain as it is” under the new emir. “Zero enemies and a lot of friends – regionally and internationally.” As leader, Sheikh Mishal will also have to grapple with long-running strains between the ruling family and its critics in the perpetually deadlocked and fractious parliament. Critics complain that the friction has hindered fiscal and economic reform. In 2022, Sheikh Mishal intervened in a protracted dispute between the government and parliament. He dissolved parliament, decreed new elections and replaced the prime minister, but declared no intention to interfere in the vote or the selection of parliament speaker. After being sworn in, Sheikh Mishal castigated authorities for having previously appointed people to positions “that are not consistent with the simplest rules of justice and fairness”. He also stressed “the importance of follow-up, responsible oversight, and objective accountability within the framework of the constitution and the law for negligence, dereliction and tampering with the interests of citizens”. Abdulaziz Mohammed Al-Anjeri, of the Kuwaiti think tank Reconnaissance Research, told Al Jazeera, Sheikh Mishal was likely to rule as a “reformist”. “He is someone who does not allow nepotism or favourtism to impact his decisions,” Al-Anjeri said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/20/kuwaits-new-emir-sheikh-meshal-takes-oath-of-office
‘Remove him’: Sudan army chief al-Burhan faces calls to go after RSF gains,"After losing another big city in Sudan’s civil war, army chief al-Burhan is facing pressure from the public and some of his own generals to step down.","The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has capturedSudan’s second-largest city, just a day after the army and its supporters prematurely celebrated repelling an attack. As army soldiers retreated from Wad Madani – once a hub for hundreds of thousands of displaced people – they left civilians behind. The army has released a rare statement acknowledging that its troops withdrew too quickly and promising an investigation, yet their supporters are calling for accountability. “On Sunday we actually celebrated with the rest of Wad Madani,” said Noon Arbab*, a young woman now searching for a way out of the city with her family. “Now I think it was all a big lie.” “I think we should throw the army’s entire leadership away,” she added. Countless civilians like Arbab are calling for army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan to step down in the hope that a new leader can thwart the RSF’s advances. Al-Burhan’s subordinates are also furious with the way he is fighting the war, according to sources close to security forces. But experts warn that a change of guard could lead to a power struggle – or vacuum – fracturing the Sudanese army. “Despite the position that al-Burhan finds himself in, I think if he leaves – however that happens – it will leave an indelible mark on the Sudanese army,” said Kholood Khair, an expert on Sudan and founding director of the think tank Confluence Advisory. Losing legitimacy Since the RSF captured Wad Madani, many of the army’ssupportershave taken to social media to call on generals to replace al-Burhan. The sentiment is widely shared among civilians who are terrified that the RSF could attack their towns and cities next. The RSF tends to loot homes, markets and banks in every city it conquers, as well as subjectwomen to sexual violence. “All of the citizens want the removal of al-Burhan. He is the reason for all of the cities and provinces falling to the RSF,” said Yousif Ibrahim*. “I still don’t understand why the army just left Wad Madani. Wad Madani is where so many displaced people from Khartoum sought refuge.” Hamid Khalafallah, a Sudanese analyst and PhD candidate at the University of Manchester, where he researches democratic transitions in Africa, said most of the army’s traditional supporters feel betrayed. He added that his father had fled Wad Madani on Sunday, but soldiers told him to return after claiming that they defeated the RSF. The next day, his father fled again when the RSF stormed the city. “Military troops in [nearby towns] were advising people to go back … what the military has done has led to a feeling of betrayal,” Khalafallah told Al Jazeera. “People [in this region] won’t support the RSF, but they feel lost. They don’t know who to turn to now.” Coup d’etat? One week before Wad Madani fell to the RSF, a former army officer told Al Jazeera that most generals view al-Burhan as a weak leader. But he stressed that nobody was going to topple him to preserve a strong chain of command for the duration of the war. “As soon as the war ends, Burhan is gone,” the former officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal, told Al Jazeera. Al-Burhan may be more vulnerable after the fall of Wad Madani, according to two Sudanese journalists who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the topic. “There has been some movement in the army, but nobody knows what exactly is going on,” one journalist, who has close contacts in security services, told Al Jazeera. Another Sudanese journalist said army generals have not removed him because they cannot agree on who should replace him. “They need someone with experience, charisma, and [who is] not tainted. Getting those three in one is hard,” the journalist told Al Jazeera. Desperate attempt? Over the course of the war, al-Burhan has tried to brand himself as Sudan’s de facto head of state, with some success. As a result, experts say that any attempt to remove him could hurt the army’s political leverage over the RSF, which most Arab and Western states still widely view as an irregular militia. “Even if [generals] managed to avoid a split in the army, any leadership change risks rocking the army’s foreign relations at a very delicate time or looking like an act of desperation,” said Alan Boswell, an expert on the Horn of Africa for International Crisis Group, a non-profit dedicated to ending and preventing conflict worldwide. Khair, from Confluence Advisory, adds that al-Burhan remains the perfect scapegoat for an army on the cusp of losing complete control of Sudan. “Al-Burhan has a lot of the public ire … and frankly there is a lot more public ire to come if things keep going the way they are going for the [military].” Khair also said that generals loyal to former President Omar al-Bashir, and who are members of the Islamic movement in Sudan, may topple al-Burhan if the RSF conquers cities such as Atbara and Shendi. Both River Nile cities are home to military and political elites who have ruled Sudan since it acquired independence in 1956. “Al-Burhan is the perfect fall guy … but now is not the time to get rid of him,” Khair told Al Jazeera. “Army officers may wait until the RSF takes a place like Shendi and sacrifice him then.” “My sense is that his days are numbered.” * Some names have been changed to protect individuals from reprisal.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/20/remove-him-sudan-army-chief-al-burhan-faces-calls-to-go-after-rsf-gains
Malaysia bans Israel-flagged ships from its ports in response to Gaza war,PM says Israel’s actions ‘violate international law through the ongoing massacre and brutality against Palestinians’.,"Malaysia has banned all Israeli-flagged cargo ships from docking at its ports in what it said was a response to the war in Gaza, accusing Israel of violating international law through the “massacre and brutality against Palestinians”. On Wednesday, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim announced the decision to impose the maritime ban on Israel-affiliated vessels – singling out ZIM, Israel’s largest shipping firm – amid growing alarm over disruptions to global shipping as a result ofattacks on cargo shipsin the Red Sea. Ships on their way to Israel will also be barred from loading cargo at any port in the Southeast Asian nation with immediate effect, Anwar said in a statement. Malaysia, where about 60 percent of the population is Muslim, does not maintain diplomatic relations with Israel and advocates for a two-state solution to theIsrael-Palestine conflict. “The Malaysian government decided to block and disallow the Israeli-based shipping company ZIM from docking at any Malaysian port,” Anwar said. The restrictions are a response “to Israel’s actions that ignore basic humanitarian principles and violate international law through the ongoing massacre and brutality against Palestinians”. Malaysia “also decided to no longer accept ships using the Israeli flag to dock in the country” and ban “any ship on its way to Israel from loading cargo in Malaysian ports”. “Both of these restrictions are effective immediately,” the prime minister said. Malaysia hasdonated millionsof dollars in aid to Gaza and Anwar has vocally supported the Palestinian cause and condemned Israel’s bombardment of Gaza since October 7. At least 19,667 Palestinians havebeen killedin Israeli attacks since the war started in October. The death toll from Hamas’s attack on Israel, which triggered the current conflict,standsat nearly 1,140. Kuala Lumpur has a longstanding relationship with Hamas. Malaysia’s ban comes at a time of major disruptions to shipping routes as the Red Sea passage is jeopardised due toattacks by Yemen’s Houthirebels in the world’s main East-West trade route. The Red Sea is linked to the Mediterranean by the Suez Canal, which creates the shortest shipping route between Europe and Asia. About 12 percent of world shipping traffic transits the canal. Container ships traversing these waters have either switched off tracking systems or have anchored as companies try to reroute and adjust prices. This week, theUnited States announcedthe launch of a multinational force to protect trade in the Red Sea after the Houthi attacks forced many shipping lines to suspend operations.

US sanctions network accused of supplying Iran’s drone production,Tehran is suspected of supplying UAVs to Russia and Middle Eastern proxies.,"The United States has imposed sanctions on a network accused of evading trade restrictions to supply Iran with components to build drones. The US Treasury Department on Tuesdayannouncedthe measures have been implemented against a web of foreign front companies that have been sending Tehran sensitive equipment. Iranian-built unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being used in the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine. The sanctions target 10 entities and four individuals. The firms affected include “intermediary companies, front companies, and logistics businesses” based in Iran, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Indonesia. The network, the US Treasury says, has procured hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of foreign components for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Aerospace Force Self-Sufficiency Jihad Organization, an Iranian research and development unit that builds cybe-warfare equipment and weaponry. Iran is supplying UAVs to its “terrorist proxies in the Middle East and to Russia,” the US administration added. The US Justice Department also unsealed an indictment on Tuesday against Hossein Hatefi Ardakani, the alleged leader of the network. Iran-based Ardakani is charged with conspiring to illegally buy and export US-made microelectronics to Iran. According to the indictment, Ardakani and his co-conspirators, including a Chinese national named Gary Lam, used foreign companies to evade US export controls on sensitive equipment. “Ardakani and his co-conspirators crafted a sophisticated web of front companies to obscure the illicit acquisition of US and foreign technology to procure components for deadly UAVs,” US special agent Michael Krol said. “These very components have been found in use by Iran’s allies in current conflicts, including in Ukraine.” Washington has long accused Tehran of supplying weapons, including drones, to Russia for use in Ukraine, where it has been locked in awarfor 22 months. Iran denies providing Russia with drones. Russia has launched almost nightly attacks using UAVs on Ukrainian cities and infrastructure in recent weeks. Kyiv said on Wednesday that it had destroyed 18 out of 19 attack drones launched at the country overnight. In a statement announcing the indictments, US attorney Matthew Groves said the US remains “focused on disrupting the efforts of Iran and its agents to circumvent US sanctions in support of Iran’s weapons programs, including its drone program, which have been used to support and supply terrorist organizations and other foreign adversaries – such as Russia – around the globe”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/20/us-unveils-new-sanctions-against-iran-linked-drone-component-suppliers
Israel signals readiness for new temporary truce in Gaza as pressure mounts,Hamas says it will not enter negotations over releasing captives until Israel ends its war on Gaza.,"Israeli President Isaac Herzog has said his country is willing to agree a new temporary truce with Hamas in Gaza to secure the release of morecaptivesheld by the Palestinian group. “Israel is ready for another humanitarian pause and additional humanitarian aid in order to enable the release of hostages,” Herzog told a gathering of ambassadors on Tuesday. The comments come amid growing international pressure on Israel to pause its assault on Gaza and to allow more humanitarian aid into the besieged territory. A previous Israel-Hamas agreement mediated by Qatar and Egypt led to a week-long truce at the end of November during which Hamas released 86 women and children it was holding in exchange for 240 Palestinian women and teenagers held in Israeli jails. Hamas also released 24 foreign nationals during the pause in fighting. Qatar’s Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, who also serves as the Gulf state’s foreign minister, Mossad Director David Barnea and CIA Director Bill Burns held talks in Poland on Monday to discuss a potential new deal to secure the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinians in Israeli prisons and a humanitarian pause in the fighting. “The talks were positive with negotiators exploring and discussing different proposals in an attempt to progress on negotiations,” a source briefed on the diplomatic efforts told the Reuters news agency. “An agreement is not expected imminently, however.” Hamas said in a statement on Tuesday that it rejects any forms of negotiations about prisoner exchanges “under the continuing Israeli genocidal war.” The Palestinian group said it is open to any initiative that contributes to “ending the aggression” and opening border crossings “to bring in aid and provide relief to the Palestinian people.” Al Jazeera’s Bernard Smith said the statements from Herzog and Hamas on Tuesday indicate some progression towards a potential truce. “The question will be whether it is just that, a pause – a humanitarian pause – as the Israelis would call it, or a full ceasefire,” Smith said, reporting from Tel Aviv.    The war has flattened large parts of northern Gaza and driven most of the population to the southern part of the besieged territory, where many are in crowded shelters and tent camps. Some 1.9 million Palestinians – about 90 percent of Gaza’s population – have fled their homes. At least 19,667 people, mostly women and children, have been killed in the Israeli assault on Gaza since, according to Palestinian health authorities. Israel launched the assault on Gaza after Hamas fighters from the territory stormed into southern Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking about 240 others hostage, according to Israeli officials. Israel is facing growing international pressure to scale back its offensive as the civilian death toll in Gaza continues to soar. France, the United Kingdom and Germany on Sunday added their voices to calls for a ceasefire, while US President Joe Biden last week called the bombing “indiscriminate”. The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) isexpected to votelater on Tuesday on a resolution calling for a halt to the fighting in Gaza. Earlier, the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said the war in Gaza is a “moral failure” of the international community, calling on Israel and Hamas to reach a new truce to halt the fighting. “I have been speaking of moral failure because every day this continues is a day more where the international community hasn’t proven capable of ending such high levels of suffering and this will have an impact on generations not only in Gaza,” ICRC president Mirjana Spoljaric told journalists in Geneva following trips to the Gaza Strip and Israel.

‘We have a duty’: US doctor says ceasefire an ‘ethical imperative’ in Gaza,"Doctors continue to weigh calls for ceasefire in Gaza, with some some saying doing so is a professional responsibility.","Of all thedoctors and medical personnelkilled in Gaza this year, Dr Osaid Alser estimates he knew half personally. Alser, a researcher and resident at the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in the United States, grew up in Gaza City, Palestine’s largest city. He began his medical career there, starting as a student and eventually becoming a teacher himself. But since the start of the war in Gaza on October 7, Alser has watched as Israeli bombs have rained down on his hometown and military forces have stormed into medical centres. The result has been the near collapse of Gaza’s healthcare system. Only 11 hospitals — a third of those in the enclave — remain operational, with dwindling amounts of fuel and medical supplies. Faced with the death and destruction in Gaza, Alser felt compelled to speak up. “We have a duty to say: Stop the war and ceasefire now,” he told Al Jazeera. To him, calling for a ceasefire was anethical imperative, not a political statement. But not all healthcare providers feel the same way. Many feel an obligation to avoid commenting on conflicts, as part of a tradition that views medical workers as above the fray. However, the intensity of the war — and its particular toll on Gaza’s health system — have spurred some to ask: When do medical professionals have a responsibility to speak out? Thedebateerupted last month with a meeting of the American Medical Association (AMA), the largest professional organisation for physicians in the US. Its House of Delegates, which sets the organisation’s policies, declined to debate a resolution that would have called for a ceasefire in Gaza. According to the publication MedPage Today, some of the delegates felt the resolution would force them to decide whether the conflict in Gaza was a “’just war’ or ‘unjust war’”. That, they said, was not their role. The concept of so-called “medical neutrality” stretches back to a history of civilian involvement in battlefield medical care, with some volunteer nurses tending to the sick and wounded on both sides of a conflict.    International law has since developed to protect the roles healthcare workers have in warfare, making it a war crime to intentionally attack medical personnel. But “medical neutrality” does not necessarily mean impartiality. And some medical ethicists point out that the scale of the Gaza conflict has raised dire questions. “The concern that a lot of people are having is that this is not business as usual,” Harold Braswell, an associate professor of healthcare ethics at Saint Louis University, told Al Jazeera. “Israel has dropped an enormous amount of bombs on a highly condensed civilian area in a very, very short period of time. And that has created a very, very urgent situation.” Gaza, a narrow strip only 11km (7 miles) wide and 40km (25 miles) long, is home to 2.3 million people. Palestinian health authorities estimate that at least 19,453 people have been killed, two-thirds of them women and children. A further 1.9 million have been displaced, with tens of thousands living in the streets of Rafah after Israel ordered civilians to flee south. Humanitarian organisations have warned of healthcare workers being killed, as bombs drop on hospitals and ambulance convoys. Alser, the doctor in Texas, has taken it upon himself to sketch out the scale of the impact. He and his brother, also a doctor, launched an initiative last month to track the number of healthcare workers killed. So far, they have documented 278 killed since the start of the war. That includes 104 physicians, 87 nurses and 87 others working in various medical roles. “That includes a lot of my friends, my mentors, even my own medical students that I taught back in 2017, who went on to become doctors and have been killed,” Alser said. 6.12.2023 Update: IOF murdered 278 healthcare workers and kidnapped 41 just in the past 60 days.#NotATarget#Palestine#Gaza#Gaza_Genocide#WarCrimes#CeasefireNOW#WestBank#freedom#freepalestine#Palestine_Genocide#Gaza_Holocaustpic.twitter.com/kykaAaK6SX — Healthcare Workers Watch – Palestine (@HCWWatch)December 7, 2023  “We’ve been documenting the names of course, because they’re not just numbers, and we’re posting their stories from people we know and trust on the ground.” In addition, Israel has detained more than 40 health workers, includingDr Muhammad Abu Salmiya— the director of Gaza’s largest hospital, al-Shifa — and Alser’s former student, Dr Saleh Eleiwa. The rising numbers left Alser feeling no choice but to speak out. “I just felt like we absolutely have to talk about this,” he said. “So that’s really the motivation: Seeing our colleagues, friends, family being killed — doctors, professionals who just work in medicine [and] go home after they work for many, many hours and they get killed.” Alser is not alone. The American Public Health Association (APHA), the largest professional body for public health workers in the US, issued an appeal last month for an immediate ceasefire, amid pressure from its members. Healthcare labour unions and advocacy groups have likewise called for a ceasefire. And more than 100 faculty members at public health and medical schools signed a letter this month urging the US government to support a ceasefire. US President Joe Biden has thus faravoided pressingfor a ceasefire, citing Israel’s right to “defend itself” after the Hamas attack on October 7. But members of the medical community are divided over how much pressure to place on Israel and whether its acts of war have reached a threshold that demands a unified ethical stance. Much of that division has centred on whether the attacks on healthcare centres in Gaza amount to war crimes. In a widely circulated opinion piece published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Dr Matthew Wynia argued that health professionals do indeed have a responsibility to speak out on the war and denounce any crimes committed under international humanitarian law. But he sees the issue as far from settled, citingIsrael’s claimsthat Hamas fighters are using Gaza’s medical facilities “for offensive purposes, which can make striking them legal under limited circumstances”.    Even in those instances, however, Wynia said there were limits to the extent to which violence could be justified. “If a facility is being used to hide military equipment and personnel, for example, any proposed strike on it must still ‘minimise’ potential harm to civilians, and the military value of the strike must be ‘proportionate’ to the civilian harms it might cause,” Wynia wrote. In an email to Al Jazeera, Wynia said he fundamentally considers himself a pacifist and would personally support a ceasefire. However, he added, “unless we posit that all doctors are ethically obliged to be pacifists, then I don’t think we can say that calling for a ceasefire in this war is an ethical obligation for all doctors”. “And to be consistent, this would mean also calling for a ceasefire in Ukraine and in all other wars,” he said. Wynia’s opinion piece sparked a backlash in the medical community, with some readers saying it relied too heavily on narratives put forth by Israel. Alser was among them. He and two colleagues — Canadian-Palestinian doctor Tarek Loubani, and Norwegian physician Mads Gilbert — wrote a response saying Wynia’s article lacked ethical clarity. The article “muddied the moral intuitions held by many of us that attacking hospitals, infrastructure, and health care workers is wrong”, they wrote. All three doctors had worked previously in Gaza. They said they had “never come across militants operating from within a hospital or restricting access to certain hospital areas”.    For its part, Israel’s militaryhas releasedvideos of weapons allegedly found in medical centres and given media tours of tunnels under the al-Shifa Hospital. No independent investigation has been conducted. The Israeli doctor Zohar Lederman also said there should be no ethical ambiguity when it comes to the Israeli military’s siege of hospitals in Gaza. “One of the most sophisticated militaries in the world should not murder hundreds of vulnerable patients, including patients receiving dialysis and newborns in incubators, who have nowhere else to go,” he wrote in his own response. Wynia has since answered his critics with another, shorter article, saying medical professionals should condemn “both illegal use of and attacks on health care facilities” and war crimes committed by either side. He also emphasised that there remains a diversity of opinions “on the ethics of Israel’s approach to this war”. “In fact, I can attest that there are, and Israel’s defenders and critics are equally convinced they hold the moral high ground,” he said. For Alser, the debate further underscores the need for Palestinian perspectives in discussions about the war, regardless of any professional repercussions he may face. The 31-year-old doctor remained on call as the fighting began, watching the war in his homeland late at night or early in the morning. In the weeks since the fighting started, his mother, five siblings, nieces and nephews have been displaced six times. They too briefly stayed at al-Shifa Hospital, before fleeing to Khan Younis and eventually Rafah. They are currently living in a tent. Alser explained that, as the Israeli siege continues and food runs scarce, they face malnourishment. “For me, it was time to speak up and speak up more — to advocate for my family and call for protection for my friends, my people,” he said. “So, instead of just sitting at home crying and just doing nothing, I kind of shifted that energy to more like doing something good.” “We’re being advocates,” he added, “and advocacy is a very important part of medicine”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/19/we-have-a-duty-us-based-doctor-says-ceasefire-an-ethical-imperative-in-gaza
Can the US-led maritime force stop Yemen’s Houthi attacks during Gaza war?,"The Houthis say they won’t stop attacking ships unless Israel stops its attacks on Gaza. So far, the shipping industry doesn’t appear convinced the task force can halt them.","The United States has announced the establishment of a new multinational maritime security force in response to attacks on ships launched by Iran-aligned Houthi rebels in Yemen. The initiative is aimed at ensuring ships can pass through busy waterways near Yemen safely as the Houthis have beentargeting vesselsin protest of Israel’s war on Gaza, which has killed more than 19,000 Palestinians. But what will the task force do, how will it work and how effective could it be? US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced theestablishment of a 10-country forceon Tuesday in Bahrain. In addition to the Arab nation, the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, the Seychelles and Spain have agreed to join Washington in the new mission. Some of the countries are expected to conduct joint patrols in the southern parts of the Red Sea, the Bab al-Mandeb Strait and the Gulf of Aden while others will support the force by providing intelligence. The mission will be coordinated by Combined Task Force 153 (CTF 153), an existing force under a US-led joint effort established in April 2022 with the aim of improving maritime security in the area. The existing framework has 39 member nations, and there are reports that other countries could join or have already agreed to join the newly formed 10-member maritime effort but don’t want it publicised. The Houthis have promised to stand up to any US-led efforts and only stop their attacks once Israel stops its war in Gaza. They have signalled they are open to talks, but diplomacy has so far failed to stop their attacks. For its part, Iran has warned Washington that its joint maritime effortwill face “extraordinary problems”. The Houthi group, also known as Ansarallah, started its operations against Israel by launching missiles and drones on the southern parts of Israel, including the port and tourist city of Eilat, in October soon after the war started. Most of the projectiles were intercepted by Israeli and US defences or fell short due to the roughly 2,000km (1,240-mile) distance between the two countries. So the Houthis changed tactics, instead focusing on ships near their shores. They have been firing missiles and launching attack drones at commercial ships that they claim are linked to Israel andseized a vessel last monththat they are still holding in a Yemeni port. Their attacks have stopped many ships from making their way to Israel. “The Houthis are feeling emboldened. They perceive that they have won the civil war in Yemen and that their position is unchallenged domestically,” said Thomas Juneau, an assistant professor at the Graduate School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Ottawa whose research focuses on the Middle East, especially Iran and Yemen. “They also probably assess that the US and its regional partners are keen to avoid an escalation of the war in Gaza into a full-blown regional war.” At least 12 shipping companies havesuspended transit through the Red Seadue to the Houthi attacks. They include some of the largest in the world: Denmark’s AP Moller-Maersk, Germany’s Hapag-Lloyd, the Italian-Swiss Mediterranean Shipping Company and France’s CMA CGM.  Markets, including the oil and gas market, have increasingly reacted to the attacks, especially considering the volume of cargo being redirected. For instance, Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd together operate almost a quarter of the world’s shipping fleet. Bab al-Mandeb, thenarrow waterway that separatesEritrea and Djibouti on the Horn of Africa from Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula, is where 10 percent of the world’s seaborne crude oil travels. More than 17,000 ships pass through it each year. It is less than 20km (12 miles) wide, far narrower than the more than 200km (124 miles) of the northern parts of the Red Sea. The direct impact on oil prices has been relatively limited so far, but experts have warned that thingscould significantly escalateif the attacks continue and security remains an issue. Insurance premiums and prices of oil and gas products are expected to rise if the conflict is not resolved. “The Houthis will not be deterred to stop these strikes easily,” Juneau told Al Jazeera. Some of the member nations of the task force have warships in the Red Sea. Two US navy destroyers, the USS Carney and USS Mason, are sailing through the Bab al-Mandeb Strait. The idea is for the warships to serve as a deterrent to Houthi attacks and to stop them when possible. The naval ships won’t necessarily escort commercial vessels through the Red Sea but will be on standby to respond to attacks. It’s complicated. Houthi fighters landed a helicopter on a ship last month to capture it. The presence of task force military vessels nearby could make a repeat of such a move harder. The task force’s warships could also strike down incoming missiles from Yemen, just as they have intercepted rockets headed towards Israel. But even Israel’s much-touted Iron Dome missile defence system doesn’t have a 100 percent track record of stopping incoming rockets. So far, the US has not fired back at Yemen. “It will be difficult for the recently announced, US-led coalition to fully deter the Houthis and put an end to their disruption of maritime shipping,” Juneau said. At this point, the markets appear unconvinced that the task force will be able to protect shipments through the Red Sea. On Tuesday, Maersk said it was rerouting its ships around Africa to avoid sending them through the Bab al-Mandeb Strait.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/19/can-the-new-us-led-maritime-force-stop-houthi-attacks-during-gaza-war
Yemen’s Houthis ‘will not stop’ Red Sea attacks until Israel ends Gaza war,US launches maritime coalition to counter attacks the rebel group says are a response to Israeli ‘crimes’ in Gaza Strip.,"Yemen’s Houthis will not halt attacks on ships linked to Israel in the Red Sea, despite the United States announcing a newmaritime protection forceto counter them, a spokesperson for the rebel group said. “Even if America succeeds in mobilising the entire world, our military operations will not stop … no matter the sacrifices it costs us,” Mohammed al-Bukhaiti, a senior Houthi official, said in a post on X on Tuesday. The Houthis would only halt their attacks if Israel’s “crimes in Gaza stop and food, medicines and fuel are allowed to reach its besieged population”, al-Bukhaiti said. He spoke after US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austinannounceda coalition on Monday to protect trade in the Red Sea after the attacks forced shipping lines to suspend operations. The Iran-linked Houthis have waged attacks on more than a dozen commercial ships in an attempt to pressure Israel to end its bombardment of the Gaza Strip. “These reckless Houthi attacks are a serious international problem and they demand a firm international response,” Austin said about the new 10-nation coalition. He said the force would operate “with the goal of ensuring freedom of navigation for all countries and bolstering regional security and prosperity”.  After the US announcement, Houthi Major General Yusuf al-Madani said in a statement: “Any escalation in Gaza is an escalation in the Red Sea … Any country or party that comes between us and Palestine, we will confront it.” Spokesperson al-Bukhaiti told Al Jazeera on Monday that the group would confront any US-led coalition in the Red Sea. “You have the military establishment in Yemen, in the areas controlled by the Houthis, warning that they will continue to target ships cruising through the Bab el-Mandeb strait and the Red Sea and they insist they are doing this to protect people in Gaza, in particular,” Al Jazeera’s Hashem Ahelbarra said, reporting from Doha on Tuesday. “A top Houthi official, Mohammed Abdulsalam, who is also a senior negotiator, said the attacks by the Houthis are not an act of defiance but if this new coalition is adamant on launching attacks, then they will have to bear the consequences of what he described as a broader conflict in the region. “But he said at the same time that the Houthis are still adamant on the need for the Israelis to stop the war if they want the Houthis to stop the attacks,” our correspondent added. On Tuesday, Abdulsalam told Reuters news agency that the US-led naval patrol mission is “essentially unnecessary” – as all waters near Yemen are still safe, except for Israel-linked ships or vessels travelling to Israel. The US and British navies said over the weekend that their destroyers had shot down a total of 15 drones in the waterway. In the latest incident on Tuesday, the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations, said four small boats, each carrying four to five people, approached a vessel off the coast of Djibouti in a “suspicious” manoeuvre – but that no weapons were seen during the incident. At least 12 shipping companies, including the Italian-Swiss giant Mediterranean Shipping Company, France’s CMA CGM and Denmark’s AP Moller-Maersk, havesuspendedtransit through the Red Sea due to safety concerns. UK oil giant BP on Monday became the latest firm to announce it would avoid the waters. About 12 percent of global trade passes through the Red Sea, which connects to the Mediterranean Sea via the Suez Canal. Houthi attacks have effectively rerouted a significant portion of trade by forcing freight companies to sail around Africa, imposing higher costs and delays for energy, food and consumer goods deliveries. Ahmed Helal, MENA director at The Global Counsel, told Al Jazeera the “cascading impact” of the crisis is on inflation. “Major central banks have been cutting interest rates to combat inflation and bring prices down for consumers. But this disruption in a major global trade artery affects regular goods and energy, both oil and natural gas,” he said. He added that because of the Houthi attacks, and the ongoing disruption of natural gas supplies to Europe as a result of the Ukraine war, “European natural gas prices jump by 12 percent, UK natural gas prices jump by 10 percent, and the price of oil also jumped by 4 percent in the past 24 hours”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/19/yemens-houthis-will-not-stop-red-sea-attacks-until-israel-stops-gaza-war
Israeli attack on residential area in south Gaza kills at least 29 people,"Three buildings are destroyed in the attack in Rafah, and separate strike in Jabalia refugee camp kills at least 13 people.","At least 29 Palestinians have been killed in an Israeli air strike in a residential area of Rafah in southern Gaza while a hospital has been raided in north Gaza and 13 people were killed in an attack on a refugee camp in that part of the enclave. Tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians have crammed into Rafah on Gaza’s border with Egypt to escape Israeli bombardments farther north despite fears that they will also not be safe there. “Three residential buildings in one area were destroyed in the attack,” Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud said from Rafah on Tuesday. The number of casualties was expected to rise as more bodies were pulled from the rubble, under which people were also trapped, he said. Journalist Adel Zoroub was among the 29 people killed in the air raid in Rafah, the Government Media Office in Gaza said on its Telegram channel. Separately, at least 13 Palestinians were killed and many more injured in an Israeli air raid on the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Health in the enclave said. Fierce battles raged in northern Gaza, where Hamas continues to put up stiff resistance across what is now a battered wasteland seven weeks after Israeli tanks and soldiers stormed in.    Ashraf al-Qudra, the Ministry of Health spokesperson in Gaza, said on Tuesday that Israeli forces turned al-Awda Hospital in northern Gaza into barracks after detaining more than 240 people. Those being held included “80 hospital staff, 40 patients and 120 displaced people inside the hospital”, he said. They arrested six of the hospital’s staff, including the director of the facility, Ahmed Muhanna, according to al-Qudra. Israeli forces also raided Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City overnight and into Tuesday, according to the church that operates it, destroying a wall at its front entrance and detaining most of its staff. Don Binder, a pastor at St George’s Anglican Cathedral in occupied East Jerusalem, which runs the hospital, was quoted by The Associated Press news agency as saying that the raid left just two doctors, four nurses and two janitors to tend to more than 100 seriously wounded patients with no running water or electricity. “It has been a great mercy for the many wounded in Gaza City that we were able to keep our Ahli Anglican Hospital open for so long,” Binder wrote in a Facebook post late on Monday. “That ended today.” He said an Israeli tank was parked on the rubble at the hospital’s entrance, blocking anyone from entering or leaving.  There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which has continued totarget and raidhealthcare facilities in the enclave. A World Health Organization (WHO) official said on Monday that the Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, whichIsraeli troops raidedlast week, had stopped functioning and patients, including babies, have been evacuated. “We cannot afford to lose any hospitals,” said Richard Peeperkorn, the WHO representative for Gaza. Peeperkorn also said about 4,000 displaced people taking refuge on the grounds of the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis in southern Gaza were at risk as Israel pursues military operations there. The Gaza Health Ministry saidon Tuesdaythat 19,667 Palestinians had been killed and 52,586 wounded in the Israeli assault on the Hamas-ruled enclave since the war began on October 7. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised to achieve total victory over Hamas, whose fighters killed about 1,140 people and took 240 captive in a surprise October 7 raid into Israel, according to Israeli tallies. Israel’sintensifying attacksin Gaza have created an uproar among many governments and international organisations over the civilian death toll, hunger and homelessness.    Meanwhile, talks for another truce between the sides continue with the mediation efforts led by Qatar amid repeated calls for the end of hostilities by the international community. Al Jazeera’s Alan Fisher, reporting from occupied East Jerusalem, said there was “clear progress” towards a potential newprisoner exchange dealbetween Israel and Hamas after Bill Burns, the director of the US Central Intelligence Agency, flew to Warsaw for negotiations with David Barnea, the head of Israel’s Mossad intelligence service, and Qatar’s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani. However, as Israel points to mid-January as the timetable for the “next stage of the war”, there is the possibility Hamas may decide “just to sit tight” until then “to see how things play out”, Fisher said. Hamas may wait until then “to give up any of the captives and use them as a bargaining chip when things actually start to change on the ground”, he added. A senior Hamas official on Tuesday rejected holding negotiations during the war but said the group was open to any initiative to end it. “We affirm our position of categorically rejecting to hold any form of negotiations over prisoners exchange under the continuing Israeli genocidal war,” Basem Naem said in a statement. “We are, however, open to any initiative that contributes to ending the aggression on our people and opening the crossings to bring in aid and provide relief to the Palestinian people,” he added. Israeli President Isaac Herzog signalled readiness to enter into another truce to recover captives held in Gaza and enable more aid to reach the besieged Palestinian enclave. “Israel is ready for another humanitarian pause and additional humanitarian aid in order to enable the release of hostages,” Herzog told a gathering of ambassadors, according to his office. “And the responsibility lies fully with [Hamas leader Yahya] Sinwar and Hamas leadership,” he said. On Monday, Hamas’s armed wing, the Qassam Brigades, posted a one-minutevideo of three elderly Israeli captivespleading for their immediate release.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/19/israeli-attack-on-residential-area-in-rafah-kills-29
UN Security Council in intense negotiations on Gaza humanitarian resolution,Diplomats say draft text may be watered down from ‘lasting cessation’ to ‘suspension’ of hostilities to appease US and avoid another veto.,"Members of the United Nations Security Council are involved in intense negotiations over a draft resolution on the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza as they seek to funnel more aid to Palestinians and avoid another US veto. The United States was working on Tuesday with countries on the council to resolve outstanding issues related to the draft resolution, the US Department of State said. The resolution being worked on, the US said, would demand that Israel and Hamas allow aid into Gaza and set up UN monitoring of the humanitarian assistance delivered. The vote, which had been expected to take place earlier on Tuesday, was already delayed by a day as council members sought to stave off another US veto and as Israel faces growing international pressure to change its tactics in the war against Hamas. An initial draft text of the new resolution seen on Monday called for “an urgent and lasting cessation of hostilities to allow unimpeded access of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip”. Diplomatic sources said this language has been watered down to an “urgent suspension of hostilities” and could be further weakened to satisfy Washington. “The key sticking point, of course, we believe is the ‘cessation of hostilities’,” Al Jazeera’s Gabriel Elizondo said, reporting from the UN in New York. “The United States and Israel say that any resolution that has those words in it is akin to a ceasefire, and they say that would only benefit Hamas, and so the US would reserve its veto power as it has done in the past. … We think they are trying to work out some sort of language there.” On December 8, despite unprecedented pressure from UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the US – Israel’s closest ally –blockedthe adoption of a resolution calling for an “immediate humanitarian ceasefire”, the latest in several US vetoes on draft resolutions relating to the war. Last week, the 193-member UN General Assemblyoverwhelmingly approveda similar resolution, but unlike the Security Council’s, its resolutions are nonbinding. Senior UN official Tor Wennesland said Israel’s steps to allow aid into Gaza until now have been “far short of what is needed”. “The delivery of humanitarian aid in the [Gaza] Strip continues to face nearly insurmountable challenges,” said Wennesland, special coordinator for the Middle East peace process. “Limited [humanitarian] steps by Israel … are positive but fall far short of what is needed to address the human catastrophe on the ground.” NEW:@UAEMissionToUNhas circulated updated draft resolution on#Gazaaid/monitoring which now ""calls for the urgent suspension of hostilities to allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access and for urgent steps towards a sustainable cessation of hostilities."" Other changes…https://t.co/ryjpAvl6nGpic.twitter.com/2UFYhPz3r8 — Rami Ayari (@Raminho)December 19, 2023  A key issue is how to implement and sustain a desperately needed aid operation.Human Rights Watchaccused Israel on Monday of deliberately starving Gaza’s population by blocking the delivery of water, food and fuel, a method of warfare that it described as a war crime.    The draft resolution recognises that civilians in Gaza do not have access to sufficient food, water, sanitation, electricity, telecommunications and medical services “essential for their survival”. It demands the parties to the conflict – Hamas and Israel – fulfil their obligations under international humanitarian law and enable “the immediate, safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance at scale directly to the Palestinian civilian population throughout the Gaza Strip”. Elizondo noted that the draft resolution also “calls for the UN to monitor all of the aid distribution in Gaza”. That is something new, the Al Jazeera correspondent said. “Previous Security Council drafts never had that wording in it.” The draft also reiterates calls for the protection of civilians and infrastructure critical for their survival, including hospitals, schools, places of worship and UN facilities. It demands the immediate and unconditional release of all captives held by Hamas. Discussions around a new truce come as the US reiterates its support for Israel in its war. Speaking alongside Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant in Tel Aviv on Monday, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said US support for Israel was“unshakeable”. But he added: “We will also continue to urge the protection of civilians during conflict and to increase the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza.” Since the war began on October 7, Israel has killed more than 19,000 people in Gaza, according to Palestinian health authorities. Hamas’s attacks on southern Israel on October 7, which triggered the war, killed about 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials.

Hamas video shows elderly Israeli captives pleading for release,"The Qassam Brigades releases the one-minute video, titled Don’t Let Us Grow Old Here, on its Telegram account.","Hamas has posted a video of three elderly Israeli captives pleading for their immediate release. The Palestinian group’s armed wing, the Qassam Brigades, posted the one-minute video, titled Don’t Let Us Grow Old Here, on its Telegram account on Monday. The men – identified by Israeli officials as 79-year-old Chaim Peri, 80-year-old Yoram Metzger and 84-year-old Amiram Cooper – were taken to Gaza on October 7 when Hamas launched attacks inside Israeli territory, killing 1,147 people and taking about 240 captives. Nearly half of those captives were released as part of a weeklong truce between Israel and Hamas last month. In the video, Peri, seated between the two other captives, said in Hebrew that he was being held along with other elderly hostages with chronic illnesses and that their conditions were harsh. “We are the generation who built the foundation for the creation of Israel. We are the ones who started the IDF military. We don’t understand why we have been abandoned here,” he said, referring to the Israeli armed forces. “You have to release us from here. It does not matter at what cost. We don’t want to be casualties as a direct result of the IDF military air strikes. Release us with no conditions,” he added. The video concludes with the three men saying in unison: “Don’t let us grow old here.”  Israeli media reported the three hostages came from the Nir Oz kibbutz along the Israeli border, which was targeted in the October 7 attacks. Peri was at his house in Nir Oz during the attack, Israeli media reports said. He tried to repel the gunmen while hiding his wife behind a sofa, his son told the Reuters news agency. He eventually gave himself up to save his wife, who remained hidden, the report said. The Israeli military said Hamas had released a “criminal, terrorist video”. “Chaim, Yoram and Amiram, I hope that you hear me this evening,” military spokesman Daniel Hagari said in a televised briefing. “Know this – we are doing everything, everything, in order to return you back safely.” Israel has in the past labelled such videos as a form of psychological warfare by Hamas. After the release of the latest video, families of Israelis held captive by Hamas in Gaza protested outside Israeli Ministry of Defense headquarters in Tel Aviv, demanding the immediate release of their loved ones. The protest came amid growing outrage within Israel after the Israeli military last week admitted itmistakenly shot deadthree Israeli captives in Gaza despite them waving a white flag.    Al Jazeera correspondent Sara Khairat, reporting from occupied East Jerusalem, said the video released by Hamas sends a “strong message”. “[The video] is going to do two things: help the people know that they are alive even though it’s still not clear when it was filmed, and it will also put a lot more pressure on the Israeli government, which is already in hot waters for the death of three captives last week and at a time when the demonstrations are continuing,” she said. Meanwhile, as diplomatic efforts continue to end the war in Gaza and release prisoners taken on both sides, the Israeli military hasintensified its bombardmentof the enclave, killing nearly 19,500 people since October 7 – most of them women and children. The air and ground strikes on Gaza have flattened the besieged enclave, burying thousands of people under the rubble. In absence of the required aid not being allowed to flow into the strip, international aid agencies have warned of a humanitarian disaster with widespread hunger and spread of diseases. Human Rights Watched has accused Israel ofusing starvation as a weapon of warin Gaza.

Speaking alongside Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant in Tel Aviv on Monday, Austin said US support for Israel was “unshakeable”, as the death toll from the Israeli assault on Gaza surpassed 19,000, according to Palestinian health authorities. Austin said he had discussed with Gallant how to reduce harm to civilians trapped in the battlefield. They also talked about a transition from major combat to a lower-intensity conflict. “In any campaign, there will be phases,” Austin said. “We will also continue to urge the protection of civilians during conflict and to increase the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza,” Austin said. While the US provides Israel with weapons and diplomatic support, it has recently sharpened its tone towards Netanyahu’s government. Last week President Joe Biden said Israel risked losing international support because of what he called its“indiscriminate” bombing. Austin, however, offered reassurance on Monday, saying: “American support for Israel security is unshakable. Israel is not alone.” Gallant meanwhile said Israel would gradually transition to the next phase of its operations in Gaza and displaced people would likely be able to return first to the north of the enclave.    Austin’s visit came amid growing concern from foreign governments and international organisations over civilian deaths in Gaza and a deepeninghumanitarian crisis. Earlier, the international human rights organisation Human Rights Watch said that Israel was “deliberately blocking the delivery of water, food and fuel,” to people in Gaza and “usingstarvationof civilians as a method of warfare”. The Israeli assault on Gaza began after Hamas killed around 1,200 people in southern Israel and took about 240 otherscaptive, according to Israeli authorities. Israel’s relentless bombardment and ground invasion has killed at least 19,453 people, most of them women and children, according to Palestinian health authorities, and levelled entire neighbourhoods and displaced more than 80 percent of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who has supported Israel’s campaign, said on Monday that “too many civilians” have been killed in the fighting, and expressed support for a “sustainable ceasefire”. While Austin has said that more aid must be delivered to the people of Gaza, the US has found itself increasingly isolated over its stance on the war between Israel and Hamas.    Last week, the US cast one of the few dissenting votes against a UN General Assembly resolution calling for a ceasefirethat passedwith overwhelming support. The UN Security Council is scheduled to hold a ceasefire vote on Monday, after the US also vetoed aprevious resolution. International leaders have also voiced concern over the possibility of a wider regional escalation as the war drags on. Austin said on Monday that the US was leading efforts to address a series of attacks by Yemen’sHouthi rebel groupthat have disrupted commercial shipping in the Red Sea. The Iran-backed group says the attacks are an effort to pressure Israel to halt its attacks on Gaza. “In the Red Sea, we’re leading a multinational maritime task force to uphold the bedrock principle of freedom of navigation,” Austin said.    The Pentagon chief also warned against greater involvement by the powerful Iran-backed groupHezbollah, which has traded fire with Israel from southern Lebanon since the fighting began but has thus far avoided a larger confrontation. US officials have said thatWilliam Burns, the director of the CIA, the US intelligence agency, is meeting with his Israeli counterpart and the prime minister of Qatar to discuss a potential deal to secure the release of additional captives held by Hamas. A previous deal, which Qatar and Egypt helped to mediate,secured a seven-day truce and the releaseof dozens of captives in exchange for the release of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/18/us-says-support-for-israel-unshakeable-as-gaza-ceasefire-calls-grow
Turkey’s Erdogan and Hungary’s Orban pledge to strengthen ties in Budapest,The two countries are the only holdouts in NATO to not have ratified Sweden’s bid to join the transatlantic military alliance.,"Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban have pledged to strengthen ties after talks in Budapest. The meeting on Monday marked the Turkish president’s second visit to the country in four months. Hungary and Turkey are the only two NATO countries that haveso far not ratifiedSweden’s bid to join the transatlantic military alliance in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Earlier this month, Erdogan made Turkey’sratification of Sweden’s NATO bid conditionalon the United States Congress “simultaneously” approving Ankara’s request for F-16 fighter jets. The two leaders did not comment on the issue in their address to reporters. NATO enlargement was discussed during Erdogan’s visit, according to Hungarian President Katalin Novak, who also met the Turkish leader. Erdogan’s visit coincides with the 100th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries. “We wish to further strengthen our ties in areas such as defence and energy, where we already have fruitful cooperation,” Erdogan said, adding that the two countries aimed to increase their trade volume to $6bn from $4bn currently. Erdogan was received with military honours in Budapest’s Heroes’ Square before heading into a meeting with Novak and then with Orban. Orban presented Erdogan with the gift of a Nonius horse – though the Turkish leader fell off a horse in 2003. “The gift from one equestrian nation to another,” Orban wrote on Facebook. In return, Orban was gifted with an electric car made in Turkey, a photo of which he posted on X. “The best deal I’ve ever made! For one horsepower, I got 435. Welcome to Hungary President Erdogan!” he wrote. During a joint press conference, Orban said his country was “looking for allies with whom we can win”. “The big plan is that Turks and Hungarians will be victorious together in the 21st century,” he said. In recent years, Hungary has pursued a policy of opening up to the East, not only towards Russia but also towards China and Central Asian countries. The central European country of close to 10 million people is the only European Union member state that has maintained close ties to the Kremlin since the beginning of the Ukraine war. On Sweden’s NATO membership, Budapest has chided Stockholm over its “open hostile attitude”, accusing Swedish representatives of being “repeatedly keen to bash Hungary” on rule-of-law issues. Orban told parliament in September that ratifying Sweden’s NATO bid was not “urgent”. In the past, Orban has repeatedly stated that Hungary supports Sweden’s bid, claiming that the approval was merely a “technicality”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/18/turkeys-erdogan-and-hungarys-orban-pledge-to-strengthen-ties-in-budapest
Death and fear among civilians in NW Syria amid Assad regime’s bombardment,Multiple people were killed in Idlib and towns in the western countryside of Aleppo in shelling over the weekend.,"Idlib, Syria —Seven civilians were killed and 20 others were injured on Sunday when the military of President Bashar al-Assad bombed the city of Idlib and towns in the countryside near Aleppo. Syria Civil Defence, a volunteer group that offers medical services, as well as rescue and relief assistance to communities in opposition-held areas of the country’s northwest,said they responded to the deaths of five civilians, including a child and a woman pregnant with twins, in the town of Darat Izza. They also assisted an additional five injured people, including two children, after more than 40 artillery shells fell on the area. Another 15 people were injured, including five children and a woman, as a result of missile bombardment on residential neighbourhoods in the city of Idlib. Abu Amin, an observer who monitors the movement of missiles and military aircraft in the area added that two others were killed in the town of Abzimo in the western countryside of Aleppo, as a result of artillery shelling with Acacia 152 launchers and Grad 40 missiles. So far this month, there have been 48 attacks on civilians in 15 cities and towns, resulting in the deaths of nine people, including three children and a woman, according to the Civil Defence. The deputy director of the Syrian Civil Defence, Mounir Mustafa, told Al Jazeera that the bombing caused astate of “terror” among residents, in addition to the damage it caused to residential buildings, shops and public facilities. The Syrian Civil Defence are also known as the White Helmets. A shell fell a few metres away from Majoun Turki, a resident of the Shuhada Camp in Darat Izza, and he was wounded by a small piece of shrapnel. “When it fell, I no longer realised what was going on around me. I became dizzy, and my eyes still hurt,” the 60-year-old man told Al Jazeera. While Darat Izza, which connects the areas of the northern and western Aleppo countryside and Idlib, is subjected to repeated bombardment by the ruling regime’s forces, the most recent bombing led to the displacement of civilians towards nearby farmlands. “My family has now fled towards the highway. I asked them to leave for the sake of the young children”, said Turki, a father to 11 children, whose family has been displaced since 2011, when the attacks began on his village in the eastern Hama countryside. “Fear was intense yesterday,” said Bashar Fandu, whose two cousins were among those killed in the Darat Izza bombing. They were buying gasoline when the shell fell on top of them, killing them along with the seller and two passers-by. “The violent shelling continued during the burial at night,” he added. The Syrian regime and its ally Russiadeny targeting civiliansand proclaim that they target military faction sites. Abu Amin, the observer, said that the recent attacks on the city of Idlib were “unprovoked”, as they were not accompanied by military actions by the opposition factions, and the strikes did not target the positions of those factions. “The bombing sometimes coincides with military actions by the opposition factions,” Abu Amin said, noting that the attack on the towns of the western Aleppo countryside yesterday evening was in response to the bombing of the towns of Nubl and al-Zahraa, located in regime-controlled areas, by the opposition factions. While the region has been subject to a ceasefire truce since March 2020, violations have continued, especially during the last four months. Civil Defence teams have counted 1,206 attacks by regime forces and its allies from the beginning of 2023 until December 10, which have killed 154 people and injured 652. “These attacks threaten the lives of residents, impose a state of instability, and force people to flee at a time when the humanitarian crisis is worsening with the approaching winter,” Mustafa from the Civil Defence said. Of the 4.5 million people who live in northwestern Syria, 2.9 million are displaced. About two million of them live in random camps that lack basic services. Edem Wosornu, director of operations and advocacy for the UN humanitarian agency OCHA, spoke to the Security Council on November 28 about the danger of renewed bombing campaigns on northwestern Syria, describing it as “the most significant we have seen since 2019.” According to the UN, recent months have witnessed the displacement of 120,000 people from the southern Idlib countryside to the north, as a result of repeated bombing.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/18/death-and-fear-among-civilians-in-nw-syria-amid-assad-regimes-bombardment
Captives mistakenly killed by Israeli troops left SOS signs in Hebrew,The killing of the three men sparks an intense outcry in Israel and raises concerns about its military’s wartime conduct.,"Israel’s military says it has discovered distress signals in a Gaza building where three Israeli captives were sheltering before they weremistakenly shot deadby Israeli troops. The signs, which read “SOS” and “Help, three hostages” in Hebrew, were found in a building in the Shujayea suburb of Gaza City, military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said on Sunday. The military distributed photographs of the white cloth signs written in red, likely with leftover food. They were hung on a building about 200 metres (220 yards) from where the captives were shot last week, Hagari said.    The killing of the captives, who, Israel’s military said, were fired at despite waving a white flag, has sparked an outcry in Israel and amplified concerns about their military’s wartime conduct. Ido Shamriz, brother of slain captive Alon Shamriz, accused the Israeli army of “abandoning” and then “murdering” him. Ruby Chen, father of a 19-year-old captive and soldier still held in Gaza, said the incident made him even more fearful of his son’s fate. “We feel like we’re in a Russian roulette game [finding out] who will be next in line to be told the death of their loved one,” Chen said. The captives’ deaths also added to Israeli concerns that their government and military are more focused on eliminating Hamas than rescuing at least 100 captives believed still to be in captivity in Gaza. Hamas last month said about 60 captives had been killed or were missing due to the Israeli bombardment. Israel has confirmed at least 20 captives have died in Gaza, without saying how it knows this information. On Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hinted that new negotiations may be under way to recover captives after his intelligence chief met the prime minister of Qatar, a mediator in the conflict. However, Hamas has said it will not release any more captives until the war ends. Israel believes some of the captives may be trapped in Hamas’s sprawling underground tunnel network, complicating the Israeli military’s efforts to root out the group. On Sunday, Israel’s military announced it had uncovered the largest tunnel it had ever seen in Gaza and promised to search through more tunnels in its pursuit of Hamas. “We will hunt them even if we need to go down to the tunnels,” Hagari said. “We also need to do it with attention to the rescue of our hostages and the understanding that maybe some of them are in the tunnels.” The newly discovered Hamas tunnel has an entrance near a key Israeli border crossing, raising additional questions about security failures leading up to the group’s October 7 attacks on southern Israel. The expansive tunnel, equipped with ventilation and electricity, is twice the height and three times the width of other Gaza tunnels, Israeli officials said. It stretches for more than 4km (2.5 miles) and dives 50 meters (55 yards) below ground at some points. “Millions of dollars were invested in this tunnel,” Hagari said on Sunday. “It took years to build. … Vehicles could drive through,” he added. “At this point, this is the biggest tunnel in Gaza.” Nir Dinar, another Israeli military spokesperson, said Israel had previously failed to spot the tunnel because its border defences detect only tunnels meant to enter Israel. Israeli officials believed Hamas used the tunnel to move vehicles, fighters and supplies ahead of its October 7 attacks, which killed about 1,200 people, they say. In retaliation for that attack, Israel has bombed the besieged Gaza Strip for two and a half months and launched a ground invasion,killingmore than 19,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, and reducing much of the enclave to ruins.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/18/captives-mistakenly-killed-by-israeli-troops-left-sos-signs-in-hebrew
Yemen’s Houthis say they attacked two more vessels in the Red Sea,Owner of Swan Atlantic says ship struck by unidentified object but none of the crew hurt. Panama-flagged vessel also targeted.,"Yemen’s Houthi rebels say they have launched a drone attack targeting two cargo vessels in the Red Sea, the latest in a series of assaults that have disrupted maritime trade as freight companies seek to avoid the area. Houthi spokesperson Yahya Sarea on Monday identified the vessels as the MSC Clara and Norwegian-owned Swan Atlantic and said the attacks were carried out after their crews failed to respond to calls from the group. The Swan Atlantic’s owner said the ship was struck by an unidentified object but none of the crew was hurt. The MSC Clara is a Panama-flagged vessel, according to London Stock Exchange Group data. Details of the attack on the vessel were not immediately clear. The Iran-backed Houthis have attacked numerous vessels over recent weeks, saying they are targeting ships in the Red Sea with links to Israel in protest against its military offensive in Gaza. The group has warned against sailing towards the area. The attacks have caused concerns about the impact on the passage of oil, grain and other goods on what is an important global trade route, and they have pushed up the cost of insuring and shipping goods through the Red Sea. All of the Swan Atlantic’s systems were operating normally although its water tank was damaged in the attack, said Oystein Elgan, chief executive of owner Inventor Chemical Tankers. Inventor Chemical Tankers has no Israeli ties, Elgan said. The vessel’s operator, Uni-Tankers, said the attack caused a small fire, which the crew brought under control, and the ship, carrying vegetable oils, continued to Reunion Island. A British maritime authority said it had received a report of a vessel that “experienced an explosion” on its port side in an attack 24 nautical miles (44km) northwest of Yemen’s al-Makha (Mocha) port. The vessel and crew were reported safe, it said in an advisory. The incident described by a United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) advisory was similar to the attack on the Swan Atlantic. The UKMTO said in a separate advisory it had received a report of a vessel 24 nautical miles southeast of al-Makha that was approached by a craft with several armed people on board. Warning shots were fired from the vessel and the craft and the armed personnel on board changed course, the advisory said. The UKMTO said in other advisories it had received reports of an incident 63 nautical miles (117km) northwest of Djibouti and another near the Bab al-Mandeb strait, 30 nautical miles (56km) south of al-Makha. The Houthis, who rule much of Yemen, have pledged to continue carrying out attacks until Israel halts its assault on Gaza. However, in an initial indication of possible moderation, the group said on Saturday that real steps to ease the humanitarian crisis in Gaza would contribute to “reducing the escalation”. The threat risks disturbing the global economy. Several shipping companies have announced they willsuspend all journeysthrough the Red Sea due to the attacks. About 40 percent of international trade passes through the narrow strait between Yemen and northeast Africa, which leads northwards to the Red Sea, Israel’s southern port facilities and the Suez Canal. The increased threat has caused shippinginsurance coststo jump by tens of thousands of dollars a day andraised oil prices. Oil major BP temporarily paused all transit through the Red Sea citing security concerns. The alternative route for ships avoiding the Suez Canal is to take a much longer trip around Africa. The United States announced last week that it was in talks with other countries to set up a task force to protect the trade route. An Italian source on Monday reported that the country is considering joining a naval coalition to patrol the Red Sea.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/18/oil-tanker-m-v-swan-atlantic-hit-by-houthi-projectile-in-the-red
President el-Sisi declared victorious in Egypt election,"Sisi took 89.6 percent of the vote to secure a third term, with turnout at 66.8 percent, says election authority.","Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has secured a third term as leader of the Middle East’s most populous nation, officials said, after the counting of votes in the election held between December 10 and 12 was finalised. Sisi won 89.6 percent of the vote, the National Elections Authority said on Monday. Turnout reached an “unprecedented” 66.8 percent of voters, said authority head Hazem Badawy. Over 39 million Egyptians cast their ballots for Sisi, a former army chief who has ruled the most populous Arab country for a decade. The vote, theresult of which was in little doubt, took place as Egypt dealt with various crises, including the Israel-Hamas war in neighbouring Gaza and the country’s worst-evereconomic crisis. Despite Egypt’s afflictions, a decade-long crackdown on dissent has eliminated any serious opposition to Sisi, the fifth president to emerge from within the ranks of the military since 1952. Sisi was running againstthree other candidates, none of whom were high profile. The most prominent potential candidate ended his run complaining that his campaign had been impeded and dozens of his supporters arrested. Runner-up Hazem Omar, who leads the Republican People’s Party, received 4.5 percent of the vote. Next came Farid Zahran, leader of the left-leaning Egyptian Social Democratic Party, and Abdel-Sanad Yamama from the Wafd, a century-old but relatively marginal party. Sisi is now set to serve his third – and, according to the constitution, final – term in office, starting in April. Sisi came to power after the 2013 overthrow of the country’s first popularly elected president, Mohamed Morsi. He was re-elected in 2018. In both previous elections he won with 97 percent of the vote. Sisi extended the presidential mandate from four to six years and amended the constitution to raise the limit on consecutive terms in office from two to three. Under his rule, Egypt has jailed thousands of political prisoners, and while a presidential pardons committee has freed about 1,000 in one year, rights groups say that three to four times that many were arrested over the same period. His supporters credit him with engineering a return to calm in the country after the chaos that followed the 2011 uprising that overthrew President Hosni Mubarak.

Iran points at Israeli-linked group as cyberattack disrupts fuel network,Tehran says Israel-linked Predatory Sparrow group is behind the disruption.,"A cyberattack has disrupted services at around 70 percent of Iran’s fuel stations, according to reports. The Israel-linked group Predatory Sparrow, or Gonjeshke Darande in Persian, claimed on Monday it was behind the disruption, according to Iranian state TV. Israel media outlets also reported the claim. “This cyberattack was carried out in a controlled manner to avoid potential damage to emergency services,” Predatory Sparrow said in its statement quoted by the Iranian media. A statement on the attack was shared from a new account with the group’s name opened in early December on X. Iran’s civil defence agency, which is responsible for the country’s cybersecurity, said it was still considering all possible causes for the disruptions as it investigated. Iranian state media added that the hacker group has in the past claimed cyberattacks against Iranian petrol stations, rail networks and steel factories. The fuel outages are the first such incident since 2021, when a major cyberattack in Iran disrupted the sale of fuel, causing long queues at stations across the country. Pump prices in Iran are heavily subsidised. Iran accused Israel and the United States of being behind those attacks. The disruptions began early on Monday and were especially acute in Tehran. Many petrol stations have been forced to operate their pumps manually, Iranian media reported. “At least 30 percent of gas stations are working, with the rest gradually resolving the disruption in services,” Oil Minister Javad Owji said. Reza Navar, a spokesman for Iran’s fuel stations association, had told the semiofficial Fars news agency that a technical issue was behind the disruption. “A software problem with the fuel system has been confirmed in some stations across the country and experts are currently fixing the issue,” Navar said. Navar added that there was no fuel supply shortage but called on drivers to not go to fuel stations. The Ministry of Petroleum earlier told state TV that the disruption was not linked to plans to increase the price of fuel, a policy that caused widespreadprotests in 2019and led to violent repression. State TV said petrol stations were seeking to provide fuel manually and that it would take at least six to seven hours to resolve the problems. Israel has not yet commented on the cyberattack. Israel’s unit on cyberattacks on Monday said Iran and Hezbollah were behind an attempted cyberattack on a hospital in northern Israel about three weeks ago. It said that the attack was thwarted but that the hackers were able to retrieve “some of the sensitive information stored in the hospital’s information systems”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/18/iran-says-cyberattack-disrupts-petrol-stations-across-country
Israel accused of wielding starvation as a weapon of war against Gaza,Human Rights Watch urges world leaders to speak out against ‘abhorrent war crime’.,"An international NGO has accused Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war in Gaza. Human Rights Watch (HRW) said in a statement issued on Monday that Israel is deliberately depriving Palestinians of access to food, water and other basic necessities. The use of hunger against the civilian population is a war crime, the NGO stated, calling for world leaders to act. The press release cites statements from Israeli officials, interviews with survivors, reports from aid organisations, and evidence from satellite imagery to establish that Israel is engaged in the “deliberate use of policies to deprive Palestinians of the resources necessary for daily existence”. “For over two months, Israel has been depriving Gaza’s population of food and water, a policy spurred on or endorsed by high-ranking Israeli officials and reflecting an intent to starve civilians as a method of warfare,” said Omar Shakir, Israel and Palestine director at Human Rights Watch. “World leaders should be speaking out against this abhorrent war crime, which has devastating effects on Gaza’s population,” he added. The statement comes as Israel faces increasinginternaland external pressure regarding mounting civilian casualties resulting from its “indiscriminate” bombardment of the Gaza Strip. Israel has killed 18,787 people and injured another 50,897, according to the latest figures, while thousands are believed to beburied under the rubble. Speeches and statements from Israeli officials promoting a campaign to deliberately block access to necessary resources for the Gaza population as a strategy indicate that Israel has not made these intentions secret, HRW said. Even from the beginning of the Israeli offensive, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant infamouslystatedthat Israel was “putting a complete siege on Gaza. … No electricity, no food, no water, no gas – it’s all closed,” justifying the move by describing Palestinians as “beastly people”.    The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court provides that intentionally starving civilians by “depriving them of objects indispensable to their survival, including willfully impeding relief supplies”, is a war crime, HRW said in the statement. The plight of Gaza’s 2.3 million people has become desperate amid the war, which has now persisted for over two months. Around 80 percent of Palestinians living in the enclave have been displaced by the violence, while efforts to get aid into the enclave have struggled. Images showing the massive devastation of the Gaza Strip, of desperate Palestiniansraiding food banks,humanitarian aiddelivery trucksand reports of deliberatedestruction of agricultural landbolster the allegations. Alarmed humanitarian organisations have been fruitlessly calling for a ceasefire anddenouncingthe shocking cost of thecatastrophicwar which amounts to a collective punishment of the civilian population of Gaza. The Israeli government hit back at HRW, accusing it of being an “anti-Semitic and anti-Israeli” organisation. “Human Rights Watch … did not condemn the attack on Israeli citizens and the massacre of October 7 and has no moral basis to talk about what’s going on in Gaza if they turn a blind eye to the suffering and the human rights of Israelis,” foreign ministry spokesman Lior Haiat told AFP.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/18/hrw-israel-committing-war-crime-by-intentionally-starving-gaza
‘Bloodbath’: Israel continues to target Gaza hospitals and civilians,No let up in Israel’s onslaught despite mounting calls for a truce and aid deliveries.,"Despite growing international pressure for a respite, Israel is continuing to bombard Gaza’s health facilities and residential areas. Israeli air raids on Sunday and Monday maintained the focus on hospitals and civilian neighbourhoods in the enclave, a tactic that has only encouraged further calls from around the world for a ceasefire in the besieged Palestinian territory as civilian causalities mount. Mass casualties have been reported following strikes on the Jabalia and Nuseirat refugee camps. Israeli artillery shelling targeted multiple residences in the Shujayea, Tuffah and Daraj neighbourhoods in Gaza City. Continuous shooting has been reported at the entrance to al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. At least 26 Palestinians were killed in an attack on the hospital earlier, Al Jazeera journalists reported. The Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis in southern Gaza has been repeatedly targeted over the past 48 hours. An Israeli tank shell hit the maternity building on Sunday, killing a 13-year-old girl, named Dina Abu Mehsen, and injuring several others, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health. A bomb fell near the building but did not explode, causing a great deal of panic and injuring three people, according to Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Rafah. In a statement to Al Jazeera, Gaza Health Ministry spokesperson Ashraf al-Qudra denounced Israel for trying to “eliminate” the besieged enclave’s health sector. “What the occupation is doing is part of the scenario that began in northern Gaza from the Shifa complex,” he said. “Targeting Nasser Medical Complex is part of the occupation’s policy to eliminate the health sector and would bring down the health system in the southern Gaza Strip,” he added. The deadliest everGaza warbegan with attacks by Hamas, which rules the enclave, on October 7, when the group killed 1,139 people and abducted about 250, according to updated Israeli figures. Gaza’s Health Ministry says more than 18,800 people, mostly women and children, have been killed in Israel’s campaign in Gaza. It said more than 100 were killed in Israeli attacks on Sunday, while dozens more are reported to have died so far on Monday.    World Health Organization described the situation at al-Shifa Hospital – once the cornerstone of the territory’s healthcare system – as a “bloodbath” as hundreds of injured patients sheltered inside with “new patients arriving every minute”. The United Nations agency said the hospital, which was occupied by Israeli forces earlier in the war, is providing only basic trauma stabilisation, has no blood for transfusions and hardly any staff to care for a constant flow of patients, after a visit to deliver medicines and surgical supplies to the facility. Dr Rana Hajjeh, from WHO’s Cairo office, told Al Jazeera: “What they saw was a completehorror scene. The injured patients are all over the floor, they are being sutured on the floor. There are not enough beds or stretchers. There isn’t any pain medication. They’re basically just bleeding on the floor.” Thousands of displaced people are using the hospital building and grounds as a shelter during a severe shortage of water and food, Hajjeh said. Israeli soldiersraidedthe Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza over several days earlier in the week and killed dozens before evacuating wounded patients and medical staff to the hospital grounds, according to the health authorities in the enclave. Citing the ministry’s reports, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said earlier this week he was “extremely worried” about the hospital’s situation. The WHO said it was urgently gathering information at the hospital, where Gaza authorities said Israeli forces this week used a bulldozer to smash through the perimeter of a site Israel has said was used by Hamas fighters. The Israeli military said the hospital was being used as a Hamas “command and control centre” and that soldiers had detained about 80 fighters before leaving the site on Saturday.    Earlier in the week, authorities in Gaza said some 70 medical staff were detained by Israel in the raid. The group has denied using Kamal Adwan or other hospitals for activities. Israel has also said al-Shifa had been used by Hamas, before occupying it last month. Palestinian Health Minister Mai al-Kaila hascalledfor an “urgent probe” after Israeli forces were accused of crushing Palestinians, including wounded patients, using bulldozers in the yard of the hospital. Only four hospitals of 24 working in north Gaza before the war with Israel began have even partial service, and three of those are barely functioning, WHO said. Israeli raids on the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza killed 110 Palestinians on Sunday, according to the Health ministry in the enclave. Another attack on the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza killed at least 25 people overnight, according to the Al Jazeera team at the site. Strikes and raids are reported to have continued on Monday.    The Israeli government is under growing pressure from the international community to pause the fighting and do more to protect civilians. The United Nations Security Council is set to vote on Monday on a new resolution, drafted by the United Arab Emirates, calling for a truce and delivery of aid in Gaza. The UN estimates that 1.9 million Palestinians in Gaza – about 80 percent of the population – have been displaced by the war. “I would not be surprised if people start dying of hunger, or a combination of hunger, disease, weak immunity,” said Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees. French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna called for an “immediate and durable” truce on a visit to Israel on Sunday. Germany and the United Kingdom also joined the calls for a ceasefire over the weekend, and Israeli protesters demanded the government relaunch talks with Hamas on releasing more hostages after three were mistakenly killed by Israeli troops while waving a white flag. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was expected to press Israel to wind down major combat operations as he arrived in Tel Aviv on Monday. He will also visit Qatar, which brokered a previous truce deal. ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/18/bloodbath-israel-keeps-hitting-gaza-hospitals-amid-international-uproar
Iraqis to vote for powerful provincial councils in election,The first council elections in a decade are expected to strengthen the grip of pro-Iran groups.,"Iraqis are headed to the polls to elect provincial councils for the first time in 10 years, with thousands vying for seats in the powerful assemblies. Ballots will be cast in 15 of Iraq’s 18 provinces on Monday. The elections are a prelude to a parliamentary vote in 2025, which will test the strength of pro-Iran groups that have been raising their profile in recent years. Overall, 285 candidates will be elected to the councils, whose duties include appointing regional governors and allocating health, transport and education budgets. Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdistan region, which includes three provinces, will decide their provincial councils next year. Monday’s vote is seen as a key test for the government of Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, who rose to power a year ago on the back of a parliamentary coalition of pro-Tehran parties. Since taking office, al-Sudani has struggled to develop public services and infrastructure ravaged by decades of conflict. He is hoping for a high turnout, which would give his administration a boost. “Turnout is the ultimate gage of satisfaction,” said Renad Mansour, a senior research fellow at Chatham House. It will show, he said, “whether the Sudani government’s economic populism – the policy of giving out [public sector] jobs – can be successful and can capture the young population”. Voting started at 7am (04:00 GMT) on Monday under tight security and was set to continue until 6pm (15:00 GMT). Some 17 million of Iraq’s 43 million people are eligible to vote, with 6,000 candidates in the race. However, voter apathy has been on the rise among a mostly young population who feel that they have not seen the benefits of Iraq’s massive oil wealth, much of which is misdirected or stolen in a country ranked among the world’s most corrupt. Hassan Qabas, a member of Iraq’s Independent High Electoral Commission (IHEC), told Al Jazeera that around 1,800 international observers had been invited to participate. The vote is expected to consolidate the position of the ruling Coordination Framework coalition. The Iran-aligned bloc features Shia Islamist parties with factions of Hashed al-Shaabi, a network of former paramilitary units integrated into the regular army. However, critics say the councils are sure to be nests of corruption and enable clientelism. Influential Shia scholar and political kingmaker Muqtada al-Sadr, whose rivals blocked his bid to form a government after heemerged as a winnerin the 2021 parliamentary polls, is boycotting the election. Manaf Almusawi, a member of his Sadrist movement, told Al Jazeera the boycott is intended to “voice rejection of the government’s policies” and “deprive the government of legitimacy”. Iraq’s provincial councils were established after the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq that toppled Saddam Hussein. The councils were initially abolished in late 2019 as a concession to massive antigovernment protests, but al-Sudani’s government later re-established them. To reflect Iraq’s multi-confessional and multiethnic population, 10 seats are reserved for minorities, namely Christians, Yazidis and Sabians. A 25 percent quota also ensures that 1,600 of the candidates are female.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/18/iraqis-vote-for-powerful-provincial-councils
At least 90 killed in latest Israeli attacks on Gaza’s Jabalia refugee camp,The first responders and locals are searching for the wounded as more bodies are believed to be under the rubble.,"At least 90 people have been killed and more than 100 injured in the latest Israeli attacks on the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza. The enclave’s Health Ministry said Sunday’s strikes hit a residential block belonging to the al-Barsh and Alwan families in the town of Jabalia, Palestinian news agency Wafa reported. Women and children were among the dead, with dozens still missing, Wafa said in its report. The first responders and locals were searching for the wounded and more bodies were believed to be under the rubble. Many of those injured, including children, were taken to nearby medical centres, which are already overwhelmed with patients.   The son of Dawoud Shehab, the spokesman for the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group, was among the dead, an official from the group told the Reuters news agency. “We believe the number of dead people under the rubble is huge but there is no way to remove the rubble and recover them because of the intensity of Israeli fire,” he said by phone. Medics in central Gaza’s Deir el-Balah said at least 12 Palestinians were killed and dozens wounded, while in Rafah in the south, an Israeli air attack on a house left at least four people dead. About 19,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since October 7. Israel says 1,147 people were killed on its territory that day. Meanwhile, Israel has also ramped up its artillery shelling insouthern Gaza, hitting the cities of Khan Younis and Rafah, where the majority of displaced Palestinians are sheltering.    The stepping up of bombardments in the south has worsened the humanitarian situation, with starving people scrambling for food and water,grabbing them from aid trucksin desperation. Israel on Sunday said it will reopen the Karem Abu Salem Crossing in the east but it is unclear whether supplies have crossed through there yet. The United Nations estimates that 1.9 million people – about 80 percent of Gaza’s population – have been displaced by the war. “I would not be surprised if people start dying of hunger, or a combination of hunger, disease, weak immunity,” said Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/17/at-least-90-killed-in-latest-israeli-attacks-on-gazas-jabalia-refugee-camp
Starving Palestinians scramble for aid as desperation mounts in Gaza,"Not enough aid is flowing into the strip, forcing the Palestinians into a ‘survival mode’ amid heavy Israeli attacks.","The humanitarian crisis in Gaza continues to worsen after more than two months of Israeli bombing and forced displacement of people to the enclave’s south. On Sunday, hungry and desperate Palestinians were seen jumping onto aid trucks in order to get food and other supplies in Gaza’s Rafah area near the border with Egypt. Dozens of Palestinians surrounded the aid trucks after they drove in through the Rafah crossing with Egypt, forcing some to stop before climbing aboard, pulling food and water boxes down, and carrying them off or passing them off to crowds below. “The humanitarian situation has become very desperate, not only for the residents of Rafah city but also for the one million displaced Palestinians here who are becoming hungry, thirsty and traumatised as the war pounds on,” said Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Rafah.    Mahmoud said the amount of aid being allowed inside the strip is not enough and has forced the Palestinians into a “survival mode”. “People are without anything – without a home, without access to food, without water and without medical supplies,” he said. “So, the scenes at Rafah crossing are a natural response: When people starve to death, when they are hungry, this is what we will see happening.” The United Nations this week warned that people in Gaza are so “desperate for food” that they are stopping aid trucks and immediately eating what they find. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of UNRWA who visited the strip recently, said the residents, despite their long and difficult history of suffering under Israeli siege, have “never, ever experienced” hunger of this kind. “I saw it with my eyes that people in Rafah have started to decide to help themselves directly from the truck out of total despair and eat what they have taken out of the truck on the spot,” Lazzarini said on Thursday. On the same day, Carl Skau, the deputy head of the UN World Food Programme (WFP), confirmed that nearly half of the people in Gaza arestarving, with no idea where their next meal is coming from. The WFP said half of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million is starving as the Israeli military’s assault on the southern part of the enclave expands and people are cut off from supplies. Drone footage from southern Gaza on Sunday showed volunteers from the Gaza Emergency Relief prepare a giant stew. Aid deliveries crossing into Gaza via Rafah, the sole entry point on the Egyptian border, are only a fraction of pre-conflict levels, despite the surge in needs. Aid coming through the border crossing has been slow to deliver what the Gaza Strip population needs because of delays from truck inspections. Rafah is sheltering more than 12,000 people per square kilometre, housing an estimated 85 percent of people displaced across Gaza since the attacks began on October 7. That day, Hamas launched a surprise incursion on Israeli territory, killing some 1,140 people and taking another 240 captives. Israel’s bombardment has since killed 18,787 people and injured another 50,897, while thousands are believed to beburied under the rubble. Despite thousands sheltering at the crossing, Rafahcontinues to be the targetof Israeli air strikes. A massive explosion took place overnight in the Geneina district of Rafah, with two people killed and residential homes targeted and destroyed, said Al Jazeera’s Mahmoud. “A large number of injured have been brought to the Kuwaiti hospital here,” he said. “We are talking about more than 50 people injured.”   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/17/starving-palestinians-loot-aid-trucks-as-desperation-mounts-in-gazas-rafah
Thousands flee as war reaches Sudan’s second-largest city,"Heavy fighting reported in Wad Madani, where thousands of displaced people had sought shelter.","Thousands of displaced people have fled the formerly safe city of Wad Madani in Sudan, as the war between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) reaches the city. Paramilitary forces established a base in the east of Sudan’s second-largest city and the capital of al-Jazirah state, the AFP news agency reported on Sunday, forcing thousands of already displaced people to escape. The RSF attack has opened a new front in the eight-month-old war, in what had previously been “one of Sudan’s few remaining sanctuaries”, according to the Norwegian Refugee Council’s (NRC) Sudan director William Carter. Crowds of people – many of whom had taken refuge in the city from violence in the capital Khartoum – were seen packing up belongings and leaving on foot in videos posted on social media. “The war has followed us to Madani so I am looking for a bus so me and my family can flee,” 45-year-old Ahmed Salih told the Reuters news agency by phone. “We are living in hell and there is no one to help us,” he said, adding that he planned to head south to Sennar. Sudan’s army, which has held the city since the start of the conflict, launched air strikes on RSF forces as it tried to push back the assault that started on Friday, witnesses told Reuters. The RSF responded with artillery and RSF reinforcements were seen moving in the direction of the fighting, the witnesses added. RSF soldiers have also been seen in villages to the north and west of the city in recent days and weeks, residents said. Sudan spiralled into war after soaring tensions between army chief General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and RSF commander General Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo exploded into open fighting in mid-April. The war broke out due to disagreements over plans for a political transition and the integration of the RSF into the army, four years after former ruler Omar al-Bashir was deposed in an uprising. More than 12,000 people have been killed, according to a conservative estimate by the Armed Conflict and Event Data Project, while the United Nations says nearly 6.8 million have been forced to flee their homes.    The UN on Sunday said 14,000 people have fled Wad Madani so far, and a few thousand had already reached other cities. Half a million people had sought refuge in al-Jazirah, mainly from Khartoum. Wad Madani alone houses more than 86,000 displaced people, according to the UN, which has suspended all humanitarian field missions in al-Jazirah state. More than 270,000 of the city’s 700,000 residents had been dependent on humanitarian aid, the UN said. The United States Ambassador John Godfrey urged the RSF to “cease their advance” on al-Jazirah state. “A continued RSF advance risks mass civilian casualties and significant disruption of humanitarian assistance efforts,” Godfrey said in a statement on Sunday. Families scrambled on Sunday to once again flee to safety but found bus tickets had quadrupled to $60 a head, and many had nowhere to go. “A continuous flow of people, many of them who already ran for their lives just a few months ago, are now rushing towards already heavily burdened and resource-depleted cities in neighbouring states,” the NRC’s Carter said. “We are also extremely worried for highly vulnerable families in Wad Madani who have been crammed into displacement sites in schools for months and have nowhere to hide from violence, no means to escape and nowhere else to flee,” Carter added. Sudan’s doctors’ union said on Sunday the situation in the city has become “catastrophic” after pharmacies were forced shut. The army and RSF last week cast doubt on anEast African mediation initiativeaimed at ending a war that has triggered the largest internal displacement in the world and warnings of famine-like conditions. In Khartoum and cities in Darfur that the RSF has already taken, residents havereported rapes, looting and arbitrary killing and detention. The group is alsoaccused of ethnic killingsin West Darfur. The RSF has denied those accusations and said anyone in its forces found to be involved in such crimes would be held accountable.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/17/thousands-flee-as-war-reaches-sudans-second-largest-city
Kuwait’s Emir Sheikh Nawaf laid to rest in private ceremony,"Emir Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmad al-Sabah, who passed away on Saturday at the age of 86, has been laid to rest in a private funeral.","Kuwait’s late Emir Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmad al-Sabah, whopassed away on Saturday at the age of 86, has been laid to rest in a private funeral attended by select relatives. State television on Sunday showed a prayer ceremony at Bilal bin Rabah mosque in the capital Kuwait City and a funeral procession to the Sulaibikhat cemetery for the emir, which were limited in attendance to the ruling family. Parliament speaker Ahmed al-Sadoun was the only top official outside the al-Sabah family to be allowed to attend the prayers at the mosque. Kuwait’s new emir, the 83-year-old Sheikh Meshaal al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, was seen shedding a tear at the ceremony and accompanying his half-brother’s coffin, which was draped in a Kuwaiti flag. The new emir will receive condolences from the wider public on Monday and Tuesday. A 40-day mourning period has begun, and a three-day shutdown of government offices will last till Tuesday. Across Kuwait City, flags were lowered to half-mast and large digital billboards displayed pictures of the late ruler.

Hehad been admitted to the hospitallast month, and authorities did not announce an official cause of death on Sunday. His predecessor and brother, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, had ruled for 14 years and was a key figure in shaping the Arab state’s foreign policy. He died in September 2020 at 91. Despite not ruling as emir for long, Sheikh Nawaf held public service offices for six decades, serving as minister of defence, interior, labour and deputy chief of the National Guard. Dignitaries from countries in the Middle East and other parts of the worldpaid their respects following his death. Sheikh Nawaf had issued numerous amnesties for political prisoners, earning him the nickname, “emir of pardons”. One of his last moves before his death was the signing of a draft decree approved by cabinet late last month, demanding the release of dozens of political prisoners. He was defence minister when Iraq, led by President Saddam Hussein, invaded Kuwait in 1990, setting off a war that drew in foreign military powers to end Kuwait’s occupation.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/17/kuwaits-emir-sheikh-nawaf-laid-to-rest-in-private-ceremony
France condemns killing of its worker in Israeli strike in Gaza’s Rafah,The killing comes as French top diplomat Catherine Colonna in Israel to appeal for truce and lasting peace.,"The French Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs has condemned the Israeli bombing of a residential building in Rafah that killed one of its staff in a region previously declared a safe zone. “France condemns this bombing of a residential building which caused the death of many other civilians. We demand that all light be shed by the Israeli authorities on the circumstances of this bombing, as quickly as possible,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Sunday. The house was hit on Wednesday evening, killing the employee and 10 others who had been sheltering with colleagues and their family members in the residential location. The employee had been working with the French government in Gaza since 2002, and some of his family members had already been evacuated from Gaza, the ministry said, offering condolences. The ministry statement is released at a time when external pressure on Israel is increasing due to its“indiscriminate” bombing raidsin Gaza. More than 80 percent of the nearly 19,000 Palestinians killed are said to be civilians. French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna on Sunday pressed for an “immediate and durable” truce in the Gaza war, adding Paris is “deeply concerned” over the situation in the war-ravaged Palestinian territory. “Too many civilians are being killed,” Colonna said during remarks in Tel Aviv with her Israeli counterpart Eli Cohen, as Israel presses on with its offensive after the October 7 attacks that has sent tensions spiralling across the region.    The foreign minister also condemned theOctober 7 attackby Hamas and plans to meet with the families of the Israeli captives held in the Gaza Strip. At least 1,140 people, most of them civilians, were killed in the Hamas attack and 240 were taken captive. Dozens of them were released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners as part of a truce deal late last month. Colonna also plans to pursue an agreement with her Palestinian counterpart Riyad al-Maliki in the occupied West Bank during her trip. Shortly before her arrival in Israel, Colonna condemned increasing attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. “Since October 7, unfortunately, some settlers, driven by their ideological blindness… have committed crimes” against Palestinians, she said, adding that “these settlers must be punished”. More than 290 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces or settlers in the West Bank since October 7, according to the territory’s Ministry of Health.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/17/france-condemns-death-of-its-agent-in-gaza-residential-house-bombing
Israeli military uses drones to kill Palestinians in West Bank’s Tulkarem,Israeli forces reportedly prevented ambulances from reaching the camp and arrested one paramedic as it intensifies raids.,"Israeli forces killed at least five Palestinians in the occupied West Bank’s Tulkarem on Sunday morning, taking the toll in Israeli raids, including drone strikes, in the occupied territories to seven in the last 24 hours. Two of the victims were killed in drone strikes while several others were injured in the large-scale military offensive in Tulkarem, the Palestinian Wafa news agencyreported, quoting the local media and medical sources. Wafa identified the victims as Jihad Aarneh, 25, Mahmoud Samer Jaber, 22, Ghayth Yasser Shahada, 25, Waleed Asaad Zahra, 22, and Asaad Asad Zahra, 33. At least two Palestinians werekilled on Saturdayin two separate incidents in the occupied West Bank. Israel’s army confirmed its forces used aircraft to target Palestinians in the town, saying it struck and killed fighters who had launched explosives at them from the Nur Shams camp. Following the air raid, Israeli forces prevented ambulances from reaching the camp and arrested one paramedic, Wafa reported. The Israeli forces also carried out a large-scale raid with tanks and bulldozers, according to Wafa. Also on Sunday, a Palestinian died from injuries sustained after an Israeli attack in Jenin several days earlier, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said. Al Jazeera’s Charles Stratford, reporting from the Tulkarem refugee camp, said the raid began at 1am on Sunday and lasted nine hours. He said Israeli forces fired projectiles from drones at people in the camp and, according to residents, blocked ambulances from entering to treat the wounded for four hours. “About 17,000 people are living in this camp and they are facing raids like this pretty much every day,” Stratford said. “The situation highlights not only the kind of territory that thousands of civilians are facing, but the huge difficulties that medical crews face as these raids continue,” he said. Israeli military raids and settler attacks have intensified in the occupied West Bank since theGaza warbroke out on October 7. During this time, at least 297 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces and settlers, making it the deadliest year on record in 18 years. The death toll includes at least 65 children, with a further 3,365 injured.    Israeli authorities have also stepped up the arrests of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem since October 7, with more than 4,500 people detained in the past two months, according to the Palestinian Prisoner’s Society. In the besieged Gaza Strip, at least 18,787 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed in Israeli attacks since October 7, according to the territory’s Health Ministry.
