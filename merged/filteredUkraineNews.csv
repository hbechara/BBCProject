Rustem Umerov: Who is Ukraine's next defence minister?,"Who is Rustem Umerov, Ukraine’s next defence minister?",1.0000000000000002,2023-09-04,2023-09-04,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's decision to replace his defence chief has been seen primarily as an attempt to clean up corruption. But the appointment of Rustem Umerov, a Crimean Tatar and a Muslim, is a signal that Ukraine is serious about returning Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.Speculations about the replacement of Oleksii Reznikov, Ukraine's defence minister since November 2021, have been rife for months. While personally not accused of any wrongdoing, the man by President Zelensky's side since day one of the Russian full-scale invasion was seen as unable to stop corruption penetrating his ministry. Military procurement scandals and accusations of bribery against officials at enlistment centres made him damaged goods in the eyes of Ukrainian society, currently in need of a morale boost in the wake of a slower than expected offensive. This is where Rustem Umerov comes in.The 41-year-old is a government official who for the past year headed Ukraine's State Property Fund, but is best known for negotiating with Russia and for organising successful prisoner exchanges. Not a complete unknown but not someone in the media spotlight either, he is a Crimean Tatar born in exile and an active member of this ethnic community, trying to reinstate its cultural identity and its place in the world.Most importantly for Ukrainians, he has not been accused of corruption, embezzlement or profiteering.Mr Umerov came into politics in 2019 when he ran for parliament with the reformist ""Holos"" party, which he later left to become a government official. Before that he worked in the private sector, first in telecoms and later in investment. In 2013, he founded a charity programme to help train Ukrainians at the prestigious Stanford University in the US.But the defining part of his identity are his Crimean Tatar roots and the role they can play in Ukraine's firm intention to return Crimea.Crimean Tatars are the indigenous Turkic population of the Crimean peninsula. During World War II they were falsely accused of collaboration with the Nazis and forcibly deported by the Soviet army to Central Asia. On May 18 1944, a 200,000-strong community was uprooted in one day as families were given a few minutes to pack before being loaded onto trains to be shipped off thousands of kilometres away. Thousands are thought to have perished in transit, or soon afterwards. Not the only ethnic group to experience such treatment under Joseph Stalin, the Crimean Tatars spent decades trying to return to their homeland. Rustem Umerov's family was amongst those deported and he was born in exile in Uzbekistan. In the late 1980s, when he was still a child, many Crimean Tatars, including his family, were allowed to return to the peninsula. For many years Mr Umerov advised Mustafa Dzhemilev, the historic leader of Crimean Tatars, and is himself one of the delegates of the Qurultay - the Crimean Tatar Congress.  He was also co-chair of the Crimea Platform, an international diplomatic initiative focused on negotiating with Russia following its 2014 occupation of the peninsula.""The deportation of Crimean Tatars is one of the greatest crimes of the Soviet regime,"" Umerov wrote in a piece for Liga.net in 2021. ""It was started by the tyrants in power at that time in order to exterminate an entire nation.""While he attacked Russia's 2014 annexation of the Black Sea peninsula, he also worked towards negotiating with Moscow to free several Crimean Tatars, arrested in Crimea since 2014 and bring them to Ukraine. Speaking to the BBC soon after the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022, Umerov said he was determined ""to find [a] political and diplomatic resolution to this brutal invasion"".In his televised address to the nation on Sunday, President Zelensky confirmed he would seek parliamentary approval to make Mr Umerov his new defence minister, saying the ministry ""requires fresh approaches and new modes of engagement with both the military and society at large.""For now a full-scale military assault on Crimea may be some way off, and some observers have described as unrealistic Ukraine's intentions to return to its pre-2014 borders, which would include the peninsula.But President Zelenksy's appointment of an indigenous Crimean to play a key role in realising these intentions sends a clear message: this is Kyiv's endgame.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has proposed Rustem Umerov, head of Ukraine’s main privatisation agency, to serve as the country’s wartime defence minister followingOleksii Reznikov’s dismissal. Here is what you need to know about Umerov: Umerov, 41, is aCrimean Tatar, a Turkic group of Sunni Muslims whose ancestral home is the Crimean Peninsula, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. In 1944, 180,000 Crimean Tatars, including Umerov’s family, were deported from Crimea to Uzbekistan on the orders of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. He was born in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. In 1991, Rustam and his family returned to Crimea during the Crimean Tatar repatriation of the late 1980s and early 90s. At an elite boarding school, the young Umerov learned five languages: Ukrainian, Tatar, Russian, Turkish and English. As part of the Future Leaders Exchange Program run by the US Department of State, he was sent to study in the United States in 1998 before joining the European Youth Parliament. Umerov began his career in the private sector. He joined one of Ukraine’s leading mobile operators in 2004. In 2013, he established his own investment company, ASTEM, and its ASTEM Foundation. He has a bachelor’s degree in economics and a master’s in finance. In 2014, when Russia occupied Crimea, he was the adviser toMustafa Dzhemilev, the leader of the Crimean Tatar Mejlis. Since 2020, Umerov has been a member of a Ukrainian government task force working on a strategy to end the occupation of Crimea. In September 2022, Umerov, then a lawmaker from the pro-European Holos party, became head of the State Property Fund, an agency selling state assets to private investors. He is credited with turning around an institution frequently mired in corruption scandals. He also relaunched sales of state property, raising record proceeds for the state during the war. Umerov, described as a talented negotiator by people close to him, was a member of the Ukrainian team that negotiated with Russia in March 2022, one month after Russia’s full-scale invasion. He also participated in talkson the Black Sea grain dealand prisoner exchanges, including Ukraine’s Azov fighters who were captured during the battle for the southern city of Mariupol in 2022. He was also involved in securing the release from Russian authorities of Crimean Tatars Ahtem Chiygoz and Ilmi Umerov in 2017. He was a member of the delegation during a visit by Zelenskyy to Saudi Arabia in May and accompanied first lady Olena Zelenska during a visit to the United Arab Emirates in March. #UAEwill help#Ukraineto establish Ukraine Sovereign Fund.

Ukraine and Russia complete first prisoner swap since plane crash,Russia and Ukraine complete first prisoner exchange since plane crash,0.9148187631454907,2024-01-31,2024-01-31,"Russia and Ukraine say they have exchanged captured soldiers - the first swap since the crash of a Russian plane that Moscow claimed had 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war (PoWs) on board.Russia's military says each side got 195 soldiers back on Wednesday.Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says 207 Ukrainian soldiers were returned.Kyiv questions Moscow's claims that Ukrainian PoWs were on the plane that came down last week. Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed on Wednesday that the Il-76 military transport plane had been downed by Ukraine in the western Belgorod region using an American Patriot system. He provided no proof. The Russian military had previously said that dozens of Ukrainian soldiers were on the plane, which was heading to the area for a prisoner exchange. It said six Russian crew members and three escorting officials were also on board, adding that there were no survivors.Russia has as yet produced no firm evidence of its claims and officials there have a long and proven history of lies and disinformation.  Kyiv has not directly denied the Russian statements but says that nothing has been confirmed.  Last week, a spokesman for military intelligence in Kyiv told the BBC that he ""does not exclude"" the possibility that PoWs were on the Il-76 plane.Other official statements talk about Ukraine's right to defend itself from Russian missiles, particularly fired from Belgorod, near the Ukrainian border.But many in Ukraine wonder why Russia has not shown images of dozens of dead bodies after the plane crash to back up its assertions.  None of the details have been independently verified and both sides have called for an international investigation.Wednesday's exchange is the 50th PoW swap since President Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. In a brief statement, the Russian defence ministry said the exchange was completed after negotiations.""The released military personnel will be transported by military transport aircraft... to Moscow for treatment and rehabilitation,"" it said.""All those released are provided with the necessary medical and psychological assistance,"" the statement said.Footage released by the ministry purportedly shows those exchanged Russian soldiers boarding a bus before their flight to Moscow.Meanwhile, President Zelensky wrote in a post on social media: ""Our people are back. 207 of them. We return them home no matter what.""We remember every Ukrainian in captivity. Both warriors and civilians. We must bring all of them back,"" he said, thanking Ukraine's top security officials for making the latest exchange possible.Videos filmed by the Ukrainian authorities show the released PoWs spilling off buses, with big grins and shouts of ""Glory to Ukraine!"" One soldier drops to the ground, rolling in the snow, so overjoyed to be back.The men are wearing Russian prison uniforms, their heads are close-shaven and many look gaunt after their time in captivity.Some are in tears, talking to relatives by phone. At the end of the video they all stand, wrapped in Ukraine's national blue-and-yellow flags, and singing the country's anthem.The exchange was kept secret until it happened, for security. Ukraine confirms that the United Arab Emirates was involved as a mediator, as it was earlier this month, but we do not know any details about the negotiations. Ukraine's co-ordination centre for PoWs said among those released were National Guard members, border guards as well as one police officer. Ukraine has said that none of the 65 men who were due for release last week, and who Russia claims were killed, are among the latest to be swapped. However, a spokesman for Ukrainian military intelligence told the BBC some of the other soldiers who did return on Wednesday, had been due to be swapped in the last exchange.The BBC has spoken to friends and relatives of the 65 still unaccounted for. They do not want to comment publicly, but stress that there is no evidence of anything at this point - and they remain hopeful. ""Of course, we're worried,"" a friend of one prisoner said. ""But there is no information, no proof.""There are still thousands of Ukrainian PoWs being held in Russia.Their families usually have no contact with them at all, and can know nothing about the men's fate until they are suddenly freed in a prisoner swap.One woman, Tetyana, whose son was captured in Ukraine's south-eastern city of Mariupol in 2022, told the BBC she had heard nothing from her son directly ever since. The last confirmation he was even alive was more than a year ago, when a prisoner who was released confirmed that they had shared a cell. Tetyana described the agony of living with such uncertainty and having to convince herself each day that her son was still alive.","Russia and Ukraine have exchanged hundreds of prisoners of war, in the first prisoner swap since thecrashlast week of a Russian military transport plane that Moscow says was carrying 65 Ukrainian soldiers. The Russian Ministry of Defence said that each side got 195 soldiers back and that its soldiers would be flown to Moscow to receive medical and psychological treatment. “On January 31, as a result of the negotiation process, 195 Russian servicemen who were in mortal danger in captivity were returned from territory controlled by the Kyiv regime. In return, exactly 195 prisoners from the armed forces of Ukraine were handed over,” the Defence Ministry said in a statement. It was cited by the RIA state news agency as saying that the United Arab Emirates had played a role in brokering the deal. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on his official account on X that it was one of the biggest swaps so far. He gave a slightly higher number for the number of Ukrainians returned. “Our people are back. 207 of them. We return them home no matter what,” said Zelenskyy. Ukraine’s governmental body in charge of POWs said that this was the 50th prisoner exchange of its kind. It returned home soldiers involved in the defence of the cities of Mariupol and Kherson, as well as soldiers captured by Russia on Snake Island in the Black Sea. The body said marines and combat medics were among those handed back and that 36 of the returned Ukrainians had injuries or serious illnesses. The two countries have carried out periodic prisoner swaps via intermediaries since the war began nearly two years ago, despite the absence of any peace talks between them since the early months of the conflict. The latest and biggest exchange was on January 3, when they traded a total of 478 captives following mediation by the UAE. The crash on January 24 of a Russian Ilyushin Il-76 plane in a field before a similar planned swap had thrown doubt on the future of prisoner exchanges between the two sides. Moscow said Ukrainian soldiers being carried to a scheduled exchange were killed when the plane was shot down by Kyiv’s forces. Kyiv has not outright denied Moscow’s version of events but questioned whether captured Ukrainian soldiers were actually on board. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday said that a US-made Patriot missile was used to shoot down the military cargo plane. “The plane was shot down, it has already been established for certain, by an American Patriot system,” Putin said in a televised appearance.

Ukraine celebrates first Christmas on 25 December,Ukraine officially celebrates Christmas on December 25 for the first time,0.8927371923470879,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,"Many Ukrainian Orthodox Christians are preparing to celebrate Christmas on 25 December for the first time this year. Ukraine has traditionally used the Julian calendar, also used by Russia, where Christmas falls on 7 January. In a further shift from Russia, it is now marking Christmas according to the Western - or Gregorian - calendar, which it uses in everyday life.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky changed the law in July, saying it allowed Ukrainians to ""abandon the Russian heritage"" of celebrating Christmas in January. In a Christmas message issued on Sunday evening, Mr Zelensky said all Ukrainians were now together. ""We all celebrate Christmas together. On the same date, as one big family, as one nation, as one united country."" In the capital Kyiv, married couple Lesia Shestakova, a Catholic, and Oleksandr Shestakov, who is Orthodox, are celebrating Christmas together.The pair - who until now marked Christmas twice, with their respective parents - attended the Sunday morning service at the city's Catholic cathedral (pictured above).""There is finally a day in Ukraine which my husband and I can spend together in the cathedral and thank God that we are together, alive and in good health,"" Lesia told Reuters news agency.The Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU), a newly created independent church that held its first service in 2019, has also changed its Christmas date to 25 December. It formally broke away from the Russian Orthodox church over Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its support for separatists in eastern Ukraine.People prayed and lit candles across the country on Sunday. In the western city of Lviv, which has been little damaged by the war, children in traditional costumes sang carols and took part in festive processions on the streets. Ukrainians decorate a Christmas tree near the Independence Square in Kyiv, UkraineIn recent years many worshippers have joined the OCU but millions still follow the historically Russia-linked Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC), and so will continue to celebrate Christmas on 7 January. The UOC says that in 2022 it split from Moscow because of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine although many people remain sceptical.And of course there are expected to be quite a few Ukrainians who will be celebrating twice - the more the merrier.  All pictures are subject to copyright.","Ukrainians have celebrated Christmas on December 25 for the first time, as part of an ongoing effort to remove Russian influence from their country. The change was enacted in a law signed by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in July, reflecting both the Ukrainians’ dismay with the 22-month-old Russian invasion and their assertion of anational identity. Ukraine previously marked Christmas in January as the Russians do. “It’s historical justice,” said Yevhen Konyk, a 44-year-old serviceman who, along with his family, participated in traditional celebrations at an open-air museum in Kyiv. “We need to move forward not only with the world but also with the traditions of our country and overcome the imperial remnants we had.”    Ukraine is largely Orthodox Christian but the faith is divided between two churches, one of which has a long affiliation with the Russian Orthodox Church. TheOrthodox Churchof Ukraine, which does not recognise the authority of the Russian church and had been regarded as schismatic, was granted full recognition in 2019 by the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, Orthodoxy’s top authority. The Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which had been a branch of the Russian church, announced in 2022 after the start of the Russia-Ukraine war that it wasbreaking tieswith Moscow and becoming autonomous. Its parishes, however, continue to follow the same liturgical calendar as the Russian church and will observe Christmas on January 7.  Many Ukrainians embraced the move to celebrate Christmas on the date aligned with the rest of Western Europe with enthusiasm. Oksana Poviakel, the director of the Pyrohiv Museum of Folk Architecture and Life of Ukraine, where Christmas celebrations took place, said celebrating on December 25 is “another important factor of self-identification”. “We are separating ourselves from the neighbour who is currently trying to destroy our state, who is killing our people, destroying our homes, and burning our land,” she said. Asia Landarenko, 63, said she prays every day for her son who is in the military. “The state of war affects everything, including the mood. The real celebration of Christmas will be after the victory, but as the saviour was born, so will be our victory,” she said."
Drone attack hits building in central Moscow,"Ukraine combat drone damages building in central Moscow, Russia says",0.8217282653129949,2023-08-18,2023-08-18,"Russian officials have accused Ukraine of launching a drone attack on a building in Moscow, causing an explosion that was heard across the city's business district.Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said air defences had shot down the drone with its debris falling on the city's Expo Center.It marks the latest in a series of such attacks on the Russian capital. Unverified footage on social media appeared to show thick grey smoke rising into the night sky over Moscow.There was no immediate comment from Ukraine, but officials in Kyiv have never formally acknowledged launching attacks on targets in Moscow.The attack occurred at around 04:00 local time (01:00 GMT), Russia's defence ministry said on Telegram. It said that, after activating the city's air defence systems, the drone had ""changed its flight path"", falling on a non-residential building on the Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment, an area of Moscow which hosts a number of government buildings. It added that there were no initial reports of casualties. The Expo Center is a large exhibition space used for conferences and conventions and is situated less than 5km (3.1 miles) from the Kremlin.A witness who was in the area told Reuters news agency the attack had caused ""a powerful explosion"". The Russian defence ministry said the debris had not caused a fire, while Mr Sobyanin said the drone had caused ""no significant damage"" to the building.One Russian state-owned news agency, Tass, reported that one of the outer walls of the centre had partially collapsed, citing emergency services. It said the affected area was around 30 sq m (323 sq ft). Moscow's Vnukovo Airport also closed following the incident, Tass said, but reopened a short time later. Until earlier this year, Moscow remained untouched by the war in Ukraine, but in recent months has been targeted by drone strikes. On 30 May, several buildings were reported damaged in a wave of strikes.On 30 and 31 July, two separate drones crashed into the glass facade of a skyscraper just a few hundred metres from the Expo Center. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said at the time that the war was ""returning to the territory of Russia"" and that this was an ""inevitable, natural and absolutely fair process"".Hours before the latest strike in Moscow, a Ukrainian sea drone was destroyed during an attempted attack on Russia's naval fleet in the Black Sea, Russia's defence ministry said. ","A Ukrainian military drone crashed into a Moscow city building after it was shot down by air defence systems inthe latest attack on the Russian capital by unmanned aerial vehicles. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app thatair defence systems had shot down a drone early on Friday morningand debris had fallen on buildings in the city’s Expo Center complex. The Expo Center – a large event space used for major exhibitions and conferences – is located less than 5km (3.1 miles) from the Kremlin. A video published by Russian media outlets showed thick smoke rising next to skyscrapers in the city. The Russian defence ministry said thatUkraine launched the drone attackat about 4am local time (01:00 GMT) “using an unmanned aerial vehicle against objects located in Moscow and the Moscow region”. “The UAV, after being exposed to air defence weapons, changed its flight path and fell on a nonresidential building in the Krasnopresnenskaya embankment area of Moscow,” the ministry said on Telegram.    Moscow’s mayor said emergency services were on the scene, but that early reports indicated there were no casualties. “The wreckage of the UAV fell in the area of the Expo Center, and did not cause significant damage to the building,” Sobyanin said on Telegram. State-run news agency TASS reported that one of the walls of the Expo Center’s pavilion had partially collapsed, citing emergency services. “The area of the collapse is about 30 square metres [323sq feet],” emergency services told TASS. The Expo Centre, on the Krasnopresnenskaya embankment of the Moskva River, hosts regular exhibitions and trade shows, according to its website. The venue is 100 metres (328 feet) from Moscow-City, an office block in the capital’s main business district that was struck twice within days by debris from downed drone strikes this month. TASS also reported that the airspace near Moscow’s international airport of Vnukovo was briefly closed, with departures and arrivals delayed, citing the aviation service. Moscow and its surrounding areashave come under frequent drone attacks in recent weeks, including two drone attacks that were repelled over Moscow’s financial district, with each causing minor damage to the facades of high-rise buildings. In May, drones were shot down near the Kremlin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned last month that “war” was coming to Russia, with the country’s “symbolic centres and military bases” now targets of Kyiv. Russia’s defence ministry also said that it thwarted a Ukrainian marine drone attack on its warships in the Black Sea on Thursday night.    Ukrainian forces had attempted to attack ships of the Russian Black Sea Fleet at 10:55pm local time (19:55 GMT) with an “unmanned sea boat” while the ships were operating in the southwestern part of the Black Sea 237km (147 miles) southwest of Sevastopol, the TASS news agency reported, citing the defence ministry. Sevastopol is the base of Russia’s Black Sea fleet on the Moscow-annexed Crimean peninsula. The ministry said the sea-borne drone was destroyed by the Pytlivyi frigate and the Vasily Bykov patrol ship before it could reach its target. Russian warships also repelled a Ukrainian sea drone attack on Russia’s Novorossiysk naval base on August 4, the news agency reported."
Anna Politkovskaya: Russian convicted of journalist murder gets pardon,Russian convicted over journalist Anna Politkovskaya’s murder pardoned,0.8194017942022973,2023-11-14,2023-11-14,"One of the five men convicted over the 2006 murder of Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya has been pardoned after fighting in Ukraine, his lawyer says.Sergei Khadzhikurbanov, a former Moscow police officer, was jailed for 20 years at a trial in 2014.His lawyer, Alexei Mikhalchik, said the pardon came after he had completed a six-month military contract.Ms Politkovskaya's family and employer described the decision as a ""monstrous injustice"". Ms Politkovskaya, an investigative reporter and vocal critic of Russia's war in Chechnya, was shot in a lift in her block of flats.Her reporting for Novaya Gazeta newspaper won international renown for her dogged investigation of Russian abuses in Chechnya.But her pieces, which were highly critical of President Vladimir Putin, then serving his second term, and the Chechen leadership, angered many in authority.In a joint statement, the newspaper, along with Ms Politkovskaya's son Ilya and daughter Vera, said none of them had received notice of the pardon, adding that no efforts were being made to bring to justice others who were responsible for the murder. It has never been determined who ordered the killing.""For us, this 'pardon' is not evidence of the redemption and remorse of the murderer,"" the statement said.""It's a monstrous fact of injustice and lawlessness, desecration of the memory of a person killed for her convictions and doing her professional duty.""Khadzhikurbanov was found guilty of providing logistical support for the murder.""As a special forces fighter, [Khadzhikurbanov] was invited to sign a contract to participate in the special military operation,"" his lawyer told AFP.""When the contract expired, he was pardoned by presidential decree.""The Russian defence ministry has been recruiting prisoners to fight in Ukraine, apparently taking over from the Wagner mercenary group which was the first to adopt the practice last year.At the murder trial in 2014, Rustam Makhmudov was given a life sentence for pulling the trigger.His uncle Lom-Ali Gaitukayev, one of those found guilty of organising Ms Politkovskaya's murder, was also jailed for life.Makhmudov's two brothers, Dzhabrail and Ibragim, were sentenced to 14 and 12 years in a penal colony.","A man convicted for his role in the killing of investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya has been pardoned after fighting in Ukraine, according to his lawyer and local media reports. Politkovskaya, who was well known for reporting on abuses in Russia’s war in Chechnya early in Vladimir Putin’s presidency, was shot dead outside her flat in Moscow in 2006. The killing triggered an outcry in the West and underlined the growing dangers of reporting in Russia as Putin gradually clamped down on independent media. Sergei Khadzhikurbanov, a former police officer, was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2014 for organising the killing. “As a special forces fighter, [Khadzhikurbanov] was invited to sign a contract to participate in the special military operation… When the contract expired, he was pardoned by presidential decree,” Khadzhikurbanov’s lawyer Alexei Mikhalchik told the AFP news agency.    Khadzhikurbanov was convictedalong with four other menfrom Chechnya, a mostly Muslim region in the northern Caucasus where Russia and its local allies crushed two rebellions, in 1994-96 and, under Putin, in 1999-2009. In 2018, the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg found that, while the authorities had found and convicted a group of men who had directly carried out the contract killing, they had “failed to take adequate investigatory steps to find the person or persons who had commissioned the murder”. Politkovskaya, who did much of her work for the independent investigative magazine Novaya Gazeta, now banned in Russia, won more than a dozen international prizes for reporting on abuses committed in Chechnya by Russian and allied forces as well as by rebels, despite repeated detentions and death threats. Many Russian prisoners have been sent to fight in Ukraine since Moscow launched its offensive last February, with critics warning some have committed new crimes after returning from the front. The Kremlin last week acknowledged the use of prisoner recruits to fight in Ukraine and said convicts who “atone for their crime on the battlefield with blood” could be pardoned. “They are atoning with blood in storm brigades, under bullets and under shells,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Friday.    Russia has probably recruited 100,000 people from prisons to fight in Ukraine, Olga Romanova, the head of an independent prisoners’ rights group has estimated. Local Russian media outlets have reported several instances of released prisoners going on to commit serious offences, including murders, after having left the army."
"Ukraine spy chief's wife poisoned, says Kyiv","Ukraine says Marianna Budanova, wife of military spy chief, was poisoned",0.8120653466656048,2023-11-28,2023-11-28,"The wife of Ukraine's spy chief Lt Gen Kyrylo Budanov, Marianna Budanova, has been poisoned with heavy metals, a spokesman for the country's military intelligence has told BBC Ukrainian. Andriy Yusov said several other agency employees also had mild symptoms of poisoning. He did not specify how many.Reports in Ukrainian media did not say whether or not Russia was thought to be behind the alleged attack.There were no suggestions that Gen Budanov may also have been targeted.The general, who leads the Main Directorate of Intelligence (DIU) of Ukraine's defence ministry, has played a key role in planning and sometimes executing major military operations against Russian forces, following Moscow's full-scale invasion in February 2022.A Ukrainian intelligence source earlier told the BBC Mrs Budanova was being treated in hospital after falling ill.News website Babel, which on Tuesday was the first to report the alleged poisoning, said Mrs Budanova had been taken to hospital after feeling unwell for a ""prolonged period of time"".Citing its own sources in Ukrainian intelligence, Babel said she was now completing a course of treatment and would be monitored by doctors.No detail has been given of the type of heavy metal suspected in Mrs Budanova's poisoning. However, the unnamed official made clear the substances were ""not used in any way in everyday life or military operations"". Ukrainska Pravda later quoted its own sources as saying the poisoning had been confirmed after tests.She had most likely been given poisoned food, it reported, but was now ""feeling better"" after completing an initial course of treatment.Separately, Ukraine's Unian news agency quoted its source as saying that Mrs Budanova was being treated in a hospital in Ukraine, not abroad.Mrs Budanova - born in 1993 in Kyiv - has a master's degree in psychology. She later became involved in politics, working as an adviser to the mayor of Kyiv.In 2022, she told Elle magazine that she had also worked as a volunteer in Kyiv's military hospital in 2015-17.In September, Lt Gen Budanov, 37, told the War Zone website that he and his wife had been staying in his office ""since the February invasion"" in 2022 for safety reasons.""She's [Marianna] actually a professor at our national police academy. She's teaching legal psychology. It's not a problem for her as it might have been for someone else.""Mr Yusov told Ukrainska Pravda earlier this year that more than 10 assassination attempts had been made against Gen Budanov.","The wife of Ukraine’s military spy chief has been poisoned with heavy metals and is undergoing treatment, a Ukrainian official says. A spokesperson for the Ukrainian military intelligence agency, or GUR, said Marianna Budanova, wife of Kyrylo Budanov, was receiving treatment in hospital. “Yes, I can confirm the information. Unfortunately, it is true,” GUR spokesperson Andriy Yusov told the Reuters news agency on Tuesday without clarifying when the poisoning occurred or who was responsible. Budanov has become a celebrated figure in Ukraine for his role in planning clandestine operations against Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.    Yusov said this year that Budanov had survived 10 assassination attempts by Russia’s Federal Security Service, or FSB. While it is not immediately clear who was behind the suspected poisoning of his wife, the BBC’s Ukrainian service cited Yusov as saying that other GUR officials have experienced milder poisoning symptoms. The suspected poisoning was first reported by Ukrainian media. There was no immediate comment from Russian authorities. Russian media figures have speculated that the poisoning could be a result of infighting within Ukraine. Russia has previously been accused of poisoning dissidents, including politicianAlexey Navalnyand twoRussian exileswho attended a summit in Berlin organised by a critic of Russia. Moscow has also blamed Ukraine for suspected involvement in the killings of apro-war Russian bloggerand a pro-war journalist on Russian soil, something Ukraine denies."

Georgia was passed over for candidate status at the time.President Volodymyr Zelensky described the European Commission report as ""historic"" and said it was an important day.Ms von der Leyen said Ukraine had completed ""well over 90% of the necessary reforms"" that the EU set out last year, adding that ""the goal is truly within reach"".It was also a day to celebrate in Georgia, she said. The government in Tbilisi is seen as having made sufficient progress on gender equality, fighting violence against women and organised crime.A final decision on the recommendations will be made by the EU's member states at their December summit.But the devil to reaching the goal of membership is in the detail.EU accession talks are a slalom of technicalities and caveats and they tend to be painstakingly slow. Candidate countries need to meet extensive legal and economic criteria to join. ""Just because you are granted candidate status, it doesn't mean you will join the EU tomorrow,"" said an EU diplomat.The entire process normally takes about a decade, but can take longer than that.""The Western Balkans are the best example of how slow, tricky and inefficient the process can be,"" said Tina Akhvlediani of the Centre for European Policy Studies.Each enlargement decision requires the backing of all 27 EU members, and any country can block negotiations at any stage, often due to bilateral disputes.""It can be because of ethnic identities, cultural differences, even the name of the country. Greece demanded that Macedonia change its name to North Macedonia,"" said Ms Akhvlediani.The European Commission report, released on Wednesday, however recommends that Ukraine needs to:""Ukraine has had massive issues with corruption, and it needs to do more to carry out judicial reform - which is relatively fundamental stuff,"" said Tina Akhvlediani. But there is a certain leniency, considering that Ukraine is in the middle of a war.""In spite of the invasion, they have come a long way and tried their very best to reform. It's really impressive,"" Michael Gahler, a German MEP from the Christian Democrats, told the BBC.Unlike Nato, which Ukraine is also seeking to join, the European Union has no collective defence pact. But Mr Gahler says Ukraine joining the EU would ensure that Russia does not make a further attempt to take over the country.""We need to make it very clear that Ukraine belongs in Europe,"" said Mr Gahler. ""It is not in the Russian orbit, it is firmly anchored in the West. And for that to happen, we need to start accession negotiations.""But ultimately the EU is facing a dilemma. It is torn between the signal of solidarity it wants to send to Ukrainians, and the difficulty of integrating such a large and war-torn country.Ukraine is the most heavily mined country in the world, it is awash with weapons, and latest estimates suggest that around 18% of its territory is controlled by Russia. ""EU leaders understand the urgency of anchoring Ukraine firmly in the West, but they are also aware that the country's security situation would pose greater challenges than any previous EU enlargement,"" said Stefan Lehne from the Carnegie Europe think tank.""The EU will have genuine problems in integrating a country that is so big and so different from the present members.""President Zelensky has promised that Kyiv will meet the Commission's conditions, and stressed how a positive EU decision will give fresh motivation to his troops. That is particularly relevant amid fears of ""Ukraine fatigue"" mounting among Western allies. He has spoken himself of the Israel-Hamas war  ""taking away the focus"" from the war in Ukraine.No EU member state is ready to admit Ukraine while it is at war, but the geopolitical urgency is there, says Tina Akhvlediani from the Centre for European Policy Studies.""If Ukraine doesn't join the EU, then the country will be lost to Russia. It's autocracy versus democracy. We can't just watch while Russia invades other countries that have European aspirations.""But enlargement has never come about smoothly for the European Union. It is quite normal for the European Commission, which runs the process, to take a positive approach toward future accessions, while national governments are often divided. In Brussels, Hungary is seen as the main hurdle that could scupper Ukraine's ambitions. Prime Minister Viktor Orban was recently photographed shaking hands with Russia's Vladimir Putin and he has been critical of sending more military support to Ukraine. In the early days of the EU, enlargement was driven by the need to consolidate Western Europe during the Cold War - and later by the necessity of stabilising the parts of the former Soviet empire that had become independent.The renewed Russian threat has revived interest in bringing in Western Balkan and Eastern European countries. ""European countries understand that we are in systemic conflict with an aggressive Russia,"" says German Michael Gahler. ""The rest of the world is watching how Europe deals with it. If we backtrack on Ukraine, that would be disastrous. We would be seen as unreliable partners for the rest of the world.""","The European Union’s executive has recommended opening formal membership talks with Ukraine, as soon as it meets final conditions, in a major show of support for Kyiv in itsbattle against Russia. “This is a strong and historic step that paves the way to a stronger EU with Ukraine as its member,” Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyposted on social media on Wednesday. “Our country must be in the European Union. Ukrainians deserve it both for their defence of European values and for the fact that even in times of full-scale war, we keep our word,” he said. The European Commission, which also paved the way for discussions to begin with Moldova, recommended that the talks should formally be launched once Ukraine satisfies remaining conditions related to reining in corruption, adopting a law on lobbying in line with EU standards and strengthening national minority safeguards. “Today is a historic day,” commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. “Ukraine continues to face tremendous hardship and tragedy provoked by Russia’s war of aggression, and yet the Ukrainians are deeply reforming their country.” Ukraine launched its bid to become part of the EU after Moscow’s invasion in February 2022 and was officially named a candidate to join in June that year. Former Soviet republicMoldovahad applied at the same time as Ukraine. Moldovan President Maia Sandu thanked Brussels and said her country was “firmly on the path for EU membership and we will continue working relentlessly towards this goal”. The EU’s 27 leaders still have to sign off on the recommendations at a summit in December, and the membership process is contingent upon the completion of required reforms with regular progress assessments as part of a long and vigorous process. Brussels also suggested member states grantGeorgiacandidate status. “I rejoice with the people of Georgia,” Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili wrote online. Balkan country Bosnia and Herzegovina did not get approval yet again, having come short on expected membership criteria, von der Leyen said. Other EU hopefuls includeTurkey, which began accession talks in 2005, but those are at a dead end. Albania, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia are also stuck in negotiations. Thewar in Ukrainehas breathed new life into the EU’s stalled push to take on new members as the bloc looks to keep Russian and Chinese influence at bay. The commission in June last year set Kyiv seven reform benchmarks to complete, including tackling corruption and curbing oligarch power, before talks should start. Von der Leyen said Ukraine had now completed “well over 90 percent of the necessary steps”. The positive signal from the EU provides a vital boost to Ukraine at a difficult time. However, whether EU countries will be ready by December to approve the talks with the war-torn country of more than 40 million people is uncertain.   "
Ukraine war: Sergei Surovikin 'seen in first photo' since Wagner mutiny,Russian General Surovikin seen in first photo since Wagner mutiny: Reports,0.7848073002943514,2023-09-05,2023-09-05,"A photo posted online appears to show a Russian general who has not been seen in public since a mutiny by the Wagner mercenary group in June.Sergei Surovikin is said to have been close to Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin, who died in a plane crash last month.There have been reports that Gen Surovikin is being investigated for possible complicity in the mutiny. But a photo purporting to show Russia's former commander in Ukraine has now been published on social media.""General Sergei Surovikin is out. Alive, healthy, at home, with his family, in Moscow. Photo taken today,"" well-known Russian media personality Ksenia Sobchak wrote in a caption on the picture on Telegram on Monday.The photo shows a man wearing sunglasses walking arm in arm with a red-haired woman who resembles the general's wife, Anna. BBC Verify analysis suggests there is a high probability that the man in the photo is Gen Surovikin, and the woman is almost certainly Anna. The BBC has also found no previous copies of the photo circulating online, suggesting it has emerged recently. Russian journalist Alexei Venediktov separately wrote on Telegram: ""General Surovikin is at home with his family. He is on leave and available to the defence ministry.""Wagner's mercenaries attempted a brief mutiny on 23 and 24 June, threatening to march on Moscow.Prigozhin and nine others were killed in the crash near Moscow on 23 August, which led to frenzied speculation. The Wagner boss was described by many as a ""dead man walking"" after the failed mutiny.Gen Surovikin had last been seen in public in a video during the mutiny urging the Wagner forces to call a halt to their action.Media reports days later said he had been arrested, but there has been no official confirmation of his whereabouts.The general was put in charge of Russian forces in Ukraine in October but was removed three months later.He gained a reputation for brutality during Russian operations in Syria, where he became known as ""General Armageddon"".","A new photo appearing to showRussian General Sergei Surovikin, who disappeared from public view following a short-lived mutiny by Wagner mercenary fighters in June, has been published on the social media account of a prominent Russian media personality.

He is on leave and available to the Defence Ministry”. Surovikin, who gained the nickname “General Armageddon” for his brutality during Russia’s military intervention in Syria’s civil war, was brieflyin charge of Moscow’s war effortin Ukraine before that role was handed in January to General Valery Gerasimov, chief of the general staff. Various international and Russian military bloggers reported that Surovikin had fallen under suspicion by the Kremlin following the brief mutiny by Wagner mercenaries in June and that he was being investigated for possible complicity.    Russia’s state news agency RIA said last month thatSurovikin had been removedas head of the country’s aerospace forces and his deputy Viktor Afzalov had assumed the job on a temporary basis. The late Wagner boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who died in a private jet crash last month with other senior Wagner figures, was fiercely critical of Russia’s military leaders but spoke highly of Surovikin, calling him “a man who is not afraid of responsibility”. Widely viewed by Russian war commentators as a forceful and capable figure, Surovikin was considered one ofPrigozhin’s most important alliesin the regular Russian army and in the Wagner chief’s bitter disputes with Russia’s Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of General Staff Gerasimov.

Wagner boss Prigozhin confirmed dead in plane crash - Moscow,Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin confirmed dead in crash,0.7816804209263579,2023-08-27,2023-08-27,"Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin has been confirmed dead after genetic analysis of bodies found in Wednesday's plane crash, Russian officials say.The Investigative Committee (SK) said the identities of all 10 victims had been established and corresponded to those on the flight's passenger list.Prigozhin's private jet came down north-west of Moscow on 23 August, killing all those on board.The Kremlin has denied speculation it was to blame for the crash.The SK said it was continuing a criminal investigation.""Molecular-genetic testing has been completed,"" it said in a statement.""According to its results, the identities of all 10 deceased have been established, and they correspond to the list published in the flight manifest.""The victims include several senior figures in Wagner, a Russian mercenary group set up by Prigozhin and involved in military operations in Ukraine, Syria and parts of Africa.Among them was Dmitry Utkin, who managed Wagner's military operations.The others on the Embraer Legacy plane - flying from Moscow to St Petersburg - included Wagner members Valery Chekalov, Sergei Propustin, Yevgeny Makaryan, Alexander Totmin and Nikolay Matuseyev.The plane was flown by pilot Alexei Levshin and co-pilot Rustam Karimov, and there was one flight attendant, Kristina Raspopova.The crash came two months after Prigozhin led a Wagner mutiny against the Russian armed forces, seizing the southern city of Rostov and threatening to march on Moscow.The standoff was defused after a deal was reached which led to Prigozhin and Wagner fighters relocating to Belarus.However, Russian President Vladimir Putin described the mutiny as a ""stab in the back"" and there has been speculation that Russian security forces were somehow involved in the crash.US officials quoted by CBS have said that the most likely cause of the crash was an explosion on board the plane, and the Pentagon said Prigozhin was probably killed.On Friday Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said rumours of foul play were an ""absolute lie"".Mr Putin has sent his condolences to the families of the victims.He described Prigozhin as a ""talented person"" who ""made serious mistakes in life"".","Russian authoritiesconfirmed the deathof Wagner Group chief Yevgeny Prigozhin, putting to rest any doubts about whether the wily mercenary leader turned mutineer was on a plane that crashed killing everyone on board. Genetic testing on the 10 bodies recovered at thecrash site“conform to the manifest ” for the flight, Russian Investigative Committee spokeswoman Svetlana Petrenko said in a statement on Sunday. Russia’s civil aviation authority had said Prigozhin and some of his top lieutenants were on the list of seven passengers and three crew members. The Investigative Committee did not indicate what might have caused the business jet to plummet from the sky halfway between Moscow and St Petersburg, Prigozhin’s hometown. But the crash’s timing raised suspicions of a possible Kremlin-orchestrated hit – something Russia has vehemently denied. Peter Eltsov, associate professor at the US National Defense University, said conspiracy theories about Prigozhin still being alive say a lot about how big a figure the Wagner Group chief was in Russia. “He is becoming this iconic hero for a lot of his followers,” Eltsov told Al Jazeera. Two months ago, Prigozhin, 62, mounted a daylong mutiny against Russia’s military, leading his mercenaries from Ukraine toward Moscow. Russian President Vladimir Putin decried the act as “treason” and vowed punishment for those involved. Instead, the Kremlin quickly cut a deal with Prigozhin to end the revolt, saying he would be allowed to walk free without facing any charges and to resettle in Belarus. Questions remained about whether the former ally of Russia’s leader would face a comeuppance for the brief uprising that posed the biggest challenge to Putin’s authority during his 23-year rule. Prigozhin’s second-in-command, Dmitry Utkin, as well as Wagner logistics mastermind Valery Chekalov, also were killed in the crash. Utkin was long believed to have founded Wagner and baptised the group with his nom de guerre.    Prigozhin was locked in a bitter months-long power struggle with the defence ministry as his forces spearheaded costly battles for limited gains in eastern Ukraine. He earlier accused the Russian military of trying to “steal” victories from Wagner and slammed Moscow’s “monstrous bureaucracy” for grinding progress on the ground. And he directly blamed Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and other senior officials for his fighters’ deaths, claiming Moscow had not provided sufficient ammunition. Unlike Russia’s generals, who have been criticised for shirking the battles in Ukraine, the stocky and bald Prigozhin regularly posed for pictures alongside mercenaries allegedly on the front lines. He posted on social media images from the cockpit of an Su-24 fighter jet and challenged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to an aerial duel. Wagner soldiers played a prominent role in the fighting in eastern Ukraine, especially in the months-long siege of the city of Bakhmut, despite Prigozhin’s frequent, profanity-laced attacks on Russia’s military high command over their conduct of the war that culminated in the failed mutiny. After the mutiny, his fighters were offered three options: to follow him to Belarus, retire, or enlist in Russia’s regular army and return to Ukraine. Several thousand Wagner mercenaries opted to move to Belarus, where a camp was erected for them southeast of the capital, Minsk. Some are expected to be absorbed into Russia’s armed forces, but many will be angry over the sudden demise of the group’s founder who inspired a high degree of loyalty among his men. Putin paid amixed tributeto Prigozhin on Thursday, describing him as a “talented businessman” but also as a flawed character who “made serious mistakes in life”.   "
Ukraine war: Romania reveals Russian drone parts hit its territory,Romania claims parts of possible Russian drone fell on its territory,0.753376051922459,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Romania's defence minister has said that remains of a drone used in a Russian attack on a Ukrainian port have been found on Romanian territory.His comments follow two days of him and other senior officials ""categorically"" denying any cross-border incident.Ukraine had insisted it had evidence of the explosion.Romania's president says the attack, which the defence ministry is investigating, would be a serious violation of Romania's sovereignty.An attack on Romania, which is a member of Nato, would be ""completely inadmissible"", Klaus Iohannis said.On Monday, Ukraine's foreign ministry had reported that Shahed drones ""fell and detonated"" in Romania on Sunday night after the latest Russian attack on the Ukrainian port of Izmail. It called the incident further proof of the ""huge threat"" posed by Moscow to Ukraine's neighbours.  Now Romania's Defence Minister, Angel Tilvar, has visited the Danube Delta region close to the border with Ukraine and announced that several pieces of a drone had been found.An investigation is now under way and the fragments are being analysed to determine whether they come from a Russian weapon.Rebutting Kyiv's assertions became difficult after Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmitro Kuleba announced publicly that he had photographic evidence of the incident.He said it was ""absolutely obvious"" what had happened and that there was ""no point in denying it"".The incident has brought angry reaction from Romanian commentators who want to know why the government denied an attack so quickly and unequivocally and suspect an attempted cover-up.""It is because you still live with the mindset of 30 years ago, when nothing existed that the 'great ruler' did not want? Or was it just sheer stupidity?"" defence analyst Andrei Luca Popescu asked, referring to the era of Communist rule.He added that while it was sensible not to panic the population, it was also pointless to lie in the days of geolocation and the internet. ""We will not trigger Nato's Article 5 for this,"" he said, referring to the agreement that an armed attack on one member is an attack on all.""But we are facing a war on our border, where the danger of collateral damage is very real and likely.""Russia has been hitting Ukraine's port facilities along the River Danube for several weeks after pulling out of a deal to allow Ukraine to export its grain via the Black Sea.The port of Izmail, across the Danube from Romanian territory, was hit again in the early hours of Wednesday, leaving one person dead.Odesa regional military administration head Oleh Kiper said the man killed was an agricultural worker and that port and grain facilities were damaged.Romanian officials are not explaining their previous vehement denials of the drone incident, although the defence minister is taking the blame for ""misinforming"" the country's president. The minister insisted in an interview on Romanian TV that the remains which had been found presented no threat.He added that the authorities were on high alert and would take extra measures to secure the airspace. ""We will have more observation points, more patrols."" It is not entirely clear whether the drone was shot down, and fragments landed in Romania, or whether it crashed on the Romanian side of the border.The Romanian defence ministry previously said it had been monitoring the situation in Ukraine and on the border in real time.""At no point did the means of attack used by the Russian Federation generate direct military threats to the national territory or the territorial waters of Romania,"" the ministry said in an earlier statement.It is not the first incident to spark fears of the war in Ukraine escalating beyond its western border.In November last year, when two Polish farmers were killed near the village of Przewodow, initial reports - including from Kyiv - blamed a Russian missile.It was later determined that the men were killed by falling fragments of a missile fired by Ukraine's air defence systems, shooting down a Russian missile.Then in April this year, there was embarrassment for the Polish government when a Russian missile was discovered in a Polish forest after apparently lying undetected for several months.Officials hurriedly made clear that it appeared to be a decoy and contained no explosive, but they could never explain how it crossed the border undetected.","Parts of what could be a Russian drone fell on Romanian territory, Romania’s Defence Minister Angel Tilvar says, two days after Ukraine said Russian drones had detonated on the NATO member’s land. Romanian officials had earlier denied reports of drones falling on Romanian territory and said Russian attacks in neighbouring Ukraine did not cause a direct threat. Tilvar told local news channel Antena 3 CNN on Wednesday that parts of what was most likely a drone were discovered in the eastern Tulcea county, an area of the Danube that forms a natural border between Romania andwar-torn Ukraine. “I confirm that in this area, pieces that may be of a drone were found,” he said, adding that the pieces did not pose a threat. He said the area had not been evacuated because there was nothing to suggest that the parts were dangerous and said the pieces would be analysed to confirm their origin. Kyiv had said on Monday that drones detonated in Romania during an overnight Russian air raid on a Ukrainian port across the Danube River, where attacks had increased since July when Moscow abandoned a deal that lifted a de facto Russian blockade of Ukraine’s Black Sea ports. Speaking in Bucharest on Wednesday at the start of a summit of the presidents of Three Seas Initiative countries, Iohannis said the attacks were war crimes happening a “small distance” from Romania’s border. “If it is confirmed that the components [found] belong to a Russian drone, such a situation would be inadmissible and a serious violation of Romania’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” he said. “We are on alert and in constant contact with our NATO allies,” he added.  Tilvar reiterated there was no direct threat and told Agerpres it was possible the drone did not explode upon impact, but rather it simply crashed or pieces landed on Romanian territory. “[That] does not make us happy … but I don’t think that we can talk about an attack and, as I said before, I think we need to know how to distinguish between an act of aggression and an incident,” Agerpres quoted him as saying. A ministry spokesperson said search teams had been in the area for several days while the minister and other defence officials talked to residents. Moscow has conducted long-range air raids on targets in Ukraine since the start of the war last year, and Ukraine has reported suspected Russian weapons flying over or crashing into neighbours several times. In the most severe incident, two people were killed in Poland by a missile that fell near the border last November; Poland and NATO allies later said it was a misfired Ukrainian air defence missile."
Russian celebs at 'almost naked' party stung by backlash,‘Almost naked’ celebrity party triggers backlash in wartime Russia,0.7221571750115774,2023-12-27,2023-12-29,"This is Partygate: Russia-style.What happened at a Moscow nightclub was bizarre. What happened next says so much about the current atmosphere in Russia.  On 20 December, blogger and TV presenter Nastya Ivleeva threw an ""Almost Naked Party"" at Moscow's Mutabor nightclub. Dress code? More like an undress code. Scantily clad pop stars and celebrities attended the soiree. Including Russian rapper Vacio [real name Nikolai Vasiliev]. He turned up wearing only training shoes and one strategically placed sock.It was a private party. But it became very public when videos and photos appeared on social media. Overnight, Vacio's became the most famous sock in Russia. And not in a good way. There was uproar. Pro-Kremlin bloggers, MPs and activists, who support the war in Ukraine, were furious: how could celebrities be out partying like this while Russian soldiers were putting their lives on the line in the ""special military operation""? For the revellers, the party was well and truly over. Rapper Vacio was arrested and jailed for 15 days for ""disorderly conduct"". He was also fined 200,000 roubles (Â£1,700; $2,200) for ""promoting non-traditional sexual relations"". The organiser of the ""Almost Naked Party"", Nastya Ivleeva, is facing legal action. More than 20 people have signed a class-action lawsuit. They're demanding she pay a billion roubles (Â£8.5m) to the Defender of the Fatherland Foundation, an organisation that donates money to participants of the Kremlin's ""special operation"".  Other partygoers are facing the music, too.  There's talk of concert dates being cancelled and advertising contracts terminated. Reports, too, that some of the stars are being edited out of pre-recorded New Year's Eve entertainment shows on Russian TV. Big names - suddenly cancelled.  Cue the video messages.  One by one, the prominent party guests have been taking to social media - some to apologise for their attendance, others to insist they've done nothing wrong. ""I recognise I made a mistake,"" declared the now fully dressed megastar Philipp Kirkorov. ""The last thing I want is for such an event, my mistake, to result in restrictions on my career in Russia, the only country I exist in as an artist and as a citizen."" ""I wore a polo-neck, a big trench coat, trousers and shoes,"" said pop star Dima Bilan. ""I couldn't know in advance what the other guests would be wearing."" ""Ð¢hey say that Russia knows how to forgive. If so, I would like to ask you, the people, for a second chance,"" said Nastya Ivleeva in her video message.""If the answer is no, then I'm ready for my public execution. I won't shy away. I'm ready for any outcome."" Events of the last few days will have come as a shock to these celebrities. Following the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, they had taken the conscious decision to remain in Russia and continue their careers, and often lavish lifestyles, here. Public criticism was reserved for those anti-war celebs who had left Russia. Not any more. But why? It seems to me that Russia's political system, increasingly, relies on scapegoats. It needs groups or individuals it can point to and blame for problems at home and abroad.  Up till now, those scapegoats have included Ukraine, the US, the UK, the EU and Nato. Now, it seems, some Russian celebrities are on the list. In a social media post, this is how exiled Russian opposition activist Maxim Katz summed up events: ""In the past, there was a simple social contract with people who went to parties like this: do whatever you want as long as you stay loyal. ""But life is no party now. These ostentatious displays contrast with reality outside. You can't flippantly party in a country waging war. ""For the first time in a long time, the system has pushed back against those who supported all its rules, as long as they weren't applied to them.""","A rapper who partied at a Moscow nightclub wearing nothing but a strategically-placed sock has been jailed for 15 days, and several other Russian stars have issued public apologies after a celebrity party with the dress code “almost naked” triggered a storm of criticism and a slew of investigations. The crackdown came after pictures from the party, which took place on the night of December 20 and was organised by TV presenter and actress Anastasia Ivleeva, began circulating on social media. Amid the scantily-clad celebrities at the Mutabor nightclub was Vacio, the rapper, while Ivleeva was pictured flaunting an emerald-studded chain around her backside worth 23 million roubles ($251,000) at a time when some Russians are struggling to get by. Conservative legislators, bloggers and others were fiercely critical, contending the images were unseemly, even unpatriotic, for the country, which launched a full-scale invasion of neighbouring Ukraine in February 2022. The issue has dominated the headlines for days, pushing out stories about rising egg prices and other concerns. Maria Zakharova, a spokesperson for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that the event had “stained” those who took part, but that they now had a chance to work on themselves, the Ura.ru news outlet reported. Vacio, whose legal name is Nikolai Vasilyev, was jailed by a Moscow court for 15 days and fined 200,000 roubles ($2,182) under the LGBTQ “propaganda” law, which was toughened last year and bans positive information on lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender people. Ivleeva issued two public apology videos following the event, including one on Wednesday, where she said she regretted her actions and deserved everything she got but hoped she could be given “a second chance”. Her name has since disappeared as one of the public faces of major Russian mobile phone operator MTS, the tax authorities have opened an investigation that carries a potential five-year jail term, and a Moscow court has accepted a lawsuit from a group of more than 20 people demanding she pay out one billion roubles ($10.9m) for “moral suffering”. If successful, they want the money to go to a state fund that supports Russian veterans from the war in Ukraine. Russia’s flamboyant pop king Filipp Kirkorov also asked for forgiveness after footage circulated of him wearing a sparkling lace outfit with futuristic sunglasses. “In today’s difficult and heroic times, an artist of my calibre … cannot and should not be so irresponsible when participating in various events,” he said. Other partygoers have also recorded apologies, including journalist Ksenia Sobchak whose late father Anatoly was once a friend and boss of President Vladimir Putin. “To hold such events at a time when our guys are dying in the [Ukrainian] special military operation and many children are losing their fathers is cynical,” said Yekaterina Mizulina, director of Russia’s League for a Safe Internet, a body founded with the authorities’ support. Russia calls its invasion a “special military operation“. “Our soldiers on the front line are definitely not fighting for this.” The scandal comes when Putin, who is expected to comfortably win another six-year term in elections in March, has doubled down on social conservatism, repeatedly condemning Western countries for supposedly undermining “traditional values“. In November, Russia’s Supreme Court ruled that the “LGBT movement” should be designated as “extremists.” Standing outside the Bolshoi Theatre on Thursday, Nadezhda, one Moscow resident, told the Reuters news agency she was outraged and thought those who went to the party should be punished. “If you’re partying, at least don’t film it,” she said. “At such a difficult time [for Russia], they should at least be ashamed. Aren’t they ashamed before those who are fighting for us?”"
Russian embassy: Australia blocks new Canberra site over spying risk,Australia blocks new Russian embassy near parliament in Canberra,0.7216786949478228,2023-06-15,2023-06-15,"Australia has blocked Russia from building a new embassy near its parliament, citing a spying risk.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said intelligence agencies had given ""very clear security advice"" on the move.Laws specifically drafted to halt construction were rapidly passed on Thursday after legal attempts to block the Canberra development failed. The Kremlin said it was ""yet another unfriendly action"" which Russia would ""take into account"" in the future.Australia was following the ""Russophobic hysteria that is now going on in the countries of the collective West"", said spokesman Dmitry Peskov.A Russian diplomat earlier told AFP that the embassy was seeking legal advice.The new legislation acknowledges that Russia may be eligible for financial compensation.The current embassy will not be affected by the new laws, which have bipartisan support.Moscow currently holds the lease for a patch of land, acquired in 2008, some 400 metres (0.25 miles) from Canberra's Parliament House. It has been laying the foundations for a new embassy building, but construction has proceeded slowly.  As relations between Australia and Russia soured in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine, the former moved to rescind permission for the new building. A previous attempt to cancel the lease was thrown out by the federal court last month, prompting the new legislation. The laws took less than five minutes to be introduced, and passed through the House of Representatives.""We don't expect Russia is in a position to talk about international law, given their rejection of it so consistently and so brazenly with their invasion of Ukraine,"" said Mr Albanese, who condemned Russia's ""illegal and immoral"" invasion of Ukraine.Former UK diplomat Alex Bristow of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, told AFP that Russia has some of the ""largest, most capable, most aggressive, and least constrained intelligence services"" in the world.""Given the proximity, it could be a form of electronic surveillance operating out of the embassy,"" he added.","Australia’s parliament will pass legislation to stop Russia from building a new embassy in Canberra because of concerns about national security. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the legislation would cancel Russia’s lease on the site in the capital, based on the advice of security agencies. “The government has received very clear security advice as to the risk presented by a new Russian presence so close to Parliament House,” Albanese told reporters. “We are acting quickly to ensure the lease site does not become a formal diplomatic presence.” The move follows long-running litigation over the site after Australia’s federal court ruled last month that an eviction order made by the National Capital Authority (NCA) – a government body tasked with the planning of the city – was invalid. “To be clear, today’s decision is one taken in the national security interests of Australia, and I thank the coalition [opposition] and crossbenchers in the House and the Senate for their cooperation in this matter,” Albanese said. The Kremlin called the Australian move a hostile one which reflected what it said was the authorities’ anti-Russian sentiment. “Australia to our regret is continuing to zealously move forward as one of the authors of anti-Russian hysteria which is rippling across the collective West,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. “This is another hostile move from the Australian side which we will take into account, and if issues arise which require reciprocity from us, we will also behave accordingly.” Russia bought the lease in Canberra’s diplomatic quarter in 2008 and had plans for construction approved in 2011. Under the terms of the agreement, work was supposed to be completed within three years, but the embassy remains only partially built. The NCA then decided to terminate the Russian lease, citing that “ongoing unfinished works detract from the overall aesthetic, importance and dignity of the area reserved for diplomatic missions”. The termination of the lease has no impact on Russia’s existing embassy, which is in the former Soviet Union embassy in the suburb of Griffith, further away from Parliament House. Home Affairs Minister Clare O’Neil said the “principal problem” with the proposed second Russian embassy was its location because the site sits directly adjacent to parliament. No embassy would be allowed to be built there, she said. Albanese said his government anticipated a response from Russia over the decision and that they “will await what response occurs”. “We don’t expect that Russia is in a position to talk about international law, given their rejection of it so consistently and so brazenly with their invasion of Ukraine,” he said. Russia’s embassy has previously declared that it was committed to completing the construction, despite Australia’s objections. Australia is one of the largest non-NATO supporters of Ukraine and has been supplying aid, ammunition and defence equipment to the country since thefull-scale Russian invasion in February 2022. It has alsobannedexports of alumina and aluminium ores, including bauxite, to Russia, and sanctioned more than 1,000 Russian individuals and entities. Australia’s opposition defence spokesman Andrew Hastie said his party stood with the government on national security. “Russia has not acted in good faith towards its neighbours in recent times. It continues its campaign [in Ukraine] trashing the principles of territorial and political sovereignty,” Hastie said. “There is a trust deficit. There is a real risk to our national interest here, and the security advice is that this lease must be terminated.”"
Ukraine dam: Thousands flee floods after dam collapse near Nova Kakhovka,Hundreds flee floods in Ukraine after Nova Kakhovka dam breached,0.7171722449481079,2023-06-07,2023-06-06,"Thousands of people are being evacuated downstream of a major dam which has collapsed in Russian-held Ukraine.President Volodymyr Zelensky said 80 towns and villages may be flooded after the destruction of the dam at Nova Kakhovka, which he blamed on Russia.Water is surging down the Dnipro river, and is said to pose a catastrophic flooding risk to the city of Kherson. Russia has denied destroying the dam - which it controls - instead blaming Ukrainian shelling.Neither Ukraine nor Russia's claim has been verified by the BBC.The Kakhovka dam, downstream from the huge Kakhovka reservoir, is crucial to the region.It provides water to farmers and residents, as well as to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. It is also a vital channel carrying water south to Russian-occupied Crimea.Ukraine's state-owned hydropower plants administrator Ukrhydroenergo warned that the peak of a water spill downstream from the emptying reservoir was expected on Wednesday morning.It said this would be followed by a period of ""stabilisation"", with the water expected to rapidly recede in four to five days.There are concerns about the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant - Europe's largest - which uses reservoir water for cooling. The situation there is said to be under control and there is ""no immediate nuclear safety risk"" for the plant, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).Video footage shows a torrent of floodwater gushing through a breach in the dam. Several towns are already flooded, while people in areas further downstream have been forced to flee by bus and train.Abound 40,000 people need to be evacuated, Deputy Prosecutor-General Viktoriya Lytvynova said on Ukrainian television - 17,000 people in Ukraine-controlled territory west of the Dnipro River and 25,000 on the Russian-controlled east.Also speaking on Ukrainian television, Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said about 1,000 people had been evacuated so far and 24 settlements had been flooded.He accused Russia of shelling the southern region of Kherson, from where people were being evacuated, and issued a warning about the dangers posed by mines being exposed by the rising water levels.One local resident Andriy, who lives close to the dam - which was seized by Russian forces shortly after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022 - said he believed Russia wanted to ""drown"" his city.In the Ukraine-controlled city of Kherson, a woman called Lyudmyla - who was loading her belongings including a washing machine onto a trailer that was attached to an old car - said: ""We're afraid of flooding. We're taking our things a little higher up.""She called for Russian forces to be ""kicked out of here... they're shooting at us. They're flooding us or doing something else"".Another resident of the city, Serhiy, said he feared ""everything is going to die here"". ""All the living creatures, and people will be flooded out,"" he said, gesturing at nearby houses and gardens.On the Russian-seized riverbank of Nova Kakhovka, the Moscow-installed mayor Vladimir Leontyev said the city was underwater and 900 people had been evacuated.He said 53 evacuation buses were being sent by the authorities to take people from the city and two other settlements nearby to safety.Water levels had risen to over 11m (36ft) and some residents had been taken to hospital, he added.The small town of Oleshky was also heavily flooded, Kremlin-appointed officials said. The Kazkova Dibrova zoo on the Russian-held riverbank had been completely flooded and all 300 animals were dead, it said in a post on its Facebook page.It is not yet clear what caused the breach in the dam in the early hours of Tuesday, but Ukraine's military intelligence has accused Russia of deliberately blowing it up.This seems plausible, as Moscow may have feared that Ukrainian forces would use the road over the dam to advance into Russian-held territory, as part of their counter-offensive.For Russia, anxious to defend conquered territory in southern Ukraine, the dam represented an obvious problem. Just as Ukrainian forces attacked road and rail bridges further downstream last autumn in a successful effort to isolate Russian forces in and around Kherson, Russia may have decided to destroy the dam to hold up Ukraine's counter-offensive, which it fears could come from multiple directions.However, a Russian official claims Ukraine carried out the attack on the dam to detract from what they said were the failures of its counter-offensive and to deprive Crimea - Ukraine's southern peninsula illegally annexed by Russian in 2014 - of fresh water.A major Ukrainian push has long been expected. Kyiv has said it would not give advance warning of its start but a recent increase in military activity is being seen as a fresh sign that the counter-offensive may have begun.On Tuesday evening, President Zelensky said the dam destruction would not stop Ukraine. ""We will still liberate all our land,"" he said in a video address.Earlier in the day, Mr Zelensky held an urgent meeting of the country's security and defence council to discuss the issue.On Monday, Ukraine's deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said Ukrainian forces had advanced around the ""epicentre of hostilities"" in Bakhmut, but did not say whether the counter-offensive had begun.Bakhmut has for months been at the heart of fierce fighting. It has little strategic value - but is important symbolically both for Kyiv and Moscow.Yuri Sak, an adviser to Ukraine's ministry of defence, told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme that phone intercepts suggest Russia wants to target more dams.""They're actually calling to blow up more dams on the Dnipro river,"" he said.Ukraine has branded the attack on the dam ""ecocide"" and said that 150 tonnes of engine oil has spilled into the Dnipro river.Ukrhydroenergo said a power station linked to the dam had been ""completely destroyed... the hydraulic structure is being washed away"".World leaders have laid the blame for the blast at Russia's door, with some calling it a war crime. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said that if Russia was found to be responsible for the collapse of the dam it would ""demonstrate the new lows that we will have seen from Russian aggression"".The head of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg, said the destruction of the dam demonstrated once again the brutality of Russia's war in Ukraine, while Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, said he was ""shocked by the unprecedented attack"".The Geneva Conventions explicitly ban targeting dams in war due to the danger it poses to civilians.","Hundreds of people have been evacuated from settlements along the southern stretch of Ukraine’s Dnipro River afterwater burstthrough the breached Nova Kakhovka dam, submerging streets and town squares. The collapse of the structure at the southern tip of the vast Kakhovka Reservoir on Tuesday unleashed a torrent of water, adding to the misery of thousands of people who have been caught on the front lines of Russia’s war in Ukraine. Kyiv accused Russian forces of blowing up the dam and hydroelectric power station in an area of southern Ukraine that Moscow has controlled for more than a year while Russian officials blamed Ukrainian bombardment. It was not possible to verify the claims. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the dam breach is the “biggest man-made environmental disaster in Europe in decades”. “It is physically impossible to blow it up somehow from the outside with shelling,” he said in a video address to a summit of European countries in the Bucharest Nine group. “It was mined. It was mined by the Russian occupiers and blown up by them.” Footage posted on social media shows severe flooding in the Russian-controlled town of Nova Kakhovka, which is next to the dam. Its Russian-installed mayor, Vladimir Leontyev, said water levels had risen to more than 11 metres (36 feet) and some residents had been taken to hospital, Russia’s TASS news agency reported. He said 900 people had been evacuated. Leontyev added that 53 evacuation buses were being sent to take people from Nova Kakhovka and two nearby settlements to safety. “We are organising temporary accommodation centres with hot meals,” he said. Journalist Yulia Shapovalova said from Moscow that the machine room of the Kakhovka power station was “under water”. “We’re getting pictures of entire houses floating down the Dnipro River,” she said. According to Shapovalova, Russian authorities said the partial destruction of the dam has led to flooding and the “washing-away of entire agricultural fields” along the river.  The Russian-installed administration in the partially occupied Kherson region said it was preparing to evacuate three districts – Nova Kakhovka, Golo Pristan and Oleshky. The latter two lie across the mouth of the Dnipro River from the Ukrainian-held regional capital, also called Kherson. Water levels there had already risen by more than a metre (3.3 feet), residents said, and were expected to rise further. “The water flow in the Dnipro River and its tributaries is very powerful,” Kherson resident Oleksandr Syomyk said as he stood beside the swollen river. “The water level rose by one metre. We’ll see what happens next, but we hope for the best.” Ukrainian police released a video showing an officer carrying an elderly woman to safety and residents wading through knee-deep water in the Kherson region. Ukraine’s prosecutor general said thousands of people were being evacuated from flooded areas. “Over 40,000 people are in danger of being flooded. Ukrainian authorities are evacuating over 17,000 people,” Andriy Kostin said on social media, adding that 25,000 more people should be evacuated on the Russian-occupied side of the Dnipro River. Oleksandr Tolokonnikov, a senior official in Ukraine’s Kherson military administration, warned that worse was to come. “Tomorrow there will be a peak [of flooding]. Then there will be a decline,” he told an online media briefing earlier on Tuesday. “We already evacuated about 1,000 people. We have about 50 buses shuttling between Kherson and the affected villages. In Kherson, we have four evacuation sites prepared.” Ukraine’s interior ministry said 24 villages have flooded. “I was evacuated from the flooded village of Antonivka. Our local school and stadium downtown were flooded. … The road was completely flooded. Our bus got stuck,” Lidia Zubova, 67, told the Reuters news agency as she waited for a train to leave Kherson. The World Data Center for Geoinformatics and Sustainable Development, a Ukrainian nongovernmental organisation, estimated that nearly 100 villages and towns would be flooded and the water level would start dropping only after five to seven days. Both sides warned of a looming environmental disaster. Ukraine’s Presidential Office said about 150 tonnes of oil escaped from the dam machinery and that another 300 tonnes could still leak out. “The human and environmental cost of the destruction of the Kakhovka dam is a huge humanitarian disaster,” said Marie Struthers, Amnesty’s Eastern Europe and Central Asia director. “The destruction of the Kakhovka dam is a catastrophe that endangers the life, safety and well-being of tens if not hundreds of thousands of people living within range of the flood waters,” she said. “There must be a prompt, independent and impartial investigation into the destruction of the Kakhova dam.” The dam supplies water to farmland in southern Ukraine and the Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula. It also cools the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. The UN nuclear watchdog said Europe’s largest nuclear power plant should have enough water to cool its reactors for “some months” from a separate pond even as the reservoir drains out. It called for the pond to be spared. Damage to the dam creates a new humanitarian disaster just as Ukraine is unleashing a long-awaited counteroffensive to drive Russian troops from its territory. The Geneva Water Hub, a water research and policy institute, said it was “deeply concerned”. “The devastating consequences for civilians are likely to reverberate long after the flooding has stopped,” it said in a statement."
Ukraine war: Russia strikes Ukraine grain after ending sea deal,"After ending deal, Russia warns against Black Sea grain shipments",0.7170721485038959,2023-07-19,2023-07-18,"Russian missile attacks on Ukraine's Black Sea coast have destroyed 60,000 tonnes of grain and damaged storage infrastructure, officials say.Agriculture Minister Mykola Solskyi said a ""considerable amount"" of export infrastructure was out of operation.Russia has pulled out of a deal guaranteeing safe passage for exports across the Black Sea.Later on Wednesday Russia's President Putin accused the West of using the grain deal as ""political blackmail"".He added he would consider rejoining the international agreement, in place since last summer, only ""if all principles under which Russia agreed to participate in the deal are fully taken into account and fulfilled"". His comments came shortly after Russia's defence ministry declared that from midnight on Wednesday night (21:00 GMT), any ships heading to Ukrainian ports would be viewed as potential carriers of military cargo and party to the conflict. Some north-western and south-eastern areas of the Black Sea would be temporarily dangerous for shipping, it added.Russia began targeting Ukraine's ports in the early hours of Tuesday within hours of its withdrawal from the grain deal.More strikes followed overnight into Wednesday, targeting grain terminals and port infrastructure in Odesa and further down the Black Sea coast in Chornomorsk, two of the three ports that were included in the export deal. At least 12 civilians, including a nine-year-old boy, were wounded during the attacks, which also caused damage to blocks of flats, military officials said.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said each missile strike was a blow not just to Ukraine, but to ""everyone in the world striving for a normal and safe life"". France and Germany also condemned the attack. Germany Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said that by covering Odesa with a hail of bombs, Russian President Vladimir Putin was robbing the world of any hope of Ukrainian grain and ""hitting the world's poorest"".The infrastructure ministry published a series of photos showing damage to silos and other grain facilities. Officials said there had been damage to wharves and reservoirs, but it was international and Ukrainian traders that had suffered the most.Russian war commentators said the damage proved that Kyiv was unable to shoot down the majority of Russian missiles and drones.Officials said the co-ordinated attack involved Kalibr cruise missiles, Onyx supersonic and Kh-22 anti-ship missiles as well as kamikaze drones, fired from the Black Sea, Crimea and southern Russia. Although 37 Russian missiles and drones were shot down, a number did penetrate Ukrainian defences, they said.Russia had called its initial attack on Odesa a ""mass revenge strike"" for an attack on the Russian-built bridge over the Kerch strait linking occupied Crimea to Russia. Seaborne drones were blamed for Monday's bridge strike that knocked out a section of bridge and killed a Russian couple.Crimea saw further disruption on Wednesday. Some 2,200 residents were evacuated from four villages near a military training range after a fire triggered hours of explosions at a nearby ammunition depot.Russian-installed officials also shut a 12-km (7.5-mile) section of the Tavrida motorway that links the cities of Simferopol and Sevastopol in southern Crimea to the bridge over the Kerch strait. Construction of the road by Russia's occupation authorities began in 2017.A series of explosions were heard in the area from about 04:30 (01:30 GMT) on Wednesday. Officials did not explain the cause of the fire near the city of Staryi Krim. But unconfirmed reports on social media spoke of three Ukrainian strikes.Russia's appointee boss in Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, said the cause of the fire at the military range was being investigated, but that no-one was hurt.","A day afterpulling outof the wartime grain deal and renewing global fears over food security, the Kremlin has warned that shipping grain out of Ukrainian Black Sea ports could be risky in the absence of Russian security guarantees, claiming Ukraine uses the waters for military activities. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov issued the warning on Tuesday, amid suggestions that Turkey could step in to protect Ukrainian grain shipments. TheBlack Sea grain dealbrokered by the United Nations and Turkey was signed by Russia and Ukraine last July to ensure that Ukrainian ships could transport grain from its Black Sea ports of Yuzhny, Odesa and Chornomorsk to the Bosporus, without being attacked. With it came a separate agreement to facilitate shipments of Russian food and fertiliser, but Moscow has long complained that parts of the deal relating to these exports have not been implemented. As Russia withdrew on Monday, officials said their repetitive demands to boost Russian grain and fertiliser exports through the pact had not been met. In a statement on Telegram, Russia’s foreign ministry said Moscow’s termination of the deal also means the “withdrawal of navigation safety guarantees, curtailment of the maritime humanitarian corridor, and restoration of the regime of a temporarily dangerous area in the northwestern Black Sea”. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a statement, “Even without the Russian Federation, everything must be done so that we can use this Black Sea corridor.” “We are not afraid. We were approached by companies that own ships. They said that they are ready, if Ukraine and Turkey are ready to continue, then everyone is ready to continue supplying grain,” Zelenskyy added. The Ukrainian leader has been in talks with the UN chief Antonio Guterres to discuss restoring grain supply through the Black Sea routes. World leaders have condemned Moscow for backing out of the deal, saying the move threatens global food security and will lead to a hike in prices. “Hundreds of millions of people face hunger and consumers are confronting a global cost-of-living crisis,” Guterres said in a statement. But Peskov rejected such criticisms and highlighted that Moscow would supply grain to poor countries in need.   "
Ukraine war: Kyiv accuses Russia of shelling Kherson evacuations,Ukraine accuses Russia of shelling rescuers amid dam evacuations,0.7116876413604614,2023-06-08,2023-06-08,"Ukraine has accused Russia of attacking evacuation points for those affected by the Kakhovka dam breach, after a person was killed by shelling in Kherson.The Kherson prosecutor's office said two others were also injured, while the interior ministry said eight more were hurt by shelling in Korabelna Square.The attacks came as President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the city, where he met with locals affected by the flooding.2,000 people have been evacuated from the area, Kherson's governor says.Speaking in a video statement posted to Telegram, Oleksandr Prokudin said the ""evacuation from zones of flooding is continuing"" despite the ""immense danger and constant Russian shelling"". But he said that 68% of the flooded territory in the Kherson region was on Russian-held territory on the east bank of the Dnipro River. The river has slowly swelled since the Kakhovka dam collapsed on Tuesday, causing thousands to flee their homes. The World Food Programme told the BBC on Thursday that the situation was a ""public health crisis in the making"" due to pollution including sewage, heavy oil and pesticides mixed into floodwater.Ukraine says the flooding has affected an area of around 600 km sq (230 sq miles), and hundreds of thousands of people have been left without drinking water. The Ukrainian army has used drones to drop water bottles and food to some residents. While the water level seems to have stabilised in Kherson itself, it still flows through streets at a daunting height, and flies now fill the air along with a pungent smell.Rescue teams and volunteers are continuing to head out on boats to salvage anyone, or anything they can. Their efforts are punctuated by outgoing artillery fire.Both Kyiv and Moscow have accused each other of targeting evacuation points in the Kherson region. Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior adviser to President Zelensky, accused Russia of bombarding the city and of ""preventing rescuers from evacuating the population"". The Kremlin-installed head of the Kherson region, Vladimir Saldo, said on Telegram that two people died after Ukraine shelled a civilian evacuation point which was flooded after the dam breach.And Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov claimed that Russian rescue workers are ""forced to work in conditions of ongoing shelling from Ukraine, and this complicates their work"". He did not provide evidence to back up these claims.Speaking in Kherson, where he met with rescue workers, President Volodymyr Zelensky repeated his criticism of the international community, including the UN and the Red Cross, for their slow response to the dam collapse. And he vowed to local residents that his government would be available to help them rebuild their lives. ""You are going through this difficult ordeal now,"" Mr Zelensky said. ""We will help you and rebuild everything that needs to be restored. I thank you and wish you good health.""The Kremlin said there were no plans for President Vladimir Putin to visit the affected zones. Communities on small islands close to Russian occupied territory are said to be experiencing the worst of these floods. Whole homes there have been submerged.And a local Russian-installed official said five people have died and 41 have been hospitalised by flooding in the region.Elsewhere, fighting has continued in some areas, as analysts watch to see how Ukraine's long-anticipated advance takes shape. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Thursday that his forces had withstood fierce attempts by Ukrainian troops to break through the frontline in Zaporizhzhia province overnight. And footage posted to social media by pro-war Russian bloggers and geolocated by the BBC appeared to show units of Ukrainian armour coming under artillery fire as they advanced towards Russian held areas in Zaporizhzhia region. The column appeared to be advancing towards fortifications at Tokmak, around 5-10km back from the limit of Russian control. The BBC cannot verify when the advance occurred. In the east, Ukraine's Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said Kyiv's forces were continuing to advance around the city of Bakhmut. In a daily intelligence update, the UK's ministry of defence said ""heavy fighting continues along multiple sectors of the front,"" noting that Ukraine ""holds the initiative"" in most areas. On Wednesday Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine's national security council, denied reports of the new offensive and said that when Kyiv does launch an offensive ""everyone will know about it"".Senior US officials have previously told the BBC's US partner CBS News that it is accurate to say that the Ukraine counteroffensive is in its opening phases, but that the main thrust has not yet begun.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyyhas accused Russian forces of shelling Ukrainian emergency workers who are trying to rescue people from floodwaters caused by thedestruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam. Speaking in his nightly address on Wednesday, Zelenskyy said that more than 2,000 people have been rescued so far from flooding in the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions which, he said, contrasted starkly with Russian-occupied regions where he accused Moscow’s forces of simply abandoning people to the flood. “Evacuation continues. Under fire!” Zelenskyy said. “Russian artillery continues to fire, no matter what. Savages,” he said. “Our military and special services are rescuing people as much as it is possible, despite the shelling.” Zelenskky describedconditions in Russian-occupied parts of the Kherson regionas “absolutely catastrophic” and called on international humanitarian organisations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, to immediately deploy to and help people abandoned in occupied areas now hit by flooding from the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam on Tuesday. “The occupiers simply abandoned people in these terrible conditions. Without rescue, without water, just on the rooftops in flooded communities,” Ukraine’s president said. “It is even impossible to establish for sure how many people in the temporarily occupied territory of Kherson region may die without rescue, without drinking water, without food, without medical care,” he added.    Reporters said on Wednesday that artillery booms could be heard as people scrambled to leave affected areas with the help of rescue workers. Earlier on Wednesday, Zelenskky said he was disappointed that the UN and the Red Cross had so far failed to respond rapidly to the dam disaster, according to comments published by media outlets. “Each person who dies there is a verdict on the existing international architecture and international organisations that have forgotten how to save lives,” he said later in his evening address. “If there is no international organisation in the area of this disaster now, it means that it does not exist at all, that it is incapable of functioning. All the relevant appeals from Ukraine and our government are in place,” he said. The situation in the occupied part of Kherson region is absolutely catastrophic. The occupiers simply abandoned people in these terrible conditions. Without rescue, without water, just on the rooftops in flooded communities. And this is another deliberate crime of Russia: after…pic.twitter.com/SPGzXyoCen — Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa)June 7, 2023  Commenting for the first time on the blowing up of the dam on Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin repeated Moscow’s line that Ukraine was to blame. In a call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Putin alleged that Kyiv authorities, encouraged by Western supporters, had destroyed the dam and were escalating “war crimes, openly using terrorist methods and staging acts of sabotage on Russian territory”, the Kremlin said in its account of the call. Erdogan has proposed a commission of inquiry into the dam’s destruction, the presidential office in Ankara said, following separate telephone conversations with Putin and Zelenskyy on Wednesday. It remains unclear how the dam disaster would affect the war and Ukraine’s planned counteroffensive against Russian forces, but Kyiv said on Wednesday that its troops had advanced more than 1km (just over half a mile) around the ruined city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine. Reports of the advance were the most explicit claim of battlefield progress by Ukraine since Russia said that the Ukrainian counteroffensive had begun – unannounced – earlier this week.    Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s national security council, said assaults under way were still localised, and the full-scale offensive has yet to begin, adding that the public would know when the counteroffensive starts. “Our troops have switched from defence to the offensive in the direction of Bakhmut,” Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said on Telegram. Russia’s defence ministry confirmed eight Ukrainian attempts to attack near Bakhmut but said that all had been repelled. Addressing the issue of the dam’s destruction as Kyiv and Moscow trade blame, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington, DC-based think tank, said Russia has “a greater and clearer interest in flooding the lower [Dnipro] despite the damage to their own prepared defensive positions”. Believing that Ukraine had already begun its counteroffensive, the ISW said, Russian forces may have thought breaching the dam could cover their possible retreat and delay Ukraine’s advance. However, the flooding is now heavily disrupting Russia’s prepared defensive positions along the occupied bank of the Dnipro river, the ISW said on Thursday. Near-infrared imagery captured at 0400 am ET on June 7 indicates that flooding is heavily disrupting prepared Russian defensive positions on the east bank of the#DniproRiver – especially affecting Russian first-line positions in Hola Prystan & Oleshky.https://t.co/W6mPtd0HgQhttps://t.co/ai9DXhGgrCpic.twitter.com/7A4tXHzqdb — ISW (@TheStudyofWar)June 8, 2023  “The flooding has destroyed many Russian first-line field fortifications that the Russian military intended to use to defend against Ukrainian attacks,” the ISW added. Authorities are now warning of the impact on global hunger and the environment due to the dam’s destruction with the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) warning that the flooding could destroy crops and lead to greater hunger worldwide. Ukraine’s agriculture ministry said that it expects about 10,000 hectares (38.6 square miles) of agricultural land on the northern bank of the Dnipro river in the Kherson region to be flooded, according to initial estimates. On the southern bank, in the Russian-occupied region, this area will be flooded many times, the ministry said on its website. Environmental organisation Greenpeace also warned of enormous damage to the country’s water supply and food security. “Due to the scale of the disaster […] there will be inevitable impacts on the water supply for millions of people and agriculture during the coming summer months and beyond,” Greenpeace said.

Poland says Russian missile entered airspace then went into Ukraine,Poland says Russian missile briefly entered its airspace,0.710636900227928,2023-12-29,2023-12-29,"Poland's armed forces chief believes a Russian missile entered Poland for almost three minutes and then turned back into Ukrainian airspace.Gen Wieslaw Kukula said the missile travelled about 40km (25 miles) into Polish airspace early on Friday.The alert coincided with what Ukraine has called Russia's biggest day of air strikes since its war began.Poland's UN representative said Warsaw believes the incident was linked to the massive bombardment. ""We clearly see it as an element of the situation created by the latest wave of Russian attacks,"" Krzysztof Szczerski told the UN Security Council. President Andrzej Duda convened an emergency security meeting after the object was picked up on radar.About 200 police officers have been conducting a search of the area where the object was detected in case the missile landed on Polish territory.Poland is a member of the Nato alliance, and Polish and Allied aircraft were scrambled in response to the incident at around 07:00 (06:00 GMT) on Friday. There have been no reports of an explosion. Operational Command spokesman Lt Col Jacek Goryszewski said an unidentified object had entered Poland from Ukraine near the town of Zamosc, in the Lublin region of south-eastern Poland, not far from the border.At least 30 people were killed in the attacks which targeted Lviv, the closest Ukrainian city to Lublin region, as well as Dnipro, Kyiv and other cities. The Polish military was tracking the Russian missile strikes during the night. Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance stood in solidarity with Poland and ""remains vigilant"".An unconfirmed report said a search was taking place near the town of Hrubieszow.The Polish government has not ruled out Russian provocation. ""We need to check whether this wasn't a provocation or a test of our reaction. We should check both scenarios carefully,"" Deputy Defence Minister Stanislaw Wziatek told TVN24.Polish military expert Cmdr Maksymilian Dura told TVN24 it was premature to conclude it was a Russian missile because it had not been found, and just because contact had been lost it could not be certain that it had left Polish airspace.Krzysztof Komorski, the president of the Lublin Voivodship [equivalent to a province or region] wrote on social media: ""Please be calm and patient, the services are working.""Since Russia's invasion and war against Ukraine three missiles have entered Poland.In November 2022, two Polish farmers were killed by a missile that landed in the village of Przewodow near the Ukrainian border. It was believed to have been fired by Ukrainian air defence forces to repel a Russian missile attack.In a harmless but more embarrassing incident from December last year, an object believed to have been an unarmed Russian Kh-55 cruise missile was fired from Belarus and crossed around 500km of Polish territory before landing in a forest.The object, which was detected by Polish air defences at the time, was only found in April this year by a passer-by not far from the city of Bydgoszcz in central Poland.Another unidentified object that entered Polish airspace this year from the direction of Belarus was probably an observation balloon. Radar contact with it was lost near Rypin in central Poland.Both sides of Poland's political arena have seized on the latest event to score points.Poland's new defence minister, Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz, stressed in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the security forces ""acted immediately"" to the latest incident, reassuring Poles, ""the state is acting!"".His predecessor, Mariusz Blaszczak, from the right-wing Law and Justice-led government that lost power in an election in October and served as defence minister during the two earlier events, responded: ""We don't know what fell in the area of Tomaszow Lubelski. We don't know if anyone was hurt. We don't know why the anti-aircraft defence systems didn't work. Is the state acting?""","Polish military authorities have said that a Russian missile briefly passed through the country’s airspace before leaving, prompting concern from the country thatborders Ukraineon the day Russia carried out attacks across several Ukrainian citieskilling at least 30 people. Poland, a member of the NATO military alliance, says that the object entered from the direction of Ukraine on Friday morning, entering about 40 kilometers (24 miles) before leaving after about three minutes. “Everything indicates that a Russian missile intruded in Poland’s airspace,” said Poland’s defence chief, General Wieslaw Kukula. “It was monitored by us on radars and left the airspace. We have confirmation of this on radars and from [NATO] allies.” The incident comes at a time of high tensions between Russia and European nations located near Ukraine, whichRussia invadedin February 2022. Spoke with President@AndrzejDudaabout the missile incident in#Poland.#NATOstands in solidarity with our valued Ally, is monitoring the situation & we will remain in contact as the facts are established. NATO remains vigilant. — Jens Stoltenberg (@jensstoltenberg)December 29, 2023  Polish officials say they are working to further verify their findings and rule out the possibility of a technical malfunction. The Russian news agency RIA quoted Russia’s charge d’affaires in the country, who was summoned by the Polish government, as stating that Poland had provided no proof of a border violation. In a social media post on Friday, NATO Secretary GeneralJens Stoltenbergsaid that the security alliance is monitoring the situation and communicating with Polish officials. “I spoke with President Andrzej Duda about the missile incident in Poland. NATO stands in solidarity with our valued ally, is monitoring the situation and we will remain in contact as the facts are established. NATO remains vigilant,” Stoltenberg said. Operational commander of the Polish army Maciej Klisz said that the country’s air defence network had been on high alert due to recent Russianmissile and drone attacksin Ukraine and that fighter jets were sent to intercept the missile before it left Polish territory. The military also said that a ground search was being carried out in the area where the missile disappeared off the radar. The White House on Friday said that US President Joe Biden was closely following the development in Poland. White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan “expressed the United States’ solidarity with Poland, our close NATO ally” and pledged technical assistance as needed in a call with Polish Secretary of State Jacek Siewiera, according to a statement from the White House.    The incident is not the first time that the war in Ukraine has threatened tospill overinto Polish territory. In November 2022, an errant Ukrainian airdefence missilekilled two civilians when it landed in the border village of Przewodow. Poland’s newly elected Prime MinisterDonald Tusk, who won the election with a bloc of pro-EU and pro-Ukraine parties that overthrew the country’s far-right government after eight years in power, has promised full support for Ukraine in its war against Russia. That war has ground on for nearly two years, with little end in sight as Ukraine fights to expel Russian forces that have established strong defences along the captured territory. While Ukraine still has substantial support from many Western governments, schisms havestarted to emergeover the provision of furthermilitary assistance, including in the US, which has provided more support than any other country. On Friday, the British defence ministry said that it would send 200 air defence missiles to Ukraine, which is currently under heavy bombardment from Russian forces. Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyysaid on Friday that he visited Avdiivka, an eastern town near the front line that has seen heavy fighting. “This is one of the most difficult areas of the front line,” he wrote on Telegram along with a video of him in front of a sign with the name of the town, giving medals to soldiers. “I thank all those who are at the first line [of fire] for their service, for this year during which the entire country survived thanks to its soldiers,” he said."
Ukraine war: US to give Kyiv long-range ATACMS missiles - media reports,"Ukraine to receive US long-range ATACMS missiles, US media report",0.7024911471577759,2023-09-23,2023-09-23,"US President Joe Biden plans to give Ukraine advanced long-range missiles to help Kyiv with its ongoing counter-offensive, US media report.They quote US officials familiar with the issue as saying Ukraine will get some ATACMS missiles with a range of up to 190 miles (300km).This would enable Kyiv to hit Russian targets deep behind the front line.At least two Ukrainian missiles hit the headquarters of Russia's Black Sea fleet in annexed Crimea on Friday.A Ukrainian military source told the BBC that the attack in the port of Sevastopol used Storm Shadow missiles, which are supplied by Britain and France.Such missiles have a range of just over 150 miles.NBC News and the Wall Street Journal quote unnamed US officials as saying Mr Biden told his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky that Kyiv would get ""a small number"" of ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile System) missiles. The two leaders met at the White House on Thursday.The WSJ adds that the weapons will be sent in the coming weeks.Meanwhile, the Washington Post cited several people familiar with the discussions as saying Ukraine would get ATACMS armed with cluster bomblets rather than single warheads.Neither the US nor Ukraine have officially confirmed the reports.After the Biden-Zelensky talks Washington announced a new tranche of $325m (Â£265m) in military aid - including artillery and ammunition - for Ukraine. America's Abrams tanks will be delivered to Kyiv next week.However, both presidents have been evasive on the ATACMS issue.""I believe that most of what we were discussing with President Biden yesterdayâ€¦ we will be able to reach an agreement,"" Mr Zelensky said on Friday during a visit to Canada.""Yes, [this is] a matter of time. Not everything depends on Ukraine,"" he added. Kyiv has for months been pushing for ATACMS to boost its tough and bloody counter-offensive in the south.It says key Russian supply lines, command positions and other logistical hubs deep behind the front line would then be within striking distance, forcing Moscow to move them further away and thus making it harder to resupply troops and weaponry.Russian positions in the occupied Ukrainian regions in the south - including Crimea - would be particularly vulnerable, Ukraine says. President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and the Biden administration was initially hesitant to provide Ukraine with modern weaponry. But its stance has since shifted dramatically, with Kyiv getting high-precision Himars long-range rocket systems and Patriot air defence missiles.President Biden has been hesitant on ATACMS amid fears that such missiles could bring a direct clash with nuclear-armed Russia closer.","United States President Joe Biden has informed his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, that Washington will provide Kyiv withATACMS long-range missiles, US broadcaster NBC News has reported. Ukraine has repeatedly asked the Biden administration for the long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) to help hit supply lines, airbases and rail networks deep behind Russia’s front lines in occupied regions of Ukraine. But the White House has not announced a decision to provide Ukraine with the ATACMS system and the missiles were not publicly discussed when Zelenskyy visited Washington, DC on Thursday for talks with Biden, even as the US announced a new $325m military aid package for Kyiv. The White House and the Pentagon declined to comment on the NBC report on Friday. The Pentagon also declined to say whether any promise of ATACMS was given to Zelenskyy during his meetings on Thursday at the Department of Defense, saying: “In regards to ATACMS, we have nothing to announce.” A date for delivery of the ATACMS was not revealed, according to NBC. Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs warned earlier this month thatthe supply of longer-range missiles to Kyivwould cross a “red line” and the US would be viewed as “a party to the conflict” in Ukraine if it did provide such weapons. Zelenskyy did not answer directly when asked about the NBC reports on ATACMS, but he noted that the US was the biggest single supplier of weaponry to Ukraine. “We are discussing all the different types of weapons – long-range weapons and artillery, artillery shells with the calibre of 155mm, then air defence systems,” Zelenskyy said, speaking through an interpreter.

The Washington Post also reported that the US plans to provide Ukraine with a version of the ATACMS that will be armed with cluster bomblets rather than a single warhead, citing several unnamed sources familiar with the deliberations, and that can fly up to 306km (190 miles). ATACMS is designed for “deep attack of enemy second-echelon forces”, a US Army website states, and could be used to attack command and control centres, air defences and logistics sites well behind the front line.

"Wagner boss Prigozhin is in Russia, Belarus ruler Lukashenko says","After brief exile in Belarus, Wagner boss in Russia: Lukashenko",0.6958512434178536,2023-07-06,2023-07-06,"Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin - who led a short-lived rebellion in Russia last month - is in Russia and not Belarus, the leader of Belarus says.Prigozhin's whereabouts have been a mystery since the mutiny.Under the deal to end the stand-off, charges against him were dropped and he was offered a move to Belarus.But on Thursday Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko said: ""As for Prigozhin, he's in St Petersburg. He is not on the territory of Belarus.""In response to Mr Lukashenko's remarks the Kremlin said it was ""not following"" Prigozhin's movements.Mr Lukashenko had helped broker the deal to end the mutiny, and just over a week ago said Prigozhin had arrived in Belarus.The BBC tracked Prigozhin's private jet flying to Belarus in late June, and returning to Russia the same evening. It has since made several flights between St Petersburg and Moscow - although it is not clear if Prigozhin has been on board. The BBC also can't verify Mr Lukashenko's claim about the Wagner leader's current location.On Thursday Mr Lukashenko added that ""as far as I know"" the rest of the Wagner fighters were still at their bases - which could include eastern Ukraine or a training base in Russia's Krasnodar region.The Belarus leader said an offer for Wagner to station some of its fighters in Belarus - a prospect that has alarmed neighbouring Nato countries - still stands and he has offered several Soviet-era military sites for their use.""But Wagner have a different vision,"" he said, adding: ""Of course I won't tell you about that.""""At present, the issue of their relocation has not been resolved.""The Wagner Group is a private army of mercenaries that has been fighting alongside the regular Russian army in Ukraine.In his address Mr Lukashenko said he was not concerned about having Wagner fighters in Belarus, adding they would be in the country on ""certain conditions"".""The main condition is that if we need to activate them for the defence of our country, then that will be done instantly, in any direction,"" Mr Lukashenko said as he praised Wagner's ""experience"".But, he dismissed any potential threat of a Wagner-led mutiny in Belarus.""All sorts of things happen in life, but I don't see that situation for now.""If they come here, we will pay close attention to them,"" the Belarusian leader said.Mr Lukashenko has ruled Belarus since 1994 and is widely thought to have rigged 2020 elections to maintain power.On Wednesday, Russian state TV appeared to turn on Prigozhin, with commentators across several networks attacking the Wagner Group mutiny as a premeditated act of treachery. On NTV, anchors concentrated on Prigozhin's character, portraying him as a greedy and violent petty thief and referring to his past as being ""rich in criminality"". On Rossiya 1 - one of Russia's most popular networks - hosts called for Prigozhin to face ""accountability"" for his rebellion and shared images from what officials said was a raid on his home in St Petersburg. One clip showed a large stash of weapons - including assault rifles, pistols and ammunition - laid out on a bed. In other clips, large piles of cash and gold bars, wigs and fake passports belonging to the Wagner chief were shown. Footage of a sledgehammer allegedly belonging to Prigozhin - likely referring to the one used to kill a Wagner deserter several months ago - was broadcast. However, some Telegram channels associated with the Wagner Group have claimed that the videos were staged and the house in question does not belong to the mercenary boss. Prigozhin's mutiny saw Wagner mercenaries cross from field camps in Ukraine into the southern city of Rostov-on-Don, seizing command of some military facilities.Wagner fighters then travelled north towards Moscow, prompting the Kremlin to introduce tighter security in many regions, including the capital.Russian President Vladimir Putin later said Russian pilots were killed during the mutiny and it also appears to be the case that several aircraft were destroyed.Mr Putin initially accused the group of treason, but under the deal that brought an end to the mutiny, Prigozhin was promised security and the Russian criminal case against Wagner was dropped.Its fighters were told they could either sign regular army contracts, go home or head to Belarus.Recent satellite images have shown what looks like tents being erected at a former military base close to Minsk, but there has been no sign yet that this has happened ","Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, who last month brokered a deal to end Wagner’smutinyin Russia, has said that its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, was no longer in Belarus. Lukashenko said on June 27 that Prigozhin, whose fighters briefly captured a southern Russian city and marched towards Moscow, had arrived in Belarus as part of the June 24 deal that defused the crisis. But addressing reporters on Thursday, he said: “As for Prigozhin, he’s in St Petersburg. He is not on the territory of Belarus.” A business jet linked to Prigozhin left St Petersburg for Moscow on Wednesday and headed for southern Russia on Thursday, according to flight tracking data, but it was not clear if the mercenary chief was on board. Lukashenko said an offer for Wagner to station some of its fighters in Belarus – a prospect that has alarmed neighbouring NATO countries – still stands. He said he did not see it as a risk to Belarus and did not believe Wagner fighters would ever take up arms against his country. After Lukashenko’s announcement, the Kremlin said it was not tracking Prigozhin’s movements. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that no date had yet been set for a meeting between President Vladimir Putin and Lukashenko, and said he could not yet confirm details of what would be on the agenda.  Lukashenko has spoken proudly of his role in ending the mutiny, which Putin has said could have plunged Russia into civil war. Last week, Lukashenko said he had persuaded Putin not to “wipe out” Prigozhin. But much remains unclear about the terms of the deal Lukashenko brokered and whether it is being implemented as agreed. Russian state TV on Wednesdaylaunched a fierce attackon Prigozhin and said an investigation into what had happened nearly two weeks ago was still being vigorously pursued. Journalist Yulia Shapovalova told Al Jazeera from Moscow that according to Lukashenko, the movement of mercenary fighters into Belarus depends on the Wagner management and Russian authorities. Lukashenko said he was “absolutely not worried” about Wagner forces in his country, said Shapovalova. The rebellion saw Wagner forces sweep into the southern city of Rostov-on-Don and capture military headquarters there before marching towards the Russian capital in what Prigozhin described as a “march of justice” to oust Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu and chief of the general staff Valery Gerasimov. Prigozhin said his fighters had come within 200km (124 miles) of Moscow when he ordered them to stop the advance under the deal brokered by Lukashenko. The abortive rebellion represented the biggest threat to Putin in his more than two decades in power and exposed weakness in the Kremlin. Lukashenko’s statement on Thursday followed Russian media reports that said Prigozhin was spotted in St Petersburg, Russia’s second largest city. Those reports cast his presence as part of agreements that allowed the billionaire to finalise his affairs there. Lukashenko said the issue of relocating Wagner forces had not yet been resolved, the TASS news agency reported. The Belarusian president also hit out at the West over the Ukraine war and said it was likely that Kyiv would try to demonstrate its power against Russia before a key NATO summit in Lithuania next week, TASS reported. He was quoted as saying nuclear weapons would only be used in Ukraine in the case of possible NATO “aggression”."
Ukraine's counter-offensive against Russia under way,Ukraine counteroffensive against Russia under way: think tank,0.6913764904569908,2023-06-09,2023-06-09,"Was this the week that Ukraine's long-anticipated counter-offensive finally got under way?Russian President Vladimir Putin seems to think so. ""We can definitely state that this Ukrainian offensive has begun,"" he said in a video interview published on Telegram on Friday.In some ways, it's already been under way for weeks, with Ukraine conducting what's known in military jargon as ""shaping operations"": long range artillery and missile attacks on key Russian logistical targets far behind the front lines. Monday seemed to herald a change, with small detachments of lightly armoured Ukrainian units moving forward across the open fields towards Russian fortifications in southern Ukraine, south-east of Zaporizhzhia. ""Now the so-called 'fighting reconnaissance stage' is taking place along the entire length of the front,"" Serhii Kuzan, co-founder and chairman of the Ukrainian Security and Cooperation Centre, told the BBC.""That means there's a probing of Russian defences.""Some videos and accounts suggested that they quickly ran into trouble.""Somewhere this happens more successfully with small losses,"" Mr Kuzan said. ""And somewhere less successfully, where the Russians fight back.""Mr Kuzan declined to name specific towns, saying only that they were all in the area south of Zaporizhzhia.By Tuesday, the world's attention was captured by the destruction of the dam at Nova Kakhovka and the subsequent flooding that soon covered around 230 square miles (596 sq km) either side of the Dnipro River.For all the Kremlin's denials, it didn't look like a coincidence. The dam, and the road across it, offered a possible line of attack for Ukrainian forces looking for ways to keep Russian forces off-balance.It seems highly likely that Russian forces, which controlled the dam, decided to blow it up, taking one of Kyiv's military operations off the table.Kyiv had already signalled its interest in this stretch of the front line more than once. In late April, Ukrainian soldiers crossed the river and briefly established a bridgehead at Oleshky. Ukraine also took control of several small islands in the Dnipro delta, close to Kherson.The extent of Kyiv's military plans for this area is not known, and is now academic. The catastrophic flooding will have made river crossings impossible for the time being.""But the fact that such a direction was an option was seen by the Russians,"" Mr Kuzan said.While the authorities in Kyiv suddenly grappled with the flooding, the fighting continued - and seemed to escalate - further east.By early Thursday morning, the UK's Ministry of Defence tweeted that ""heavy fighting continues along multiple sectors of the front,"" adding that in most areas ""Ukraine holds the initiative.""In a video the same day, Russia's defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said that Russian forces had repelled an overnight Ukrainian attack in the area south of Zaporizhzhia, involving 150 armoured vehicles and 1,500 troops.According to the Russian Defence Ministry, Ukraine's 47th Mechanised Brigade ""made an attempt to break through Russian lines.""A video circulated on the internet, purporting to show something new: a western-supplied Leopard tank being destroyed. The BBC has not yet verified the video. Ukrainian officials, characteristically tight lipped about current operations, offered tantalising glimpses into what was going on.Hanna Malyar, the Deputy Defence Minister, coyly said that Russian troops were ""actively on the defensive"" in the area around the town of Orikhiv, around 65km south-east of Zaporizhzhia. In a statement on Telegram, she also confirmed that battles were continuing around Velyka Novosilka, further east. The two towns likely form the western and eastern edges of a heavily fortified stretch of the front line where many analysts believe Ukraine will eventually try and punch through Russian lines. ""It's not a secret that one of our main goals is to cut the land corridor that feeds the whole southern grouping of enemy forces,"" Mr Kuzan said. Pro-Russian Telegram channels in the Donbas were full of excited chatter about Ukraine's latest moves, much of it laced with scorn.""They are going where the Russians are waiting for them,"" one member posted in the I Love Kramatorsk group. ""What stupidity!""Others acknowledged that Ukrainian forces had moved forward, but questioned the price in lost men and armour. ""I really question the price of this success,"" another member of the same group commented. ""Do they have enough forces to reach Tokmak [44km south of Orikhiv], let alone Berdyansk and Melitopol?""But it's not the only area where fighting is raging. Footage from north and south of the city of Bakhmut, scene of one of the longest and bloodiest battles of the war, appeared to show Ukrainian forces moving forward.Ms Malyar said they had advanced ""from 200 to 1,100 metres in various sections,"" in what may eventually be an effort to encircle the city and trap its Russian occupiers.It is, as the UK's Ministry of Defence noted, ""a highly complex operational picture"". But does it mean that Ukraine's counter-offensive is already entering a dramatic new phase?On Wednesday, Oleksiy Danilov, Secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council, scoffed at the idea.""All of this is not true,"" he told Reuters.""When we start the counter-offensive, everyone will know about it. They will see it.""But something has definitely changed.""The point is that the front is finally moving,"" Serhii Kuzan said, adding that several options were still open to Ukrainian commanders.But Ukraine is also operating under a number of significant restraints, the main one being the lack of fighter jets capable of providing support from the air.""That's why we move slowly,"" Mr Kuzan said, ""and then move air defence [systems] closer.""Another factor is time. This offensive will probably last no more than five months, after which autumn rain will once again render open ground impassable for heavy armoured vehicles.What will success look like?If Ukrainian forces can punch through Russian lines, all the way to the Sea of Azov, then any Russian troops west of that breach will suddenly be much more vulnerable, dependent entirely on supply lines through the Crimean Peninsula.All that would then remain, Mr Kuzan says, would be to destroy the Kerch Bridge linking Russia with Crimea (briefly disabled by a huge truck bomb last October) and attack ships and planes being used to ferry supplies to the peninsula. ""That would be the end,"" he says. ""But don't expect this to happen soon. It'll take months.""","Kyiv’s counteroffensive against Russian forces has started, a Washington, DC-based think tank monitoring the war in Ukraine has said, though Ukrainian officials continue to deny or decline confirmation that their long-awaited campaign to retake territory occupied by Russian forces is under way. “The Ukrainian #counteroffensive has begun. Activity throughout #Ukraine is consistent with a variety of indicators that Ukrainian counteroffensive operations are underway across the theater,” the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said in a series of tweets late on Thursday. Ukrainian officials have confirmed that theirforces are on the offensive in the Bakhmut region– where they have reportedly gained territory – and the ISW said that it had “observed a general uptick in military activity across the entire front line, not all of it part of the Ukrainian counter-offensive effort”. The ISW said the counteroffensive “won’t likely unfold as a single grand operation”. “It will likely consist of many undertakings at numerous locations of varying size and intensity over many weeks.” The Ukrainian#counteroffensivehas begun. Activity throughout#Ukraineis consistent with a variety of indicators that Ukrainian counteroffensive operations are underway across the theater. 🧵on what we’re seeing & how to evaluate this  activity ⬇️https://t.co/hwgxTnU2Tr — ISW (@TheStudyofWar)June 8, 2023  With Ukrainian officials signalling that the start of the counteroffensive will not be officially announced, other experts have also concluded that the campaign has begun amid reports of fighting intensifying in areas along the more-than-1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line from Kherson on the Black Sea to Ukraine’s border with Russia. NBC News, citing a senior officer and a soldier near the front lines, also said the offensive had started, while The Washington Post, citing “four individuals” in the armed forces, reported the same information on Thursday. Asked about those reports, a spokesperson for the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine told the Reuters news agency: “We have no such information.” In his nightly address on Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hailed what he described as “results” in heavy fighting in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine. “I am in constant communication with our military. The commanders of Khortytsia, Tavria, [and] all those involved in the hottest areas. Donetsk region – very tough battles,”he said. “But there is a result, and I am grateful to everyone who ensures this result! Bakhmut – well done. Step by step. I thank each of our warriors!” Zelenskyy referenced other battlefield areas but said that now was not the time to discuss them. “The entire east, the situation in the south, the situation after theRussians blew up the dam of the native Kakhovka– we see every detail. But it’s not time to talk about it today.”    In a podcast on Wednesday, Michael Kofman of the Center for Naval Analyses, a US research group, said fighting had taken a “more qualitative turn” with Ukrainian forces appearing to mount offensive operations near the eastern town of Velyka Novosilka and other points in the southern part of the Donetsk region, as well as on its border withthe Zaporizhia region. “These attacks, I don’t believe [them] to be the main offensive effort, but they mark what I think is the beginning of the Ukrainian offensive,” he said. Al Jazeera’s Jonah Hull, reporting from Kyiv, said that Ukraine has made it clear it will not give “a running commentary on what is going on” as it appears to not “want to give up the element of surprise”. “What is or what may be going on now, well, military analysts have given their view, and their view is that Ukraine is engaged in a series of probing attacks, so-called shaping operations ahead of the counteroffensive,” Hull said. “Probing Russian weaknesses, looking for vulnerabilities and, at the same time, essentially keeping Russia guessing,” he said. Russia said its forces had fought a two-hour battle with Ukrainian troops in the early hours of Thursday in the Zaporizhia region. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said the Ukrainian offensive involved 1,500 soldiers and 150 armoured vehicles. “The enemy was stopped and retreated after heavy losses,” he said. Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said only that Russia was conducting “defensive actions” near the town of Orikhiv in the Zaporizhia region. According to the ISW, the initial phase of Ukraine’s counteroffensive operations will likely be the most costly and difficult in terms of lives lost and equipment destroyed as troops and armour attempt to penetrate Russia’s defensive positions. “Militaries have long identified the penetration phase of a mechanised offensive as the most dangerous and costly. The success or failure of this phase may not be apparent for some time,” the ISW said.   "
Hungary blocks â‚¬50bn of EU funding for Ukraine,Hungary blocks $54bn EU financial aid for Ukraine,0.6885964184584821,2023-12-15,2023-12-15,"Hungary has blocked â‚¬50bn ($55bn; Â£43bn) in EU aid for Ukraine - just hours after an agreement was reached on starting membership talks. ""Summary of the nightshift: veto for the extra money to Ukraine,"" Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said after Thursday's talks in Brussels.EU leaders said Ukraine would not be left without support.Ukraine is critically dependent on EU and US funding as it continues to fight occupying Russian forces.Mr Orban announced his block shortly after the EU leaders decided to open membership talks with Ukraine and Moldova and to grant candidate status to Georgia.Hungary - which maintains close ties with Russia - has long opposed membership for Ukraine but did not veto that move. Mr Orban left the negotiating room momentarily in what officials described as a pre-agreed and constructive manner, while the other 26 leaders went ahead with the vote. He told Hungarian state radio on Friday that he had fought for eight hours to stop his EU partners but could not convince them. Ukraine's path to EU membership would be a long process anyway, he said, and parliament in Budapest could still stop it happening if it wanted to. Talks on the financial package ended in the early hours of Friday. EU leaders said negotiations would resume early next year, reassuring Kyiv that support would continue. Speaking later that day, European Council President Charles Michel said he was ""confident and optimistic"" the EU would fulfil its promise to support Ukraine. Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo echoed him: ""The message to Ukraine is: we will be there to support you, we just need to figure out a few of the details together.""Mr Michel had earlier confirmed that all but one EU leader had agreed on the aid package and wider budget proposals for the bloc - although Sweden still needed to consult its parliament. He vowed to achieve the necessary unanimity for the deal. A long delay in financial aid for the country would cause big problems for Ukraine's budget, Kyiv-based economist Sergiy Fursa told the BBC.""It pays for all social responsibilities of the government - wages for teachers, doctors, for pensions,"" he said. Ukraine is also desperately seeking the approval of a $61bn US defence aid package - but that decision is also being delayed because of major disagreements between Democrat and Republican lawmakers.Ukraine's counter-offensive against Russia's occupying forces ground to a halt at the start of winter, and there are fears that the Russians could simply outgun Ukraine.Olena Zelenska, Ukraine's first lady, warned in a BBC interview last week that Ukrainians were in ""mortal danger"" of being left to die without further Western support.On Thursday, President Putin mocked Ukraine and claimed Western ""freebies"" were running out.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was delighted by the EU's announcement on the membership. ""This is a victory for Ukraine. A victory for all of Europe. A victory that motivates, inspires and strengthens,"" he said.Ukrainian politician Kira Rudik added that ""we were really elated"" following the news about EU membership talks, but she said the feeling was now ""bittersweet"" because of the funding being blocked. ""It is impossible to have a European future without winning the war,"" she told the BBC.Earlier this week, a senior Ukrainian official told the BBC that EU membership talks were more important that the â‚¬50bn because of the message it sends to both the Ukrainian people and Vladimir Putin.Ukraine and neighbouring Moldova applied to join the EU after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. They were both given candidate status last June, while Georgia was passed over at the time.Moldovan President Maia Sandu said it was an honour to share the path to EU accession with Ukraine. ""We wouldn't be here today without Ukraine's brave resistance against Russia's brutal invasion,"" she wrote.She also told the BBC that Moldova's ability to ""stay part of the free world"" depended on it being part of the EU.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz praised his fellow leaders for showing a ""strong sign of support"", adding that it was clear that both Ukraine and Moldova belonged to ""the European family"". A diplomat at the summit said it was Mr Scholz's idea for Mr Orban to leave the room to enable the vote to go through.The Hungarian leader later distanced himself from his colleagues with a video message on Facebook: ""EU membership of Ukraine is a bad decision. Hungary does not want to participate in this bad decision.""Mr Orban has also argued that Ukraine should not get large funds from the EU as it is not part of the bloc.Talks on joining the EU can take years, so Thursday's decision will not guarantee Ukraine membership. EU candidate countries have to pass a series of reforms to adhere to standards ranging from the rule of law to the economy, although the EU's executive has already praised Ukraine for completing more than 90% of the steps taken so far on justice and tackling corruption.There are also other countries, aside from Hungary, who are sceptical about expanding the EU beyond the current 27.And talk of expansion often comes alongside airy proposals for root-and-branch reform of a bloc that's often unwieldy on far less fundamental issues.But it's still a boost for morale and comes just in time as Ukraine heads into a second winter following Russia's full-scale invasion, and as the world's attention is drawn elsewhere by war in the Middle East. ","Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has blocked 50 billion euros ($54bn) in European Union aid for Ukraine, hours after the groupagreedto formally open membership talks with Kyiv. Leaders meeting in Brussels said they would revisit the issue next month after Orban refused to back the additional funding for Ukraine’s government as itbattlesto remove Russian forces from its territory. “Summary of the nightshift: veto for the extra money to Ukraine,” Orban, the closest ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin in the EU, wrote on social media. The EU’s other leaders agreed to revisit the debate in January. “We still have some time, Ukraine is not out of money in the next few weeks,” Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told reporters as he left the talks. “We agreed with the 26 countries. Victor Orban, Hungary, were not yet able to do that. I am fairly confident we can get a deal early next year. We are thinking of late January.” Rutte said another summit would be convened to reach a deal. Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo stressed that the financial support was vital. “It is just as important that Ukraine has the means to continue the war and rebuild its country,” he said. Orban had promised to block the membership talks and the funding for weeks, and the decision was a blow to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who failed this week to persuadeRepublican lawmakersin the United States to approve an additional $61bn for Ukraine. Most EU leaders wanted this week’s summit to send a clear sign of solidarity with Ukraine amid perceptions, eagerly seized upon and repeated by Moscow, that allies’ support for Kyiv was waning. Critics have accused the Hungarian leader of holding Kyiv’s survival hostage in a bid to force Brussels to release billions of euros in EU fundsfrozenamid concerns about Budapest’s commitment to the rule of law. In what some saw as a last-minute concession, the European Commission, the EU’s executive, agreed on Wednesday to unblock 10 billion euros ($11bn) of the money. A further 21 billion euros ($23bn) remains out of Orban’s grasp, but he denied that there was any link to Hungary’s intransigence over Ukraine. “That’s not our style,” he said. Thewar in Ukrainehas become bogged down on the front lines in the country’s east, wherePutinon Thursday claimed his troops were making progress. The country currently has some 617,000 soldiers in Ukraine, he added, after launching its full-scale invasion in February 2022. Across Brussels, at NATO headquarters, the security alliance’s Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned that the West must continue supporting Ukraine in order to protect the rest of Europe. “If Putin wins in Ukraine, there is real risk that his aggression will not end there. Our support is not charity – it is an investment in our security,” Stoltenberg said."
Cuba uncovers Russia-Ukraine war trafficking ring,Cuba uncovers network trafficking Cubans to fight for Russia in Ukraine,0.6822591458615458,2023-09-05,2023-09-05,"The Cuban foreign ministry says it has uncovered a human trafficking ring aimed at recruiting Cubans to fight for Russia in its war in Ukraine.It said that Cubans living in Russia and ""even some in Cuba"" had been ""incorporated into the military forces taking part in the war in Ukraine"".Cuba is a close ally of Russia, but it stressed in its statement ""it does not form part of the conflict in Ukraine"".There has not yet been a response from Russia. The Cuban foreign ministry did not specify who was behind the operation. Last August, President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian military to increase its number of soldiers after its combat forces suffered heavy losses in Ukraine.A Russian newspaper, Ryazan Gazette, has since reported that Cubans living in Russia had joined Russian combat forces fighting in Ukraine in exchange for a promise to receive Russian citizenship.There have also been videos claiming to show Serbian volunteers training to fight alongside Russian troops in Ukraine.While it is not clear if the Cuban foreign ministry statement is linked to the reports in Ryazan Gazette, it states that ""Cuba has a firm and clear historical position against the use of mercenaries"".""We will act decisively against those who... engage in human trafficking with the aim of recruiting Cuban citizens to bear arms in any country,"" the statement reads.Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno RodrÃ­guez published the statement on X, formerly known as Twitter, adding that Cuba was using ""the force of the law"" to counter attempts to recruit its citizens.The statement strikes a rare dissonant note in recent Cuban-Russian relations, which has seen the two countries forging tighter trade ties.Just over two months ago, the defence ministers of Cuba and Russia held talks in Moscow, and the Russian foreign minister travelled to the Communist-run island in April as part of a tour of Russia's Latin American allies.Cuba has been a close ally of Russia since the Cuban revolution, which saw Fidel Castro seize power in 1959.Castro - whom the United States tried and failed to overthrow on numerous occasions - sided with Russia in the Cold War. Moscow in turn provided the government in Havana with economic, political and military assistance.A secret deal in 1962 allowing the Soviet Union to station nuclear missiles in Cuba to deter fresh US attempts to invade the island triggered one of the Cold War's most dangerous confrontations between the US and the Soviet Union. While the Cuban missile crisis came to an end peacefully after Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev and US President John F. Kennedy reached an agreement, Cuba's relations with the US have remain tense, not least due to the decades-long sanctions the US has imposed on Cuba. ","Cuba has uncovered a human trafficking ring that has coerced Cuban citizens tofight for Russia in the war in Ukraine, its foreign ministry said, adding that authorities were working to “neutralize and dismantle” the network. The ministry’s statement on Monday gave few details but noted the trafficking ring was operating both in the Caribbean island nation and within Russia. “The Ministry of the Interior detected and is working on the neutralization and dismantling of a human trafficking network that operates from Russia to incorporate Cuban citizens living there, and even some from Cuba, into the military forces participating in war operations in Ukraine,” the statement said. “Cuba has a firm and clear historical position against mercenarism and plays an active role in the United Nations in repudiation of this practice,”the ministry added, according to an unofficial translation. “Cuba is not part of the war in Ukraine. It is acting and will act vigorously against whoever, from the national territory, participates in any form of human trafficking for the purposes of recruitment of mercenarism so that Cuban citizens use weapons against any country.” The Russian government has not commented on the allegations. In late May, a Russian newspaper in Ryazan city reported that several Cuban citizens had signed contracts with Russia’s armed forces and had been shipped to Ukraine in return for Russian citizenship. It was not immediately clear if the Cuban foreign ministry statement was associated with the Ryazan report. Russia last year announced a plan to boost the size of its armed forces by more than 30 percent to 1.5 million combat personnel, a lofty goal made harder by Russia’s heavy but undisclosed casualties in the 18-month war in Ukraine. Cuba also said in the statement that it had already begun prosecuting cases in which its citizens had been coerced into fighting in Ukraine. “Attempts of this nature have been neutralized and criminal proceedings have been initiated against people involved in these activities,” according to the statement. Al Jazeera reported last year that the Russian government, through the Wagner mercenary force, had recruited Syrians to fight alongsideRussian troops in Ukraine. Thousands across war-torn Syria had reportedlyexpressed an interest in signing up.    In June, it was reported that anIraqi citizen was killedfighting with Russia’s Wagner mercenary force in Ukraine. The deceased, Abbas Abuthar Witwit, was recruited from a prison in Russia with the promise that his sentence would be commuted following his service in Ukraine. According to court papers seen by the Reuters news agency at the time, Witwit had been sentenced to four-and-a-half years in prison on drug charges in July 2021 by a court in the Russian city of Kazan. Witwit was a first-year student at a technical university in Russia at the time of his conviction."
Wagner to be declared a terrorist organisation by UK,UK to declare Russia’s Wagner Group a ‘terrorist’ organisation,0.6812844062858758,2023-09-06,2023-09-06,"Wagner, the Russian mercenary group, is set to be proscribed as a terrorist group by the UK government - meaning it will be illegal to be a member or support the organisation.A draft order to be laid in Parliament will allow its assets to be categorised as terrorist property and seized. The home secretary said Wagner was ""violent and destructive... a military tool of Vladimir Putin's Russia"".She said its work in Ukraine and Africa was a ""threat to global security"". Suella Braverman added: ""Wagner's continuing destabilising activities only continue to serve the Kremlin's political goals.""""They are terrorists, plain and simple - and this proscription order makes that clear in UK law.""Wagner had played a key role in Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as well as operating in Syria and countries in Africa including Libya and Mali.Its fighters have been accused of a number crimes including killing and torturing Ukrainian citizens.In 2020, the US said Wagner soldiers had planted landmines around the Libyan capital, Tripoli. And in July, the UK said the group had carried out ""executions and torture in Mali and the Central African Republic"". The group's future was thrown into uncertainty earlier this year when its leader Yevgeny Prigozhin led a failed mutiny against Russia's military leaders.Prigozhin, who founded the group in 2014, died in a suspicious plane crash along with other Wagner figures on 23 August and was buried in St Petersburg. The group's name will now be added alongside that of other proscribed organisations in the UK such as Hamas and Boko Haram.The Terrorism Act 2000 gives the home secretary the power to proscribe an organisation if they believe it is concerned in terrorism. Before the act, it was only possible to proscribe organisations connected to terrorism in Northern Ireland. The proscription order will make it a criminal offence to support the group - including by arranging a meetings aimed at furthering the organisation's activities, expressing support for its aims or displaying its flag or logo.Committing a proscription offence could lead to 14 years in prison.The government had come under pressure from MPs for some months to proscribe the group. Earlier this year, Labour's shadow foreign secretary David Lammy urged the government to proscribe Wagner saying it was ""responsible for the appalling atrocities in Ukraine and across the world"".Welcoming the draft order on Tuesday, Mr Lammy said on social media: ""This is long overdue, but it's welcome the government has finally acted. Now the government should press for a Special Tribunal to prosecute Putin for his crime of aggression.""  The Foreign Office had imposed sanctions on the group, including freezing the assets of Prigozhin and several top commanders.However, Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee and Conservative MP Alicia Kearns said in July: ""Sanctions are not enough - the UK needs to proscribe the Wagner group for what it is: a terrorist organisation.""Her committee also produced a report which said the government had been ""remarkably complacent"" and criticised its ""dismal lack of understanding of Wagner's hold beyond Europe, in particular their grip on African states"".The Wagner Group has been seriously weakened by its failed mutiny in June against Russia's generals, as well as the recent death in the plane crash of its top leadership, BBC Security Correspondent Frank Gardner writes.But proscribing it in law will make it harder for members to move money around, our correspondent adds. It will also provide a legal basis for Ukrainians and others to sue Wagner for potentially billions of pounds in compensation through the British courts.","The United Kingdom government is set to designate Wagner, the Russian mercenary group, as a “terrorist” organisation. The BBC, the UK’s public service broadcaster, reported a draft order would be put forward in parliament to allow Wagner’s assets to be categorised as “terrorist” property and seized. The designation will make it illegal for anyone in the UK to be a member of the group or support it. The Guardian newspaper said the order would be presented on Wednesday. The decision to proscribe the group under the Terrorism Act 2000 was taken due to “the nature and scale of the organisation’s activities as well as the threat they pose to British nationals abroad,” the Guardian cited the Home Office as saying. Home Secretary Suella Braverman described Wagner as “violent and destructive… a military tool of [President] Vladimir Putin’s Russia” and said its activities were a “threat to global security”. The UK has already imposed sanctions on Wagner, some of its senior commanders and thoselinked to it in Africa, over alleged human rights abuses, but had been under pressure to go further. David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, noted the opposition Labour party had called in February for the proscription. “This is long overdue, but it’s welcome the government has finally acted,” Lammy wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. “Now the government should press for a Special Tribunal to prosecute Putin for his crime of aggression.” Wagner played a prominent role in Moscow’s war in Ukraine and was instrumental in Russia’scapture of Bakhmut cityin May. It has also been active inseveral African countriesand Syria. Its chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin, was killed when hisprivate jet crashedon its way from Moscow to St Petersburg in August, two months to the day that he launched a brief and unsuccessful mutiny against Russia’s top military leaders. Wagner troops have reportedly been sent to Belarus and their future role in Ukraine remains unclear. “While Putin’s regime decides what to do with the monster it created, Wagner’s continuing destabilising activities only continue to serve the Kremlin’s political goals,” Braverman said. “They are terrorists, plain and simple – and this proscription order makes that clear in UK law.”"
"Russian air defence system destroyed in Crimea, Ukraine says","Ukraine says Russian missile defence destroyed in Crimea, 2 warships hit",0.6753874025698894,2023-09-14,2023-09-15,"Ukraine says it has destroyed a sophisticated Russian air defence system in occupied Crimea. Kyiv's security service (SBU) and navy carried out the attack on a Russian facility near Yevpatoriya using cruise missiles and drones, a Ukrainian intelligence source told the BBC.Video footage on social media showed a fire and smoke near the city, in the west of the Russian-occupied peninsula.Moscow has yet to directly comment on the claim. Instead, the Russian defence ministry said it had shot down several Ukrainian aerial drones and thwarted a separate attack on a naval patrol vessel.Earlier on Thursday, a number of explosions were reported in the Crimean peninsula, which Russia illegally occupied in 2014. According to the BBC's intelligence source, the Ukrainian operation used drones to take out radar equipment, then cruise missiles to hit air defence missile launchers. ""After disabling the radar stations, the navy units hit the S300 and S400 'Triumph' systems, worth $1.2bn, by two Neptune cruise missiles,"" the source said.Neptune missiles were designed by Ukraine's military for naval use but have been modified for ground targets as well.No details were provided on the number of the batteries that had been hit. Citing local residents, Ukrainian media reported that explosions happened at around 05:40 local time (02:40 GMT) and smoke was seen near the military base. BBC Verify has analysed footage on social media of smoke rising and believes it to be of the attack on Yevpatoriya.Russia's ministry of defence, on the other hand, downplayed the importance of the attack and said that they shot down 11 drones over Crimea.Russian-appointed local officials have not reported any damage in the military facility or the air defence systems.The S400 air defence system has been in service since 2007, and is an upgraded version of the Cold War-era S300.The most up-to-date version's missiles can travel 400km (250 miles) and operate and attack targets at altitudes of 48km (30 miles). The S400 can destroy aircraft and ballistic missiles. Ukraine appears to be stepping up it operations on occupying forces in Crimea. It launched a major attack yesterday on the port of Sevastopol, the headquarters of Russia's Black Sea fleet. Ukrainian officials claim that two Russian naval ships sustained serious damage. Russian officials said 10 missiles were used in the attack, which reportedly left 24 people injured. The use of the missiles served to demonstrate Ukraine's increased use of long-range munitions. Meanwhile, Ukraine's finance ministry said on Thursday that the country would receive $1.25bn (about Â£1bn) from the United States as part of the World Bank's PEACE in Ukraine project.Officials said the funds would be used for non-military purposes and would be directed towards vulnerable groups and for the provision of educational and medical services. ","Ukraine said its forces attacked two Russian patrol ships operating in the Black Sea and destroyed a sophisticated “Triumf” surface-to-air missile defence system in Russian-occupied Crimea, with military analysts describing the loss of such equipment as “tactical failures” by Russia. The attacks reported on Thursday followed a day after Kyiv said it had carried out a missile strike thatbadly damaged a Russian submarine and a naval landing shipthat were undergoing repairs in a shipyard in the Crimean port of Sevastopol, home to Russia’s Black Sea Fleet. In a post on the Telegram messaging app on Thursday, Ukraine’s military said it hit two Russian patrol vessels in a southwest region of the Black Sea, causing “certain damage” in a morning attack. “The [Sergei] Kotov was hit,” military intelligence official Andriy Yusov told the Reuters news agency, sharing a grainy video circulated online by a Ukrainian government minister that appeared to show sea drones attacking a vessel at sea. Footage of a maritime drone attack on a Russian warship, presumably the ""Vasily Bykov"", has appeared.pic.twitter.com/6L3LDLrY3P — NEXTA (@nexta_tv)September 14, 2023  The Russian Defence Ministry confirmed an attack on the Sergei Kotov ship in a morning statement but said the assault involving five sea drones was repelled. It made no mention of damage. Ukraine’s military also said it had hit aRussian air defence system in a long-range attackin the early hours of Thursday near the town of Yevpatoriya in the west of Crimea. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made special reference to the Crimea attack in his nightly message to the nation on Thursday. “I thank you for today’s triumph – the destruction of the occupiers’ air defence system on the land of our Crimea. It is a very significant achievement. Well done!” he said. “The entire staff of the Security Service of Ukraine and our Navy should be specially commended for this.” Today, there are reasons to praise the work of Ukraine’s Security Service, its personnel, and the Ukrainian Navy. I thank them for today’s triumph—destroying the occupant’s air defense system in our Crimea. Very significant outcome! Glory to everyone who fights for Ukraine!pic.twitter.com/52o83hpmlq — Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa)September 14, 2023  A Ukrainian intelligence source said that aerial combat drones first incapacitated the Russian air defence system by attacking its radar and antenna and that two Neptune cruise missiles were fired and had destroyed the defence system’s launchers. Footage circulated on social media showed powerful explosions and a plume of smoke rising in the night sky, illuminated by a blaze. Reuters could not verify the video. Russia’s Defence Ministry said its air defences shot down 11 drones overnight over the peninsula and did not mention damage. Washington, DC-based think tank,the Institute for the Study of War (ISW),said on Thursday that the reported destruction of the Russian S-400 “Triumf” surface-to-air missile system based in Crimea in a “special operation” points to serious issues in Russia’s defence of the occupied peninsula. “The strike suggests that Russian forces were unprepared to intercept missiles with the system or were unable to do so,” the ISW said. According to the ISW, Ukrainian forces hit a Russian S-400 air defence system near Olenivka, Crimea, in late August. A “second Ukrainian strike on a significant Russian air defence system in recent weeks indicates that such tactical failures may reflect a wider systemic issue with Russian air defences in occupied Crimea,” the think tank said.

While Kyiv’s counteroffensive in the south and east has been slowed by minefields and Russian defensive lines, Ukrainian forces haveescalated attacks in the Black Sea region, where Russia is imposing a de facto blockade on Ukraine’s seaborne exports. Ukraine has increasingly relied on seaborne drones to attack Russian targets, hitting the Olenegorsky Gornyak landing ship near Russia’s naval base at Novorossiysk early last month, as well as a Russian fuel tanker. Ukraine continues to press on with its gruelling counteroffensive with fierce fighting reported in many parts of the front line, but no significant breakthroughs in the three-month-old campaign.   "
Kim Jong Un: North Korea leader enters Russia to visit Putin,Vladimir Putin accepts Kim Jong Un invitation to North Korea,0.6417194788896031,2023-09-12,2023-09-14,"North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un has crossed the border into Russia for a meeting with President Vladimir Putin. They are likely to discuss an arms deal as Russia faces a Ukrainian counter offensive, a US official said. South Korea's defence ministry confirmed that Mr Kim's armoured train entered Russia early on Tuesday morning.It is now moving towards Vladivostok, where Russia is hosting the Eastern Economic Forum.  That journey is expected to take another five to six hours.The meeting between the two leaders could take place as early as Tuesday local time - although the statement from the Kremlin said it would happen in ""coming days.""Mr Kim is accompanied by senior government officials, including military personnel, KCNA reported.Photos shared by state media showed Mr Kim waving from his armoured train before departing Pyongyang. High on the meeting's agenda is the possibility of North Korea providing Moscow with weapons to support its war in Ukraine, a US official earlier told CBS, the BBC's partner in the US.Mr Kim's last trip abroad was also to Vladivostok in 2019 for a summit with Mr Putin after the collapse of North Korea's nuclear disarmament talks with then US President Donald Trump.His train is rumoured to include at least 20 bulletproof cars, making it heavier than average trains. It's weight also means the train is very slow - it can only travel at around 59 km/h (37mph). The White House has said it has new information that arms negotiations between the Russia and North Korea are ""actively advancing"". National Security Council spokesman John Kirby earlier said Russia's Defence Minister, Sergei Shoigu, had tried to ""convince Pyongyang to sell artillery ammunition"" to Russia during a recent visit to North Korea.Russia and North Korea each have things that the other country wants, said Ankit Panda from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.""What'll matter now is if both sides can find suitable prices they're willing to pay for the other's assistance,"" he told the BBC. Russia will likely ask North Korea for conventional arms, including artillery shells and rocket artillery munitions in exchange for food and raw materials, and continuing support at international forums like the United Nations, he said.""This could open up the possibility of North Korea transferring more sophisticated weaponry to Russia to allow Moscow to maintain and backfill its own stocks of conventional weapons,"" he said. It is thought that Russia might need 122mm and 152mm shells because its stocks are running low, but it is not easy to determine North Korea's full artillery inventory, given its secretive nature. Weapons on display at the meeting between Mr Kim and Mr Shoigu in July included the Hwasong intercontinental ballistic missile, believed to be the country's first ICBM to use solid propellants. It was the first time Mr Kim had opened the country's doors to foreign guests since the Covid pandemic.","Russian President Vladimir Putin has accepted an invitation from Kim Jong Un to visit North Korea after the two leaders held their first face-to-face summit in four years. Kim is in Russia’s far east as Putin looks to reinforce alliances amid Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine, and as the North Korean leader continues to advance his country’s military modernisation. He extended the invitation to Putin at “a convenient time” at a reception to mark the end of a day where the two held more than four hours of talks andtouredthe Vostochny Cosmodrome space centre. “Putin accepted the invitation with pleasure and reaffirmed his will to invariably carry forward the history and tradition of the Russia-DPRK friendship,” North Korean state news agency KCNA said on Thursday, using the acronym for the country’s official name. The talks in Russia have raisedconcernin the United States and elsewhere that Kim might be prepared to sell arms to Moscow for itswar in Ukraine, perhaps in exchange for technology that would further his military ambitions.    The North Korean leader is also expected to visit an aircraft factory and travel to Vladivostok where he will view Russia’s Pacific fleet. Kim’s delegation includes his defence minister, his top military commander and the director of the country’s munitions department. Leif-Eric Easley, professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, said the members of Kim’s delegation, as well as the location for the summit, were “quite telling” even though no joint statement was issued. “The composition of Kim’s delegation suggests North Korea may send munitions to Russia in exchange for military technology. Meeting at Russia’s eastern spaceport was equivalent to Putin thumbing his nose at UN Security Council Resolutions,” Easley said in emailed comments. “This should be a wake-up call to all other UN member states about the need to redouble efforts at enforcing sanctions on Pyongyang.” In its report, KCNA said the two leaders agreed to further strengthen strategic and tactical cooperation in the face of the “military threats, provocations and tyranny of imperialists”. Putin, meanwhile, praised the “strengthening of cooperation and friendship between our countries” and told reporters he saw “possibilities” for military cooperation with North Korea. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, who was aguest of honourat events to mark the 70th anniversary of the armistice that ended the fighting in the 1950-53 Korean War, in Pyongyang in July, was also involved in the talks. The Russian leader said earlier that Moscow could help Pyongyang build satellites – Kim has argued a spy satellite is crucial for North Korea’s weapons development but its two attempts this year to put one into orbit have both ended infailure. Some analysts suggested North Korea might want to try using a Russian space launch vehicle for the satellite and work with Russia to build a more powerful piece of equipment. “It’s possible that North Korea pushes to participate in the production process of the satellite, rather than just acquiring a finished product, to set up a natural transfer of technologies,” Yang Uk, a military expert at South Korea’s Asian Institute for Policy Studies, told the Associated Press news agency. Just before Putin and Kim met, North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles, the latest in a series of launches in breach of United Nations sanctions that prohibit such activities. US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said it was “troubling” that Russia was talking about cooperation with North Korea on programmes that potentially would violate UN Security Council resolutions. South Korea’s unification minister, Kim Young-ho, who is in charge of relations with Pyongyang, expressed “deep concerns” over military cooperation and possible arms deals, saying the two countries were apparently continuing to pursue “some kind of” a military deal. “We once again urge Russia and North Korea to halt illicit acts that cause their isolation and regression, and follow international rules including the Security Council resolutions,” the minister told reporters on Thursday. Japan’s newly-appointed Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa also warned against “violations” of UN resolutions. The resolutions – passed with Russian support – ban the development of technology that could be used in North Korea’s ballistic missile programmes. They also prohibit any scientific and technical cooperation with North Korea in nuclear science and technology, aerospace and aeronautical engineering and technology, or advanced manufacturing production techniques and methods."

Mr Ramaphosa's remarks came as he met Mr Putin in St Petersburg on Saturday as part of a peace mission with six other African countries.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told the delegation on Friday that he would not enter talks with Russia while they occupied Ukrainian land.Mr Putin told the African leaders Ukraine had always refused talks.At the meeting in St Petersburg, Mr Ramaphosa also called for both parties to return their prisoners of war, and said children removed by Russia should be returned home.Mr Putin has been charged with war crimes by the International Criminal Court over the forced removal of hundreds of Ukrainian children from their families during Russia's occupation of Ukraine. As the African delegation called for the return of children to their families, Mr Putin interrupted their speech and claimed Russia was protecting them.""Children are sacred. We moved them out of the conflict zone, saving their lives and health"", he said. The UN said they have evidence of the illegal transfer of hundreds of Ukrainian children to Russia.Mr Ramaphosa also warned Mr Putin of the impacts of the war on Africa, and said it should be settled by diplomacy.""The war cannot go on forever.  All wars have to be settled and come to an end at some stage,"" he said. ""And we are here to communicate a very clear message that we would like this war to be ended.""The war has severely restricted the export of grain from Ukraine and fertiliser from Russia, which has affected African countries in particular and intensified global food insecurity.But Mr Putin blamed the West for the grain crisis - not the war in Ukraine - as he said only 3% of the grain exports permitted under a UN-sponsored deal to ensure its safe passage through the Black Sea had gone to the world's poorest countries.Russia has repeatedly complained that Western sanctions are restricting its own agricultural exports. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there were ""no grounds for extending"" the grain deal, because ""so far what we were promised has not been done"".Mr Putin praised what he described as Africa's balanced position on the war, which Russia continues to call a ""special military operation"". The African delegation, made up of representatives from South Africa, Egypt, Senegal, Congo-Brazzaville, Comoros, Zambia, and Uganda has been specifically designed for breadth and balance, with members from different parts of Africa with different views on the conflict.South Africa and Uganda are seen as leaning towards Russia, while Zambia and Comoros are closer to the West. Egypt, Senegal and Congo-Brazzaville have remained largely neutral.African countries have primarily seen the conflict a confrontation between Russia and the West. The delegation also met with Ukrainian leaders on Friday, where Mr Ramaphosa warned the war in Europe was affecting between 1.2 and 1.3 billion people in Africa.After the leaders landed, air raid sirens sounded across Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, which Ukraine's Foreign Minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said demonstrated that Mr Putin wanted ""more war"".During their meeting, Mr Zelensky told the delegation that ""an important result of your mission"" would be to intercede to bring about the release political prisoners held by Russia.The meeting comes amid heightened tensions between both Russia and Ukraine, as Ukraine launches its counteroffensive near the region of Bakhmut.Russia has claimed the counteroffensive has failed, but Kyiv said it has retaken about 100 sq km of territory on its southern front. ","South African President Cyril Ramaphosa – who is in Russia as part of a peace-seeking delegation – told his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin that thewar in Ukrainemust stop. Ramaphosa laid out the 10 points of the African peace initiative that is seeking agreement on a series of “confidence-building measures” – even as Ukraine last week began acounteroffensive to push back Russian forces. “This war has to have an end… It must be settled through negotiations and through diplomatic means,” said Ramaphosa in St Petersburg on Saturday at the 18th-century Konstantinovsky Palace. He added his delegation, consisting of seven African leaders, “came with a very clear message: that this war has to be ended”. “This war is having a negative impact on the African continent and indeed, on many other countries around the world,” Ramaphosa said. Putin interrupted opening remarks by African leaders seeking to mediate in the Ukraine conflict to deliver a list of reasons why he believed many of their proposals were misguided. He reiterated his position that Ukraine and the West had started the conflict long before Russia sent itsarmed forces over the borderin February last year. He said Russia had never refused talks with the Ukrainian side, which had been blocked by Kyiv. The group also includes leaders from Egypt, the Republic of the Congo, Senegal, Zambia, Uganda and Comoros. On Friday, the delegation held talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv. Ukraine’s leader said after meeting the leaders that peace talks with Russia would be possible only after Moscow withdrew its forces from occupied Ukrainian territory. “We have come to listen to you and through you to hear the voice of the Russian people,” said Comoros President Azali Assoumani, who currently heads the African Union, told Putin. “We wanted to encourage you to enter into negotiations with Ukraine.” African countries have been divided over their response to the conflict, with some siding with Ukraine, while others have remained neutral or gravitated towards Moscow. During their meeting with Zelenskyy, the Ukraine presidentrequestedthe African leaders push Putin to release political prisoners as a confidence-building measure. Putin, 70, on Saturday, praised the “balanced approach” of African countries towards the Ukraine conflict. “We welcome the balanced approach of African friends to the Ukraine crisis,” Putin told the visiting leaders. “We’re open to constructive dialogue with all those who want peace based on the principles of respect for each other’s interests, as well as justice.” The Russian leader also said exports of Ukrainian grain under a deal ensuring its safe passage through the Black Sea was not helping to resolve Africa’s problems with high global food prices – as only 3 percent has gone to the poorest countries. Putin said the food crisis had been caused by the actions of Western countries, not by what Russia calls a “special military operation” in Ukraine. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Saturday that there appeared to be “no chance” of extending the deal permitting Ukraine to export grain safely across the Black Sea through Russian-controlled waters. “It’s hardly possible to predict any final decision here, but I can say that, judging de facto by the status quo that we have, this deal has no chance,” Peskov told the Russian news outlet Izvestia. Al Jazeera’s Ali Hashem, reporting from Moscow, said while many were sceptical the peace mission could lead to a breakthroughbetween Russia and Ukraine, some argue the experience African leaders have from internal and regional conflicts may be able to come up with an “out of the box solution”. “However, this crisis is multilayered and intertwined … and that’s why its so complicated. The Americans, Europeans, the Chinese … everyone is trying to have their own say on it, and it doesn’t seem it’s going to be solved anytime soon.”   "
Ukraine dam: What we know about Nova Kakhovka incident,All to know about Ukraine’s Nova Kakhovka dam explosion,0.622229587102018,2023-06-08,2023-06-06,"A huge dam in the Russian-controlled area of southern Ukraine has been destroyed, unleashing a flood.Ukraine's military and Nato have accused Russia of blowing up the dam, while Russia has blamed Ukraine. Thousands of people have been evacuated from low-lying areas either side of the river Dnipro.UN humanitarian aid chief Martin Griffiths has warned of grave and far-reaching consequences. Here's what we know so far.The Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant is in the city of Nova Kakhovka in the Kherson region. The city is currently under Russian occupation. The dam was built in the Soviet era and is one of six that sit along the Dnipro river, which stretches from the very north of the country into the Black Sea. In Kherson region, Russia occupies the left, or southern, bank while Ukraine controls the right, or northern, bank.The dam holds back a huge reservoir, which locals call the Kakhovka Sea as you cannot see the other bank in certain places. Video footage showed a massive breach in the dam, with water surging through it and flooding downstream in the direction of Kherson. Ukrainian dam operator UkrHydroEnerho said the Nova Kakhovka station was ""fully destroyed"" and could not be restored.It's unclear when exactly the dam was first damaged, but satellite images suggest its condition deteriorated over a number of days. As water from the vast Kakhovka reservoir poured through the damaged dam, agricultural land and dozens of villages and towns were quickly flooded.  Thousands of people from both sides of the river have been evacuated from their homes, but the full scale of the disaster is not yet clear. There are also major environmental concerns. The river has been contaminated with 150 tonnes of industrial lubricant, said President Volodymyr Zelensky, and another 300 tonnes was at risk of leaking.Agricultural land has been washed away and the consequences of the flooding on local farmland is likely to be felt for years.Landmines are also being dislodged by the floodwaters, prompting concerns not just for residents in Kherson, but also those coming to provide assistance. Erik Tollefsen, head of the Red Cross's weapon contamination unit said they had lost track of where the landmines were: ""All we know is that they are somewhere downstream.""President Zelensky visited the flood-hit region on Thursday and said the priority was to ""protect lives and help people as much as possible"". He also visited a crossing point in the city where people were being evacuated from the flooded area and a medical facility. It's not yet clear what caused the breach in the dam, but Ukraine's military has accused Russia of deliberately blowing it up.Moscow may have feared that Ukrainian forces would use the road over the dam to get troops across the river into Russian-held territory, as part of a counter-offensive.Mykola Kalinin, chief engineer at a hydropower and water management engineering company in Ukraine, Ukrhydroproject, claimed that an explosion was the cause. The dam, he told Ukrainian data journalism site Texty, was ""built to withstand a super-powerful impact from the outside"". Mr Kalinin concludes that it was mined from the inside.But Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov blamed Ukraine, calling it an act of ""sabotage"" that would deprive the Crimean peninsula - an area annexed by Russia in 2014 -  of water. Neither Ukraine nor Russia's claims have been verified by the BBC. Alternative theories of what could have caused, or at least contributed, to the breaching of the dam have been put forward.Fighting in the area could have affected the structure, Mark Mulligan, professor of Physical Geography at University College London, told the BBC.""Structural failure resulting from the impact of earlier damage associated with the war remains a possibility,"" Prof Mulligan said.A second theory he put forward was that Russia, which controls the dam, deliberately allowed water levels to rise in the reservoir behind it - making a collapse more likely and more impactful.According to analysis of satellite imagery carried out by the US Foreign Agricultural Service, water levels rose sharply over the last few months.""The very high level of water in the reservoir coupled with previous damage, leading to uncontrolled flows of water through the dam could lead to catastrophic structural failure,"" Prof Mulligan said.However, the dam's destruction is hard to assess on satellite imagery alone, as much of the damage is underwater.""At this stage nobody knows except those on the ground, all else is speculation,"" Prof Mulligan added.Mr Zelensky has accused the international community of not reacting fast enough to the flooding, and said without drinking water, food or medicine it was impossible to know how many people would die. He has accused international organisations, like the Red Cross, of losing the ability to save lives. The World Bank has offered to conduct a rapid assessment of the damage and Ukraine's most urgent needs.What was the purpose of the dam?It held back a vast reservoir that supplied water to communities upstream, and provided cooling water to the nuclear power station at Zaporizhzhia, around 160km (100 miles) away, which is under Russian control.The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said there was no immediate nuclear safety risk but it was monitoring the situation.It later said that if the dam did fall below 12.7m, the lowest level at which water can still be pumped upstream to Zaporizhzhia, there were alternative water sources to keep the nuclear plant cool.The dam was also a vital channel carrying water from the river to Russian-occupied Crimea, meaning water supplies there are likely to be affected.After Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, Ukraine blocked a channel carrying water from Nova Kakhovka, triggering a water crisis on the peninsula.Russian forces reopened the channel after last year's invasion. But without the dam, dropping water levels could once again jeopardise the flow of water along the channel.Russia has previously carried out several attacks on dams throughout Ukraine since the invasion, causing widespread flooding and disrupting power supplies.","A dam and hydroelectric power plant in a Russian-controlled part of southern Ukrainehave been destroyed, unleashing a torrent of water and prompting fears of wide-scale flooding in the area downstream on the Dnipro river. Ukrainian and Russian officials have urged local communities near the Nova Kakhovka dam to evacuate the area immediately. It is unclear what exactly destroyed the dam early on Tuesday, but from the images being broadcast from the scene, it appears that an explosion blew up a large part of the structure. Videos showed the buildings around the entrance of the dam being heavily damaged, while a large body of water was seen gushing through a hole in the structure. Ukrainian and Russian officials have accused each other of blowing up the dam, although conflicting reports have emerged from Moscow-installed officials. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused “Russian terrorists” of destroying the dam and said the outrage “confirms for the whole world that they must be expelled from every corner of Ukrainian land”. “Not a single meter should be left to them, because they use every meter for terror,” he wrote in a tweet. “The terrorists will not be able to stop Ukraine with water, missiles or anything else,” he said. Andriy Yermak, head of Zelenskyy’s office, also labelled the alleged act “ecocide“. The world must see and react to the consequences of Russian terrorism against civilian population of Ukraine, as well as ecocide.pic.twitter.com/PKBtLVXuwc — Andriy Yermak (@AndriyYermak)June 6, 2023  Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu accused Ukraine of blowing up the dam as part of a plan to redeploy units from the nearby Kherson region. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters said the incident was “deliberate sabotage by the Ukrainian side.” “Apparently, this sabotage is also connected with the fact that having started large-scale offensive actions two days ago, now the Ukrainian armed forces are not achieving their goals, these offensive actions are faltering,” he added.  Meanwhile, a Moscow-installed official in Nova Kakhovka, Vladimir Leontev, told Russian state television that the damage to the dam was the result of a series of Ukrainian attacks. However, Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-installed official in Zaporizhzhia, said the dam collapsed due to earlier damage and the pressure of the water. The dam is located in Russian-controlled territory near the major city of Kherson. Russian forces captured Kherson in March 2022, but a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive retook the city in November 2022, as Russian troops retreated to the southern bank of the Dnipro river. Russia still controls most of the territory on the southern banks downstream from the dam, while Ukraine controls the territories to the north of the river. The dam, 30 metres (98 feet) tall and 3.2km (2 miles) long, was built in 1956 on the Dnipro river as part of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. It supplies water to large swaths of southeastern Ukraine, as well as the Russian-annexed Crimean peninsula. The dam’s reservoir also provided water used for the essential cooling of the six reactors at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), the largest such facility in Europe, as well as for spent fuel and emergency diesel generators that have had to be used repeatedly when external power fails.    Both sides have made statements to quell fears that the plant is at risk. Ukraine’s state nuclear power agency, Energoatom, said although the recent events posed a risk to the plant, the situation was “under control”. For its part, Russia’s state nuclear energy company Rosatom said there was no threat to the ZNPP. The United Nations nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said on Twitter it was closely monitoring the situation but that there was “no immediate nuclear safety risk at [the] plant”. The IAEA is aware of reports of damage at#Ukraine’s Kakhovka dam; IAEA experts at#ZaporizhzhyaNuclear Power Plant are closely monitoring the situation; no immediate nuclear safety risk at plant.#ZNPP — IAEA – International Atomic Energy Agency ⚛️ (@iaeaorg)June 6, 2023  IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said the plant should have enough water to cool its reactors for “some months” from a pond located above the reservoir of the dam “There are a number of alternative sources of water. A main one is the large cooling pond next to the site that by design is kept above the height of the reservoir,” he said in a statement. River banks are already flooding as water pours over through the destroyed dam structure. The exact ecological consequences are yet to be clearly identified, but Ukrainian officials have warned they could be serious. Yermak wrote, “The Russians will be responsible for the possible deprivation of drinking water for people in the south of Kherson region and in Crimea, the possible destruction of some settlements and the biosphere.” Ukraine’s presidential office said in astatementthat “at least 150 tons of motor oil got into the Dnipro River, and there is a risk of further leakage of more than 300 tons”. The Russian-backed governor of Crimea said on Tuesday that there is a risk that water levels in the North Crimean canal, which carries fresh water to the peninsula from the Dnipro river, could fall as a consequence of the dam’s destruction. The Crimean peninsula is dependent on fresh water from the canal. Ukraine previously blocked water supplies to Crimea after Russia annexed the peninsula in 2014, causing water shortages in the region. The destruction of the Kakhovka dam today puts thousands of civilians at risk and causes severe environmental damage.This is an outrageous act, which demonstrates once again the brutality of#Russia’s war in#Ukraine. — Jens Stoltenberg (@jensstoltenberg)June 6, 2023  There has been widespread condemnation of the incident, with NATO’s Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg saying the destruction of the dam demonstrated “the brutality of Russia’s war in Ukraine”. Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, said the act qualifies as a “war crime”. Shocked by the unprecedented attack of the Nova Kakhovka dam. The destruction of civilian infrastructure clearly qualifies as a war crime – and we will hold Russia and its proxies accountable. — Charles Michel (@CharlesMichel)June 6, 2023  German Chancellor German Chancellor Olaf Scholz blamed Russia for the attack, saying the long-feared move represented a new dimension in the conflict. “By all accounts, this is aggression by the Russian side to stop the Ukrainian offensive, to defend its own country. This shows that this is a new dimension,” Scholz said at a townhall organised by broadcaster RTL. He tweeted: “The destruction of the Kakhovka dam with the terrible consequences shows a new dimension. It fits with the way Russia is relentlessly waging war and fits in with the many crimes in Ukraine. We support Ukraine for as long as necessary.” British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said it was too early to give a meaningful assessment of the details behind the destruction of a dam in southern Ukraine but that it had happened because of Russia’s invasion. Voicing solidarity with the Ukrainian people, Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Twitter: “We condemn the destruction of civilian infrastructures, (which is) in violation of international humanitarian law. Spain will always stand with Ukraine against the brutal Russian aggression” Sanchez reiterated. Our solidarity with the Ukrainian people in the wake of the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam. We condemn the destruction of civilian infrastructures, in violation of international humanitarian law. Spain will always stand with Ukraine against the brutal Russian aggression. — Pedro Sánchez (@sanchezcastejon)June 6, 2023 "
What do Vladimir Putin and Tucker Carlson gain from Moscow interview?,Decoding Putin’s ‘obsessive ideas’ in the Tucker Carlson interview,0.622063256604678,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Russian President Vladimir Putin's highly anticipated interview with conservative US media personality Tucker Carlson has aired.The interview, which was recorded on Tuesday, was posted on Carlson's website and X, formerly known as Twitter. The high-profile sit-down marks the first time the Russian leader has agreed to an interview with a Western media outlet since he launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost two years ago and comes as fighting in the country has reached a stalemate.Carlson introduced the interview in front of a snowy Kremlin and said it had been recorded two days before.Prior to the interview, he falsely claimed that other journalists were uninterested in talking to the Russian leader and that ""not a single Western journalist has bothered to interview"" Mr Putin since the invasion of Ukraine. Countless reporters from Western countries, including the BBC's Russia Editor Steve Rosenberg, have sent the Kremlin repeated interview requests. None of these have been granted. Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov himself admitted that Carlson was incorrect during a news briefing on Wednesday, telling the BBC in Moscow: ""Mr Carlson is not correct, and he couldn't have known that. We receive a lot of requests for interviews with the president.""But the interview is a major coup for Carlson, who has rebounded rapidly since he was spectacularly fired by Fox News last year, after reportedly falling out of favour with owner Rupert Murdoch. It allows him to present his new media company, which launched on X last year, as a major player in the media landscape. During the interview, Carlson pushed for the release of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, asking Mr Putin if he ""would be willing to release him to us and we'll bring him back to the United States"". Mr Putin said he believed a deal could be struck to release Mr Gershkovich, 32, ""if our partners take reciprocal steps"".Carlson's visit has come at an opportune time for the long-time Russian leader, whose media appearances are tightly choreographed and controlled by the Kremlin. In the US, attempts to pass legislation granting new military aid for Ukraine - widely viewed as essential to continuing the war - have stalled in Congress. On Wednesday, the latest bill that would have allocated $60bn of crucial funding for Kyiv was advancing through the Senate but faced stiff opposition from Republicans in the House. In the absence of fresh military aid, Ukraine's attempts to drive Russian forces from the country and launch new counter-offensives in the south and the eastern Donbas region have proved practically impossible. Some senior Republicans, including the party's Senate leader Mitch McConnell, remain committed to forcing through that new aid. But they face increasing hostility from hard-right members of their own party, who have baulked at the spiralling cost of the conflict and are pushing against US involvement in global conflicts.The Kremlin will be hoping that, by doing an interview with a prominent conservative TV presenter, Republican lawmakers will be susceptible to Moscow's narratives usually only parroted within domestic Russian media. Carlson has also had a long and mutually beneficial relationship with Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, who has expressed scepticism about supporting Ukraine.Carlson's platform offers an opportunity for the Kremlin to reach a wider, potentially sympathetic and heavily conservative audience in the US. In the past, the former Fox News host has launched scathing attacks on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and allied himself with Mr Putin's drive to embrace so-called ""traditional values,"" a phrase which has included attacks on LGBT people in Russia. Kremlin spin-doctors also have an eye on Europe, which will be left to support Ukraine financially if America withdraws assistance. Politics on the continent are changing. Surveys show increasing levels of hesitancy among the European public about continuing support for Ukraine. A number of right-wing populist parties, some of them with pro-Russian leanings, have had success in elections in various countries. Others, including in economic powerhouses like France and Germany, are doing well in the polls.But there is also a domestic element to the proceedings. Russia will hold presidential elections next month, and while the contest is almost certain to be won by Mr Putin - with his sole anti-war challenger disqualified on Thursday - the interview with Carlson allows the Russian leader to present himself as an international statesman with a global presence to his home audience. Indeed, Russian state media have spent several days treating Carlson as a major celebrity. In breathless coverage, state TV followed the media personality's arrival and broadcast footage of various trips to restaurants and a visit to see the Spartacus ballet at the Bolshoi Theatre.Finally, Moscow will be closely watching growing signs of internal political divisions in Ukraine. On Thursday, President Zelensky said he was replacing his top military commander, Gen Valery Zaluzhny, amid rumours of a rift between the two men. That will be music to Mr Putin's ears - his ultimate goal, short of the military conquest of Ukraine, is the removal of the Zelensky government in order to replace it with a pro-Russian one under his control. Failing that, the Kremlin leader is hoping Europe and America will tire of the war and put pressure on the Ukrainians to begin negotiations to end the conflict on terms that would be favourable to Moscow.","Russian President Vladimir Putin has told conservative US journalist Tucker Carlson that ending Moscow’s almost two-year-old invasion of Ukraine is “simple”. In his first interview with a Western reporter since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began two years ago, the Kremlin handpicked Carlson, a former Fox News superstar-turned-online commentator. The reason is obvious – Carlson has characterised the Russia-Ukraine war as a “border dispute”, called on Americans to cut off multibillion aid packages to Kyiv, and compared Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to a “rat” and a “pimp”. During the two-hour interview recorded in a Kremlin audience hall with gilded furniture, Carlson did not pressure Putin the way he used to sandbag the pro-Democrat guests on the Fox News show he wasfired from last year. Putin’s goal appears obvious – he wanted Carlson to urge Republicans to stop supporting Ukraine and concentrate on domestic problems. “You have issues on the border, issues with migration, issues with the national debt,” Putin told Carlson, who looked gullible and sheepish for most of their sit-down. “You have nothing better to do, so you should fight in Ukraine? Wouldn’t it be better to negotiate with Russia?” When Carlson asked whether Putin could just call US President Joe Biden to “work it out”, Putin refused – but said the solution was “very simple”. “If you really want to stop fighting, you need to stop supplying weapons. It will be over within a few weeks. That’s it. Then we can agree on some terms,” he said. Carlson did not even try to refute Putin’s outlandish and ungrounded claims. One was Putin’s belief that elected leaders do not run the United States. “So, twice you’ve described US presidents making decisions and then being undercut by their agency heads. So, it sounds like you’re describing a system that’s not run by the people who are elected in your telling,” Carlson said. “That’s right,” Putin said without offering further explanation – and Carlson readily agreed. Then he asked Putin who was behind the 2022explosionin the Baltic Sea that damagedNord Stream, a natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany that was crucial for Moscow’s coffers. Carlson called it “the biggest act of industrial terrorism ever”, but did not dispute Putin’s claim that it was the CIA that had allegedly blown up the pipeline – and presented no concrete evidence whatsoever. Putin began the interview with a lengthy lecture on Eastern Europe’s history, in which he reiterated the Kremlin’s manipulative view onKyivan Rus, a medieval superpower whose disintegration spawned today’s Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. Carlson seemed completely ignorant about the issue – and just kept nodding in bewilderment when Putin told him about a Viking prince named Ruric whose descendants ruled Kyivan Rus. One of them, Prince Vladimir, converted to Orthodox Christianity a millennium ago. According to Putin’s logic, Russia was the only legitimate successor to Kyivan Rus, and the very idea of Ukraine was “invented” by czarist Russia’s archrival – Austria. “Before World War I, Austrian general staff relied on the ideas of Ukrainianisation and started actively promoting the ideas of Ukraine and the Ukrainianisation,” Putin said. To Carlson’s audience and many in the West, the lecture may seem boring and irrelevant. But to Ukrainians, Putin’s interpretation of events is a sobering and threatening reminder that the Kremlin denies Ukraine’s very right to exist. “Because all of these anecdotes about Prince Vladimir and Rurik have to tell all sceptics just one thing – this man has obsessive ideas,” said Maria Kucherenko, from Come Back Alive, a Kyiv-based charity. “And he won’t stop at anything to make them real,” she told Al Jazeera. Ukrainian officials and public figures who have met with Putin face to face have long maintained that the Russian president is determined to subjugate and annihilate Ukraine no matter what. “He is tough and he behaves like he has this almost divine power, over Ukraine in particular,” Yuriy Vitrenko, who headed Naftogaz, Ukraine’s state energy company, at the time, told this reporter in 2021 recalling his encounters with Putin. Putin reiterated his old claims that today’s Ukraine is an “artificial state” created by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin who annexed areas in Poland, Hungary and Romania making them part of Soviet Ukraine. Putin also suggested that Hungary, whose nationalist helmsman Viktor Orban remains the most pro-Russian leader within the European Union, “has the right to take back its lands.” An observer compared Putin’s intention to those of Nazi dicatator Adolf Hitler who triggered World War II by annexing areas in Eastern Europe that were populated by ethnic Germans. “I think that the response to his Hitlerism on the part of North American and European elites will resolutely be harsh and will lead to more military aid to Ukraine,” Nikolay Mitrokhin of Germany’s Bremen University told Al Jazeera. “Here Putin worked for Biden by trying to animate Trump’s audience.” To other Ukrainian observers, the interview offered nothing but tired Kremlin tropes. “The only remarkable thing in this interview is the size of the table – it’s tiny! The rest we have seen and heard a gazillion times,” Svetlana Chunikhina, vice president of the Association of Political Psychologists, a group in Kyiv, told Al Jazeera. “Tucker goddamned Carlson served very well as a microphone stand for the crazy maniac who for two hours rambled about how he loves to kill Ukrainians.” To a Russian observer, the interview is a Kremlin public relations stunt designed to convince average Russians that Putin’s war did not turn their nation into an international pariah spurned by the West. “They want to show that Russia doesn’t confront the civilised world but only separate elites within it. To sort of emphasise that there are other elites, and here’s a well-known journalist interviewing [Putin],” said Sergey Biziyukin, an exiled opposition activist from the western Russian city of Ryazan. “And that once [these elites] win elections, the West will admit that Russia is right,” he told Al Jazeera referring to Donald Trump’s possible victory in the November presidential vote and to the recent success of several nationalist and far-right groups in Europe. The interview’s timing was critical for Ukraine. On Wednesday, Republicans blocked a multibillion aid package that was critical for Kyiv – while Zelenskyy announced his highly divisive decision to fireValerii Zaluzhnyi, the highly trusted and influential top general. However, to Ukrainian servicemen, the interview is nothing but a demonstration of weakness. “They’re two losers trying to support each other, trying to voice their conspiracy theories,” said Valentin, a Ukrainian drone operator stationed in the eastern region of Donetsk who watched parts of the interview on his cellphone. “They can’t face the truth about Ukraine that is real and will prevail,” he told Al Jazeera by phone."
Nato membership for Ukraine a key question at Vilnius summit,Full text: NATO Vilnius summit communique,0.6218914859465691,2023-07-11,2023-07-12,"Out in a dense forest in central Ukraine, troops from a Ukrainian artillery battery are training before heading out to the front lines. For some it will be a return to the fight, for others it will be their first time - as they replace those who have been injured or killed. Firing at targets in a clearing with AK-47 rifles, they are careful to conserve ammunition. And it is not just training camps where supplies are low.""We have enough fighting spirit to win, of course. Unfortunately, we currently do not have enough weapons,"" Roman, their commander, tells me. ""The main thing is to have enough ammunition.""Out on the front lines they are having to economise, he explains. ""This is not a secret. The amount of ammunition that the enemy uses daily is at least five times higher than the amount of ammunition that we use.""Supplies from allies have been essential for Ukraine in this war. For Roman and other soldiers, the Nato summit in Vilnius is a crucial moment to ensure they have what they need to continue the fight.The widespread expectation is that new weapons will be promised at the summit, as well as more supplies of ammunition. The US decision to provide cluster munitions from existing stockpiles last week was partly to act as a stop-gap before new artillery supplies are ready. But viewed from Ukraine the summit is about much more than just weapons and ammunition - it is about what type of commitment the country will be offered when it comes to joining the alliance.Ukraine has been knocking at Nato's door for years. What it wants is more than just positive noises and a feeling of being left in a permanent waiting room.At the core of Nato is Article 5, which sets out that an attack on one member is an attack on all. This principle of collective defence could offer protection for Ukraine, but - almost everyone agrees - is very difficult to put in place when a country is already at war. ""We believe that it is long overdue to invite Ukraine to Nato,"" Oleg Nikolenko, a spokesperson for Ukraine's foreign affairs minister, says. ""An invitation to join Nato does not mean an immediate membership in Nato. We are cognizant of the fact that as long as the war goes on, Ukraine won't be able to join Nato. But we are talking about the invitation and setting the clear timeframe for this to happen.""The 2008 Nato summit in Bucharest casts a long shadow. Ukraine, along with Georgia, was told membership was on the cards in the future - but with no clear path and no expectation that it would be anytime soon. That angered Russia but without offering any protection in return. Georgia was attacked in 2008 by Russia, and Ukraine attacked too - first in 2014 and then in 2022. Many of those US officials involved in the decision in Bucharest now acknowledge it was a mistake.This time Ukraine wants greater clarity and concrete assurances. The exact nature and timetable of any commitment could have real consequences for the war. For instance, offering membership only when the war is over might encourage Russia to maintain a low level conflict to stall membership, some analysts argue. But there are existing Nato members who are cautious about offering too much to Ukraine now. They fear this could draw Nato closer to war with Russia. That is a view that is met with some annoyance in Ukraine.""Let's be honest: for a long time, Nato has been paying too much attention to whether Russia will allow them to do anything,"" Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the office of the President of Ukraine, told me when I visited his heavily guarded office in the centre of the capital. ""Nato must say unequivocally that there are no more preconditions for this related to Russian threats.""Ukrainians view membership as a way to end the war by deterring Russia rather than escalating it. They acknowledge, as US President Joe Biden has made clear in recent days, that Ukraine needs to make the reforms that any prospective member has to undertake. But they argue that Nato was set up to confront Moscow in the Cold War and yet it is now Ukraine which is effectively fighting on Nato's behalf, defending its eastern flank against Russia with its soldiers and civilians dying every day. For many in Kyiv, the focus by some inside the alliance on the risks of an invitation are a mistake. What, they ask, are the risks of not acting? In public, Ukrainian officials are careful to sound optimistic and not to enter into any discussion of the consequences if they receive only vague promises and looser ""security guarantees"". They do not want to sound ungrateful for the weapons and ammunition they still need right now. But privately officials worry that in the long term a failure to bring Ukraine into closer alignment with the West will be used by Moscow to push a narrative within the country that Ukraine has been let down and the West cannot be trusted. People could feel betrayed, one senior official told me.Without formal membership, the fear is the West could tire of supplying the weapons and ammunition Ukraine needs as the war grinds on. That is something Vladimir Putin and Russia is counting on. So in Kyiv do they worry about that? ""I have a counter question: what does it mean to be tired of supporting Ukraine?"" presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak remarks when I put that question to him. ""This means that democracy does not know how to defend itself. And that any authoritarian country, if it has a capacity to fight, will always win.""","NATO leaders are holding their annual summit as Ukraine looks to the security alliance for support in its attempt to push back invading Russian forces. The Vilnius communique, however, while emphasising NATO’s support for Ukraine, gave no clear timetable on when the country might be able to join the alliance, in a major disappointment for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who had travelled to the Lithuanian capital. “Ukraine’s future is in NATO,” the leaders said in the joint statement on Tuesday. “We will be in a position to extend an invitation to Ukraine to join the alliance when allies agree and conditions are met,” the declaration said, without specifying the conditions. The communique also touched on the Asia Pacific, with the leaders of Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea all attending as NATO allies. It said China was a challenge to NATO’s interests, security and values with its “ambitions and coercive policies” triggering a furious response from Beijing. And it accused Beijing and Moscow of “mutually reinforcing attempts to undercut the rules-based international order”. China has said it wants peace in Ukraine, but has not condemnedRussia’s full scale invasionsince it began in February 2022. Here is the full text of the communique: The NATO Invitee associates itself with this Communiqué. 1.           We, the Heads of State and Government of the North Atlantic Alliance, bound by shared values of individual liberty, human rights, democracy, and the rule of law, have gathered in Vilnius as war continues on the European continent, to reaffirm our enduring transatlantic bond, unity, cohesion, and solidarity at a critical time for our security and international peace and stability.  NATO is a defensive Alliance.  It is the unique, essential and indispensable transatlantic forum to consult, coordinate and act on all matters related to our individual and collective security.  We reaffirm our iron-clad commitment to defend each other and every inch of Allied territory at all times, protect our one billion citizens, and safeguard our freedom and democracy, in accordance with Article 5 of the Washington Treaty.  We will continue to ensure our collective defence from all threats, no matter where they stem from, based on a 360-degree approach, to fulfil NATO’s three core tasks of deterrence and defence, crisis prevention and management, and cooperative security.  We adhere to international law and to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and are committed to upholding the rules-based international order.  This Summit marks a milestone in strengthening our Alliance. 2.           We warmly welcome President Zelenskyy to the inaugural meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council.  We look forward to our valuable exchanges with the Heads of State and Government of Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and the Republic of Korea, as well as the President of the European Council and the President of the European Commission at this Summit.  We also welcome the engagements with the Foreign Ministers of Georgia and the Republic of Moldova, and with the Deputy Foreign Minister of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as we continue to consult closely on the implementation of NATO’s tailored support measures. 3.           We welcome Finland as the newest member of our Alliance. This is an historic step for Finland and for NATO. For many years, we worked closely as partners; we now stand together as Allies. NATO membership makes Finland safer, and NATO stronger. 4.           We reaffirm our commitment to NATO’s open door policy and to Article 10 of the Washington Treaty. Every nation has the right to choose its own security arrangements. We look forward to welcoming Sweden as a full member of the Alliance and, in this regard, welcome the agreement reached between the NATO Secretary General, the President of Türkiye, and the Prime Minister of Sweden. 5.           Peace in the Euro-Atlantic area has been shattered.  The Russian Federation has violated the norms and principles that contributed to a stable and predictable European security order.  The Russian Federation is the most significant and direct threat to Allies’ security and to peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area.  Terrorism, in all its forms and manifestations, is the most direct asymmetric threat to the security of our citizens and to international peace and prosperity.  The threats we face are global and interconnected. 6.           Strategic competition, pervasive instability and recurrent shocks define our broader security environment.  Conflict, fragility and instability in Africa and the Middle East directly affect our security and the security of our partners.  The People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) stated ambitions and coercive policies challenge our interests, security and values.  We remain open to constructive engagement with the PRC, including to build reciprocal transparency, with a view to safeguarding the Alliance’s security interests.  We continue to be confronted by cyber, space, hybrid and other asymmetric threats, and by the malicious use of emerging and disruptive technologies. 7.           Russia bears full responsibility for its illegal, unjustifiable, and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine, which has gravely undermined Euro-Atlantic and global security and for which it must be held fully accountable.  We continue to condemn in the strongest terms Russia’s blatant violations of international law, the Charter of the United Nations, and OSCE commitments and principles.  We do not and will never recognise Russia’s illegal and illegitimate annexations, including Crimea.  There can be no impunity for Russian war crimes and other atrocities, such as attacks against civilians and the destruction of civilian infrastructure that deprives millions of Ukrainians of basic human services.  All those responsible must be held accountable for violations and abuses of human rights and international humanitarian law, particularly against Ukraine’s civilian population, including the forced deportation of children and conflict-related sexual violence.  The destruction of the Kakhovka dam highlights the brutal consequences of the war started by Russia.  Russia’s war has had a profound impact on the environment, nuclear safety, energy and food security, the global economy, and the welfare of billions of people around the world.  Allies are working to enable exports of Ukrainian grain and actively support international efforts to alleviate the global food crisis. 8.           Russia must immediately stop this illegal war of aggression, cease its use of force against Ukraine, and completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its forces and equipment from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders, extending to its territorial waters.  We urge all countries not to provide any kind of assistance to Russia’s aggression and condemn all those who are actively facilitating Russia’s war.  Belarus’ support has been instrumental as it continues to provide its territory and infrastructure to allow Russian forces to attack Ukraine and sustain Russia’s aggression.  In particular Belarus, but also Iran, must end their complicity with Russia and return to compliance with international law. 9.           We welcome the strong support in the UN General Assembly for efforts to promote a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace in Ukraine.  We welcome and support President Zelenskyy’s commitment in setting out the principles for such a peace through his Peace Formula.  We are committed to achieving a just and lasting peace that upholds the principles of the UN Charter, in particular sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence.  We underline that this cannot be realised without Russia’s complete and unconditional withdrawal.  While we have called on Russia to engage constructively in credible negotiations with Ukraine, Russia has not shown any genuine openness to a just and lasting peace. 10.         We reaffirm our unwavering solidarity with the government and people of Ukraine in the heroic defence of their nation, their land, and our shared values.  We fully support Ukraine’s inherent right to self-defence as enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter.  We remain steadfast in our commitment to further step up political and practical support to Ukraine as it continues to defend its independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders, and will continue our support for as long as it takes.  We welcome efforts of all Allies and partners engaged in providing support to Ukraine.    11.         We fully support Ukraine’s right to choose its own security arrangements.  Ukraine’s future is in NATO.  We reaffirm the commitment we made at the 2008 Summit in Bucharest that Ukraine will become a member of NATO, and today we recognise that Ukraine’s path to full Euro-Atlantic integration has moved beyond the need for the Membership Action Plan.  Ukraine has become increasingly interoperable and politically integrated with the Alliance, and has made substantial progress on its reform path.  In line with the 1997 Charter on a Distinctive Partnership between NATO and Ukraine and the 2009 Complement, Allies will continue to support and review Ukraine’s progress on interoperability as well as additional democratic and security sector reforms that are required.  NATO Foreign Ministers will regularly assess progress through the adapted Annual National Programme.  The Alliance will support Ukraine in making these reforms on its path towards future membership.  We will be in a position to extend an invitation to Ukraine to join the Alliance when Allies agree and conditions are met. 12.         The security of Ukraine is of great importance to Allies and the Alliance.  To support Ukraine’s further integration with NATO, today we have agreed a substantial package of expanded political and practical support.  We have decided to establish the NATO-Ukraine Council, a new joint body where Allies and Ukraine sit as equal members to advance political dialogue, engagement, cooperation, and Ukraine’s Euro-Atlantic aspirations for membership in NATO.  It will provide for joint consultations, decision-making, and activities, and will also serve as a crisis consultation mechanism between NATO and Ukraine. 13.         The continued delivery of urgently needed non-lethal assistance to Ukraine by NATO through the Comprehensive Assistance Package (CAP) remains a priority.  Since the Madrid Summit, Allies and partners have committed over 500 million euros to the CAP.  To support Ukraine’s deterrence and defence in the short, medium, and long term, we have agreed today to further develop the CAP into a multi-year programme for Ukraine.  The assistance provided will help rebuild the Ukrainian security and defence sector and transition Ukraine towards full interoperability with NATO.  Allies will continue to fund the CAP in a sustained and predictable way.  We highly welcome and encourage partner contributions. 14.         Russia has increased its multi-domain military build-up and presence in the Baltic, Black, and Mediterranean Sea regions, and maintains significant military capabilities in the Arctic.  Russia’s more assertive posture, novel military capabilities, and provocative activities, including near NATO borders, as well as its large-scale no-notice and snap exercises, continue to threaten the security of the Euro-Atlantic area.  In the High North, its capability to disrupt Allied reinforcements and freedom of navigation across the North Atlantic is a strategic challenge to the Alliance.  NATO and Allies will continue to undertake necessary, calibrated, and coordinated activities, including by exercising relevant plans. 15.         Russia’s deepening military integration with Belarus, including the deployment of advanced Russian military capabilities and military personnel in Belarus, has implications for regional stability and the defence of the Alliance.  NATO will remain vigilant and further monitor developments closely, in particular the potential deployment of so-called private military companies to Belarus.  We call on Belarus to stop its malign activities against its neighbours, to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, and to abide by international law. 16.         Russia is modernising its nuclear forces, including its large stockpile of theatre-range weapons, and expanding its novel and disruptive dual-capable delivery systems.  It is unacceptable that Russia uses such dual-capable systems to attack civilians and critical civilian infrastructure in Ukraine.  We condemn Russia’s announced intention to deploy nuclear weapons and nuclear-capable systems on Belarusian territory, which further demonstrates how Russia’s repeated actions undermine strategic stability and overall security in the Euro-Atlantic area.  We condemn Russia’s irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and coercive nuclear signalling.  We recall the Joint Statement of the Leaders of the Five Nuclear Weapons States issued on 3 January 2022 on Preventing Nuclear War and Avoiding Arms Races.  We call on Russia to recommit – in words and deeds – to the principles enshrined in that Statement. 17.         Russia’s actions demonstrate a posture of strategic intimidation and underline the continued need for NATO to monitor all of these developments and adapt its posture as necessary.  Allies will continue to work closely together to address the threats and challenges posed by Russia and reiterate that any use of Chemical, Biological, Radiological or Nuclear weapons by Russia would be met with severe consequences. 18.         Russia has intensified its hybrid actions against NATO Allies and partners, including through proxies.  This includes interference in democratic processes, political and economic coercion, widespread disinformation campaigns, malicious cyber activities, and illegal and disruptive activities of Russian intelligence services.  We are enhancing the tools at our disposal to counter Russian hybrid actions and will ensure that the Alliance and Allies are prepared to deter and defend against hybrid attacks. 19.         We seek stability and predictability in the Euro-Atlantic area and between NATO and Russia.  NATO does not seek confrontation and poses no threat to Russia.  In light of its hostile policies and actions, we cannot consider Russia to be our partner.  Any change in our relationship depends on Russia halting its aggressive behaviour and fully complying with international law.  We remain willing to keep open channels of communication with Moscow to manage and mitigate risks, prevent escalation, and increase transparency.  At the same time, we will continue to consult on and assess the implications of Russia’s policies and actions for our security, and respond to Russian threats and hostile actions in a united and responsible way. 20.         We categorically reject and condemn terrorism in the strongest possible terms.  Countering terrorism in all its forms and manifestations is essential to our collective defence.  NATO’s role in the fight against terrorism contributes to all three core tasks of the Alliance and is integral to the Alliance’s 360-degree approach to deterrence and defence.  Allies will continue to fight this threat with determination, resolve, and in solidarity.   As part of a broader effort to better respond collectively to this threat, we will further develop Allies’ capabilities, and continue to engage with the Global Coalition to Defeat Da’esh and with partner countries in order to support their efforts and to help them build their capacity to counter terrorism.  NATO will also continue to engage, as appropriate, with other international actors to ensure added value and complementarity. 21.         Terrorist organisations threaten the security of our populations, forces and territory.  They have expanded their networks, enhanced their capabilities and invested in new technologies to improve their reach and lethality.  We will continue to deter, defend and respond to threats and challenges posed by terrorist groups, based on a combination of prevention, protection and denial measures.  We have today tasked the Council in permanent session to update NATO’s Policy Guidelines and Action Plan on Counter-Terrorism, and reassess, in consultation with our regional partners, the areas where NATO can provide civil-military assistance to partners in this field.  Our approach to terrorism, and its causes, is in accordance with international law and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and upholds all relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions on the fight against terrorism. 22.         NATO’s southern neighbourhood, particularly the Middle East, North Africa and Sahel regions, faces interconnected security, demographic, economic, and political challenges.  These are aggravated by the impact of climate change, fragile institutions, health emergencies, and food insecurity.  This situation provides fertile ground for the proliferation of non-state armed groups, including terrorist organisations.  It also enables destabilising and coercive interference by strategic competitors.  Russia is fuelling tensions and instability across these regions.  Pervasive instability results in violence against civilians, including conflict-related sexual violence, as well as attacks against cultural property and environmental damage.  It contributes to forced displacement, fuelling human trafficking and irregular migration.  These trends pose serious transnational and humanitarian challenges and have a disproportionate impact on women, children, and minorities.  In response to the profound implications of these threats and challenges within and in the vicinity of the Euro-Atlantic area, we have today tasked the North Atlantic Council in permanent session to launch a comprehensive and deep reflection on existing and emerging threats and challenges, and opportunities for engagements with our partner nations, international organisations, and other relevant actors in the region, to be presented by our next Summit in 2024. 23.         The People’s Republic of China’s stated ambitions and coercive policies challenge our interests, security and values.  The PRC employs a broad range of political, economic, and military tools to increase its global footprint and project power, while remaining opaque about its strategy, intentions and military build-up.  The PRC’s malicious hybrid and cyber operations and its confrontational rhetoric and disinformation target Allies and harm Alliance security.  The PRC seeks to control key technological and industrial sectors, critical infrastructure, and strategic materials and supply chains.  It uses its economic leverage to create strategic dependencies and enhance its influence.  It strives to subvert the rules-based international order, including in the space, cyber and maritime domains. 24.         We remain open to constructive engagement with the PRC, including to build reciprocal transparency, with a view to safeguarding the Alliance’s security interests.  We are working together responsibly, as Allies, to address the systemic challenges posed by the PRC to Euro-Atlantic security and ensure NATO’s enduring ability to guarantee the defence and security of Allies.  We are boosting our shared awareness, enhancing our resilience and preparedness, and protecting against the PRC’s coercive tactics and efforts to divide the Alliance.  We will stand up for our shared values and the rules-based international order, including freedom of navigation. 25.         The deepening strategic partnership between the PRC and Russia and their mutually reinforcing attempts to undercut the rules-based international order run counter to our values and interests.  We call on the PRC to play a constructive role as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, to condemn Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, to abstain from supporting Russia’s war effort in any way, to cease amplifying Russia’s false narrative blaming Ukraine and NATO for Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, and to adhere to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter.  We particularly call on the PRC to act responsibly and refrain from providing any lethal aid to Russia. 26.         In 2014, at the Wales Summit Allied Heads of State and Government agreed the Defence Investment Pledge.  Since then Allies have made remarkable progress and all have increased their defence spending, developed further their forces and capabilities, and have contributed to Allied operations, missions and activities.  However, as the Strategic Concept sets out, our nations are now facing more profound security threats and challenges than at any time since the end of the Cold War. 27.         Consistent with our obligations under Article 3 of the Washington Treaty, we make an enduring commitment to invest at least 2% of our Gross Domestic Product (GDP) annually on defence.  We do so recognising more is needed urgently to sustainably meet our commitments as NATO Allies, including to fulfil longstanding major equipment requirements and the NATO Capability Targets, to resource NATO’s new defence plans and force model, as well as to contribute to NATO operations, missions and activities.  We affirm that in many cases, expenditure beyond 2% of GDP will be needed in order to remedy existing shortfalls and meet the requirements across all domains arising from a more contested security order.    28.         We commit to invest at least 20% of our defence budgets on major equipment, including related Research and Development.  We recognise this should be met in conjunction with a minimum of 2% of GDP annual defence expenditure.  We need to maintain our technological edge, and continue to modernise and reform our forces and capabilities, including through the integration of innovative technologies. 29.         We commit to contribute the necessary forces, capabilities and resources to the full range of NATO operations, missions and activities.  This includes meeting requirements for deterrence and defence, providing the forces needed to implement NATO’s defence plans and contribute to NATO crisis management operations.  Allies will ensure that our forces are ready and have the necessary personnel, equipment, training, spares, logistics, infrastructure, and stockpiles.  We commit to improve the interoperability of our national forces, including through transparent compliance with, and further development of, NATO standards and doctrines. 30.         To have the necessary capabilities, the Alliance requires a strong and capable defence industry, with resilient supply chains.  A strong defence industry across the Alliance, including a stronger defence industry in Europe and greater defence industrial cooperation within Europe and across the Atlantic, remains essential for delivering the required capabilities.  Furthermore, consistent with our commitments, obligations and processes, we will reduce and eliminate, as appropriate, obstacles to defence trade and investment among Allies. 31.         NATO is the foundation of our collective defence.  NATO’s key purpose and greatest responsibility is to ensure our collective defence, against all threats, from all directions.  NATO will continue to fulfil three core tasks: deterrence and defence; crisis prevention and management; and cooperative security.  These are complementary to ensure the collective defence and security of all Allies. 32.         Deterrence and defence are at the heart of the Alliance, underpinned by Article 5 of the Washington Treaty and an enduring transatlantic bond.  We are modernising NATO for a new era of collective defence.  We are united in our commitment and resolve to prevail against any aggressor and defend every inch of Allied territory. 33.         Guided by our sovereign decisions, and in response to the threats we face, we remain vigilant and stand together in solidarity ensuring a substantial and persistent presence of our military forces across the Alliance on land, in the air and at sea, in line with our 360-degree approach.  NATO’s deterrence and defence posture is based on an appropriate mix of nuclear, conventional and missile defence capabilities, complemented by space and cyber capabilities.  It is defensive, proportionate and fully in line with our international commitments.  We will employ military and non-military tools in a proportionate, coherent and integrated way to respond to all threats to our security in the manner, timing and in the domain of our choosing. 34.         In response to a radically changed security environment, we are strengthening NATO’s collective defence, against all threats, from all directions.  We cannot discount the possibility of an attack against Allies’ sovereignty and territorial integrity.  Since 2014, and in particular at the 2022 Madrid Summit, we have taken decisions to strengthen our posture and set a clear trajectory for accelerated military adaptation.  Today, we have agreed significant measures to further enhance NATO’s deterrence and defence posture in all domains, including strengthening forward defences and the Alliance’s ability to rapidly reinforce any Ally that comes under threat. We will fully implement these measures and deny any potential adversary any possible opportunities for aggression.  We have: 35.         We welcome the rapid progress towards the full integration of Finland into NATO’s deterrence and defence, and have agreed to complete this process as soon as possible. 36.         We need a robust and resilient defence industry able to sustainably meet the need of significantly strengthened collective defence. We have endorsed a Defence Production Action Plan, and its action items.  This Plan will ensure long-term NATO engagement across the Alliance based on the principles of transparency, equitable treatment and inclusive participation.  With this Plan, and in support of Allies’ own priorities, we are committed to leveraging the Alliance’s role as a convener, standard-setter, requirement setter and aggregator, and delivery enabler to promote sustainable defence industrial capacity.  This will be underpinned by a renewed and urgent focus on interoperability and improving materiel standardization to ensure that our forces can operate seamlessly together, with an initial focus on land munitions.  The Plan will ensure our understanding of defence industry across the Alliance, including small and medium-size enterprises, help aggregate demand to meet NATO’s capability targets, encourage multinational cooperation and more agile procurement, and enhance transparency with industry. 37.         Our robust military capabilities are critical for NATO’s deterrence and defence.  We continue to invest more in advanced and interoperable capabilities across all domains, placing particular emphasis on combat-capable, predominantly heavy, high-end forces and capabilities.  These will reflect the requirements of NATO’s defence plans and other tasks.  We will ensure that these capabilities are resourced to maintain the required high levels of readiness.  We continue to improve the deployability, interoperability, standardisation, responsiveness, force integration and support of our forces in order to conduct and sustain high-intensity operations, including crisis response operations, in demanding environments.  The NATO Defence Planning Process plays a key role in the sharing of risks and responsibilities, and we reaffirm our commitment to providing our respective shares of the capabilities required by the Alliance to fulfil our three core tasks.  Our capability development plans will ensure that we maintain our technological edge, recognising the challenges and opportunities presented by emerging and disruptive technologies, while ensuring their timely integration.  We have also decided to significantly increase our stockpiles of certain battle-decisive munitions. 38.         We will continue to strengthen and regularly exercise the Alliance’s ability to rapidly reinforce any Ally that comes under threat.  Exercises are a key way of demonstrating the Alliance’s resolve and capability.  We are adapting and streamlining our decision-making processes and improving the effectiveness of our alert and response system. 39.         We will individually and collectively deliver the full range of forces, capabilities, plans, resources, assets and infrastructure needed for deterrence and defence, including for high-intensity, multi-domain warfighting against nuclear-armed peer competitors.  Accordingly, we will strengthen training and exercises that simulate conventional and, for Allies concerned, a nuclear dimension of a crisis or conflict, facilitating greater coherence between conventional and nuclear components of NATO’s deterrence and defence posture across all domains and the entire spectrum of conflict. 40.         We have accelerated our efforts, both nationally and in NATO, to ensure the enablement of SACEUR’s Area of Responsibility, including logistics, and to improve our ability to support the reinforcement and sustainment of Allied forces into, across, and from the entire Alliance territory, including through prepositioning of ammunition and equipment.  As part of the enablement of SACEUR’s Area of Responsibility, we are taking forward our work on fuel supply distribution arrangements, as the timely provision of fuel to NATO’s military forces where required in Europe underpins the Alliance’s readiness and responsiveness.  We recognise that the changed security environment represents a more demanding challenge to the Alliance’s collective logistics and we will make political and military efforts to address this challenge, recognising that credible deterrence and defence relies on adequate logistics capability.  Effective military mobility is essential for enablement and further progress is required.  Efforts to ensure a coherent approach and synergies between NATO and the EU in the area of military mobility should be pursued. 41.         NATO Integrated Air and Missile Defence (IAMD) remains key for credible deterrence and defence, and the indivisible security and freedom of action of the Alliance, including NATO’s capability to reinforce, and to provide a strategic response.  NATO IAMD is an essential and continuous mission in peacetime, crisis, and times of conflict.  NATO IAMD incorporates all measures to contribute to deter any air and missile threat or to nullify or reduce their effectiveness.  This mission is conducted in a 360-degree approach, and tailored to address all air and missile threats emanating from all strategic directions from state and non-state actors. 42.         Allied IAMD deployments, including those on the Eastern flank in response to the Russian aggression against Ukraine, as well as exercises and training demonstrate Allied solidarity and resolve.  Based on the Strategic Concept, the new baseline for deterrence and defence posture agreed in Madrid in 2022, and the new generation of defence plans, NATO continues to strengthen its IAMD by improving IAMD readiness, responsiveness, effectiveness, and interoperability, as well as availability of airspace.  NATO and Allies continue to improve IAMD capabilities, such as surveillance, interceptors, and command and control.  We will continue to take into account the increasingly diverse and challenging air and missile threats ranging from simple Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to sophisticated hypersonic missiles. 43.         The fundamental purpose of NATO’s nuclear capability is to preserve peace, prevent coercion and deter aggression.  Nuclear weapons are unique.  As long as nuclear weapons exist, NATO will remain a nuclear alliance.  NATO’s goal is a safer world for all; we seek to create the security environment for a world without nuclear weapons.  The circumstances in which NATO might have to use nuclear weapons are extremely remote.  Any employment of nuclear weapons against NATO would fundamentally alter the nature of a conflict.  The Alliance has the capabilities and resolve to impose costs on an adversary that would be unacceptable and far outweigh the benefits that any adversary could hope to achieve. 44.         The strategic nuclear forces of the Alliance, particularly those of the United States, are the supreme guarantee of the security of the Alliance.  The independent strategic nuclear forces of the United Kingdom and France have a deterrent role of their own and contribute significantly to the overall security of the Alliance.  These Allies’ separate centres of decision-making contribute to deterrence by complicating the calculations of potential adversaries.  NATO’s nuclear deterrence posture also relies on the United States’ nuclear weapons forward-deployed in Europe.  National contributions, by Allies concerned, of dual-capable aircraft, as well as the provision of conventional forces and military capabilities in support of NATO’s nuclear deterrence mission, remain central to this effort. 45.         NATO will take all necessary steps to ensure the credibility, effectiveness, safety and security of the nuclear deterrent mission.  This includes continuing to modernise NATO’s nuclear capability and updating planning to increase flexibility and adaptability of the Alliance’s nuclear forces, while exercising strong political control at all times.  The Alliance reaffirms the imperative to ensure the broadest possible participation by Allies concerned in NATO’s nuclear burden-sharing arrangements to demonstrate Alliance unity and resolve. 46.         The Alliance is committed to ensuring greater integration and coherence of capabilities and activities across all domains and the spectrum of conflict, while reaffirming the unique and distinct role of nuclear deterrence.  NATO will continue to maintain credible deterrence, strengthen its strategic communications, enhance the effectiveness of its exercises and reduce strategic risks.  NATO is ready and able to deter aggression and manage escalation risks in a crisis that has a nuclear dimension. 47.         Missile defence can complement the role of nuclear weapons in deterrence; it cannot substitute them.  The aim and political principles of NATO Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) remain unchanged from the 2010 Lisbon Summit.  NATO BMD is purely defensive and is aimed at countering ballistic missile threats emanating from outside of the Euro-Atlantic area.  Allies remain committed to the full development of NATO BMD, to pursue the Alliance’s collective defence and to provide full coverage and protection for all NATO European populations, territory, and forces against the increasing threat posed by the proliferation of ballistic missiles. 48.         NATO BMD is based on voluntary national contributions, including the US European Phased Adaptive Approach assets in Romania, Türkiye, Spain, and Poland, as well as the NATO BMD command and control, the only component eligible for common funding.  Additional voluntary national contributions will provide robustness.  We are committed to completing additional essential components of NATO BMD command and control, which is necessary for achieving the next major milestone before reaching the Full Operational Capability. 49.         Strategic stability, delivered through effective deterrence and defence, arms control and disarmament, and meaningful and reciprocal political dialogue remains essential to our security.  Arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation strongly contribute to the Alliance’s objectives.  Allies’ efforts on arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation aim to reduce risk and enhance security, transparency, verification, and compliance.  We will pursue all elements of strategic risk reduction, including promoting confidence building and predictability through dialogue, increasing understanding, and establishing effective crisis management and prevention tools.  These efforts will take the prevailing security environment and the security of all Allies into account and complement the Alliance’s deterrence and defence posture.  We will make use of NATO as a platform for in-depth discussion and close consultations on arms control efforts.    50.         Arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation have made and should continue to make an essential contribution to achieving the Alliance’s security objectives and for ensuring strategic stability and our collective security.  NATO has a long track record of doing its part on disarmament and non-proliferation.  After the end of the Cold War, NATO dramatically reduced the number of nuclear weapons stationed in Europe and its reliance on nuclear weapons in NATO strategy.  Allies remain collectively determined to uphold and support existing disarmament, arms control, and non-proliferation agreements and commitments.  We will further strengthen arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation, as a key element of Euro-Atlantic security, taking into account the prevailing security environment and the security of all Allies. 51.         Russia’s violations and selective implementation of its arms control obligations and commitments have contributed to the deterioration of the broader security landscape.  We condemn Russia’s purported suspension of the New START treaty and failure to comply with its legally-binding obligations under the Treaty.  We call on Russia to return to full implementation of the Treaty as well as to act responsibly and engage constructively to reduce strategic and nuclear risks.  We also condemn Russia’s decision to withdraw from the landmark Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, which further demonstrates Russia’s continued disregard for arms control, and is the latest in a series of actions to undermine Euro-Atlantic security.  Allies urge Russia to implement its commitments and obligations, and to use the remaining time before its withdrawal to reconsider its decision.  Allies will continue to consult on the implications of Russia’s withdrawal from the CFE Treaty and its impact on the security of the Alliance. 52.         The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) remains the essential bulwark against the spread of nuclear weapons.  It is the cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime and disarmament architecture, the only credible path to nuclear disarmament, and the framework for international cooperation in sharing the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, science and technology.  Allies remain strongly committed to the full implementation of the NPT across its three pillars, including Article VI.  Russia blocking consensus at the Tenth NPT Review Conference was irresponsible.  We call on all NPT States Parties to work together to implement and strengthen the NPT in the current NPT Review Cycle.  We underline the urgent need to bring the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty into force.  We call for the immediate commencement and early conclusion of negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament of a treaty banning the production of fissile material for use in nuclear weapons or other explosive devices in accordance with Conference on Disarmament report CD/1299 and the mandate contained therein.  We call on all states that have not yet done so to declare and maintain voluntary moratoria on the production of fissile material for use in nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. 53.         NATO Allies support the ultimate goal of a world without nuclear weapons, in full accordance with all provisions of the NPT, achieved in an effective and verifiable way that promotes international stability and which is based on the principle of undiminished security for all.  NATO’s nuclear burden-sharing arrangements have always been fully consistent with the NPT. 54.         We reiterate that the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) stands in opposition to and is inconsistent and incompatible with the Alliance’s nuclear deterrence policy, is at odds with the existing non-proliferation and disarmament architecture, risks undermining the NPT, and does not take into account the current security environment.  The TPNW does not change the legal obligations on our countries with respect to nuclear weapons.  We do not accept any argument that the TPNW reflects or in any way contributes to the development of customary international law.   We call on our partners and all other countries to reflect realistically on the ban treaty’s impact on international peace and security, including on the NPT, and join us in working to improve collective security through tangible and verifiable measures that can reduce strategic risks and enable lasting progress on nuclear disarmament. 55.         The PRC is rapidly expanding and diversifying its nuclear arsenal with more warheads and a larger number of sophisticated delivery systems to establish a nuclear triad, while failing to engage in meaningful transparency or good faith efforts to achieve nuclear arms control or risk reduction.  We oppose any attempt to produce or support the production of plutonium for military programmes under the guise of civilian programmes, which undermines the objectives of the NPT.  We urge the PRC to engage in strategic risk reduction discussions and to promote stability through greater transparency with regard to its nuclear weapon policies, plans and capabilities. 56.         We reiterate our clear determination that Iran must never develop a nuclear weapon.  We remain deeply concerned about Iran’s escalation of its nuclear programme.  We call on Iran to fulfil its legal obligations under its Non-Proliferation Treaty-required safeguards agreement and political commitments regarding nuclear non-proliferation without further delay.  The fulfilment by Iran of these obligations and commitments is crucial to allow the IAEA to provide credible assurances of the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme. We also call on Iran to stop all ballistic missile activities inconsistent with UNSCR 2231. 57.         We condemn in the strongest terms the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s (DPRK) WMD and ballistic missile programmes which violate multiple UN Security Council Resolutions.  We reiterate that the DPRK must abandon its nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programmes, and any other weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programmes, in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner.  We urge the DPRK to return to, and fully comply with, the NPT and IAEA safeguards.  We call on the DPRK to accept the repeated offers of dialogue put forward by all parties concerned, including Japan, the United States, and the Republic of Korea. 58.         The potential use of Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) materials or weapons against NATO by hostile state and non-state actors remains a central and evolving threat to our security.  We are implementing NATO’s new CBRN defence policy, as agreed at the Madrid Summit, and are investing in the military capabilities required to effectively operate, fight and prevail in any environment, and to ensure our national and collective resilience against CBRN risks and threats. 59.         NATO safeguards the freedom and security of all its members using both political and military means.  The evolving security environment increasingly requires that NATO will take a structured and tailored approach that uses non-military and military tools in a deliberate, coherent, and sustained manner, throughout the full spectrum of peace, crisis and conflict.  NATO uses a variety of non-military tools which support the Alliance’s three core tasks.  It also continues to serve as a platform for enhancing the coherent use of these tools by Allies, under their own authority and control, and alongside other international actors.  We will continue to strengthen effective, clear, and convincing strategic communication. 60.         As the war in Europe has fundamentally shifted the nature of the Euro-Atlantic security environment, the emphasis on intelligence has become even more prominent and essential to Alliance decision-making and strategic planning.  The value of the NATO intelligence enterprise comes first and foremost from the Allied intelligence and security services working closely together to share intelligence and continue to ensure that the Alliance has a comprehensive understanding of the global strategic picture.  To that end, Allies’ intelligence capabilities will contribute to improving NATO’s understanding of the threats, risks and challenges, and to optimising our significant and diverse analysis capabilities.  We will strengthen our intelligence cooperation within the Alliance and with partners as appropriate.  NATO and Allies will enhance their security and counter-intelligence measures to respond effectively to hostile intelligence activity. 61.         National and collective resilience are an essential basis for credible deterrence and defence and the effective fulfilment of the Alliance’s core tasks, and vital in our efforts to safeguard our societies, our populations and our shared values.  Resilience is a national responsibility and a collective commitment rooted in Article 3 of the Washington Treaty.  Today we have agreed the 2023 Alliance Resilience Objectives.  We build on the 2021 Strengthened Resilience Commitment.  The Resilience Objectives will strengthen NATO and Allied preparedness against strategic shocks and disruptions.  They will boost our national and collective ability to ensure continuity of government and of essential services to our populations, and enable civil support to military operations, in peace, crisis and conflict.  Allies will use these objectives to guide the development of their national goals and implementation plans, consistent with their respective national risk profile.  We will also work towards identifying and mitigating strategic vulnerabilities and dependencies, including with respect to our critical infrastructure, supply chains and health systems.  Allies should also promote societal resilience.  As we strengthen our efforts to build resilience, we will continue to work with our partners engaged in similar efforts, in particular the European Union, in order to make the Euro-Atlantic area and our broader neighbourhood more secure.  The actions, commitments and legal obligations of individual Allies in other international bodies also contribute to enhancing our resilience. 62.         The Alliance’s ability to fulfil its core tasks increasingly relies on the adoption of digital technologies.  Recognising the urgency of a digitally-transformed Alliance, we have endorsed a Digital Transformation Implementation Strategy to underpin our ability to conduct Multi-Domain Operations, drive interoperability across all domains, enhance situational awareness, political consultation, and employ data-driven decision-making. 63.         Emerging and disruptive technologies (EDTs) bring both opportunities and risks.  They are altering the character of conflict, acquiring greater strategic importance and becoming key arenas of global competition.  The operational importance of EDTs as well as of access to and adaptation of commercial technologies in current operations have been highlighted in the context of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine.  NATO’s strategic competitors and potential adversaries are investing heavily in technologies that can be highly effective, particularly in malign hybrid activities, and decisive in conflict.  We are accelerating our own efforts to ensure that the Alliance maintains its technological edge in emerging and disruptive technologies to retain our interoperability and military edge, including through dual-use solutions.  We are working together to adopt and integrate new technologies, cooperate with the private sector, protect our innovation ecosystems, shape standards, and commit to principles of responsible use that reflect our democratic values and human rights.  We will ensure that we act in accordance with international law and seek to build public trust.  NATO’s Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic (DIANA) has now launched its first challenges to start-ups in NATO countries.  To further develop our transatlantic innovation ecosystem, the NATO Innovation Fund, the world’s first multi-sovereign venture capital fund, will begin to invest in deep-tech in the coming months.  Complementing the recently agreed strategies on Artificial Intelligence and Autonomy, NATO will develop further strategies for key emerging and disruptive technologies, including on Quantum Technologies and on Biotechnology and Human Enhancement to address the opportunities and risks they present.    64.         We continue to face growing hybrid threats and challenges from state and non-state actors, who use hybrid activities, including through interference and the harmful use of technologies, to target our political institutions, our critical infrastructure, our societies, our democratic systems, our economies, and the security of our citizens.  We remain united in defending our open and democratic societies against these malign activities.  We reiterate that hybrid operations against Allies could reach the level of an armed attack and could lead the Council to invoke Article 5 of the Washington Treaty.  We will continue to prepare for, deter, defend against and counter hybrid threats, including by potentially deploying Counter Hybrid Support Teams.  We continue to develop comprehensive preventive and response options and stand ready to apply them to enhance resilience and deter malign actors from engaging in hybrid operations.  Individual Allies may consider, when appropriate, attributing hybrid activities and responding in a coordinated manner, recognising attribution is a sovereign national prerogative.  We will continue to address disinformation and misinformation, including through positive and effective strategic communications.  We will also continue to support our partners as they strengthen their resilience in the face of hybrid challenges. 65.         The threat to critical undersea infrastructure is real and it is developing.  We are committed to identifying and mitigating strategic vulnerabilities and dependencies with respect to our critical infrastructure, and to prepare for, deter and defend against the coercive use of energy and other hybrid tactics by state and non-state actors.  Any deliberate attack against Allies’ critical infrastructure will be met with a united and determined response; this applies also to critical undersea infrastructure.  The protection of critical undersea infrastructure on Allies’ territory remains a national responsibility, as well as a collective commitment.  NATO stands ready to support Allies if and when requested.  We have agreed to establish NATO’s Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure within NATO’s Maritime Command (MARCOM).  We also agreed to set up a network that brings together NATO, Allies, private sector, and other relevant actors to improve information sharing and exchange best practice. 66.         Cyberspace is contested at all times as threat actors increasingly seek to destabilise the Alliance by employing malicious cyber activities and campaigns.  Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine has highlighted the extent to which cyber is a feature of modern conflict.  We are countering the substantial, continuous, and increasing cyber threats, including to our democratic systems and our critical infrastructure, as well as where they are part of hybrid campaigns.  We are determined to employ the full range of capabilities in order to deter, defend against and counter the full spectrum of cyber threats, including by considering collective responses.  A single or cumulative set of malicious cyber activities could reach the level of armed attack and could lead the North Atlantic Council to invoke Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, on a case-by-case basis.  We remain committed to act in accordance with international law, including the UN Charter, international humanitarian law, and international human rights law as applicable.  We continue to promote a free, open, peaceful, and secure cyberspace, and further pursue efforts to enhance stability and reduce the risk of conflict, by ensuring that international law is respected and by supporting voluntary norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace.  Today, we endorse a new concept to enhance the contribution of cyber defence to our overall deterrence and defence posture.  It will further integrate NATO’s three cyber defence levels – political, military, and technical – ensuring civil-military cooperation at all times through peacetime, crisis, and conflict, as well as engagement with the private sector, as appropriate.  Doing so will enhance our shared situational awareness.  Strengthening our cyber resilience is key to making our Alliance more secure and better able to mitigate the potential for significant harm from cyber threats.  Today we restate and enhance our Cyber Defence Pledge and have committed to ambitious new national goals to further strengthen our national cyber defences as a matter of priority, including critical infrastructures.  We have launched NATO’s new Virtual Cyber Incident Support Capability (VCISC) to support national mitigation efforts in response to significant malicious cyber activities.  This provides Allies with an additional tool for assistance.  We will further seek to develop mutually beneficial and effective partnerships as appropriate, including with partner countries, international organisations, industry, and academia, furthering our efforts to enhance international stability in cyberspace.  Complementing our existing exchanges, we will hold the first comprehensive NATO Cyber Defence Conference in Berlin this November, bringing together decision-makers across the political, military, and technical levels. 67.         Space plays a critical role for the security and prosperity of our nations.  Space is also an increasingly contested domain, marked by irresponsible behaviour, malicious activities, and the growth of counterspace capabilities by NATO’s potential adversaries and strategic competitors.  Maintaining secure use and unfettered access to space is key to effective deterrence and defence.  As part of our work on space as an operational domain, we are accelerating the integration of space into planning, exercising and executing joint and multi-domain operations in peacetime, crisis, and conflict in order to ensure space effects are coordinated across all domains.  We have committed to enhancing the sharing of our space data, products and services within NATO in support of the Alliance’s requirements and defence plans.  We welcome the ongoing efforts on the Alliance Persistent Surveillance from Space (APSS) multinational programme, which will improve NATO’s intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capacity.  We welcome the establishment of the NATO Space Centre of Excellence in France.  Allies are committed to upholding international law and we will continue to support international efforts to reduce space threats by promoting norms, rules, and principles of responsible space behaviours.  We reaffirm that hostile operations to, from, or within space could reach the level of armed attack and could lead the North Atlantic Council to invoke Article 5 of the Washington Treaty. 68.         Energy security plays an important role in our common security.  The energy crisis intentionally exacerbated by Russia has underlined the importance of a stable and reliable energy supply and the diversification of routes, suppliers, and sources.  We will continue to develop NATO’s capacity to support national authorities in protecting critical energy infrastructure.  We are committed to ensuring secure, resilient, and sustainable energy supplies to our military forces.  As we adapt our Alliance to the ongoing energy transition, we will ensure military capability, effectiveness and interoperability.  Allies are seeking and will continue to seek diversification of their energy supplies, in line with their needs and conditions. 69.         Climate change is a defining challenge with a profound impact on Allied security facing present and future generations.  It remains a threat multiplier.  NATO is committed to becoming the leading international organisation when it comes to understanding and adapting to the impact of climate change on security.  We will continue to address the impact of climate change on defence and security, including through the development of innovative strategic analysis tools.  We will integrate climate change considerations into all of NATO’s core tasks, adapt our infrastructure, military capabilities and technologies ensuring resilience to future operating environments.  To contribute to the mitigation of climate change, we are committed to significantly cutting greenhouse gas emissions by the NATO political and military structures and facilities; we will also contribute to combatting climate change by improving energy efficiency, transitioning to clean energy sources, and leveraging innovative next-generation clean technologies, while ensuring military effectiveness and a credible deterrence and defence posture.  We will continue to strengthen our exchanges with partner countries, the scientific community, as well as other international and regional organisations that are active on climate change and security.  We welcome the establishment of a NATO Centre of Excellence for Climate Change and Security in Montreal. 70.         We are committed to integrating the Human Security and the Women, Peace and Security agendas across all our core tasks.  We will continue to work towards fully operationalising this objective, through robust policies and clear operational guidelines, in order to enhance our operational effectiveness and ensure synergies between the civilian and military structures.  In doing so, we are working with partners, international organisations, and civil society.  We reaffirm our commitment to an ambitious human security agenda.  Our Human Security Approach and Guiding Principles allows us to develop a more comprehensive view of the human environment, contributing to lasting peace and security.  Today, we endorse a NATO Policy on Children and Armed Conflict, and an updated Policy on Combatting Trafficking in Human Beings.  Our ongoing work on human security also includes cultural property protection. 71.         We recognise the critical importance of women’s full, equal, and meaningful participation in all aspects of peace and stability, noting the disproportionate impact that conflict has on women and girls, including through conflict-related sexual violence.  We will consistently continue to implement our Policy on Women, Peace and Security, and, in this context, we will advance gender equality and integrate gender perspectives and foster the principles of the Women, Peace and Security agenda set out by the UN Security Council in all that we do, including in NATO operations, missions, activities, and our work on emerging challenges.  We will assess and update NATO’s Policy on Women, Peace and Security. 72.         NATO’s partnerships are, and will continue to be, essential to the way NATO works.  They play an important role in supporting NATO’s three core tasks and our 360-degree security approach.  We are grateful to our partners for their significant contributions to NATO’s situational awareness, operations, missions, and activities, including Trust Fund projects.  The current security environment highlights the significance of partnerships.  They are crucial to protect the global commons and enhance our resilience.  We will strengthen our ties with partners that share the Alliance’s values and interest in upholding the rules-based international order.  We will continue to strengthen political dialogue and practical cooperation with partners, based on mutual respect, benefit and interest of both Allies and partners.  This contributes to stability beyond our borders and enhances our security at home.  We will increase outreach to countries in our broader neighbourhood and across the globe and remain open to engagement with any country or organisation, when doing so could bolster our mutual security.  We remain committed to the principles underpinning our relations with our partners, and have taken steps to make our partnerships more strategic, more coherent and more effective.  We will discuss common approaches to global security challenges where NATO’s interests are affected, share perspectives through deeper political engagement, and seek concrete areas for cooperation to address shared security concerns.  In line with our Comprehensive Approach Action Plan, we will continue to pursue coherence within NATO’s own tools and strands of work, concerted approaches with partner nations and organisations such as the UN, the EU, and the OSCE, as well as further dialogue with non-governmental organisations. 73.         The European Union remains a unique and essential partner for NATO.  Our strategic partnership is essential for the security and prosperity of our nations and of the Euro-Atlantic area.  It is built on our shared values, our determination to tackle common challenges and our unequivocal commitment to promote and safeguard peace, freedom and prosperity.  NATO recognises the value of a stronger and more capable European defence that contributes positively to transatlantic and global security and is complementary to, and interoperable with NATO.  The development of coherent, complementary and interoperable defence capabilities, avoiding unnecessary duplication, is key in our joint efforts to make the Euro-Atlantic area safer.  Such efforts, including recent developments, will lead to a stronger NATO, help enhance our common security, contribute to transatlantic burden sharing, help deliver needed capabilities, and support an overall increase in defence spending.  Non-EU Allies continue to make significant contributions to the EU’s efforts to strengthen its capacities to address common security challenges.  For the strategic partnership between NATO and the EU, non-EU Allies’ fullest involvement in EU defence efforts is essential.  We look forward to mutual steps, representing tangible progress, in this area to support a strengthened strategic partnership.  We reaffirm in their entirety all the decisions, principles, and commitments with regard to NATO and EU cooperation.  We will continue to further strengthen this partnership in a spirit of full mutual openness, transparency, complementarity, and respect for the organisations’ different mandates, decision-making autonomy and institutional integrity, and as agreed by the two organisations. 74.         In the context of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, NATO-EU cooperation has become more significant.  We have unequivocally demonstrated unity of purpose and common resolve in leveraging our complementary, coherent and mutually reinforcing roles.  NATO and EU will continue to support Ukraine.  In this respect, we welcome the establishment of the dedicated NATO-EU Staff Coordination on Ukraine.  We have also achieved tangible results in strategic communications, including the fight against disinformation, countering hybrid and cyber threats, exercises, operational cooperation, defence capabilities, defence industry and research, counter-terrorism, and defence and security capacity building.  We are further expanding our cooperation on resilience, protection of critical infrastructure, emerging and disruptive technologies, space, security implications of climate change, and geostrategic competition.  We will also continue to address the systemic challenges posed by the PRC to Euro-Atlantic security.  Political dialogue between NATO and the EU remains essential to advance NATO-EU cooperation. 75.         The Western Balkans is a region of strategic importance for NATO as highlighted by our long history of cooperation and operations.  We remain strongly committed to the security and stability of the Western Balkans by supporting reforms that advance the respective NATO and EU aspirations of the countries in the region.  We will continue to enhance our political dialogue and practical cooperation in order to support reforms, regional peace and security, and counter malign influence, including disinformation, hybrid, and cyber threats, posed by both state and non-state actors.  The region requires continued attention and commitment from the Alliance and the international community to counter these challenges.  Democratic values, the rule of law, domestic reforms, and good neighbourly relations are vital for regional cooperation and Euro-Atlantic integration, and we look to continued progress in this regard.    76.         NATO strongly supports the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a stable and secure Bosnia and Herzegovina, in accordance with the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina and other relevant international agreements.  We encourage domestic reconciliation, and urge political leaders to refrain from divisive and secessionist rhetoric and actions.  We remain committed to the country’s Euro-Atlantic aspirations.  We continue to support reform efforts, including through the newly agreed Defence Capacity Building package, NATO HQ Sarajevo, and wide-ranging cooperative security and partnership tools, and through the country’s Reform Programme with NATO.  We encourage Bosnia and Herzegovina to take advantage of NATO’s support and intensify efforts to make progress on reforms in key areas, including the much-needed political, electoral, rule of law, economic, and defence reforms, without prejudice to a final decision on NATO membership. 77.         Strengthening NATO-Serbia relations would be of benefit to the Alliance, to Serbia, and to the whole region.  We look to Serbia to engage with NATO and its neighbours in a constructive manner, including in its public communications on the mutual benefits of NATO-Serbia cooperation.  We support the EU-facilitated Dialogue and other efforts aimed at the normalisation of relations between Belgrade and Pristina, and urge the sides to seize the moment and engage in good faith towards reaching a lasting political solution.  We call on both sides to immediately de-escalate, return to dialogue, and engage constructively in implementing the agreement on the path to normalisation between Belgrade and Pristina reached recently in Brussels and Ohrid. 78.         We remain committed to NATO’s continued engagement in Kosovo, including through the NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR).  KFOR will continue to provide a safe and secure environment and freedom of movement in Kosovo in line with UNSC Resolution 1244.  The recent escalatory actions are unacceptable and we condemn the violence in northern Kosovo as well as the unprovoked attacks that caused serious injuries to NATO soldiers.  We have increased KFOR’s troop presence to respond to the recurrent tensions.  Any changes to our force posture in KFOR will remain conditions-based and not calendar driven. 79.         The Black Sea region is of strategic importance for the Alliance. This is further highlighted by Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine. We underline our continued support to Allied regional efforts aimed at upholding security, safety, stability and freedom of navigation in the Black Sea region including, as appropriate, through the 1936 Montreux Convention. We will further monitor and assess developments in the region and enhance our situational awareness, with a particular focus on the threats to our security and potential opportunities for closer cooperation with our partners in the region, as appropriate. 80.         We reiterate our support to the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Georgia within its internationally recognised borders.  We stand firm in our support for Georgia’s right to decide its own future and foreign policy course free from outside interference.  We call on Russia to withdraw the forces it has stationed in Georgia without its consent.  We further call on Russia to reverse its recognition of the Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions of Georgia; to end the militarisation of these regions and continued attempts to forcibly separate them from the rest of Georgia through the construction of border-like obstacles; and to cease the human rights violations and abuses, including arbitrary detentions, and harassments of Georgian citizens.  We highly appreciate Georgia’s substantial contributions to NATO operations, which demonstrate its commitment and capability to contribute to Euro-Atlantic security.  We remain committed to making full use of the NATO-Georgia Commission and the Annual National Programme (ANP) in deepening political dialogue and practical cooperation with Georgia.  We reiterate the decision made at the 2008 Bucharest Summit that Georgia will become a member of the Alliance with the Membership Action Plan (MAP) as an integral part of the process; we reaffirm all elements of that decision, as well as subsequent decisions.  We welcome the progress made in implementing the enhanced Substantial NATO-Georgia Package, including Crisis Management, Cyber Security, Military Engineering, and Secure Communications, as well as new initiatives in the areas of Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Defence and Training Facilities.  To advance its Euro-Atlantic aspirations, Georgia must make progress on reforms, including key democratic reforms, and make best use of the ANP. 81.         We reiterate our support for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Republic of Moldova within its internationally recognised borders and call on Russia to withdraw all of its forces stationed in the Transnistrian region without Moldova’s consent.  We stand firm in our support for Moldova’s right to decide its own future and foreign policy course free from outside interference, and fully respect Moldova’s constitutional neutrality.  NATO is stepping up political and practical support to strengthen its resilience and uphold its political independence in light of the deteriorating security environment.  Allies welcome Moldova’s efforts to promote democratic reforms and are committed to supporting Moldova as it advances its European integration.  NATO will continue to provide practical assistance through the enhanced Defence Capacity Building Package, as Moldova works to strengthen its security and defence capabilities and modernise its Armed Forces. 82.         The Middle East and Africa are regions of strategic interest.  We will deepen our political engagements and public diplomacy outreach to our long-standing partners in the Mediterranean Dialogue and Istanbul Cooperation Initiative.  We will also increase our outreach to relevant regional organisations, including the African Union and the Gulf Cooperation Council.  We are implementing the Defence Capacity Building packages for Iraq, Jordan, Mauritania, and Tunisia.  We will also explore with the Jordanian authorities the possibility of establishing a NATO Liaison Office in Amman. 83.         NATO and Allies remain committed in our support to Iraq and its ability to stabilise the country.  We recognise the continued efforts and progress of the Government of Iraq and the Iraqi Security Forces to combat ISIS/Da’esh.  We encourage further progress in Iraq’s fight against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.  Our NATO Mission Iraq continues to deliver non-combat advisory and capacity building support to the Iraqi security institutions in the greater Baghdad area, and has deepened collaboration with Iraq’s Ministry of Defence.  Based on the request from the Iraqi government, we are considering broadening NATO Mission Iraq, by evolving it to provide advice to the Iraqi Ministry of Interior on its Federal Police.  NATO Mission Iraq will continue to be demand-driven, and will be carried out with the full consent of the Iraqi authorities, in full respect of Iraq’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and in close coordination with relevant partners and international actors. 84.         Iran’s support to the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine has an impact on Euro-Atlantic security.  We call upon Iran to cease its military support to Russia, in particular its transfer of Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) which have been used to attack critical infrastructure, causing widespread civilian casualties.  We express our serious concern over Iran’s malicious activities within Allied territory.  We also call upon Iran to refrain from destabilising actions, including seizures of maritime vessels, and to play a constructive role in fostering regional stability and peace. 85.         The Indo-Pacific is important for NATO, given that developments in that region can directly affect Euro-Atlantic security.  We welcome the contribution of our partners in the Asia-Pacific region – Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and the Republic of Korea – to security in the Euro-Atlantic, including their commitment to supporting Ukraine.  We will further strengthen our dialogue and cooperation to tackle our shared security challenges, including on cyber defence, technology and hybrid, underpinned by our shared commitment to upholding international law and the rules-based international order. 86.         NATO’s engagement with other international and regional organisations, including the United Nations, the OSCE, and the African Union, contributes to international security.  We will strengthen these interactions to advance our shared interests.  We are exploring the possibility of establishing a Liaison Office in Geneva to further strengthen our engagement with the United Nations and other relevant international organisations. 87.         We will ensure that our political decisions are adequately resourced. We will build on the progress made to ensure that increased national defence expenditures and NATO common funding will be commensurate with the challenges of a more contested security order. 88.         We pay tribute to all women and men who work tirelessly for our collective security, honour all those who have paid the ultimate price or have been wounded to keep us safe, and their families. 89.         NATO remains the strongest Alliance in history.  As in the past, we will stand the test of time in safeguarding the freedom and security of our Allies and contributing to peace and security. 90.         We express our appreciation for the generous hospitality extended to us by the Republic of Lithuania.  We look forward to meeting again for the Alliance’s 75th anniversary in Washington, D.C. in 2024, followed by a meeting in the Netherlands in 2025."
Nato membership for Ukraine a key question at Vilnius summit,"NATO membership of Ukraine, Sweden in focus at Vilnius summit",0.6146626094257395,2023-07-11,2023-07-10,"Out in a dense forest in central Ukraine, troops from a Ukrainian artillery battery are training before heading out to the front lines. For some it will be a return to the fight, for others it will be their first time - as they replace those who have been injured or killed. Firing at targets in a clearing with AK-47 rifles, they are careful to conserve ammunition. And it is not just training camps where supplies are low.""We have enough fighting spirit to win, of course. Unfortunately, we currently do not have enough weapons,"" Roman, their commander, tells me. ""The main thing is to have enough ammunition.""Out on the front lines they are having to economise, he explains. ""This is not a secret. The amount of ammunition that the enemy uses daily is at least five times higher than the amount of ammunition that we use.""Supplies from allies have been essential for Ukraine in this war. For Roman and other soldiers, the Nato summit in Vilnius is a crucial moment to ensure they have what they need to continue the fight.The widespread expectation is that new weapons will be promised at the summit, as well as more supplies of ammunition. The US decision to provide cluster munitions from existing stockpiles last week was partly to act as a stop-gap before new artillery supplies are ready. But viewed from Ukraine the summit is about much more than just weapons and ammunition - it is about what type of commitment the country will be offered when it comes to joining the alliance.Ukraine has been knocking at Nato's door for years. What it wants is more than just positive noises and a feeling of being left in a permanent waiting room.At the core of Nato is Article 5, which sets out that an attack on one member is an attack on all. This principle of collective defence could offer protection for Ukraine, but - almost everyone agrees - is very difficult to put in place when a country is already at war. ""We believe that it is long overdue to invite Ukraine to Nato,"" Oleg Nikolenko, a spokesperson for Ukraine's foreign affairs minister, says. ""An invitation to join Nato does not mean an immediate membership in Nato. We are cognizant of the fact that as long as the war goes on, Ukraine won't be able to join Nato. But we are talking about the invitation and setting the clear timeframe for this to happen.""The 2008 Nato summit in Bucharest casts a long shadow. Ukraine, along with Georgia, was told membership was on the cards in the future - but with no clear path and no expectation that it would be anytime soon. That angered Russia but without offering any protection in return. Georgia was attacked in 2008 by Russia, and Ukraine attacked too - first in 2014 and then in 2022. Many of those US officials involved in the decision in Bucharest now acknowledge it was a mistake.This time Ukraine wants greater clarity and concrete assurances. The exact nature and timetable of any commitment could have real consequences for the war. For instance, offering membership only when the war is over might encourage Russia to maintain a low level conflict to stall membership, some analysts argue. But there are existing Nato members who are cautious about offering too much to Ukraine now. They fear this could draw Nato closer to war with Russia. That is a view that is met with some annoyance in Ukraine.""Let's be honest: for a long time, Nato has been paying too much attention to whether Russia will allow them to do anything,"" Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the office of the President of Ukraine, told me when I visited his heavily guarded office in the centre of the capital. ""Nato must say unequivocally that there are no more preconditions for this related to Russian threats.""Ukrainians view membership as a way to end the war by deterring Russia rather than escalating it. They acknowledge, as US President Joe Biden has made clear in recent days, that Ukraine needs to make the reforms that any prospective member has to undertake. But they argue that Nato was set up to confront Moscow in the Cold War and yet it is now Ukraine which is effectively fighting on Nato's behalf, defending its eastern flank against Russia with its soldiers and civilians dying every day. For many in Kyiv, the focus by some inside the alliance on the risks of an invitation are a mistake. What, they ask, are the risks of not acting? In public, Ukrainian officials are careful to sound optimistic and not to enter into any discussion of the consequences if they receive only vague promises and looser ""security guarantees"". They do not want to sound ungrateful for the weapons and ammunition they still need right now. But privately officials worry that in the long term a failure to bring Ukraine into closer alignment with the West will be used by Moscow to push a narrative within the country that Ukraine has been let down and the West cannot be trusted. People could feel betrayed, one senior official told me.Without formal membership, the fear is the West could tire of supplying the weapons and ammunition Ukraine needs as the war grinds on. That is something Vladimir Putin and Russia is counting on. So in Kyiv do they worry about that? ""I have a counter question: what does it mean to be tired of supporting Ukraine?"" presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak remarks when I put that question to him. ""This means that democracy does not know how to defend itself. And that any authoritarian country, if it has a capacity to fight, will always win.""","Brussels, Belgium –The 31 leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) are set to convene for a two-day summit in Lithuania’s capital Vilnius this week. The military alliance members will seek to reaffirm their support for war-torn Ukraine on Tuesday and Wednesday, overcome differences over Sweden’s perspective NATO membership, and display a united stance against Russia’s aggression. “This week, at the NATO summit, we will strengthen our deterrence and defence, including with more investment. We will step up our support for Ukraine, and move Ukraine closer to NATO,” the military alliance’s Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters in Vilnius. “Lithuania seeks this summit to be remembered as the summit of decisions – not just declarations,” Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda said in a tweet on the eve of the summit. For Ukraine, a key decision after the Vilnius summit is to gain confirmation on its NATO membership. Kyivappliedto become a member of the alliance last September, seeking to fortify its borders with Russia. Since then, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, his officials – and Ukrainians within the country and around the world – have been lobbying NATO nations to speed up Kyiv’s accession process. But NATO members remain divided over the issue of offering Kyiv the alliance membership amid an ongoing war despite a broad consensus to signal strong support for Ukraine. Nations like the United States and Germany have displayed a restrictive stance towards the idea, compared to NATO’s Baltic members like Lithuania and Poland. In aninterview with broadcaster CNNover the weekend, US President Joe Biden said that Ukraine was still in the middle of a war with Russia, and if Kyiv became a NATO member, then it would drag the entire alliance into the battlefield – a sentiment shared by Germany, Turkey and some other NATO members. “For example, if you did that, then, you know – and I mean what I say – we’re determined to commit every inch of territory that is NATO territory. It’s a commitment that we’ve all made no matter what. If the war is going on, then we’re all in war. We’re at war with Russia, if that were the case,” Biden said. The US leader was referencing NATO’s cornerstone for collective defence – Article 5, which states that an armed attack against one NATO member is an armed attack against all. But a day before the onset of the summit, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in a tweet that “following intensive talks, NATO allies have reached consensus on removing MAP (Membership Action Plan) from Ukraine’s path to membership”. He welcomed this decision and said that it offers Ukraine clarity on becoming a NATO member. Following intensive talks, NATO allies have reached consensus on removing MAP from Ukraine's path to membership. I welcome this long-awaited decision that shortens our path to NATO. It is also the best moment to offer clarity on the invitation to Ukraine to become member. — Dmytro Kuleba (@DmytroKuleba)July 10, 2023  Moreover, on Friday, when Stoltenberg was asked whether NATO’s declaration regarding Kyiv’s Ukraine membership will be stronger than the alliance’s 2008 Bucharest Summit Declaration, when Ukraine and Georgia were promised a similar future in NATO, Stoltenberg said that there are differences this year. “One important difference is that Ukraine has come much closer to NATO, because NATO allies have worked closely with Ukraine for many years, especially since 2014. So, this has ensured a much higher level of cooperation and interoperability between Ukraine and NATO,” he said. Meanwhile, the Kremlin has said that Ukraine becoming a member of NATO would demand “a harsh response” from Russia.    But NATO chief Stoltenberg told reporters in Brussels on Friday that at the Vilnius summit, he expects the alliance to agree to a multiyear programme of assistance to Ukraine, in the face of threats from Russia. “We have already pledged 500 million euros [$548m] for critical needs, including fuel, medical supplies, de-mining equipment and pontoon bridges. We will also help build Ukraine’s security and defence sector, including with military hospitals. And we will help Ukraine transition from Soviet-era to NATO equipment and standards,” he said. He added that NATO will also upgrade its political ties with Kyiv by setting up a NATO-Ukraine Council, which Zelenskyy will inaugurate as a part of this week’s summit. According to Stoltenberg, the Council would act like a consultation mechanism between NATO members and Ukraine, whereby if Kyiv feels threatened, specific issues could be instantly discussed and decided by the Council, bringing Ukraine closer to the alliance. “The NATO-Ukraine Council is a step in the right direction for Kyiv because it will send quite a strong message not only to Ukrainians but also to the Russian President Vladimir Putin,” Harry Nedelcu, geopolitics director at Rasmussen Global and leader of its Ukraine Advisory Service, told Al Jazeera. “But at this summit, the serious debate with respect to Ukraine is going to be on providing Kyiv with more security guarantees in the interim period, until the country joins NATO. These guarantees would include enhancing Ukraine’s military capabilities, and also helping the country develop its own military industry to sustain itself,” Nedelcu added. So far, the US, Germany, the United Kingdom and other countries have said they would pledge to embolden Ukraine militarily in the face of Russian aggression. While strengthening and supporting Ukraine remains a key priority at the Vilnius summit, another pressing matter is Sweden’s future in NATO. Sweden and Finland applied to become NATO memberslast May. While Finland has joined, Turkey and Hungary have been holding up Sweden’s membership. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused Sweden of providing safe haven to members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and the Democratic Union Party (PYD) in Syria, both of which Ankara considers “terrorist” organisations. Erdogan also asked Sweden to lift an arms embargo on Turkey imposed in 2019 after Ankara’s incursion into northern Syria. He said these were important “security concerns” for Turkey that had to be resolved before he agreed to NATO’s enlargement.    While Sweden has passed an “anti-terrorism” law and lifted the arms embargo, the recent incident of theburning of the Quranin the country has once again angered Turkey, and Erdogan has repeatedly expressed that Stockholm has not done enough to quash Kurdish groups. Erdogan and Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson will meet in the presence of Stoltenberg before the Vilnius summit begins to resolve their differences. “A good scenario would be if in Vilnius, Erdogan says, ‘I am satisfied with the actions of the Swedish parliament and I am ready to put this in front of my Parliament’,” a senior NATO official told journalists in a press briefing before the summit. “There are more than 50 percent of chances that this happens, but let’s see,” he added. According to Bruno Lete, security and defence expert at the German Marshall Fund of the United States (GMF) in Brussels, from a technical perspective there is nothing that prevents Sweden from becoming a NATO member. “Sweden has one of the most performant armed forces in Europe. So, this is really a political problem,” he told Al Jazeera. “Turkey is using its veto on Swedish membership to pursue its self-interest. Turkey is interested in regaining access to the US F-16 jet fighter programme. The country was removed from the programme years ago after it decided to buy Russian S-400 systems despite warnings from Washington not to do so,” he said. “At this point, negotiations between Turkey and Sweden are still in a deadlock. But the real kingmaker here is the United States, which has decision-making power on pulling Turkey back into the jet fighter programme. The problem is that Washington is not so keen to do so,” Lette said, adding that once Turkey ratifies Sweden’s membership, Hungary will follow suit. In his interview with CNN, Biden acknowledged Turkey’s ambitions and said that Turkey is seeking to modernise its F-16 fleet, along with Greece. “And so, what I’m trying to, quite frankly, put together is a little bit of a consortium here, where we’re strengthening NATO in terms of military capacity of both Greece as well as Turkey, and allow Sweden to come in. But it’s in play. It’s not done,” Biden said. Prior to his departure to the Vilnius summit, Erdogan denied links between Sweden’s NATO membership and Ankara’s F-16 goal. But he said if Turkey became a member of the European Union, it would speed up Sweden’s NATO membership. In a press conference in Vilnius before the summit, Stoltenberg said he supported Turkey’s EU membership and highlighted that it is still possible that Sweden could join NATO at the summit.  Another key priority for the transatlantic military alliance is countering threats from China, an integral issue for leaders from Japan, Australia, New Zealand and South Korea who are also attending the summit. At the NATO summit last year in Spain’s capital Madrid, the alliance identified China as a “systemic challenge to Euro-Atlantic security” and has acknowledged Beijing’s “no-limits” partnership with Russia. But according to GMF’s Lete, while the leaders from Asia, Australia and New Zealand want NATO to weigh in further on China, the alliance’s goal to partner with these nations is merely for information exchange and situational awareness and is not a military partnership. “A recent proposal to increase the NATO presence in Asia by opening a representation office in Tokyo was actually blocked by France. The alliance focuses on addressing the Chinese strategic threat here locally in Europe, not by expanding its presence in Asia,” he said. “I believe NATO is well equipped to deal with external threats and the rapidly changing world order,” Lete said. “Its core mission to defend Europe and bind both sides of the Atlantic is more relevant than ever. But in my opinion, the biggest challenge NATO will need to deal with in the future emerges from the inside.”"
Russia hikes interest rates to 12% as rouble falls,Russia’s central bank hikes rates to 12 percent to halt rouble’s slide,0.6121928885720698,2023-08-15,2023-08-15,"Russia has hiked interest rates to 12% after the rouble fell to its lowest value in 16 months.The currency fell past 100 per dollar on Monday, prompting Russia's central bank to hold an emergency meeting.The Bank of Russia said it decided to raise interest rates from 8.5% to curb inflation, which hit 4.4% in August.Pressure has been mounting on the Russian economy due to imports rising faster than exports and military spending growing for the Ukraine war.""Steady growth in domestic demand surpassing the capacity to expand output amplifies the underlying inflationary pressure and has impact on the rouble's exchange rate dynamics through elevated demand for imports,"" the Bank of Russia said in a statement.The bank said ""inflationary pressure"" was building, but that its target was to bring inflation, which is the rate prices rise at, down to 4% by 2024.Russia has been targeted with sanctions by Western countries following its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.The rouble plummeted after war first broke out, but was bolstered by capital controls and oil and gas exports.However, it has lost about a quarter of its value overall against the US dollar since Ukraine was invaded and this week more than 100 roubles was needed to buy one dollar.On Tuesday, the currency recovered slightly to 98 roubles to the dollar, but it remains much weaker than it was last year.It is not the first time the Bank of Russia has been aggressive with interest rate hikes. When Russia first attacked Ukraine the bank raised rates from 9.5% to 20%, but began cutting them shortly afterwards.But the latest hike will only have a temporary impact, according to Liam Peach, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.""Russia will struggle to attract capital inflows because of sanctions,"" he said.Analysts have said a major factor in the rouble weakening has been Russia's trade, and therefore its economy, being hit by Western sanctions.Since the outbreak of war, many EU countries which relied on Russian oil and gas have pledged to wean themselves off imports from the country and find alternative suppliers.EU leaders introduced a price cap plan to limit the amount Russia earns from its oil exports and the country has also been excluded from Swift, an international payment system used by thousands of financial institutions.","Russia’s central bank has hiked its key interest rate by 350 basis points to 12 percent, an emergency move to try and halt the rouble’s recent slide after a public call from the Kremlin for tighter monetary policy. The extraordinary rate meeting came on Tuesday after the rouble plummeted past the 100 threshold against the US dollar on Monday, dragged down by the effects of Western sanctions on Russia’s balance of trade and as military spending soars. The rouble pared gains after the decision to stand 0.3 percent weaker at 98.00 by 08:37 GMT, but still significantly above lows near 102 on Monday which had not been hit since the early weeks after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s economic adviser Maxim Oreshkin on Monday rebuked the central bank, blaming what he called its soft monetary policy for weakening the rouble.    Hours after Oreshkin’s words, the bank announced the emergency meeting, throwing the currency a lifeline. “Inflationary pressure is building up,” the bank said in a statement on Tuesday. “The decision is aimed at limiting price stability risks. “The pass-through of the rouble’s depreciation to prices is gaining momentum and inflation expectations are on the rise.” Central bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina has won plaudits for her handling of the economy since Russia began what it calls a “special military operation” in Ukraine, but the plunging rouble and high inflation have put her on the back foot, especially among pro-war nationalists. The Kremlin’s public criticism of her monetary policy adds further pressure as Russia heads towards a presidential election in March 2024, with consumers battling rising prices for basic goods. “While such a depreciation risks boosting inflation, it is also the signal it sends out to the Russian public about the costs of the invasion of Ukraine,” said Stuart Cole, chief macroeconomist at Equiti Capital in London. “As such, today’s decision will likely have had an element of politics behind it as well as economics.” The bank last made an emergency rate hike in late February 2022 with a rate raise to 20 percent in the immediate fallout of Russia’s despatching troops to Ukraine. The bank then steadily lowered the cost of borrowing to 7.5 percent as strong inflation pressure eased in the second half of 2022. Since its last cut in September 2022, the bank had held rates but steadily increased its hawkish rhetoric, eventually hiking by 100 basis points to 8.5 percent at its last scheduled meeting in July. The next rate decision is due on September 15. Russia saw double-digit inflation in 2022 and after a deceleration in the spring of 2023 due to that high base effect, annual inflation is now above the central bank’s 4 percent target once more and quickening. In annualised terms on a seasonally adjusted basis, current price growth over the last three months amounted to 7.6 percent on average, the bank said. The bank removed its signal that it was ready to raise rates further, said Sovcombank chief analyst Mikhail Vasilyev, interpreting that as a sign that rates have peaked. “We believe that the key rate will remain at the current 12 percent level until the end of the year,” Vasilyev said. Russia’s widening budget deficit and stark labour shortages have contributed to rising inflationary pressure this year, but the rouble’s rapid slide from about 70 against the US dollar at the start of the year to more than 100 on Monday has pushed the central bank to act. The bank, which blames the rouble’s slide on Russia’s shrinking current account surplus – down 85 percent year on year in January-July – has already tried to limit the rouble’s decline. Last week, it halted the finance ministry’s FX purchases to try to reduce volatility, a step that effectively saw Russia abandon its budget rule. Analysts widely agreed that those measures alone were too minimal in scope to significantly support the currency. “Today’s rate hike will only temporarily slow the bleeding,” said Liam Peach, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics in London. “Russia will struggle to attract capital inflows because of sanctions,” he said. “And there’s little ammunition for FX intervention – the central bank has some unfrozen renminbi assets and gold reserves, but the bar for using these is likely to be high.”"
Ukraine war: Two people killed in Zaporizhzhia attack,"At least two killed in Russian attack on Zaporizhzhia city, Ukraine says",0.6085787984585123,2023-08-09,2023-08-09,"Two people have been killed in a Russian attack on the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine's Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said.Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky shared footage showing smoke rising and a partially damaged church with fire in its courtyard at the scene.The wounded were being treated by medics, a regional official said.The attack comes after Russia said it shot down two Ukrainian drone attacks earlier in the day.Zaporizhzhia is a Ukrainian city on the Dnipro River. It lies some 44km (27 miles) from the war's front line.Initially, President Zelensky reported on Telegram that three people had died as a result of the attack. But later, Mr Klymenko revised the death toll down to two, saying that one person had been resuscitated.Zaporizhzhia region's head, Yuriy Malashko said Russia had hit a ""church and retail outlets"" in the city's Shevchenkivskyi district.Mr Zelensky sent his condolences to the families affected in a statement posted to Twitter and said Russia would be held accountable for the strike. The Zaporizhzhia region has come under attack throughout the war, including one deadly missile strike on a maternity unit in November 2022. The region is also home to Europe's largest nuclear power plant, which is currently occupied by Russian troops.","At least two people have been killed and several others wounded in a Russian rocket attack on the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, which is near Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, Ukrainian officials said. A rescue operation was under way, Ukrainian President Volodymyr said on Wednesday, without providing additional information about the attack. Regional governor Yuriy Malashko initially said three people died in the attack on a residential area, but Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko later said two people died and one other person had been resuscitated. A video posted by Zelenskyy showed smoke billowing from burning and badly damaged buildings next to a church. Zaporizhzhia, an important city on the Dnipro River, lies some 44 kilometres (27 miles) from the front line.    The number of victims could rise in the attack, which damaged a residential area, Malashko said on Telegram. Earlier, Zaporizhzhia city council’s secretary, Anatoliy Kurtev, said that Russia had hit a residential area of the city. The city lies about 50km (30 miles) northeast of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which has been occupied by Russian forces since the early weeks of the war. Shelling in the plant’s surroundings has raised persistent fears of a nuclear accident. Meanwhile in Russia, an explosion on the grounds of a factory that makes optical equipment for Russia’s security forces north of Moscow killed one person, wounded 60 others and left at least eight people unaccounted for, officials said. Wednesday’s blast occurred in the Russian town of Sergiyev Posad, some 50km (30 miles) northeast of Moscow, local authorities said. Andrei Vorobyov, governor of the Moscow region, said the premises had been rented by a private firm, and that a criminal investigation had been opened into possible violations of safety procedures. He said 38 apartment blocks in the surrounding area had been damaged, along with two schools, a sports complex and a store. Russia’s TASS news agency quoted emergency services as dismissing early reports that the blast could have been caused by a drone attack, many of which have taken place in Moscow and the surrounding area in recent weeks and months, attributed by Russia to Ukraine. Footage posted on social media showed a huge column of smoke rising above the town. TASS reported that a major rescue operation involving more than 150 people was under way, citing the Emergencies Ministry as saying it had sent its lead units, “Tsentrospas” and “Leader”, to the site of the blast. Russian agencies quoted local authorities as saying a state of emergency had been declared in the area."
Ukraine says it has uncovered major arms corruption,Ukraine says it uncovers $40m arms corruption scheme,0.596555754042842,2024-01-28,2024-01-28,"Ukraine's security service says it has uncovered corruption in an arms purchase by the military worth about $40m (Â£31m).The SBU said five senior people in the defence ministry and at an arms supplier were being investigated.  It said the defence officials signed a contract for 100,000 mortar shells in August 2022.Payment was made in advance, with some funds transferred abroad, but no arms were ever provided.Corruption has been a major stumbling block in Ukraine's bid to join the European Union.The SBU said an investigation had ""exposed"" officials of the ministry of defence and managers of arms supplier Lviv Arsenal, ""who stole nearly 1.5 billion hryvnias in the purchase of shells"".""According to the investigation, former and current high-ranking officials of the Ministry of Defence and heads of affiliated companies are involved in the embezzlement,"" it said. The SBU said that despite the contract for the shells having being agreed six months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, ""not a single artillery shell"" was ever sent.One of the suspects was detained while attempting to leave Ukraine and is currently in custody, the SBU said. Ukraine's prosecutor general says the stolen funds have been seized and will be returned to the defence budget.Issues surrounding corruption have dogged Ukraine for years. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky cited the fight against corruption as one of his main priorities when he came to power in 2019.The latest allegations come as Republicans in the United States push back on President Joe Biden's efforts to send more aid to Ukraine.In August, President Zelensky fired all the officials in charge of military recruitment to end a system in which some people were being allowed to escape conscription.Ukraine was ranked 116th out of 180 countries in a 2022 corruption perceptions index by campaigning and research organisation Transparency International.But anti-corruption efforts are beginning to make a difference. It is one of only 10 countries steadily climbing Transparency International's ranking, rising 28 places in a decade.","Employees from a Ukrainian arms firm conspired with Ministry of Defence officials to embezzle almost $40m earmarked to buy 100,000 mortar shells for the war with Russia, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has reported. The SBU said late Saturday that five people have been charged, with one person detained while trying to cross the Ukrainian border. If found guilty, they face up to 12 years in prison. The announcement, which was confirmed by Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence, will have a deep impact on a country beleaguered byRussia’s nearly two-year-old invasion. The SBU said an investigation had “exposed officials of the Ministry of Defence and managers of arms supplier Lviv Arsenal, who stole nearly 1.5 billion hryvnias [$40m] in the purchase of shells.” “According to the investigation, former and current high-ranking officials of the Ministry of Defence and heads of affiliated companies are involved in the embezzlement,” the SBU said. The deal involved the purchase of 100,000 mortar shells for the military, with a contract secured in August 2022 and payment made in advance. But no arms were ever provided, the SBU statement said, with some funds then moved to other foreign accounts.    Five people have been given “notices of suspicion” – the first stage in Ukrainian legal proceedings – both in the ministry and the arms supplier, according to the security service’s statement. One suspect, the SBU said, was detained while trying to cross the Ukrainian border. Officials accused of participating in the scheme include the current and former heads of the defence ministry’s Department of Military and Technical Policy, Development of Armaments and Military Equipment, as well as the head of Lviv Arsenal. According to Ukraine’s prosecutor general, the stolen funds have been seized and will be returned to the defence budget. Corruption within Kyiv’s military has been a thorny issue both as it tries to maintain wartime public morale and present itscase to join the European Union. Last September, Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov was dismissed amid various corruption cases. The announcement came as Russia launched drone and missile attacks hitting both civilian and critical infrastructure across Ukraine, Kyiv’s Air Force said on Sunday. The Air Force said Moscow attacked the central Poltava region with two ballistic missiles fired from its Iskander ballistic missile system. It also launched three surface-to-air missiles over the Donetsk region in the east. In the southeast Zaporizhia region, Governor Yuri Malashko said an infrastructure site had been hit in a drone attack. Filip Pronin, governor of the Poltava region, wrote on Telegram that the attack there hit an industrial site in the city of Kremenchuk, igniting a fire. There were no preliminary reports of casualties, Kyiv said.   "
Ukraine war: Seven killed in Russian missile strike on eastern town of Pokrovsk,"At least 8 killed in Russian missile attack in Pokrovsk, eastern Ukraine",0.5904563205180191,2023-08-08,2023-08-07,"At least seven people have been killed in a Russian missile attack on residential buildings in the eastern Ukrainian town of Pokrovsk, officials say. Two missiles hit the town - the second as rescuers were searching for victims of the first.Dozens of people were injured, including police officers and rescuers. Two children were among more than 30 civilians who were hurt. Rescue efforts are continuing. Pokrovsk lies about 70km (43 miles) north-west of Donetsk city, which is occupied by Russian forces. Before the war it had a population of around 60,000 people.Pavlo Krylenko, the head of the Donetsk region, said the first strike killed five civilians, and that an official from the emergency services was killed in the second strike. A person who works in the military also died. He added that the buildings which were ""destroyed and damaged"" were ""high-rise buildings, private houses, administrative buildings, catering establishments [and] a hotel"".""Russia is a terrorist state. And she must be punished for her crimes!"" he added in a post on Telegram.According to other Ukrainian officials, the second missile struck 40 minutes after the first, killing and wounding rescuers as they searched for survivors in the ruins of what Mr Zelensky described as an ""ordinary residential building"".He publishing a video of a five-storey building that had its top floor destroyed. Amid scenes of general chaos and confusion it showed civilians clearing away rubble, and rescuers helping people into ambulances.A day after the strikes, Russia claimed that its forces had also hit a Ukrainian military command post in Pokrovsk. Ukraine offered no comment on Tuesday's reported strike.Kateryna, a resident who who was injured in the first attack, told the Reuters news agency she was at home when the missile struck.""The flame filled up my eyes. I fell down on the floor, on the ground. My eyes (hurt) a lot, otherwise I am ok, just the shrapnel in my neck."" Andriy Yermak, head of Ukraine's Presidential Office, said at least two civilians were also killed when Russian guided bombs hit ""private houses"" in the Kharkiv Region on Monday evening. Five people were injured in those strikes, he said. James Waterhouse, Ukraine correspondentWe were in Pokrovsk in May reporting on the thousands of people returning there to live close to the front line. They continue to ignore warnings from local authorities to stay away because of the real risks. The sights of rescue teams sifting through rubble are a reminder of how enduring those hazards are. It is a town constantly on a war footing, where civilians mingle with soldiers. Our team have stayed in the Hotel Druzbha and eaten in the mafia-themed Corleone restaurant.Both are prominent hubs in this eastern community. Both are now gutted from the impact of a Russian missile. The attacks came a day after a Russian ""guided bomb"" hit a blood transfusion centre in north-eastern Ukraine, killing two people, according to Ukrainian officials. Ukraine has been trying to regain territory occupied by Russia but has made modest gains since launching a counter-offensive two months ago.On Sunday Mr Zelensky sought to justify attacks on Russian ships in the Black Sea, telling Argentine newspaper La Nacion that Ukraine ""has to find another method to end the blockade of our water"".""If Russia continues to dominate its territory in the Black Sea and blockading, firing missiles, then Ukraine will do the same, which is a fair protection of our chances,"" he said. Russia withdrew from a deal allowing the export of Ukrainian grain and warned ships in the Black Sea they could face military action, prompting Ukraine to issue a similar declaration.Last week, a Russian tanker with 11 crew members was hit by what Moscow said was a Ukrainian attack in the Black Sea. Although Ukraine did not comment publicly, a security service source told the BBC a sea drone had been used.That followed a similar sea drone attack on a Russian naval ship near the Russian port of Novorossiysk, which is a major hub for Russian exports.Naval drones, or sea drones, are small, unmanned vessels which operate on or below the water's surface. Research by BBC Verify suggests Ukraine has carried out several attacks with sea drones. ","At least eight people have been killed and 31 others wounded after two Russian missiles hit residential buildings in the eastern Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region, Ukrainian officials said. Videos and pictures released by Ukrainian authorities on Monday showed people sorting through the rubble including at a badly damaged five-storey apartment building. An ambulance was on the scene treating the wounded. Donetsk regional Governor Pavlo Kyrylenko reported that eight people were killed in the attacks, including five civilians, two rescue workers and one member of the military, according to the Reuters news agency. Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said earlier that four civilians died in the first attack and an emergency official was killed during the second attack. Search-and-rescue operations were ongoing, Klymenko said. Ten members of the Ukrainian security services were among the 31 wounded, most of whom were civilians, officials said. The strikes damaged a hotel, residential buildings and other civilian structures, Kyrylenko said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in an online statement, accused Russia of trying to leave nothing but “broken and scorched stones” in eastern Ukraine. His remarks accompanied footage of a damaged, five-storey residential building with one floor partially destroyed. Pokrovsk had a pre-war population of about 60,000 people.    The deadly attack came just a day after officials from about 40 countries gathered in Saudi Arabia to work on a peace settlement for the war in Ukraine. Russia’s foreign ministry on Monday denounced the two-day talks in Jeddah as not having “the slightest added value” because Moscow – unlike Kyiv – had not been invited. A foreign ministry statement repeated previous assurances that Moscow is open to a diplomatic solution, on its terms, that would end the 17-month-old war and that it is ready to respond to serious proposals. The Kremlin’s demands include Kyiv recognising Russia’s annexation of four Ukrainian regions, which Russian forces at this point only partially control, and Crimea, which Moscow seized in 2014. But Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy, ruled out Moscow’s previous demands, which would give Russia time to dig in deeper in the parts of Ukraine it has occupied. He said on X, formerly known as Twitter, that Russian forces must fully withdraw from the occupied areas and there would be no compromise by Kyiv on that. Meanwhile, the Security Service of Ukraine announced on Monday that it had detained analleged Russian informantwho gathered intelligence about Zelenskyy’s trip to the southern Mykolaiv region last month. It claimed the woman “was collecting data for an air attack during Zelenskyy’s visit”.  The woman attempted to establish Zelenskyy’s route, times and visits in the region. She was detained when she tried to pass the information to the Russians, the statement said, without providing evidence. Zelenskyy has been a prime target for the Kremlin since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, when he refused to leave Kyiv as Moscow’s forces approached. He has since played a key role in rallying public morale, including via a nightly video address, and has become a recognisable face across the world as he presses allies and others to help Ukraine. Also on Monday, Russian shelling struck a nine-storey residential building in the city of Kherson, killing one person and wounding four others, according to regional Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. He said Kherson had endured a “tough night” as the Russians “covered the central part of the city with fire”. A 57-year-old woman was also killed and four people wounded in the Russian shelling of a village in the northeastern Kharkiv province, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said."
Ukraine claims Crimea landing for 'special operation' on Independence Day,Ukraine says troops landed on Crimea in ‘special operation’,0.5788450810868867,2023-08-24,2023-08-24,"Ukraine has claimed its troops briefly landed overnight in the occupied Crimea peninsula, as the country marks 32 years of its independence. All objectives of the ""special operation"" were achieved without any casualties, the defence ministry said.It added that during a firefight in Olenivka and Mayak, western Crimea, ""the enemy suffered losses"". Russia illegally annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, eight years before Moscow launched a full-scale invasion.The Kremlin has so far made no public comments on the reported Ukrainian operation. In a post on Telegram, the main intelligence department of Ukraine's defence ministry claimed responsibility for Thursday's operation. It said the Ukrainian Navy provided the support. It said that ""special units on watercraft landed on the shore"" before engaging in combat with Russian troops stationed in the area.""Also, the state flag was flying again in the Ukrainian Crimea,"" the statement added.The intelligence department posted a short video purportedly showing Ukrainian soldiers raising the national flag. Gunfire sounds can be heard in the footage. Ukraine's Suspilne television channel reported that the skirmish involved aircraft and navy ships. A Russian Telegram channel had also reported of fighting in that area.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky released an Independence Day message on X, formerly known as Twitter, rallying his countrymen to help maintain the country's independence. ""In this fight, everyone counts. Because the fight is for something that is important to everyone,"" Mr Zelensky said.Independence Day has gained increased significance among Ukrainians since Russia's full-scale invasion started in February 2022, according to a poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology. It is now the country's third most important holiday, behind only Easter and Christmas.Ukraine launched its counter-offensive in June, attempting to expel the Russians from land they had captured in the east and south of the country.An analysis by BBC Verify showed the gains in terms of reclaimed land size have been small.However, analysts at the US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) say the advances near Robotyne and Urozhaine are ""likely tactically significant because of the structure of Russian defensive lines"". They also note that Russian forces have dedicated significant effort to hold the settlements.Russia has also accused Ukraine of drone attacks, the most recent of which was on 23 August. It hit a skyscraper under construction in Moscow.Ukraine's claim of landing its troops in Crimea came a day after it emerged that Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of the mercenary group that fought with Russia in the war, was on the passenger list of a private jet that crashed after taking off from Moscow. Mr Prigozhin had led a failed mutiny against Russian President Vladimir Putin in June.","Ukraine’s navy and military intelligence carried out a “special operation” overnight with units landing in Crimea, officials have said. A short and brief video posted on Thursday, along with a statement by the Defence Ministry intelligence service (HUR), showed a small motorboat moving through the water at night near a coastline. The alleged landing came at a poignant moment, with Ukraine celebrating its independence from the Soviet Union on Thursday, August 24. The intelligence service said the landing point was on the western tip of the Crimean Peninsula. “Special units on watercraft landed on the shore in the area of the Olenivka and Mayak settlements,” HUR said. It added that “all goals” had been achieved and that casualties had been inflicted, but did not specify the aims of the operation. “The enemy suffered losses among personnel, [and] enemy equipment was destroyed,” HUR said, noting that the “state flag flew again in the Ukrainian Crimea”. If confirmed, the operation would mark a rare demonstration that Ukrainian forces can stage acts on the ground in Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. The reports come a day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowed to end Russia’s occupation of Crimea. During a speech at an international conference on Crimea in Kyiv, Zelenskyy said Crimea will be “de-occupied like all other parts of Ukraine that are unfortunately still under the occupier”. Last month, Moscow accused Ukraine of attacking the Russian-built Crimean bridge, which has been closed due to multiple incidents, including an explosion in July 2023. Zelenskyy said that once Crimea was back under Ukrainian control, it would be part of Ukraine’s economy and, therefore, the global economy. “Today we are taking the first such economic step. We are signing the first document with companies that are ready to enter Crimea following Ukraine,” he said. On Wednesday, Ukraine’s military also reported deliberately luring a Russian military pilot to land his Mi-8 helicopter at a Ukrainian airfield. Ukraine has launched multiple attacks on the Russian-annexed peninsula since the start of Moscow’s invasion in February 2022, and refers to the area as “temporarily occupied”. But Russia has shown no sign of abandoning Crimea, which it has used as a platform to launch missile strikes on Ukrainian targets. Moscow says a referendum held after Russian forces seized the peninsula showed Crimeans want to be part of Russia, a claim vehemently denied by Ukraine and much of the international community."

Mr Putin gave Mr Kim a glove from a spacesuit ""that had been in space several times"" and a Russian-made rifle. Mr Kim gave Mr Putin a North Korean-made gun, among other gifts.Mr Putin returned to Moscow after the summit, but Mr Kim's visit would continue for several days, Mr Peskov added without elaborating further.  The North Korean leader was expected to oversee a display of Russian warships, as well as visit several factories and stop by the eastern city of Vladivostok on his way home.Wednesday's meeting between the two sanctioned regimes took place at a time when their relations with the West are at an all-time low.The two leaders discussed military matters and the war in Ukraine during the summit - which Mr Kim appeared to express support for.""Russia has risen to a sacred fight to protect its sovereignty and security against the hegemonic forces"" of the West, Mr Kim said, telling Mr Putin he would ""always support"" his decisions.Mr Putin also said he would help Pyongyang develop satellites, drawing concern in the US that Russian help with satellite technology would improve the North Korean missile programme.""That is quite troubling and would potentially be in violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions"" which Russia itself had voted for in the past, US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said on Wednesday.Mr Putin appeared to acknowledge this, saying there were ""there are certain limitations"" to military co-operation.The US has also warned that it would ""not hesitate to take action"" if North Korea provides weapons to Russia, to which the Kremlin had said that the interests of Russia and North Korea were important to them ""and not warnings from Washington"".","Russian President Vladimir Putin has accepted an invitation from Kim Jong Un to visit North Korea after the two leaders held their first face-to-face summit in four years. Kim is in Russia’s far east as Putin looks to reinforce alliances amid Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine, and as the North Korean leader continues to advance his country’s military modernisation. He extended the invitation to Putin at “a convenient time” at a reception to mark the end of a day where the two held more than four hours of talks andtouredthe Vostochny Cosmodrome space centre. “Putin accepted the invitation with pleasure and reaffirmed his will to invariably carry forward the history and tradition of the Russia-DPRK friendship,” North Korean state news agency KCNA said on Thursday, using the acronym for the country’s official name. The talks in Russia have raisedconcernin the United States and elsewhere that Kim might be prepared to sell arms to Moscow for itswar in Ukraine, perhaps in exchange for technology that would further his military ambitions.    The North Korean leader is also expected to visit an aircraft factory and travel to Vladivostok where he will view Russia’s Pacific fleet. Kim’s delegation includes his defence minister, his top military commander and the director of the country’s munitions department. Leif-Eric Easley, professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, said the members of Kim’s delegation, as well as the location for the summit, were “quite telling” even though no joint statement was issued. “The composition of Kim’s delegation suggests North Korea may send munitions to Russia in exchange for military technology. Meeting at Russia’s eastern spaceport was equivalent to Putin thumbing his nose at UN Security Council Resolutions,” Easley said in emailed comments. “This should be a wake-up call to all other UN member states about the need to redouble efforts at enforcing sanctions on Pyongyang.” In its report, KCNA said the two leaders agreed to further strengthen strategic and tactical cooperation in the face of the “military threats, provocations and tyranny of imperialists”. Putin, meanwhile, praised the “strengthening of cooperation and friendship between our countries” and told reporters he saw “possibilities” for military cooperation with North Korea. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, who was aguest of honourat events to mark the 70th anniversary of the armistice that ended the fighting in the 1950-53 Korean War, in Pyongyang in July, was also involved in the talks. The Russian leader said earlier that Moscow could help Pyongyang build satellites – Kim has argued a spy satellite is crucial for North Korea’s weapons development but its two attempts this year to put one into orbit have both ended infailure. Some analysts suggested North Korea might want to try using a Russian space launch vehicle for the satellite and work with Russia to build a more powerful piece of equipment. “It’s possible that North Korea pushes to participate in the production process of the satellite, rather than just acquiring a finished product, to set up a natural transfer of technologies,” Yang Uk, a military expert at South Korea’s Asian Institute for Policy Studies, told the Associated Press news agency. Just before Putin and Kim met, North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles, the latest in a series of launches in breach of United Nations sanctions that prohibit such activities. US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said it was “troubling” that Russia was talking about cooperation with North Korea on programmes that potentially would violate UN Security Council resolutions. South Korea’s unification minister, Kim Young-ho, who is in charge of relations with Pyongyang, expressed “deep concerns” over military cooperation and possible arms deals, saying the two countries were apparently continuing to pursue “some kind of” a military deal. “We once again urge Russia and North Korea to halt illicit acts that cause their isolation and regression, and follow international rules including the Security Council resolutions,” the minister told reporters on Thursday. Japan’s newly-appointed Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa also warned against “violations” of UN resolutions. The resolutions – passed with Russian support – ban the development of technology that could be used in North Korea’s ballistic missile programmes. They also prohibit any scientific and technical cooperation with North Korea in nuclear science and technology, aerospace and aeronautical engineering and technology, or advanced manufacturing production techniques and methods."
Bi-2: Russia anti-war band arrested in Thailand faces deportation,Russian rock band critical of Ukraine war faces deportation from Thailand,0.5754128258350922,2024-01-30,2024-01-31,"A Russian-Belarusian rock band with anti-war views that had been touring Thailand is under threat of being deported back to Russia, activists say.Human Rights Watch has urged the Thai government not to deport Bi-2, who have been criticised by Moscow, saying the seven members face persecution.The band was arrested for unauthorised shows while touring Phuket, a resort island that hosts hundreds of thousands of Russian tourists. They are in detention in Bangkok.But Thai authorities are yet to comment on the case publicly or respond to the BBC's questions. A statement on the band's official Facebook page said they were facing deportation after being found guilty on 26 January of performing a gig without the correct permit. It said they had paid a fine for the breach.But some of their supporters responded to the post, alleging the band had been targeted: ""Russian authorities found an excuse to detain them.""The band says in their statement: ""outside pressure played a significant role in our detention. We know that the reason for this pressure is [retaliation] for our creativity, our views, our position.""The band has also alleged that they could not understand the legal process with Thai police and courts, having not been provided adequate translation services. Of the band's seven members, some are dual citizens of Australia and Israel, so they could be deported to those countries. But activists warn that at least two members  only have Russian citizenship and could be sent back there.Russian authorities are yet to comment on the band's situation and have not said if they sought their deportation.But the band has been singled out by Russian lawmakers before for their ""anti-Russian stance"". In May 2023, Russia's justice ministry labelled the frontman Yegor Bortnik a ""foreign agent"" for ""opposing"" Russia's invasion of Ukraine and ""making negative statements"" about Russia, its citizens and authorities.The band had been touring outside Russia since 2022, including playing shows across Europe last year.""They've been inconvenient for [the] Russian government for a while because they are a very big band and they are very obviously anti-war and anti-Putin. So they moved out of the country a while ago,"" a friend of one of the band members, Marjana Semkina, wrote on Facebook. Thailand and, in particular, its desirable island holiday spots such as Phuket have seen a huge influx of Russian tourists since the war began in Ukraine two years ago. Many Russians have fled the country to avoid conscription. By some estimates, nearly half a million Russians arrived in Phuket in the first half of 2023. ""If Thai authorities send them [Bi-2] back to Russia to face danger and persecution, it would be the first case under [Prime Minister] Sretta's government,"" Human Rights Watch's senior researcher Sunai Pasuk told the BBC.""The Thai PM promised that his government will adhere to the principle of human rights so this is a crucial test."" It would also be the first case of the Thai administration forcibly returning a Russian national to Russia since the war began.And it would be a breach of Thai domestic law preventing torture and enforced disappearances, as well as Thailand's obligations under international laws against torture. Bangkok is a signatory to the UN Convention against torture, meaning it has an obligation not to return people to places where they face the risk of persecution.With additional reporting by Thanyarat Doksone","Members of a dissident Russian-Belarusian rock band critical of Moscow’s war in Ukraine have been jailed in Thailand, with growing calls to not deport them to Russia. Progressive rock group Bi-2’s members remained locked up on Wednesday after being detained for performing without work permits in Thailand. The group has spoken out againstRussia’s invasion of Ukraineand Russian President Vladimir Putin. The group was detained last week after it played a gig in Phuket, a southern Thai island popular with foreign tourists including many Russians. Human Rights Watch (HRW) said Bi-2 will face “persecution” if returned to Russia, and referred to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson accusing the band of “sponsoring terrorism”. A post on the seven-member band’s official Telegram channel on Wednesday said singer Yegor Bortnik, known by his stage name Lyova, had left Thailand. “Lyova Bi-2 flew to Israel, the rest of the group members are still in a migration prison in a cramped cell for 80 people,” the post read. The detained musicians “include Russian citizens as well as dual nationals of Russia and other countries, including Israel and Australia,” HRW said in a statement on Tuesday. Those holding only Russian citizenship are thought to be most at risk. Thai officials confirmed the band’s arrest last week and said they now face possible deportation. “This usually results in deportation to their country of origin but there is some discretion [about the destination],” said Kriangkrai Ariyaying, the superintendent of Phuket’s Immigration Bureau. The country’s National Security Council “is looking into the matter, seeing what are details including the band members’ names and nationalities,” Foreign Minister Parnpree Bahiddha-Nukara told reporters on Wednesday. VPI Event, which organises concerts in Thailand, said all the necessary permits were obtained, but the band had been given tourist visas in error. “Typically, in such cases, migration services contact the organiser of the event to apply appropriate sanctions. But in this case, the attention of the migration services was focused exclusively on the artists,” VPI said, adding that the Russian consulate had attempted to cancel Bi-2’s concerts in December. HRW said Thailand has an international legal obligation to not forcibly return anyone who faces the threat of torture if returned. “Under no circumstances should they be deported to Russia, where they could face arrest or worse for their outspoken criticisms” of Putin and the war, said Elaine Pearson, HRW’s Asia director. HRW also said that “amid repression in Russia reaching new heights, Russian authorities have used transnational repression – abuses committed against nationals beyond a government’s jurisdiction – to target activists and government critics abroad with violence and other unlawful actions”. Bi-2 is popular in Russia. Several of its concerts were cancelled in 2022 after the band refused to play at a venue with banners supporting the war in Ukraine, following which the group left Russia. One of the band’s founders has openly denounced the Putin government, saying it makes him feel “only disgust” and accusing the leader of having “destroyed” Russia. Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya urged Thailand to “find a solution” to the band’s visa issue. I'm worried about the 🇹🇭 situation involving the Belarus-born rock band Bi-2. It's now absolutely clear that Russia is behind the operation to deport the band. I urge the Royal Thai Government & democratic nations to find a solution to ensure the freedom of these brave musicians.pic.twitter.com/IJeQApQxbm — Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya (@Tsihanouskaya)January 30, 2024  “I’m worried about the situation involving the Belarus-born rock band Bi-2,” she wrote on X. “It’s now absolutely clear that Russia is behind the operation to deport the band.” Bi-2 has more than one million subscribers to its YouTube channel and 376,000 monthly listeners on Spotify."
Ukraine war: US to arm Kyiv with depleted uranium tank shells,Russia blasts ‘inhumanity’ of US sending depleted uranium shells to Ukraine,0.5723170609172636,2023-09-07,2023-09-07,"The US has announced it will send controversial weapons to Ukraine as part of more than $1bn (Â£800m) in military and humanitarian aid.Russia condemned the move to equip US Abrams tanks with shells strong enough to pierce conventional tank armour.They are made of depleted uranium - a by-product of uranium enrichment stripped of most radioactive material.Overnight, suspected Ukrainian drone attacks were reported on the Russian city of Rostov-on-Don and near Moscow.Unconfirmed video showed what appeared to be a blast in central Rostov where, according to Governor Vasily Golubev, one person was lightly injured and several cars were damaged. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said a drone that targeted the town of Ramenskoye had also been shot down and no damage reported.The announcement of a new security package for Ukraine came during top US diplomat Antony Blinken's visit to Kyiv, prompting an angry Russian response.The 120mm uranium tank rounds - included in $175m of US military equipment for Ukraine - are for M1 Abrams tanks due to be delivered to Ukraine later this year. The rounds are made of depleted uranium, a waste product from the process of enriching naturally occurring uranium for nuclear fuel or weapons. It cannot generate a nuclear reaction and is considered ""considerably less radioactive than natural uranium"", according to the International Atomic Energy Agency.Depleted uranium can be used to reinforce armour-plating on tanks but is favoured for weapons because of its extreme density and ability to pierce conventional tank armour.These types of shells sharpen on impact, which further increases their ability to bore through armour, and they ignite after contact. Russia also reacted angrily when the UK announced in March it was sending depleted uranium shells to Ukraine for its Challenger 2 tanks.When President Vladimir Putin described the weapons as having a ""nuclear component"", the UK Ministry of Defence said it had used depleted uranium in its armour-piercing shells for decades and accused Moscow of deliberately spreading misinformation.The UN Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation has found no significant poisoning is caused by exposure to depleted uranium but a 2022 UN Environment Programme (UNEP) report said it was concerned about potential health issues arising from its use in Ukraine.""The chemical toxicity of depleted uranium is considered a more significant issue than the possible impacts of its radioactivity,"" it said.The US decision is a U-turn from March when the Pentagon said it would not be sending any depleted uranium munitions to Ukraine. A Department of Defense official told the Politico news website the US had now decided to send the weapons because they were thought to be the best way of arming Abrams tanks in Ukraine.National Security Council spokesman John Kirby has described them as ""a commonplace type of munition"".  The US will also provide anti-armour systems, tactical air navigation systems and additional ammunition for Himars missiles.""This new assistance will help sustain it and build further momentum,"" Mr Blinken said. The Russian embassy in Washington denounced the decision as ""an indicator of inhumanity"", adding that the US was ""deluding itself by refusing to accept the failure of the Ukrainian military's so-called counter-offensive"". Since June, Ukraine's territorial gains in the counter-offensive have been very small, but Ukrainian generals claim they have breached Russia's formidable first line of defences in the south.On Wednesday, 16 people, including a child, were killed in an attack on the city of Kostyantynivka, in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky blamed Moscow for the attack but Russia is yet to comment. ","Russia has denounced as inhuman a plan by the United States to provide the Ukrainian military with ammunition containing depleted uranium. The Pentagon said on Wednesday that the controversial arms for US-made Abrams tanks would be part of a new military package worth up to $175m, out of more than$1bn in civilian and defence supportthat US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced during a visit in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. “The administration’s decision to supply weapons with depleted uranium is an indicator of inhumanity,” Russia’s embassy in Washington said on the Telegram messaging app following the announcement. “Clearly, with its idea of inflicting a ‘strategic defeat’, Washington is prepared to fight not only to the last Ukrainian but also to do away with entire generations,” the embassy said. “The US is deliberately transferring weapons with indiscriminate effects,” it added. “It is fully aware of the consequences: explosions of such munitions result in the formation of a moving radioactive cloud. Small particles of uranium settle in the respiratory tract, lungs, esophagus, accumulate in kidneys and liver, cause cancer and lead to the inhibition of the whole organism’s functions.” Along with the depleted uranium shells for tanks that the US plans to deliver to Ukraine, the new military assistance package includes Javelin anti-tank missiles, tactical air navigation systems and additional ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), according to the Pentagon. While theUnited Kingdom sent depleted uranium munitionsto Ukraine earlier this year, this will be the first US shipment to Ukraine of the controversial armour-piercing shells and it is set to stir controversy over the use of such weapons on the battlefield. The US was widely criticised recently forsending cluster bombs to Ukraine, despite concerns over the dangers such weapons pose to civilians.    The use of depleted uranium shells is not banned under international law. But their use has been fiercely debated, with opponents such as the International Coalition to Ban Uranium Weapons saying there aredangerous health risks from ingesting or inhaling depleted uranium dust, including cancers and birth defects. Uranium is an extremely dense metal – about 1.7 times more dense than lead – and is so hard that it does not change shape when it hits a target. A by-product of uranium enrichment, depleted uranium ammunition can easily punch through armour plating and self-ignite in a searing cloud of dust and metal. US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said on Wednesday that the ammunition is not radioactive and “not anywhere close to going into” the sphere of nuclear weaponry. “This is a commonplace type of munition that is used particularly for its armour-piercing capabilities,” he said. Following the UK’s provision of depleted uranium ammunition in March,Russian President Vladimir Putin warnedthat Moscow would “respond accordingly”, and accused the West of deploying weapons with a “nuclear component”.    Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also said at the time that the munitions were “a step towards accelerating escalation”. Putin announced that Russia would respond to the UK by stationing tactical nuclear weapons in neighbouring Belarus – the first outside Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union. Blinken said on Wednesday that the latest assistance to Kyiv would ensure that Ukraine “has what it needs” to succeed in its ongoing counteroffensive against Russian forces, and also strengthen Ukraine’s longer-term defence capabilities. “Certainly, we see the important progress that’s being made now in the counteroffensive, and that’s very, very encouraging,” Blinken told Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv. The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington, DC-based think tank, said on Wednesday that Ukraine’s military continued to report advances against Russia’s front lines in the counteroffensive, particularly around the city of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region and Robotyne in the Zaporizhia region."
Belgorod raid: Insurgents defeated after rare cross-border incursion - Russia,Russia claims 70 attackers killed in cross-border Belgorod raid,0.5679384077616428,2023-05-23,2023-05-24,"Armed insurgents who crossed the border from Ukraine to launch attacks in Russia's Belgorod region have been defeated, Moscow claims.Villages near the border were evacuated after coming under shellfire in one of the most significant cross-border raids since the start of Russia's invasion.Russia says 70 attackers were killed and insists the fighters are Ukrainian.But Kyiv has denied involvement and two Russian paramilitary groups have said they were behind the incursion.Monday's raid led Moscow to declare a counter-terrorism operation, giving the authorities special powers to clamp down on communications and people's movements. The measures were only lifted on Tuesday afternoon, and even then, one of the paramilitary groups was claiming it still controlled a ""small, but our own piece of the Motherland"".The claims by the warring sides have not been independently verified, but any assaults on Russian soil make Nato leaders nervous, and the development could prove a mixed blessing for Kyiv. Russia's defence ministry said a ""unit of the Ukrainian nationalist formation"" invaded its territory and was responsible for heavy shelling on the Kozinka checkpoint and other parts of the nearby area.As well as killing dozens of what it described as ""Ukrainian terrorists"" in artillery and air strikes, the ministry claimed to have driven the rest of the fighters back to the Ukrainian border.But Ukrainian officials said the attackers were Russians, from groups known as the Liberty of Russia Legion and the Russian Volunteer Corps (RVC).""These are Russian patriots who want to change the political regime in the country,"" Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar told Ukrainian TV.The Liberty of Russia Legion said on Twitter on Monday it had ""completely liberated"" the border town of Kozinka and that its units had reached as far as the town of Grayvoron, further east.The group said it was continuing to free the Belgorod region and Russian armed forces could not oppose it.Separately, on Tuesday afternoon the RVC posted a video of its fighters moving towards what looked like a border check-point, saying it still controlled a ""small... piece of the homeland"".Both of the paramilitary groups also told Ukraine's public broadcaster Suspilne that they were creating ""a demilitarised zone on the border with the Russian Federation from which they will not be able to shell Ukraine"".The cross-border incursion may be embarrassing for Moscow, and go some way to offset the bad optics for Ukraine of reportedly losing control of Bakhmut after months of intense and bloody fighting.It is also likely to be part of Ukraine's shaping operations ahead of its coming counter-offensive, aiming to draw Russian troops away from the south where Kyiv is expected to attack.But it is not a development that is likely to welcomed by the West.The long-range weapons they have provided to Kyiv, although not used in this attack, still come with the proviso they are not to be used to hit targets inside Russia.Despite official denials from Kyiv, it is hard to believe this raid was launched without assistance from Ukrainian military intelligence.It plays into the Kremlin narrative that Russia's own sovereign security is under attack from malign forces backed by the West. It is a narrative likely to be fuelled by reports that some of those who took part are linked to far right extremism, reinforcing Moscow's claim that its trying to rid Ukraine of Neo-Nazis.Belgorod's governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said several people had been injured in the fighting, including two civilians who were being evacuated from their homes. Mr Gladkov said that people in several villages had been evacuated and warned those who had fled their homes not to return yet, as Russian forces carried out what he described as a ""mopping-up"" operation. He added that air defences had shot down drones overnight, damaging buildings. Temporary shelters have been set up in the Grayvoronsky district for some 9,300 people who have been displaced, according to local authorities. The BBC has verified that a building used by Russia's main security agency, the FSB, was among those hit. It is not clear what caused the damage. ","Russia has said more than 70 attackers were killed in its operation to repel cross-border raiders who entered the country’s Belgorod region from Ukraine and battled with Russian forces for an estimated 24 hours before retreating from Russian territory. Russia said it had deployed jets and artillery on Tuesday to destroy the armed groups that penetrated the border region in the most audacious attack on Russian territory since Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine last year. Authorities said 13 people were injured by artillery and mortar fire during the fighting and that a woman died during evacuations on Monday. A second civilian was reported killed in the village of Kozinka. Nine border villages were evacuated during the fighting, according to Russian officials. “In total, more than 70 militants, four armoured vehicles and five pickups were destroyed. Today, the [counter-terrorist operation] has been cancelled in the Belgorod region,” Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported on Wednesday, referring to the attackers as a “Ukrainian sabotage and reconnaissance group”.    Russia’s defence ministry spokesman, Igor Konashenkov, said local troops, air strikes and artillery hadrouted the attackersand what remained of the force was pushed “back to the territory of Ukraine, where they continued to be hit by fire until they were completely eliminated”. Members of two anti-Kremlin groups, the Freedom of Russia Legion and the Russian Volunteer Corps (RVC), claimed responsibility while Kyiv denied any involvement with the raid. “We are not waging war on foreign territories,” Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Ganna Malyar said on Tuesday. In a video purportedly released by the Freedom of Russia Legion on Monday, a camouflaged spokesman, surrounded by armed men in fatigues, said: “Russia will be free!” – a slogan frequently used by Russian opposition activists.    Little is known about the two groups or their ties with the Ukrainian military. The RVC was founded last August and reportedly consists mostly of anti-Putin far-right Russian fighters who have links with Ukrainian far-right groups. Moscow-based journalist Yulia Shapovalova told Al Jazeera that the Kremlin believe all the attackers were “Ukrainian militants”. Belgorod in southwest Russia is located about 80km (45 miles) north of the city of Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine. The region is known for hosting Russian military assets, including fuel and ammunition depots. Belgorod was included in Russian President Vladimir Putin’s order last year to increase the state of readiness for attacks and improve defences. Similar to Russia’s neighbouring Bryansk region and other border areas, Belgorod haswitnessed sporadic spilloverfrom the war in Ukraine. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov refused to say on Tuesday how many attackers were involved in the assault or comment on why efforts to put down the attackers took so long. The governor of the Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said the raid targeted the rural area around Graivoron, a town about 5km (3 miles) from the border. The regional governor complained in a video late on Tuesday that federal authorities’ claims for the past year that “everything is under control” did not ring true in light of the cross-border incursion and earlier attacks. He appealed again to the Kremlin to strengthen defences in the region. Russia’s military reaction to the raid – described by the Institute for the Study of War as a “very small and localised undertaking” – was “highly disproportionate” to the scale of the attack, the Washington DC-based think tank said. “Russian forces should not have required significant reinforcements – or the involvement of a colonel general – to repulse a raid conducted by reportedly 13 armoured vehicles,” the ISW said on Wednesday. The#Russianreaction to the raid in the information space and in the reported military activities appears to be a highly disproportionate response to a very small and localized undertaking. 2/2https://t.co/ujMqJTaBZipic.twitter.com/BTbqLfYPAq — ISW (@TheStudyofWar)May 24, 2023  On Wednesday, Gladkov reported on his Telegram channel that a drone had dropped an explosive device on a road in Belgorod damaging a car, though no one was injured in the attack, according to initial information. A Russian bomb squad and emergency workers were at the scene of the attack, Russia TASS news agency reported, citing the governor’s Telegram channel. In a separate post, the governor reported that a drone had been shot down over Belgorod, though it was unknown if that drone was responsible for the attack on the road or if it was a different drone, TASS reported. The Russian news portal RBK, quoting unidentified sources in Russia’s regional interior ministry and territorial police, said that during the cross-border incursion, Graivoron came under heavy shelling that lasted about five hours early on Monday. After that, tanks fired at the Graivoron border checkpoint while the adjacent village of Kozinka came under mortar and rocket fire, RBK said, citing the same sources. The attacking force was made up of 10 armoured vehicles and an unspecified number of troops, RBK said. Gladkov also reported that fire from the Ukrainian side of the border on Tuesday hit the Borisovka area, about 20km (20 miles) northeast of Graivoron. No casualties were reported, he said without elaborating on the incident. The attack on Russia’s Belgorod comes ahead of a widely expected Ukrainian offensive and Russia reinforcing hundreds of kilometres of front lines with tank barriers, trenches and troops. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited Ukrainian troops on the front line in the eastern region of Donetsk on Tuesday, where Russian forces have concentrated their efforts to capture territory. “Every day on the battlefield, Ukrainian marines prove that they are a powerful force that destroys the enemy, liberates Ukrainian land and performs the most difficult tasks in the most difficult conditions,” Zelenskyy said, announcing the creation of a Ukrainian marine corps.

Ukraine dam: Thousands flee floods after dam collapse near Nova Kakhovka,"Ukraine, Russia trade blame for destruction of Nova Kakhovka dam",0.5655646882368498,2023-06-07,2023-06-06,"Thousands of people are being evacuated downstream of a major dam which has collapsed in Russian-held Ukraine.President Volodymyr Zelensky said 80 towns and villages may be flooded after the destruction of the dam at Nova Kakhovka, which he blamed on Russia.Water is surging down the Dnipro river, and is said to pose a catastrophic flooding risk to the city of Kherson. Russia has denied destroying the dam - which it controls - instead blaming Ukrainian shelling.Neither Ukraine nor Russia's claim has been verified by the BBC.The Kakhovka dam, downstream from the huge Kakhovka reservoir, is crucial to the region.It provides water to farmers and residents, as well as to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. It is also a vital channel carrying water south to Russian-occupied Crimea.Ukraine's state-owned hydropower plants administrator Ukrhydroenergo warned that the peak of a water spill downstream from the emptying reservoir was expected on Wednesday morning.It said this would be followed by a period of ""stabilisation"", with the water expected to rapidly recede in four to five days.There are concerns about the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant - Europe's largest - which uses reservoir water for cooling. The situation there is said to be under control and there is ""no immediate nuclear safety risk"" for the plant, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).Video footage shows a torrent of floodwater gushing through a breach in the dam. Several towns are already flooded, while people in areas further downstream have been forced to flee by bus and train.Abound 40,000 people need to be evacuated, Deputy Prosecutor-General Viktoriya Lytvynova said on Ukrainian television - 17,000 people in Ukraine-controlled territory west of the Dnipro River and 25,000 on the Russian-controlled east.Also speaking on Ukrainian television, Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said about 1,000 people had been evacuated so far and 24 settlements had been flooded.He accused Russia of shelling the southern region of Kherson, from where people were being evacuated, and issued a warning about the dangers posed by mines being exposed by the rising water levels.One local resident Andriy, who lives close to the dam - which was seized by Russian forces shortly after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022 - said he believed Russia wanted to ""drown"" his city.In the Ukraine-controlled city of Kherson, a woman called Lyudmyla - who was loading her belongings including a washing machine onto a trailer that was attached to an old car - said: ""We're afraid of flooding. We're taking our things a little higher up.""She called for Russian forces to be ""kicked out of here... they're shooting at us. They're flooding us or doing something else"".Another resident of the city, Serhiy, said he feared ""everything is going to die here"". ""All the living creatures, and people will be flooded out,"" he said, gesturing at nearby houses and gardens.On the Russian-seized riverbank of Nova Kakhovka, the Moscow-installed mayor Vladimir Leontyev said the city was underwater and 900 people had been evacuated.He said 53 evacuation buses were being sent by the authorities to take people from the city and two other settlements nearby to safety.Water levels had risen to over 11m (36ft) and some residents had been taken to hospital, he added.The small town of Oleshky was also heavily flooded, Kremlin-appointed officials said. The Kazkova Dibrova zoo on the Russian-held riverbank had been completely flooded and all 300 animals were dead, it said in a post on its Facebook page.It is not yet clear what caused the breach in the dam in the early hours of Tuesday, but Ukraine's military intelligence has accused Russia of deliberately blowing it up.This seems plausible, as Moscow may have feared that Ukrainian forces would use the road over the dam to advance into Russian-held territory, as part of their counter-offensive.For Russia, anxious to defend conquered territory in southern Ukraine, the dam represented an obvious problem. Just as Ukrainian forces attacked road and rail bridges further downstream last autumn in a successful effort to isolate Russian forces in and around Kherson, Russia may have decided to destroy the dam to hold up Ukraine's counter-offensive, which it fears could come from multiple directions.However, a Russian official claims Ukraine carried out the attack on the dam to detract from what they said were the failures of its counter-offensive and to deprive Crimea - Ukraine's southern peninsula illegally annexed by Russian in 2014 - of fresh water.A major Ukrainian push has long been expected. Kyiv has said it would not give advance warning of its start but a recent increase in military activity is being seen as a fresh sign that the counter-offensive may have begun.On Tuesday evening, President Zelensky said the dam destruction would not stop Ukraine. ""We will still liberate all our land,"" he said in a video address.Earlier in the day, Mr Zelensky held an urgent meeting of the country's security and defence council to discuss the issue.On Monday, Ukraine's deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said Ukrainian forces had advanced around the ""epicentre of hostilities"" in Bakhmut, but did not say whether the counter-offensive had begun.Bakhmut has for months been at the heart of fierce fighting. It has little strategic value - but is important symbolically both for Kyiv and Moscow.Yuri Sak, an adviser to Ukraine's ministry of defence, told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme that phone intercepts suggest Russia wants to target more dams.""They're actually calling to blow up more dams on the Dnipro river,"" he said.Ukraine has branded the attack on the dam ""ecocide"" and said that 150 tonnes of engine oil has spilled into the Dnipro river.Ukrhydroenergo said a power station linked to the dam had been ""completely destroyed... the hydraulic structure is being washed away"".World leaders have laid the blame for the blast at Russia's door, with some calling it a war crime. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said that if Russia was found to be responsible for the collapse of the dam it would ""demonstrate the new lows that we will have seen from Russian aggression"".The head of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg, said the destruction of the dam demonstrated once again the brutality of Russia's war in Ukraine, while Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, said he was ""shocked by the unprecedented attack"".The Geneva Conventions explicitly ban targeting dams in war due to the danger it poses to civilians.","Kyiv has accused Russian forces of blowing up a large dam in southern Ukraine, while the Moscow-installed official in the city of Nova Kakhovka in the Russian-controlled portion of the Kherson region blamed the structure’s destruction on Ukrainian shelling. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused “Russian terrorists” ofdestroying the dam early on Tuesdayand said the outrage “confirms for the whole world that they must be expelled from every corner of Ukrainian land”. “Not a single meter should be left to them, because they use every meter for terror,” said Zelenskyy, who called an emergency meeting of the country’s national security council. “The terrorists will not be able to stop Ukraine with water, missiles or anything else,” he wrote on Twitter. But the Kremlin accused Kyiv of sabotaging the dam to distract attention from a purportedly faltering counteroffensive against Russian forces. “We can state unequivocally that we are talking about deliberate sabotage by the Ukrainian side,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. He added that Ukraine was also aiming to deprive Russian-annexed Crimea of the freshwater it receives from the reservoir via the North Crimean Canal. Commenting on allegations that Russia was responsible for the blast, Peskov said: “We can strongly reject this. We officially declare that here we are definitely talking about deliberate sabotage from the Ukrainian side.” The dam, 30 metres (some 98 feet) tall and 3.2km (2 miles) long, was built in 1956 on the Dnipro River as part of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant. The southern command of Ukrainian armed forces said the “scale of the destruction” was being assessed as Ukraine’s military administration for the Kherson region called on people to be ready to evacuate from villages on the right bank of theDnipro River before expected flooding. “The water level is rising and everyone who is in the danger zone must: Turn off all electrical appliances; take documents and essentials; take care of loved ones and pets; follow the instructions of rescuers and policemen,” the Kherson administration said on its Telegram channel. “About 16,000 people are in the critical zone on the right bank of the Kherson region,” said Oleksandr Prokudin, head of the Kherson military administration, adding that there was already flooding in eight areas along the Dnipro River. Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the Ukrainian presidential office, accused Russia of destroying the dam in “a panic” in order to slow down the Ukrainian counteroffensive, saying the consequences of Russia’s actions were “already catastrophic”. “On a vast territory, all life will be destroyed; many settlements will be ruined; colossal damage will be done to the environment,” he said. The office of the prosecutor general said Ukraine was investigating the incident as a possible war crime and as possible criminal environmental destruction, or “ecocide”. But RIA Novosti news agency quoted the Moscow-installed mayor of Nova Kakhovka, Vladimir Leontiev, as saying the dam had been hit by shelling which he blamed on Ukraine. “There were several hits” on the dam, he said, according to the Russian news agency. “This crime cannot be written off. This is a terrorist act directed against civilians, Ukrainians did it,” he said. Al Jazeera’s Charles Stratford, reporting from Kyiv, said analysts had long seen the dam as a potential target for both sides in the war. The dam is vital for water supply and irrigation in Russian-occupied Crimea, while Russia could see its destruction as a way of making it more difficult for Ukrainian forces to cross the Dnipro River and enter Crimea in a ground offensive, Stratford said, adding that the evacuation of settlements in the area had already begun. “We are also hearing from the Ukrainians that they believe … water levels will reach a critical point around five hours from now. We also know there are ongoing evacuations from some of the settlements that are going to be affected,” he said. The Soviet-era dam in the Russian-controlled part of the Kherson region could unleash a flood across the war zone, according to Ukrainian and Russian forces. Unverified videos on social media showed a series of intense explosions around the dam. Other videos showed water surging through its remains with bystanders expressing their shock, sometimes in strong language. Ukraine controls five of the six dams along the Dnipro, which runs from the country’s northern border with Belarus down to the Black Sea and is crucial for the entire country’s drinking water and power supply. The Nova Kakhovka dam – the one furthest downstream – is controlled by Russian forces and contains an 18-cubic-kilometre (4.3-cubic-mile) reservoir which supplies water to the Crimean Peninsula, which was annexed by Russia in 2014, and to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which is also under Russian control. Ukraine’s nuclear operator Energoatom said in a Telegram statement that the blowing up of the dam “could have negative consequences for the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant”, but the situation is “controllable” at the moment. The United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency wrote on Twitter that its experts were closely monitoring the situation at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant upstream, and there was “no immediate nuclear safety risk” at the facility. The IAEA is aware of reports of damage at#Ukraine’s Kakhovka dam; IAEA experts at#ZaporizhzhyaNuclear Power Plant are closely monitoring the situation; no immediate nuclear safety risk at plant.#ZNPP — IAEA – International Atomic Energy Agency ⚛️ (@iaeaorg)June 6, 2023  Europe’s largest nuclear facility uses water from the dam to cool six reactors as well as spent fuel and emergency diesel generators. IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said in a statement that alternative sources of water near the facility should be sufficient to guarantee its safety. “A main one is the large cooling pond next to the site that by design is kept above the height of the reservoir,” he said. “It is therefore vital that this cooling pond remains intact. Nothing must be done to potentially undermine its integrity. I call on all sides to ensure nothing is done to undermine that.” According to the Ukraine War Environmental Consequences Working Group, a total collapse in the dam would wash away much of the left bank and a severe drop in the reservoir has the potential to deprive the nuclear plant of crucial cooling, as well as dry up the water supply in northern Crimea. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg called the attack “outrageous” and said it highlighted the devastation wrought by Moscow’s invasion. “The destruction of the Kakhovka dam today puts thousands of civilians at risk and causes severe environmental damage. This is an outrageous act, which demonstrates once again the brutality of Russia’s war in Ukraine,” Stoltenberg wrote on Twitter. European Union chief Charles Michel pledged to hold Russia accountable for the “war crime” of destroying civilian infrastructure. “Shocked by the unprecedented attack of the Nova Kakhovka dam. The destruction of civilian infrastructure clearly qualifies as a war crime – and we will hold Russia and its proxies accountable,” Michel wrote on social media. Lithuania’s president and the foreign ministers of Latvia and Estonia also said the incident amounted to a war crime for which Russia must be held accountable. “Today we witness an unprecedented Russian attack against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure,” Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda tweeted. “The destruction of a major dam is a crime of war that directly threatens thousands of people. Russia must be held accountable for it,” he said. “And Ukraine must win this war to stay safe!”"
Ukraine's counter-offensive against Russia under way,Zelenskyy says counteroffensive actions under way against Russia,0.5636113154026181,2023-06-09,2023-06-11,"Was this the week that Ukraine's long-anticipated counter-offensive finally got under way?Russian President Vladimir Putin seems to think so. ""We can definitely state that this Ukrainian offensive has begun,"" he said in a video interview published on Telegram on Friday.In some ways, it's already been under way for weeks, with Ukraine conducting what's known in military jargon as ""shaping operations"": long range artillery and missile attacks on key Russian logistical targets far behind the front lines. Monday seemed to herald a change, with small detachments of lightly armoured Ukrainian units moving forward across the open fields towards Russian fortifications in southern Ukraine, south-east of Zaporizhzhia. ""Now the so-called 'fighting reconnaissance stage' is taking place along the entire length of the front,"" Serhii Kuzan, co-founder and chairman of the Ukrainian Security and Cooperation Centre, told the BBC.""That means there's a probing of Russian defences.""Some videos and accounts suggested that they quickly ran into trouble.""Somewhere this happens more successfully with small losses,"" Mr Kuzan said. ""And somewhere less successfully, where the Russians fight back.""Mr Kuzan declined to name specific towns, saying only that they were all in the area south of Zaporizhzhia.By Tuesday, the world's attention was captured by the destruction of the dam at Nova Kakhovka and the subsequent flooding that soon covered around 230 square miles (596 sq km) either side of the Dnipro River.For all the Kremlin's denials, it didn't look like a coincidence. The dam, and the road across it, offered a possible line of attack for Ukrainian forces looking for ways to keep Russian forces off-balance.It seems highly likely that Russian forces, which controlled the dam, decided to blow it up, taking one of Kyiv's military operations off the table.Kyiv had already signalled its interest in this stretch of the front line more than once. In late April, Ukrainian soldiers crossed the river and briefly established a bridgehead at Oleshky. Ukraine also took control of several small islands in the Dnipro delta, close to Kherson.The extent of Kyiv's military plans for this area is not known, and is now academic. The catastrophic flooding will have made river crossings impossible for the time being.""But the fact that such a direction was an option was seen by the Russians,"" Mr Kuzan said.While the authorities in Kyiv suddenly grappled with the flooding, the fighting continued - and seemed to escalate - further east.By early Thursday morning, the UK's Ministry of Defence tweeted that ""heavy fighting continues along multiple sectors of the front,"" adding that in most areas ""Ukraine holds the initiative.""In a video the same day, Russia's defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said that Russian forces had repelled an overnight Ukrainian attack in the area south of Zaporizhzhia, involving 150 armoured vehicles and 1,500 troops.According to the Russian Defence Ministry, Ukraine's 47th Mechanised Brigade ""made an attempt to break through Russian lines.""A video circulated on the internet, purporting to show something new: a western-supplied Leopard tank being destroyed. The BBC has not yet verified the video. Ukrainian officials, characteristically tight lipped about current operations, offered tantalising glimpses into what was going on.Hanna Malyar, the Deputy Defence Minister, coyly said that Russian troops were ""actively on the defensive"" in the area around the town of Orikhiv, around 65km south-east of Zaporizhzhia. In a statement on Telegram, she also confirmed that battles were continuing around Velyka Novosilka, further east. The two towns likely form the western and eastern edges of a heavily fortified stretch of the front line where many analysts believe Ukraine will eventually try and punch through Russian lines. ""It's not a secret that one of our main goals is to cut the land corridor that feeds the whole southern grouping of enemy forces,"" Mr Kuzan said. Pro-Russian Telegram channels in the Donbas were full of excited chatter about Ukraine's latest moves, much of it laced with scorn.""They are going where the Russians are waiting for them,"" one member posted in the I Love Kramatorsk group. ""What stupidity!""Others acknowledged that Ukrainian forces had moved forward, but questioned the price in lost men and armour. ""I really question the price of this success,"" another member of the same group commented. ""Do they have enough forces to reach Tokmak [44km south of Orikhiv], let alone Berdyansk and Melitopol?""But it's not the only area where fighting is raging. Footage from north and south of the city of Bakhmut, scene of one of the longest and bloodiest battles of the war, appeared to show Ukrainian forces moving forward.Ms Malyar said they had advanced ""from 200 to 1,100 metres in various sections,"" in what may eventually be an effort to encircle the city and trap its Russian occupiers.It is, as the UK's Ministry of Defence noted, ""a highly complex operational picture"". But does it mean that Ukraine's counter-offensive is already entering a dramatic new phase?On Wednesday, Oleksiy Danilov, Secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council, scoffed at the idea.""All of this is not true,"" he told Reuters.""When we start the counter-offensive, everyone will know about it. They will see it.""But something has definitely changed.""The point is that the front is finally moving,"" Serhii Kuzan said, adding that several options were still open to Ukrainian commanders.But Ukraine is also operating under a number of significant restraints, the main one being the lack of fighter jets capable of providing support from the air.""That's why we move slowly,"" Mr Kuzan said, ""and then move air defence [systems] closer.""Another factor is time. This offensive will probably last no more than five months, after which autumn rain will once again render open ground impassable for heavy armoured vehicles.What will success look like?If Ukrainian forces can punch through Russian lines, all the way to the Sea of Azov, then any Russian troops west of that breach will suddenly be much more vulnerable, dependent entirely on supply lines through the Crimean Peninsula.All that would then remain, Mr Kuzan says, would be to destroy the Kerch Bridge linking Russia with Crimea (briefly disabled by a huge truck bomb last October) and attack ships and planes being used to ferry supplies to the peninsula. ""That would be the end,"" he says. ""But don't expect this to happen soon. It'll take months.""","Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that counteroffensive actions were under way against invading Russian forces in his country but declined to divulge additional details. The Ukrainian leader made the comment on Saturday at a news conference in Kyiv, while standing alongside visiting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. He was responding to a question about Russian President Vladimir Putin’s statement a day earlier thatUkraine’s counteroffensive had startedand that Ukrainian forces were taking “significant losses”. Zelenskyy said that “counteroffensive, defensive actions are taking place in Ukraine. I will not speak about which stage or phase they are in.” “I am in touch with our commanders of different directions every day,” he added, citing the names of five of Ukraine’s top military leaders. “Everyone is positive. Pass this on to Putin.” Top Ukrainian authorities have stopped short of announcing a full-blown counteroffensive was under way, though some Western analysts have saidfiercer fightingand reported use of reserve troops suggests it was. In his nightly video address, Zelenskyy provided few details while urging troops to keep fighting. “Thank you to all those who hold their positions and those who advance,” he said, citing the eastern and southern fronts, where fighting is heaviest. Ukraine’s general staff said its forces hadrepelled enemy attacksaround Bakhmut and Marinka, sites of heavy clashes in the east. Russian forces, it said, “continue to suffer heavy losses which they are trying to conceal”.    Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar made it plain on Telegram that the military would issue no statements until battlefield positions became clear. “Ask yourself this… am I prepared to receive information about the liberation of this or that town not when our troops enter it, but once they establish a stronghold?” she wrote. Ukraine has said for months it plans to conduct a significant counteroffensive to recapture land occupied by Russia in the south and east. But it is enforcing strict operational silence for now and has denied it has begun the main operation. With scant independent reporting from the front lines, it has been difficult to assess the state of the fighting. The United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defence, meanwhile, said Ukraine had conducted “significant” operations in several eastern and southern parts in the last 48 hours, with Russian defences breached in places. “In some areas, Ukrainian forces have likely made good progress and penetrated the first line of Russian defences. In others, Ukrainian progress has been slower,” it said, also characterising the Russian military’s performance as mixed. “Some [Russian] units are likely conducting credible manoeuvre defence operations while others have pulled back in some disorder, amid increased reports of Russian casualties as they withdraw through their own minefields,” it said. Ukraine’s counteroffensive is expected to use thousands of troops trained and equipped by the West but Russia has built huge fortifications in occupied territory to prepare, while Kyiv also lacks air supremacy. Patrick Bury, a defence and security expert at the University of Bath in the UK, told Al Jazeera that the counteroffensive was likely to be a “long game” and that its initial operations would “probably be the most bloody part for the Ukrainians”. “It’s highly unlikely that we’re going to see a rapid breakthrough like we saw in Kharkiv back in September, for example, where the Ukrainians were able to, with the help of allied intelligence, identify places where there were just exhausted and ruined Russian units and drove essentially past them and kept going. It’s not going to be like that,” he said. “The Russians have had months to prepare significant offences and these are … defensive positions with trenches, bunkers, minefields, in particular, which are designed to channel attackers into killing zones.” The Ukrainians were likely to take “a lot of casualties” while going on the attack. “It’s much easier to defend: You know the ground, you know what the plan is, you know ‘I’m going to hold this position until they get to here and then I’m going to fall back to here, and then that other position is going to support me’,” Bury said. “It’s significantly easier for the defenders as the Ukrainians found out when they were defending last year. It’s much more difficult for the attackers,” he added. “Yes, you have some intelligence preparation but you don’t know exactly where everything is; it’s all new to you, the terrain and you’re being fired on etc as you try to advance; so it’s much more difficult for them.”    The south is seen as a key strategic priority for a Ukrainian push that could aim to recapture Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant and cut the Russian land bridge to the occupied Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, dividing Russian forces. The fighting there has drawn renewed attention following the destruction of the Russian-controlled Kakhovka dam along the Dnipro River on Tuesday. The flooding from the breached dam has forced thousands to flee their homes and sparkedfears of humanitarian and environmental disasters. Ukraine says Russia blew up the dam. Moscow accuses Kyiv of firing on it. Trudeau, the first foreign leader to visit Ukraine since the dam’s breach, offered up monetary, military and moral support. He pledged 500 million Canadian dollars ($375m) in new military aid, on top of more than 8 billion Canadian dollars ($6bn) that Canada has already provided since the war began in February 2022, and announced 10 million Canadian dollars ($7.5m) for humanitarian assistance for the flood response. Trudeau said the dam’s collapse was “a direct consequence of Russia’s war”, but he did not blame Moscow directly. In other developments, the UK government also said it will give 16 million pounds ($20m) in humanitarian aid to those affected by the flooding. Most of the money is being channelled through international organisations such as the Red Cross and the United Nations. The UK is also sending boats, community water filters, water pumps and waders to Ukraine. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, meanwhile, said on Saturday that he wanted to continue speaking with Putin and plans to do so again “soon”. Scholz has spoken several times by phone with Putin since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year. The chancellor said the basis for a “fair peace” between Russia and Ukraine is the withdrawal of Russian troops. “That needs to be understood,” he said."
Bi-2: Russian anti-war band leaves Thailand for Israel,Thailand deports dissident Russian rockers to Israel,0.5624194785863993,2024-02-01,2024-02-01,"An anti-war Russian-Belarusian rock band says all its members have left Thailand for Israel after fears they would be deported to Russia.Bi-2 had been playing in a Thai resort popular with Russian tourists when members were arrested for unauthorised shows.Human rights activists urged Thailand not to deport them for fear they would be persecuted in their home countries.Now the band says it is on its way to Tel Aviv in Israel.The band's frontman, Yegor ""Lyova"" Bortnik, has already arrived in the Israeli city, Radio Free Europe reports. On its Facebook page, the band announced on Wednesday: ""All the musicians in Bi-2 have successfully left Thailand and are heading to Tel Aviv. Details tomorrow.""      The band was being held in the capital Bangkok after being arrested while touring Phuket, a resort island that hosts hundreds of thousands of Russian visitors each year.In an earlier statement it said that ""outside pressure"" had ""played a significant role"" in its detention by the Thai authorities. ""We know that the reason for this pressure is [retaliation] for our creativity, our views, our position,"" it said.The band has been touring outside Russia since 2022, including playing shows across Europe last year.In May, Russia's justice ministry labelled Bortnik a ""foreign agent"" for ""opposing"" Russia's invasion of Ukraine and ""making negative statements"" about Russia, its citizens and authorities.The band has been singled out by Russian lawmakers before for its alleged ""anti-Russian stance"". Russian state TV quoted the Russian ambassador to Thailand, Yevgeny Tomikhin, on Tuesday as saying that Moscow had not requested the band's extradition. Thailand and, in particular, its desirable island holiday spots such as Phuket have seen a huge influx of Russian tourists since the war began in Ukraine nearly two years ago. Many Russians have fled the country to avoid conscription. By some estimates, nearly half a million Russians arrived in Phuket in the first half of 2023. ","Thailand has deported members of a dissident Russian-Belarusian rock band critical of Moscow’s war in Ukraine to Israel after they were detained for performing without a permit. Members ofBi-2left “safely” for Tel Aviv on Wednesday night, they said on theirFacebookpage. Human rights advocates had warned the group would face severe persecution for speaking out againstRussia’s war in Ukraineif they were sent back to Russia. Thai authorities had detained the members of Bi-2 for working at the resort island of Phuket without a permit. The fate of the band provoked an international outcry, leading Thai immigration officials to give the band the choice of being deported to another destination if they felt unsafe to return to Russia. Thailand’s National Security Council, chaired by Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin, took charge of the case on Wednesday. Several members of the self-exiled group, which had been based in Israel in the 1990s, have dual nationalities, including Israeli and Australian. Deputy Police Chief Surachate Hakparn confirmed the band had requested to be deported to Israel. The band was detained last week after they played a gig on Phuket, a southern island popular with Russian holidaymakers. Thai officials said they were held for performing without the correct work permits and transferred to an immigration detention centre in Bangkok. VPI Event, the organisers of the band’s Thailand concerts – which also included a show in Pattaya – said all the necessary permits were obtained, but the band had been issued tourist visas in error. VPI accused the Russian consulate of having waged a campaign to cancel the concerts since December and said they had faced “unprecedented pressure” as they sought the band’s release. Bi-2, which was founded in Minsk, Belarus, is popular in Russia. Russia’s Ministry of Justice labelled lead singer Yegor Bortnick a “foreign agent” after he criticised President Vladimir Putin online last year. One of the band’s founders has openly denounced the Putin government, saying it makes him feel “only disgust” and accusing the long-serving leader of having “destroyed” Russia. Several of their concerts were cancelled in 2022 after they refused to play at a venue with banners supporting the war in Ukraine, after which they left Russia. “Even though they [are] all safe, we still want Thai authorities to respect arrest procedures strictly,” human rights lawyer Pornpen Khongkachonkiet told the AFP news agency. “It could [have] happened to me, you, and others without international attention as this case got.” Phil Robertson, the deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch (HRW), said Thailand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs had recognised “the importance of upholding human rights principles” by not sending the band to “face persecution” in Russia. Very good news that all band members of the Russian-Belorussian rock band Bi-2 were able to leave#Thailand, & go safely to#Israel. Appreciate that@MFAThairecognized the importance of upholding human rights principles, & didn't send them to face persecution & worse in#Russia.pic.twitter.com/JONpMmCRMX — Phil Robertson (@Reaproy)February 1, 2024  Robertson said that while “Thailand is vulnerable to effective manipulation by larger states pursuing transnational repression”, international pressure – and global economic concerns – had played a significant role. “Thailand realised that they didn’t need to make a lot of enemies by doing Russia’s bidding in this case.”"
EU to open membership talks with Ukraine and Moldova,Zelenskyy claims ‘victory’ as EU agrees to open Ukraine membership talks,0.5571897840170947,2023-12-14,2023-12-14,"European leaders have decided to open EU membership talks with Ukraine and Moldova and to grant candidate status to Georgia.Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky hailed the decision, made at a summit in Brussels, as ""a victory"" for his country and Europe.A spokesperson for Charles Michel, the President of the European Council, said that agreement was unanimous.Hungary has long opposed talks starting with Kyiv, but did not veto the move.Prime Minister Viktor Orban left the room momentarily in what officials described as a pre-agreed and constructive manner, while the other 26 leaders went ahead with the vote.He then distanced himself from his colleagues with a video message on Facebook: ""EU membership of Ukraine is a bad decision. Hungary does not want to participate in this bad decision, and therefore stayed away from the decision today.""Mr Zelensky was delighted by the EU's announcement: ""This is a victory for Ukraine. A victory for all of Europe. A victory that motivates, inspires and strengthens,"" he said on X.Ukraine and Moldova applied to join the EU after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. They were both given candidate status last June, while Georgia was passed over at the time.Moldovan President Maia Sandu said it was an honour to share the path to EU accession with Ukraine. ""We wouldn't be here today without Ukraine's brave resistance against Russia's brutal invasion,"" she wrote.Earlier this year, Moldova warned that Russia was seeking to seize power in Chisinau. Ms Sandu said Moldovans were now feeling Europe's ""warm embrace"" and congratulated her compatriots on what she called ""an award for all of society, all those who choose democracy and prosperity"".  White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan welcomed the EU's ""historic"" move to open accession talks with Ukraine and Moldova, calling it a ""crucial step toward fulfilling their Euro-Atlantic aspirations"".Talks on joining the European Union can take years, so Thursday's decision will not guarantee Ukraine membership. People in Ukraine know that the path to full membership is a long one, but this decision in Brussels will be a boost for morale. EU candidate countries have to pass a series of reforms to adhere to standards ranging from the rule of law to the economy, although the EU's executive has already praised Kyiv for completing more than 90% of the steps taken so far on justice and tackling corruption.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz praised his fellow leaders for showing a ""strong sign of support"", adding that it was clear that both Ukraine and Moldova belonged to ""the European family"". A diplomat at the summit said it was Mr Scholz's idea for Mr Orban to leave the room to enable the vote to go through.This was some much-needed good news for Ukraine, after almost 22 months of Russia's war and a continuing struggle to secure Western military and financial aid.Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said it was a historic moment and an ""important message of hope"" for the citizens of Ukraine and Moldova.Mr Zelensky travelled to the US earlier this week in a vain attempt to persuade the US Congress to push through $61bn in military funding, blocked by Republican lawmakers.Ukraine's counter-offensive against Russia's occupying force has ground to a halt at the start of winter.Earlier on Thursday, President Vladimir Putin mocked Ukraine and claimed Western support was running out: ""Excuse my vulgarity, but everything is being brought in as a freebie. But those freebies could run out at some point.""But President Zelensky will at least now be able to point to this political win as proof that Ukraine is not steadily being abandoned by its partners. The European Council president said it was a ""very powerful signal... to the people of Ukraine we are on their side"".Many in Kyiv see their fight against Russia's invasion as a defence of European values and they firmly view their future as an active and effective member of the European Union. Ukraine's 2014 ""Revolution of Dignity"", toppling its pro-Kremlin president, was rooted in a desire to move away from Russia's political orbit and towards Europe. President Putin reacted by sending troops into eastern Ukraine and Crimea and then staging a far wider invasion in 2022. For Georgia too, invaded by Russia in 2008, the EU vote was a ""monumental milestone"", said pro-EU President Salome Zurabishvili.Georgia has a broadly pro-EU population, its government has a complex relationship with Moscow and has refrained from imposing sanctions on Russia since its invasion of Ukraine began.Asked if President Putin had ambitions to do to Georgia what he was doing to Ukraine, pro-Putin Russian lawmaker and TV host Yevgeny Popov told BBC Newsnight, ""We are not going to.""""We have enough territory,"" he said. ""We are the biggest country in the world and we don't need any other territories. But all we need is security guarantees.""On Thursday, Mr Michel said the EU also intended to open negotiations with Bosnia-Herzegovina once it met criteria for membership. Bosnia was given candidate status a year ago but a progress report last month has listed further steps Sarajevo needs to take on electoral and judicial reforms. Bosnia has the added issue of the leader of its majority-Serb area, Republika Srpska, threatening to secede.","President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has hailed a “victory” for Ukraine and Europe after European Union leaders agreed to openmembership talkswith Kyiv, but the mood was soured just hours later when Hungary carried through on threats to block crucial financial aid to Ukraine. European Council President Charles Michel, host of the summit in Brussels, announced Thursday’s agreement on membership talks in a social media post, calling it “a clear signal of hope for their people and for our continent”. Zelenskyy welcomed the decision as “a victory for Ukraine. A victory for all of Europe. A victory that motivates, inspires, and strengthens,” he said in a post on X. European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said it was “a strategic decision and a day that will remain engraved in the history of our union”. “These countries belong to the European family,” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said. The EU also agreed to open talks with Moldova and granted EU candidate status to Georgia. Michel said the block would also advance a membership bid by another hopeful – Bosnia and Herzegovina – once it reaches “the necessary degree of compliance” with criteria. But the mood changed early on Friday when Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orban, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, announced he hadblockeda proposal to revamp the EU budget to include 50 billion euros ($54bn) in financial aid to Kyiv as it battles to remove Russian troops from its territory. For weeks, Orban had been promising to block the membership deal and the funding, which he said were not in the interests of Hungary or the EU. While Orban had agreed not to be in the room for the membership vote – allowing it to pass – the other EU nations were unable to overcome his resistance to the budget proposal put forward by Michel. “We still have some time. Ukraine is not out of money in the next few weeks,” Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told reporters on leaving the talks. “I am fairly confident we can get a deal early next year, we are thinking of late January.” However, on Friday, Orban told Hungarians in an interview on state radio that Budapest could yet put a stop to Ukraine’s membership talks and he will not give a nod to the funding package unless Brussels releases billions of euros to Hungary that it has frozen due to rule of law concerns. It is widely believed that Orban has been complicating the EU’s efforts to help Ukraine not only because he is close to Putin but also as a way to force Brussels to release the frozen funds, which total more than 30 billion euros ($32.8bn). Stressing that membership talks would be long and complex, the Hungarian leader slammed the “bad decision” to invite Ukraine to launch the process. “Hungary bears no responsibility for this. We can halt this process later on, and if needed, we will pull the brakes, and the ultimate decision will be made by the Hungarian parliament,” he said. He also appeared to set out a clear quid pro quo regarding the funding. “I’ve always said that if someone wants to amend the budget law and they want to for several reasons, this is a great opportunity for Hungary to make it clear that it should get what it deserves – not half, then a quarter, but it must get the whole thing,” Orban said. While insisting that Hungary is not a pro-Russian country, the Kremlin on Friday praised Budapest for being prepared to defend its own interests. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov warned that Ukraine and Moldova could “destabilise” the EU should they join. “Negotiations to join the EU can last for years or decades. The EU has always had strict criteria for accession, and it is obvious that at the moment neither Ukraine nor Moldova meets these criteria,” he told reporters. “It is clear that this is an absolutely politicised decision, the EU’s desire to demonstrate support for these countries. But such new members could destabilise the EU, and since we live on the same continent as the EU, we, of course, are closely watching this.” Zelenskyy has been rallying allies’ support for his country as concerns grow that their backing might be waning. This week, he travelled tothe United States, where he hoped to persuade Republican lawmakers to approve billions of dollars in new funding that they have blocked in Congress. US President Joe Biden has argued that their refusal to back the new spending plays into Putin’s hands. Ukraine launched its bid to become part of the EU after Moscow began its full-scale invasion in February 2022 and was officially named a candidate to join in June last year. Fellow former Soviet republic and neighbourMoldovahad applied at the same time as Ukraine. Thewar in Ukrainehas breathed new life into the EU’s stalled push to take on new members as the bloc looks to keep Russian and Chinese influence at bay. In June 2022, the European Commission set Kyiv seven reform benchmarks to complete, including tackling corruption and curbing the power of its oligarchs, before talks should start. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmyhal said the EU’s decision on Thursday showed that it “highly appreciated the reforms we have made in recent years and the implementation of all the recommendations of the European Commission”. “A difficult path lies ahead. We are united and ready,” he said. EU treaties oblige members to help “by all means in their power” another EU country that is a victim of armed aggression on its territory. If Ukraine becomes an EU member while the war with Russia is continuing, EU countries would have to respect that. The EU would also acquire a long new border with Russia and Belarus with implications for security,migrationand defence.   "
Nato summit: Ukraine's future membership to be discussed by leaders in Vilnius,Full text: NATO Vilnius summit communique,0.5557553714650605,2023-07-11,2023-07-12,"Nato leaders are gathering in Lithuania for a crucial summit that could shape the direction of the war in Ukraine and the future of the Western alliance. The 31 allies hope to show Russia they have the resolve to support Ukraine militarily for the long term. They arrive with a welcome boost after Turkey dropped its objections to Sweden joining the alliance.But there remains disagreement over what to say about Ukraine's own ambitions of future membership. It is thought some allies will promise Kyiv new security guarantees designed to deter future Russian aggression. They will also discuss providing more weapons and ammunition. On the membership issue, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wants Nato to say Ukraine could join as soon as possible after the fighting ends - setting out explicitly how and when this could be achieved. But some Nato nations are reluctant to go too far, fearing the promise of near-automatic membership could give Russia an incentive both to escalate and drag out the war. Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, said no final decision had been made on the language of the final communiquÃ©, but added: ""I am absolutely certain that we will have unity and a strong message on Ukraine.""But after late night talks on Monday, he announced that Turkey had agreed to support Sweden's application to join Nato. The news was welcomed by the US and Germany, as well as Sweden itself.Turkey had spent months blocking Stockholm's application, accusing it of hosting Kurdish militants. Mr Stoltenberg said the two sides had worked together to address Turkey's ""legitimate security concerns"".Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan earlier suggested he would back Sweden if the EU re-opened frozen membership talks with Ankara - a request that was rejected by EU officials.Over their two-day meeting, Nato leaders are expected to agree new plans to deter and defend the alliance against future Russian aggression by beefing up their forces in the east. And they are also expected to step up their financial commitment, making the target of spending 2% of national wealth on defence a minimum figure, rather than a general ambition. Rishi Sunak's spokesman said the UK prime minister would call on allies directly to meet this target. Security is tight in Vilnius, with Nato forces - including Patriot air defence missiles - defending a summit taking place only a short distance from Belarus and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The overarching aim of the meeting is for Nato to convince President Vladimir Putin of the alliance's long-term military commitment to Ukraine. Officials hope this could begin to change the Russian leader's thinking, putting doubt in his mind that he can outwait the West. As such, some see this summit as potentially as important as military gains on the battlefield in persuading Mr Putin to change his strategy. So some Nato members will promise Ukraine new security guarantees. US President Joe Biden has suggested Ukraine could get the kind of military support his country gives Israel - long-term commitments designed to deter potential aggressors. The alliance will also deepen its institutional links with Ukraine. An existing forum - the Ukraine Nato Commission - will be upgraded to a Ukraine Nato Council. This will give Ukraine the ability to summon meetings of the alliance as an equal partner round the table. ""The right to consult is not insignificant,"" said one official.But perhaps most importantly, some members are expected to set out more explicitly Ukraine's pathway to joining the alliance. Nato agreed at its 2008 summit in Bucharest that Ukraine ""will"" become a member and supported its application. But the alliance did not say how and when this might happen. Critics say giving Ukraine a destination but no itinerary allowed Mr Putin to risk his invasions in both 2014 and 2022. Mr Biden will meet Mr Zelensky at the summit, a US official told Reuters, although the Ukrainian president is yet to officially confirm his participation at the event.Kyiv accepts Nato cannot formally invite Ukraine to join while fighting rages. That would risk plunging the alliance into war with Russia, as Nato would be obliged under Article 5 of its treaty to defend any member that is under attack.Instead, Kyiv wants a clear promise of post-war membership with a timeline, so it knows victory will bring the security guarantee of Nato's nuclear umbrella.  One way for Nato to signal its desire to welcome Ukraine into its ranks would be to shorten the so-called membership application plan, known as the MAP. This is the formal process which tests whether a country meets Nato's strict military and governmental standards - and it can take decades. But it is what Nato might actually say about Ukraine's potential membership that is dividing the alliance. The Baltic states and eastern European nations are pushing for as much clarity as possible. They want the alliance to make clear how much progress Ukraine has made towards membership, especially how much more closely its army can operate with other Nato forces, now that it shares similar weapons and strategies. They also want Nato to make clear what further conditions Ukraine must meet to achieve membership. Gitanas Nauseda, the president of Lithuania, said Nato should avoid Ukraine's membership becoming a horizon: ""The more you walk towards it, the farther it is.""But some allies - including the US and Germany - are cautious about promising Ukraine too much. They want Ukraine to do more to tackle corruption, strengthen its judiciary and ensure civilian control over its military. Some also worry about Nato getting dragged into open conflict with Russia. They fear promising Ukraine membership after the war would give Putin an incentive both to escalate the conflict and drag it out, maintaining low-intensity fighting to prevent Ukraine ever joining. Other allies also fear losing room for manoeuvre in any post-war negotiations. They want to use the promise of Nato membership as a carrot for Ukraine and a stick for Russia, but only after the fighting has ended.

The Vilnius communique, however, while emphasising NATO’s support for Ukraine, gave no clear timetable on when the country might be able to join the alliance, in a major disappointment for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who had travelled to the Lithuanian capital. “Ukraine’s future is in NATO,” the leaders said in the joint statement on Tuesday. “We will be in a position to extend an invitation to Ukraine to join the alliance when allies agree and conditions are met,” the declaration said, without specifying the conditions. The communique also touched on the Asia Pacific, with the leaders of Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea all attending as NATO allies. It said China was a challenge to NATO’s interests, security and values with its “ambitions and coercive policies” triggering a furious response from Beijing. And it accused Beijing and Moscow of “mutually reinforcing attempts to undercut the rules-based international order”. China has said it wants peace in Ukraine, but has not condemnedRussia’s full scale invasionsince it began in February 2022. Here is the full text of the communique: The NATO Invitee associates itself with this Communiqué. 1.           We, the Heads of State and Government of the North Atlantic Alliance, bound by shared values of individual liberty, human rights, democracy, and the rule of law, have gathered in Vilnius as war continues on the European continent, to reaffirm our enduring transatlantic bond, unity, cohesion, and solidarity at a critical time for our security and international peace and stability.  NATO is a defensive Alliance.  It is the unique, essential and indispensable transatlantic forum to consult, coordinate and act on all matters related to our individual and collective security.  We reaffirm our iron-clad commitment to defend each other and every inch of Allied territory at all times, protect our one billion citizens, and safeguard our freedom and democracy, in accordance with Article 5 of the Washington Treaty.  We will continue to ensure our collective defence from all threats, no matter where they stem from, based on a 360-degree approach, to fulfil NATO’s three core tasks of deterrence and defence, crisis prevention and management, and cooperative security.  We adhere to international law and to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and are committed to upholding the rules-based international order.  This Summit marks a milestone in strengthening our Alliance. 2.           We warmly welcome President Zelenskyy to the inaugural meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council.  We look forward to our valuable exchanges with the Heads of State and Government of Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and the Republic of Korea, as well as the President of the European Council and the President of the European Commission at this Summit.  We also welcome the engagements with the Foreign Ministers of Georgia and the Republic of Moldova, and with the Deputy Foreign Minister of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as we continue to consult closely on the implementation of NATO’s tailored support measures. 3.           We welcome Finland as the newest member of our Alliance. This is an historic step for Finland and for NATO. For many years, we worked closely as partners; we now stand together as Allies. NATO membership makes Finland safer, and NATO stronger. 4.           We reaffirm our commitment to NATO’s open door policy and to Article 10 of the Washington Treaty. Every nation has the right to choose its own security arrangements. We look forward to welcoming Sweden as a full member of the Alliance and, in this regard, welcome the agreement reached between the NATO Secretary General, the President of Türkiye, and the Prime Minister of Sweden. 5.           Peace in the Euro-Atlantic area has been shattered.  The Russian Federation has violated the norms and principles that contributed to a stable and predictable European security order.  The Russian Federation is the most significant and direct threat to Allies’ security and to peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area.  Terrorism, in all its forms and manifestations, is the most direct asymmetric threat to the security of our citizens and to international peace and prosperity.  The threats we face are global and interconnected. 6.           Strategic competition, pervasive instability and recurrent shocks define our broader security environment.  Conflict, fragility and instability in Africa and the Middle East directly affect our security and the security of our partners.  The People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) stated ambitions and coercive policies challenge our interests, security and values.  We remain open to constructive engagement with the PRC, including to build reciprocal transparency, with a view to safeguarding the Alliance’s security interests.  We continue to be confronted by cyber, space, hybrid and other asymmetric threats, and by the malicious use of emerging and disruptive technologies. 7.           Russia bears full responsibility for its illegal, unjustifiable, and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine, which has gravely undermined Euro-Atlantic and global security and for which it must be held fully accountable.  We continue to condemn in the strongest terms Russia’s blatant violations of international law, the Charter of the United Nations, and OSCE commitments and principles.  We do not and will never recognise Russia’s illegal and illegitimate annexations, including Crimea.  There can be no impunity for Russian war crimes and other atrocities, such as attacks against civilians and the destruction of civilian infrastructure that deprives millions of Ukrainians of basic human services.  All those responsible must be held accountable for violations and abuses of human rights and international humanitarian law, particularly against Ukraine’s civilian population, including the forced deportation of children and conflict-related sexual violence.  The destruction of the Kakhovka dam highlights the brutal consequences of the war started by Russia.  Russia’s war has had a profound impact on the environment, nuclear safety, energy and food security, the global economy, and the welfare of billions of people around the world.  Allies are working to enable exports of Ukrainian grain and actively support international efforts to alleviate the global food crisis. 8.           Russia must immediately stop this illegal war of aggression, cease its use of force against Ukraine, and completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its forces and equipment from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders, extending to its territorial waters.  We urge all countries not to provide any kind of assistance to Russia’s aggression and condemn all those who are actively facilitating Russia’s war.  Belarus’ support has been instrumental as it continues to provide its territory and infrastructure to allow Russian forces to attack Ukraine and sustain Russia’s aggression.  In particular Belarus, but also Iran, must end their complicity with Russia and return to compliance with international law. 9.           We welcome the strong support in the UN General Assembly for efforts to promote a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace in Ukraine.  We welcome and support President Zelenskyy’s commitment in setting out the principles for such a peace through his Peace Formula.  We are committed to achieving a just and lasting peace that upholds the principles of the UN Charter, in particular sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence.  We underline that this cannot be realised without Russia’s complete and unconditional withdrawal.  While we have called on Russia to engage constructively in credible negotiations with Ukraine, Russia has not shown any genuine openness to a just and lasting peace. 10.         We reaffirm our unwavering solidarity with the government and people of Ukraine in the heroic defence of their nation, their land, and our shared values.  We fully support Ukraine’s inherent right to self-defence as enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter.  We remain steadfast in our commitment to further step up political and practical support to Ukraine as it continues to defend its independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders, and will continue our support for as long as it takes.  We welcome efforts of all Allies and partners engaged in providing support to Ukraine.    11.         We fully support Ukraine’s right to choose its own security arrangements.  Ukraine’s future is in NATO.  We reaffirm the commitment we made at the 2008 Summit in Bucharest that Ukraine will become a member of NATO, and today we recognise that Ukraine’s path to full Euro-Atlantic integration has moved beyond the need for the Membership Action Plan.  Ukraine has become increasingly interoperable and politically integrated with the Alliance, and has made substantial progress on its reform path.  In line with the 1997 Charter on a Distinctive Partnership between NATO and Ukraine and the 2009 Complement, Allies will continue to support and review Ukraine’s progress on interoperability as well as additional democratic and security sector reforms that are required.  NATO Foreign Ministers will regularly assess progress through the adapted Annual National Programme.  The Alliance will support Ukraine in making these reforms on its path towards future membership.  We will be in a position to extend an invitation to Ukraine to join the Alliance when Allies agree and conditions are met. 12.         The security of Ukraine is of great importance to Allies and the Alliance.  To support Ukraine’s further integration with NATO, today we have agreed a substantial package of expanded political and practical support.  We have decided to establish the NATO-Ukraine Council, a new joint body where Allies and Ukraine sit as equal members to advance political dialogue, engagement, cooperation, and Ukraine’s Euro-Atlantic aspirations for membership in NATO.  It will provide for joint consultations, decision-making, and activities, and will also serve as a crisis consultation mechanism between NATO and Ukraine. 13.         The continued delivery of urgently needed non-lethal assistance to Ukraine by NATO through the Comprehensive Assistance Package (CAP) remains a priority.  Since the Madrid Summit, Allies and partners have committed over 500 million euros to the CAP.  To support Ukraine’s deterrence and defence in the short, medium, and long term, we have agreed today to further develop the CAP into a multi-year programme for Ukraine.  The assistance provided will help rebuild the Ukrainian security and defence sector and transition Ukraine towards full interoperability with NATO.  Allies will continue to fund the CAP in a sustained and predictable way.  We highly welcome and encourage partner contributions. 14.         Russia has increased its multi-domain military build-up and presence in the Baltic, Black, and Mediterranean Sea regions, and maintains significant military capabilities in the Arctic.  Russia’s more assertive posture, novel military capabilities, and provocative activities, including near NATO borders, as well as its large-scale no-notice and snap exercises, continue to threaten the security of the Euro-Atlantic area.  In the High North, its capability to disrupt Allied reinforcements and freedom of navigation across the North Atlantic is a strategic challenge to the Alliance.  NATO and Allies will continue to undertake necessary, calibrated, and coordinated activities, including by exercising relevant plans. 15.         Russia’s deepening military integration with Belarus, including the deployment of advanced Russian military capabilities and military personnel in Belarus, has implications for regional stability and the defence of the Alliance.  NATO will remain vigilant and further monitor developments closely, in particular the potential deployment of so-called private military companies to Belarus.  We call on Belarus to stop its malign activities against its neighbours, to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, and to abide by international law. 16.         Russia is modernising its nuclear forces, including its large stockpile of theatre-range weapons, and expanding its novel and disruptive dual-capable delivery systems.  It is unacceptable that Russia uses such dual-capable systems to attack civilians and critical civilian infrastructure in Ukraine.  We condemn Russia’s announced intention to deploy nuclear weapons and nuclear-capable systems on Belarusian territory, which further demonstrates how Russia’s repeated actions undermine strategic stability and overall security in the Euro-Atlantic area.  We condemn Russia’s irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and coercive nuclear signalling.  We recall the Joint Statement of the Leaders of the Five Nuclear Weapons States issued on 3 January 2022 on Preventing Nuclear War and Avoiding Arms Races.  We call on Russia to recommit – in words and deeds – to the principles enshrined in that Statement. 17.         Russia’s actions demonstrate a posture of strategic intimidation and underline the continued need for NATO to monitor all of these developments and adapt its posture as necessary.  Allies will continue to work closely together to address the threats and challenges posed by Russia and reiterate that any use of Chemical, Biological, Radiological or Nuclear weapons by Russia would be met with severe consequences. 18.         Russia has intensified its hybrid actions against NATO Allies and partners, including through proxies.  This includes interference in democratic processes, political and economic coercion, widespread disinformation campaigns, malicious cyber activities, and illegal and disruptive activities of Russian intelligence services.  We are enhancing the tools at our disposal to counter Russian hybrid actions and will ensure that the Alliance and Allies are prepared to deter and defend against hybrid attacks. 19.         We seek stability and predictability in the Euro-Atlantic area and between NATO and Russia.  NATO does not seek confrontation and poses no threat to Russia.  In light of its hostile policies and actions, we cannot consider Russia to be our partner.  Any change in our relationship depends on Russia halting its aggressive behaviour and fully complying with international law.  We remain willing to keep open channels of communication with Moscow to manage and mitigate risks, prevent escalation, and increase transparency.  At the same time, we will continue to consult on and assess the implications of Russia’s policies and actions for our security, and respond to Russian threats and hostile actions in a united and responsible way. 20.         We categorically reject and condemn terrorism in the strongest possible terms.  Countering terrorism in all its forms and manifestations is essential to our collective defence.  NATO’s role in the fight against terrorism contributes to all three core tasks of the Alliance and is integral to the Alliance’s 360-degree approach to deterrence and defence.  Allies will continue to fight this threat with determination, resolve, and in solidarity.   As part of a broader effort to better respond collectively to this threat, we will further develop Allies’ capabilities, and continue to engage with the Global Coalition to Defeat Da’esh and with partner countries in order to support their efforts and to help them build their capacity to counter terrorism.  NATO will also continue to engage, as appropriate, with other international actors to ensure added value and complementarity. 21.         Terrorist organisations threaten the security of our populations, forces and territory.  They have expanded their networks, enhanced their capabilities and invested in new technologies to improve their reach and lethality.  We will continue to deter, defend and respond to threats and challenges posed by terrorist groups, based on a combination of prevention, protection and denial measures.  We have today tasked the Council in permanent session to update NATO’s Policy Guidelines and Action Plan on Counter-Terrorism, and reassess, in consultation with our regional partners, the areas where NATO can provide civil-military assistance to partners in this field.  Our approach to terrorism, and its causes, is in accordance with international law and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and upholds all relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions on the fight against terrorism. 22.         NATO’s southern neighbourhood, particularly the Middle East, North Africa and Sahel regions, faces interconnected security, demographic, economic, and political challenges.  These are aggravated by the impact of climate change, fragile institutions, health emergencies, and food insecurity.  This situation provides fertile ground for the proliferation of non-state armed groups, including terrorist organisations.  It also enables destabilising and coercive interference by strategic competitors.  Russia is fuelling tensions and instability across these regions.  Pervasive instability results in violence against civilians, including conflict-related sexual violence, as well as attacks against cultural property and environmental damage.  It contributes to forced displacement, fuelling human trafficking and irregular migration.  These trends pose serious transnational and humanitarian challenges and have a disproportionate impact on women, children, and minorities.  In response to the profound implications of these threats and challenges within and in the vicinity of the Euro-Atlantic area, we have today tasked the North Atlantic Council in permanent session to launch a comprehensive and deep reflection on existing and emerging threats and challenges, and opportunities for engagements with our partner nations, international organisations, and other relevant actors in the region, to be presented by our next Summit in 2024. 23.         The People’s Republic of China’s stated ambitions and coercive policies challenge our interests, security and values.  The PRC employs a broad range of political, economic, and military tools to increase its global footprint and project power, while remaining opaque about its strategy, intentions and military build-up.  The PRC’s malicious hybrid and cyber operations and its confrontational rhetoric and disinformation target Allies and harm Alliance security.  The PRC seeks to control key technological and industrial sectors, critical infrastructure, and strategic materials and supply chains.  It uses its economic leverage to create strategic dependencies and enhance its influence.  It strives to subvert the rules-based international order, including in the space, cyber and maritime domains. 24.         We remain open to constructive engagement with the PRC, including to build reciprocal transparency, with a view to safeguarding the Alliance’s security interests.  We are working together responsibly, as Allies, to address the systemic challenges posed by the PRC to Euro-Atlantic security and ensure NATO’s enduring ability to guarantee the defence and security of Allies.  We are boosting our shared awareness, enhancing our resilience and preparedness, and protecting against the PRC’s coercive tactics and efforts to divide the Alliance.  We will stand up for our shared values and the rules-based international order, including freedom of navigation. 25.         The deepening strategic partnership between the PRC and Russia and their mutually reinforcing attempts to undercut the rules-based international order run counter to our values and interests.  We call on the PRC to play a constructive role as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, to condemn Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, to abstain from supporting Russia’s war effort in any way, to cease amplifying Russia’s false narrative blaming Ukraine and NATO for Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, and to adhere to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter.  We particularly call on the PRC to act responsibly and refrain from providing any lethal aid to Russia. 26.         In 2014, at the Wales Summit Allied Heads of State and Government agreed the Defence Investment Pledge.  Since then Allies have made remarkable progress and all have increased their defence spending, developed further their forces and capabilities, and have contributed to Allied operations, missions and activities.  However, as the Strategic Concept sets out, our nations are now facing more profound security threats and challenges than at any time since the end of the Cold War. 27.         Consistent with our obligations under Article 3 of the Washington Treaty, we make an enduring commitment to invest at least 2% of our Gross Domestic Product (GDP) annually on defence.  We do so recognising more is needed urgently to sustainably meet our commitments as NATO Allies, including to fulfil longstanding major equipment requirements and the NATO Capability Targets, to resource NATO’s new defence plans and force model, as well as to contribute to NATO operations, missions and activities.  We affirm that in many cases, expenditure beyond 2% of GDP will be needed in order to remedy existing shortfalls and meet the requirements across all domains arising from a more contested security order.    28.         We commit to invest at least 20% of our defence budgets on major equipment, including related Research and Development.  We recognise this should be met in conjunction with a minimum of 2% of GDP annual defence expenditure.  We need to maintain our technological edge, and continue to modernise and reform our forces and capabilities, including through the integration of innovative technologies. 29.         We commit to contribute the necessary forces, capabilities and resources to the full range of NATO operations, missions and activities.  This includes meeting requirements for deterrence and defence, providing the forces needed to implement NATO’s defence plans and contribute to NATO crisis management operations.  Allies will ensure that our forces are ready and have the necessary personnel, equipment, training, spares, logistics, infrastructure, and stockpiles.  We commit to improve the interoperability of our national forces, including through transparent compliance with, and further development of, NATO standards and doctrines. 30.         To have the necessary capabilities, the Alliance requires a strong and capable defence industry, with resilient supply chains.  A strong defence industry across the Alliance, including a stronger defence industry in Europe and greater defence industrial cooperation within Europe and across the Atlantic, remains essential for delivering the required capabilities.  Furthermore, consistent with our commitments, obligations and processes, we will reduce and eliminate, as appropriate, obstacles to defence trade and investment among Allies. 31.         NATO is the foundation of our collective defence.  NATO’s key purpose and greatest responsibility is to ensure our collective defence, against all threats, from all directions.  NATO will continue to fulfil three core tasks: deterrence and defence; crisis prevention and management; and cooperative security.  These are complementary to ensure the collective defence and security of all Allies. 32.         Deterrence and defence are at the heart of the Alliance, underpinned by Article 5 of the Washington Treaty and an enduring transatlantic bond.  We are modernising NATO for a new era of collective defence.  We are united in our commitment and resolve to prevail against any aggressor and defend every inch of Allied territory. 33.         Guided by our sovereign decisions, and in response to the threats we face, we remain vigilant and stand together in solidarity ensuring a substantial and persistent presence of our military forces across the Alliance on land, in the air and at sea, in line with our 360-degree approach.  NATO’s deterrence and defence posture is based on an appropriate mix of nuclear, conventional and missile defence capabilities, complemented by space and cyber capabilities.  It is defensive, proportionate and fully in line with our international commitments.  We will employ military and non-military tools in a proportionate, coherent and integrated way to respond to all threats to our security in the manner, timing and in the domain of our choosing. 34.         In response to a radically changed security environment, we are strengthening NATO’s collective defence, against all threats, from all directions.  We cannot discount the possibility of an attack against Allies’ sovereignty and territorial integrity.  Since 2014, and in particular at the 2022 Madrid Summit, we have taken decisions to strengthen our posture and set a clear trajectory for accelerated military adaptation.  Today, we have agreed significant measures to further enhance NATO’s deterrence and defence posture in all domains, including strengthening forward defences and the Alliance’s ability to rapidly reinforce any Ally that comes under threat. We will fully implement these measures and deny any potential adversary any possible opportunities for aggression.  We have: 35.         We welcome the rapid progress towards the full integration of Finland into NATO’s deterrence and defence, and have agreed to complete this process as soon as possible. 36.         We need a robust and resilient defence industry able to sustainably meet the need of significantly strengthened collective defence. We have endorsed a Defence Production Action Plan, and its action items.  This Plan will ensure long-term NATO engagement across the Alliance based on the principles of transparency, equitable treatment and inclusive participation.  With this Plan, and in support of Allies’ own priorities, we are committed to leveraging the Alliance’s role as a convener, standard-setter, requirement setter and aggregator, and delivery enabler to promote sustainable defence industrial capacity.  This will be underpinned by a renewed and urgent focus on interoperability and improving materiel standardization to ensure that our forces can operate seamlessly together, with an initial focus on land munitions.  The Plan will ensure our understanding of defence industry across the Alliance, including small and medium-size enterprises, help aggregate demand to meet NATO’s capability targets, encourage multinational cooperation and more agile procurement, and enhance transparency with industry. 37.         Our robust military capabilities are critical for NATO’s deterrence and defence.  We continue to invest more in advanced and interoperable capabilities across all domains, placing particular emphasis on combat-capable, predominantly heavy, high-end forces and capabilities.  These will reflect the requirements of NATO’s defence plans and other tasks.  We will ensure that these capabilities are resourced to maintain the required high levels of readiness.  We continue to improve the deployability, interoperability, standardisation, responsiveness, force integration and support of our forces in order to conduct and sustain high-intensity operations, including crisis response operations, in demanding environments.  The NATO Defence Planning Process plays a key role in the sharing of risks and responsibilities, and we reaffirm our commitment to providing our respective shares of the capabilities required by the Alliance to fulfil our three core tasks.  Our capability development plans will ensure that we maintain our technological edge, recognising the challenges and opportunities presented by emerging and disruptive technologies, while ensuring their timely integration.  We have also decided to significantly increase our stockpiles of certain battle-decisive munitions. 38.         We will continue to strengthen and regularly exercise the Alliance’s ability to rapidly reinforce any Ally that comes under threat.  Exercises are a key way of demonstrating the Alliance’s resolve and capability.  We are adapting and streamlining our decision-making processes and improving the effectiveness of our alert and response system. 39.         We will individually and collectively deliver the full range of forces, capabilities, plans, resources, assets and infrastructure needed for deterrence and defence, including for high-intensity, multi-domain warfighting against nuclear-armed peer competitors.  Accordingly, we will strengthen training and exercises that simulate conventional and, for Allies concerned, a nuclear dimension of a crisis or conflict, facilitating greater coherence between conventional and nuclear components of NATO’s deterrence and defence posture across all domains and the entire spectrum of conflict. 40.         We have accelerated our efforts, both nationally and in NATO, to ensure the enablement of SACEUR’s Area of Responsibility, including logistics, and to improve our ability to support the reinforcement and sustainment of Allied forces into, across, and from the entire Alliance territory, including through prepositioning of ammunition and equipment.  As part of the enablement of SACEUR’s Area of Responsibility, we are taking forward our work on fuel supply distribution arrangements, as the timely provision of fuel to NATO’s military forces where required in Europe underpins the Alliance’s readiness and responsiveness.  We recognise that the changed security environment represents a more demanding challenge to the Alliance’s collective logistics and we will make political and military efforts to address this challenge, recognising that credible deterrence and defence relies on adequate logistics capability.  Effective military mobility is essential for enablement and further progress is required.  Efforts to ensure a coherent approach and synergies between NATO and the EU in the area of military mobility should be pursued. 41.         NATO Integrated Air and Missile Defence (IAMD) remains key for credible deterrence and defence, and the indivisible security and freedom of action of the Alliance, including NATO’s capability to reinforce, and to provide a strategic response.  NATO IAMD is an essential and continuous mission in peacetime, crisis, and times of conflict.  NATO IAMD incorporates all measures to contribute to deter any air and missile threat or to nullify or reduce their effectiveness.  This mission is conducted in a 360-degree approach, and tailored to address all air and missile threats emanating from all strategic directions from state and non-state actors. 42.         Allied IAMD deployments, including those on the Eastern flank in response to the Russian aggression against Ukraine, as well as exercises and training demonstrate Allied solidarity and resolve.  Based on the Strategic Concept, the new baseline for deterrence and defence posture agreed in Madrid in 2022, and the new generation of defence plans, NATO continues to strengthen its IAMD by improving IAMD readiness, responsiveness, effectiveness, and interoperability, as well as availability of airspace.  NATO and Allies continue to improve IAMD capabilities, such as surveillance, interceptors, and command and control.  We will continue to take into account the increasingly diverse and challenging air and missile threats ranging from simple Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to sophisticated hypersonic missiles. 43.         The fundamental purpose of NATO’s nuclear capability is to preserve peace, prevent coercion and deter aggression.  Nuclear weapons are unique.  As long as nuclear weapons exist, NATO will remain a nuclear alliance.  NATO’s goal is a safer world for all; we seek to create the security environment for a world without nuclear weapons.  The circumstances in which NATO might have to use nuclear weapons are extremely remote.  Any employment of nuclear weapons against NATO would fundamentally alter the nature of a conflict.  The Alliance has the capabilities and resolve to impose costs on an adversary that would be unacceptable and far outweigh the benefits that any adversary could hope to achieve. 44.         The strategic nuclear forces of the Alliance, particularly those of the United States, are the supreme guarantee of the security of the Alliance.  The independent strategic nuclear forces of the United Kingdom and France have a deterrent role of their own and contribute significantly to the overall security of the Alliance.  These Allies’ separate centres of decision-making contribute to deterrence by complicating the calculations of potential adversaries.  NATO’s nuclear deterrence posture also relies on the United States’ nuclear weapons forward-deployed in Europe.  National contributions, by Allies concerned, of dual-capable aircraft, as well as the provision of conventional forces and military capabilities in support of NATO’s nuclear deterrence mission, remain central to this effort. 45.         NATO will take all necessary steps to ensure the credibility, effectiveness, safety and security of the nuclear deterrent mission.  This includes continuing to modernise NATO’s nuclear capability and updating planning to increase flexibility and adaptability of the Alliance’s nuclear forces, while exercising strong political control at all times.  The Alliance reaffirms the imperative to ensure the broadest possible participation by Allies concerned in NATO’s nuclear burden-sharing arrangements to demonstrate Alliance unity and resolve. 46.         The Alliance is committed to ensuring greater integration and coherence of capabilities and activities across all domains and the spectrum of conflict, while reaffirming the unique and distinct role of nuclear deterrence.  NATO will continue to maintain credible deterrence, strengthen its strategic communications, enhance the effectiveness of its exercises and reduce strategic risks.  NATO is ready and able to deter aggression and manage escalation risks in a crisis that has a nuclear dimension. 47.         Missile defence can complement the role of nuclear weapons in deterrence; it cannot substitute them.  The aim and political principles of NATO Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) remain unchanged from the 2010 Lisbon Summit.  NATO BMD is purely defensive and is aimed at countering ballistic missile threats emanating from outside of the Euro-Atlantic area.  Allies remain committed to the full development of NATO BMD, to pursue the Alliance’s collective defence and to provide full coverage and protection for all NATO European populations, territory, and forces against the increasing threat posed by the proliferation of ballistic missiles. 48.         NATO BMD is based on voluntary national contributions, including the US European Phased Adaptive Approach assets in Romania, Türkiye, Spain, and Poland, as well as the NATO BMD command and control, the only component eligible for common funding.  Additional voluntary national contributions will provide robustness.  We are committed to completing additional essential components of NATO BMD command and control, which is necessary for achieving the next major milestone before reaching the Full Operational Capability. 49.         Strategic stability, delivered through effective deterrence and defence, arms control and disarmament, and meaningful and reciprocal political dialogue remains essential to our security.  Arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation strongly contribute to the Alliance’s objectives.  Allies’ efforts on arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation aim to reduce risk and enhance security, transparency, verification, and compliance.  We will pursue all elements of strategic risk reduction, including promoting confidence building and predictability through dialogue, increasing understanding, and establishing effective crisis management and prevention tools.  These efforts will take the prevailing security environment and the security of all Allies into account and complement the Alliance’s deterrence and defence posture.  We will make use of NATO as a platform for in-depth discussion and close consultations on arms control efforts.    50.         Arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation have made and should continue to make an essential contribution to achieving the Alliance’s security objectives and for ensuring strategic stability and our collective security.  NATO has a long track record of doing its part on disarmament and non-proliferation.  After the end of the Cold War, NATO dramatically reduced the number of nuclear weapons stationed in Europe and its reliance on nuclear weapons in NATO strategy.  Allies remain collectively determined to uphold and support existing disarmament, arms control, and non-proliferation agreements and commitments.  We will further strengthen arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation, as a key element of Euro-Atlantic security, taking into account the prevailing security environment and the security of all Allies. 51.         Russia’s violations and selective implementation of its arms control obligations and commitments have contributed to the deterioration of the broader security landscape.  We condemn Russia’s purported suspension of the New START treaty and failure to comply with its legally-binding obligations under the Treaty.  We call on Russia to return to full implementation of the Treaty as well as to act responsibly and engage constructively to reduce strategic and nuclear risks.  We also condemn Russia’s decision to withdraw from the landmark Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, which further demonstrates Russia’s continued disregard for arms control, and is the latest in a series of actions to undermine Euro-Atlantic security.  Allies urge Russia to implement its commitments and obligations, and to use the remaining time before its withdrawal to reconsider its decision.  Allies will continue to consult on the implications of Russia’s withdrawal from the CFE Treaty and its impact on the security of the Alliance. 52.         The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) remains the essential bulwark against the spread of nuclear weapons.  It is the cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime and disarmament architecture, the only credible path to nuclear disarmament, and the framework for international cooperation in sharing the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, science and technology.  Allies remain strongly committed to the full implementation of the NPT across its three pillars, including Article VI.  Russia blocking consensus at the Tenth NPT Review Conference was irresponsible.  We call on all NPT States Parties to work together to implement and strengthen the NPT in the current NPT Review Cycle.  We underline the urgent need to bring the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty into force.  We call for the immediate commencement and early conclusion of negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament of a treaty banning the production of fissile material for use in nuclear weapons or other explosive devices in accordance with Conference on Disarmament report CD/1299 and the mandate contained therein.  We call on all states that have not yet done so to declare and maintain voluntary moratoria on the production of fissile material for use in nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. 53.         NATO Allies support the ultimate goal of a world without nuclear weapons, in full accordance with all provisions of the NPT, achieved in an effective and verifiable way that promotes international stability and which is based on the principle of undiminished security for all.  NATO’s nuclear burden-sharing arrangements have always been fully consistent with the NPT. 54.         We reiterate that the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) stands in opposition to and is inconsistent and incompatible with the Alliance’s nuclear deterrence policy, is at odds with the existing non-proliferation and disarmament architecture, risks undermining the NPT, and does not take into account the current security environment.  The TPNW does not change the legal obligations on our countries with respect to nuclear weapons.  We do not accept any argument that the TPNW reflects or in any way contributes to the development of customary international law.   We call on our partners and all other countries to reflect realistically on the ban treaty’s impact on international peace and security, including on the NPT, and join us in working to improve collective security through tangible and verifiable measures that can reduce strategic risks and enable lasting progress on nuclear disarmament. 55.         The PRC is rapidly expanding and diversifying its nuclear arsenal with more warheads and a larger number of sophisticated delivery systems to establish a nuclear triad, while failing to engage in meaningful transparency or good faith efforts to achieve nuclear arms control or risk reduction.  We oppose any attempt to produce or support the production of plutonium for military programmes under the guise of civilian programmes, which undermines the objectives of the NPT.  We urge the PRC to engage in strategic risk reduction discussions and to promote stability through greater transparency with regard to its nuclear weapon policies, plans and capabilities. 56.         We reiterate our clear determination that Iran must never develop a nuclear weapon.  We remain deeply concerned about Iran’s escalation of its nuclear programme.  We call on Iran to fulfil its legal obligations under its Non-Proliferation Treaty-required safeguards agreement and political commitments regarding nuclear non-proliferation without further delay.  The fulfilment by Iran of these obligations and commitments is crucial to allow the IAEA to provide credible assurances of the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme. We also call on Iran to stop all ballistic missile activities inconsistent with UNSCR 2231. 57.         We condemn in the strongest terms the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s (DPRK) WMD and ballistic missile programmes which violate multiple UN Security Council Resolutions.  We reiterate that the DPRK must abandon its nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programmes, and any other weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programmes, in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner.  We urge the DPRK to return to, and fully comply with, the NPT and IAEA safeguards.  We call on the DPRK to accept the repeated offers of dialogue put forward by all parties concerned, including Japan, the United States, and the Republic of Korea. 58.         The potential use of Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) materials or weapons against NATO by hostile state and non-state actors remains a central and evolving threat to our security.  We are implementing NATO’s new CBRN defence policy, as agreed at the Madrid Summit, and are investing in the military capabilities required to effectively operate, fight and prevail in any environment, and to ensure our national and collective resilience against CBRN risks and threats. 59.         NATO safeguards the freedom and security of all its members using both political and military means.  The evolving security environment increasingly requires that NATO will take a structured and tailored approach that uses non-military and military tools in a deliberate, coherent, and sustained manner, throughout the full spectrum of peace, crisis and conflict.  NATO uses a variety of non-military tools which support the Alliance’s three core tasks.  It also continues to serve as a platform for enhancing the coherent use of these tools by Allies, under their own authority and control, and alongside other international actors.  We will continue to strengthen effective, clear, and convincing strategic communication. 60.         As the war in Europe has fundamentally shifted the nature of the Euro-Atlantic security environment, the emphasis on intelligence has become even more prominent and essential to Alliance decision-making and strategic planning.  The value of the NATO intelligence enterprise comes first and foremost from the Allied intelligence and security services working closely together to share intelligence and continue to ensure that the Alliance has a comprehensive understanding of the global strategic picture.  To that end, Allies’ intelligence capabilities will contribute to improving NATO’s understanding of the threats, risks and challenges, and to optimising our significant and diverse analysis capabilities.  We will strengthen our intelligence cooperation within the Alliance and with partners as appropriate.  NATO and Allies will enhance their security and counter-intelligence measures to respond effectively to hostile intelligence activity. 61.         National and collective resilience are an essential basis for credible deterrence and defence and the effective fulfilment of the Alliance’s core tasks, and vital in our efforts to safeguard our societies, our populations and our shared values.  Resilience is a national responsibility and a collective commitment rooted in Article 3 of the Washington Treaty.  Today we have agreed the 2023 Alliance Resilience Objectives.  We build on the 2021 Strengthened Resilience Commitment.  The Resilience Objectives will strengthen NATO and Allied preparedness against strategic shocks and disruptions.  They will boost our national and collective ability to ensure continuity of government and of essential services to our populations, and enable civil support to military operations, in peace, crisis and conflict.  Allies will use these objectives to guide the development of their national goals and implementation plans, consistent with their respective national risk profile.  We will also work towards identifying and mitigating strategic vulnerabilities and dependencies, including with respect to our critical infrastructure, supply chains and health systems.  Allies should also promote societal resilience.  As we strengthen our efforts to build resilience, we will continue to work with our partners engaged in similar efforts, in particular the European Union, in order to make the Euro-Atlantic area and our broader neighbourhood more secure.  The actions, commitments and legal obligations of individual Allies in other international bodies also contribute to enhancing our resilience. 62.         The Alliance’s ability to fulfil its core tasks increasingly relies on the adoption of digital technologies.  Recognising the urgency of a digitally-transformed Alliance, we have endorsed a Digital Transformation Implementation Strategy to underpin our ability to conduct Multi-Domain Operations, drive interoperability across all domains, enhance situational awareness, political consultation, and employ data-driven decision-making. 63.         Emerging and disruptive technologies (EDTs) bring both opportunities and risks.  They are altering the character of conflict, acquiring greater strategic importance and becoming key arenas of global competition.  The operational importance of EDTs as well as of access to and adaptation of commercial technologies in current operations have been highlighted in the context of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine.  NATO’s strategic competitors and potential adversaries are investing heavily in technologies that can be highly effective, particularly in malign hybrid activities, and decisive in conflict.  We are accelerating our own efforts to ensure that the Alliance maintains its technological edge in emerging and disruptive technologies to retain our interoperability and military edge, including through dual-use solutions.  We are working together to adopt and integrate new technologies, cooperate with the private sector, protect our innovation ecosystems, shape standards, and commit to principles of responsible use that reflect our democratic values and human rights.  We will ensure that we act in accordance with international law and seek to build public trust.  NATO’s Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic (DIANA) has now launched its first challenges to start-ups in NATO countries.  To further develop our transatlantic innovation ecosystem, the NATO Innovation Fund, the world’s first multi-sovereign venture capital fund, will begin to invest in deep-tech in the coming months.  Complementing the recently agreed strategies on Artificial Intelligence and Autonomy, NATO will develop further strategies for key emerging and disruptive technologies, including on Quantum Technologies and on Biotechnology and Human Enhancement to address the opportunities and risks they present.    64.         We continue to face growing hybrid threats and challenges from state and non-state actors, who use hybrid activities, including through interference and the harmful use of technologies, to target our political institutions, our critical infrastructure, our societies, our democratic systems, our economies, and the security of our citizens.  We remain united in defending our open and democratic societies against these malign activities.  We reiterate that hybrid operations against Allies could reach the level of an armed attack and could lead the Council to invoke Article 5 of the Washington Treaty.  We will continue to prepare for, deter, defend against and counter hybrid threats, including by potentially deploying Counter Hybrid Support Teams.  We continue to develop comprehensive preventive and response options and stand ready to apply them to enhance resilience and deter malign actors from engaging in hybrid operations.  Individual Allies may consider, when appropriate, attributing hybrid activities and responding in a coordinated manner, recognising attribution is a sovereign national prerogative.  We will continue to address disinformation and misinformation, including through positive and effective strategic communications.  We will also continue to support our partners as they strengthen their resilience in the face of hybrid challenges. 65.         The threat to critical undersea infrastructure is real and it is developing.  We are committed to identifying and mitigating strategic vulnerabilities and dependencies with respect to our critical infrastructure, and to prepare for, deter and defend against the coercive use of energy and other hybrid tactics by state and non-state actors.  Any deliberate attack against Allies’ critical infrastructure will be met with a united and determined response; this applies also to critical undersea infrastructure.  The protection of critical undersea infrastructure on Allies’ territory remains a national responsibility, as well as a collective commitment.  NATO stands ready to support Allies if and when requested.  We have agreed to establish NATO’s Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure within NATO’s Maritime Command (MARCOM).  We also agreed to set up a network that brings together NATO, Allies, private sector, and other relevant actors to improve information sharing and exchange best practice. 66.         Cyberspace is contested at all times as threat actors increasingly seek to destabilise the Alliance by employing malicious cyber activities and campaigns.  Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine has highlighted the extent to which cyber is a feature of modern conflict.  We are countering the substantial, continuous, and increasing cyber threats, including to our democratic systems and our critical infrastructure, as well as where they are part of hybrid campaigns.  We are determined to employ the full range of capabilities in order to deter, defend against and counter the full spectrum of cyber threats, including by considering collective responses.  A single or cumulative set of malicious cyber activities could reach the level of armed attack and could lead the North Atlantic Council to invoke Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, on a case-by-case basis.  We remain committed to act in accordance with international law, including the UN Charter, international humanitarian law, and international human rights law as applicable.  We continue to promote a free, open, peaceful, and secure cyberspace, and further pursue efforts to enhance stability and reduce the risk of conflict, by ensuring that international law is respected and by supporting voluntary norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace.  Today, we endorse a new concept to enhance the contribution of cyber defence to our overall deterrence and defence posture.  It will further integrate NATO’s three cyber defence levels – political, military, and technical – ensuring civil-military cooperation at all times through peacetime, crisis, and conflict, as well as engagement with the private sector, as appropriate.  Doing so will enhance our shared situational awareness.  Strengthening our cyber resilience is key to making our Alliance more secure and better able to mitigate the potential for significant harm from cyber threats.  Today we restate and enhance our Cyber Defence Pledge and have committed to ambitious new national goals to further strengthen our national cyber defences as a matter of priority, including critical infrastructures.  We have launched NATO’s new Virtual Cyber Incident Support Capability (VCISC) to support national mitigation efforts in response to significant malicious cyber activities.  This provides Allies with an additional tool for assistance.  We will further seek to develop mutually beneficial and effective partnerships as appropriate, including with partner countries, international organisations, industry, and academia, furthering our efforts to enhance international stability in cyberspace.  Complementing our existing exchanges, we will hold the first comprehensive NATO Cyber Defence Conference in Berlin this November, bringing together decision-makers across the political, military, and technical levels. 67.         Space plays a critical role for the security and prosperity of our nations.  Space is also an increasingly contested domain, marked by irresponsible behaviour, malicious activities, and the growth of counterspace capabilities by NATO’s potential adversaries and strategic competitors.  Maintaining secure use and unfettered access to space is key to effective deterrence and defence.  As part of our work on space as an operational domain, we are accelerating the integration of space into planning, exercising and executing joint and multi-domain operations in peacetime, crisis, and conflict in order to ensure space effects are coordinated across all domains.  We have committed to enhancing the sharing of our space data, products and services within NATO in support of the Alliance’s requirements and defence plans.  We welcome the ongoing efforts on the Alliance Persistent Surveillance from Space (APSS) multinational programme, which will improve NATO’s intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capacity.  We welcome the establishment of the NATO Space Centre of Excellence in France.  Allies are committed to upholding international law and we will continue to support international efforts to reduce space threats by promoting norms, rules, and principles of responsible space behaviours.  We reaffirm that hostile operations to, from, or within space could reach the level of armed attack and could lead the North Atlantic Council to invoke Article 5 of the Washington Treaty. 68.         Energy security plays an important role in our common security.  The energy crisis intentionally exacerbated by Russia has underlined the importance of a stable and reliable energy supply and the diversification of routes, suppliers, and sources.  We will continue to develop NATO’s capacity to support national authorities in protecting critical energy infrastructure.  We are committed to ensuring secure, resilient, and sustainable energy supplies to our military forces.  As we adapt our Alliance to the ongoing energy transition, we will ensure military capability, effectiveness and interoperability.  Allies are seeking and will continue to seek diversification of their energy supplies, in line with their needs and conditions. 69.         Climate change is a defining challenge with a profound impact on Allied security facing present and future generations.  It remains a threat multiplier.  NATO is committed to becoming the leading international organisation when it comes to understanding and adapting to the impact of climate change on security.  We will continue to address the impact of climate change on defence and security, including through the development of innovative strategic analysis tools.  We will integrate climate change considerations into all of NATO’s core tasks, adapt our infrastructure, military capabilities and technologies ensuring resilience to future operating environments.  To contribute to the mitigation of climate change, we are committed to significantly cutting greenhouse gas emissions by the NATO political and military structures and facilities; we will also contribute to combatting climate change by improving energy efficiency, transitioning to clean energy sources, and leveraging innovative next-generation clean technologies, while ensuring military effectiveness and a credible deterrence and defence posture.  We will continue to strengthen our exchanges with partner countries, the scientific community, as well as other international and regional organisations that are active on climate change and security.  We welcome the establishment of a NATO Centre of Excellence for Climate Change and Security in Montreal. 70.         We are committed to integrating the Human Security and the Women, Peace and Security agendas across all our core tasks.  We will continue to work towards fully operationalising this objective, through robust policies and clear operational guidelines, in order to enhance our operational effectiveness and ensure synergies between the civilian and military structures.  In doing so, we are working with partners, international organisations, and civil society.  We reaffirm our commitment to an ambitious human security agenda.  Our Human Security Approach and Guiding Principles allows us to develop a more comprehensive view of the human environment, contributing to lasting peace and security.  Today, we endorse a NATO Policy on Children and Armed Conflict, and an updated Policy on Combatting Trafficking in Human Beings.  Our ongoing work on human security also includes cultural property protection. 71.         We recognise the critical importance of women’s full, equal, and meaningful participation in all aspects of peace and stability, noting the disproportionate impact that conflict has on women and girls, including through conflict-related sexual violence.  We will consistently continue to implement our Policy on Women, Peace and Security, and, in this context, we will advance gender equality and integrate gender perspectives and foster the principles of the Women, Peace and Security agenda set out by the UN Security Council in all that we do, including in NATO operations, missions, activities, and our work on emerging challenges.  We will assess and update NATO’s Policy on Women, Peace and Security. 72.         NATO’s partnerships are, and will continue to be, essential to the way NATO works.  They play an important role in supporting NATO’s three core tasks and our 360-degree security approach.  We are grateful to our partners for their significant contributions to NATO’s situational awareness, operations, missions, and activities, including Trust Fund projects.  The current security environment highlights the significance of partnerships.  They are crucial to protect the global commons and enhance our resilience.  We will strengthen our ties with partners that share the Alliance’s values and interest in upholding the rules-based international order.  We will continue to strengthen political dialogue and practical cooperation with partners, based on mutual respect, benefit and interest of both Allies and partners.  This contributes to stability beyond our borders and enhances our security at home.  We will increase outreach to countries in our broader neighbourhood and across the globe and remain open to engagement with any country or organisation, when doing so could bolster our mutual security.  We remain committed to the principles underpinning our relations with our partners, and have taken steps to make our partnerships more strategic, more coherent and more effective.  We will discuss common approaches to global security challenges where NATO’s interests are affected, share perspectives through deeper political engagement, and seek concrete areas for cooperation to address shared security concerns.  In line with our Comprehensive Approach Action Plan, we will continue to pursue coherence within NATO’s own tools and strands of work, concerted approaches with partner nations and organisations such as the UN, the EU, and the OSCE, as well as further dialogue with non-governmental organisations. 73.         The European Union remains a unique and essential partner for NATO.  Our strategic partnership is essential for the security and prosperity of our nations and of the Euro-Atlantic area.  It is built on our shared values, our determination to tackle common challenges and our unequivocal commitment to promote and safeguard peace, freedom and prosperity.  NATO recognises the value of a stronger and more capable European defence that contributes positively to transatlantic and global security and is complementary to, and interoperable with NATO.  The development of coherent, complementary and interoperable defence capabilities, avoiding unnecessary duplication, is key in our joint efforts to make the Euro-Atlantic area safer.  Such efforts, including recent developments, will lead to a stronger NATO, help enhance our common security, contribute to transatlantic burden sharing, help deliver needed capabilities, and support an overall increase in defence spending.  Non-EU Allies continue to make significant contributions to the EU’s efforts to strengthen its capacities to address common security challenges.  For the strategic partnership between NATO and the EU, non-EU Allies’ fullest involvement in EU defence efforts is essential.  We look forward to mutual steps, representing tangible progress, in this area to support a strengthened strategic partnership.  We reaffirm in their entirety all the decisions, principles, and commitments with regard to NATO and EU cooperation.  We will continue to further strengthen this partnership in a spirit of full mutual openness, transparency, complementarity, and respect for the organisations’ different mandates, decision-making autonomy and institutional integrity, and as agreed by the two organisations. 74.         In the context of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, NATO-EU cooperation has become more significant.  We have unequivocally demonstrated unity of purpose and common resolve in leveraging our complementary, coherent and mutually reinforcing roles.  NATO and EU will continue to support Ukraine.  In this respect, we welcome the establishment of the dedicated NATO-EU Staff Coordination on Ukraine.  We have also achieved tangible results in strategic communications, including the fight against disinformation, countering hybrid and cyber threats, exercises, operational cooperation, defence capabilities, defence industry and research, counter-terrorism, and defence and security capacity building.  We are further expanding our cooperation on resilience, protection of critical infrastructure, emerging and disruptive technologies, space, security implications of climate change, and geostrategic competition.  We will also continue to address the systemic challenges posed by the PRC to Euro-Atlantic security.  Political dialogue between NATO and the EU remains essential to advance NATO-EU cooperation. 75.         The Western Balkans is a region of strategic importance for NATO as highlighted by our long history of cooperation and operations.  We remain strongly committed to the security and stability of the Western Balkans by supporting reforms that advance the respective NATO and EU aspirations of the countries in the region.  We will continue to enhance our political dialogue and practical cooperation in order to support reforms, regional peace and security, and counter malign influence, including disinformation, hybrid, and cyber threats, posed by both state and non-state actors.  The region requires continued attention and commitment from the Alliance and the international community to counter these challenges.  Democratic values, the rule of law, domestic reforms, and good neighbourly relations are vital for regional cooperation and Euro-Atlantic integration, and we look to continued progress in this regard.    76.         NATO strongly supports the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a stable and secure Bosnia and Herzegovina, in accordance with the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina and other relevant international agreements.  We encourage domestic reconciliation, and urge political leaders to refrain from divisive and secessionist rhetoric and actions.  We remain committed to the country’s Euro-Atlantic aspirations.  We continue to support reform efforts, including through the newly agreed Defence Capacity Building package, NATO HQ Sarajevo, and wide-ranging cooperative security and partnership tools, and through the country’s Reform Programme with NATO.  We encourage Bosnia and Herzegovina to take advantage of NATO’s support and intensify efforts to make progress on reforms in key areas, including the much-needed political, electoral, rule of law, economic, and defence reforms, without prejudice to a final decision on NATO membership. 77.         Strengthening NATO-Serbia relations would be of benefit to the Alliance, to Serbia, and to the whole region.  We look to Serbia to engage with NATO and its neighbours in a constructive manner, including in its public communications on the mutual benefits of NATO-Serbia cooperation.  We support the EU-facilitated Dialogue and other efforts aimed at the normalisation of relations between Belgrade and Pristina, and urge the sides to seize the moment and engage in good faith towards reaching a lasting political solution.  We call on both sides to immediately de-escalate, return to dialogue, and engage constructively in implementing the agreement on the path to normalisation between Belgrade and Pristina reached recently in Brussels and Ohrid. 78.         We remain committed to NATO’s continued engagement in Kosovo, including through the NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR).  KFOR will continue to provide a safe and secure environment and freedom of movement in Kosovo in line with UNSC Resolution 1244.  The recent escalatory actions are unacceptable and we condemn the violence in northern Kosovo as well as the unprovoked attacks that caused serious injuries to NATO soldiers.  We have increased KFOR’s troop presence to respond to the recurrent tensions.  Any changes to our force posture in KFOR will remain conditions-based and not calendar driven. 79.         The Black Sea region is of strategic importance for the Alliance. This is further highlighted by Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine. We underline our continued support to Allied regional efforts aimed at upholding security, safety, stability and freedom of navigation in the Black Sea region including, as appropriate, through the 1936 Montreux Convention. We will further monitor and assess developments in the region and enhance our situational awareness, with a particular focus on the threats to our security and potential opportunities for closer cooperation with our partners in the region, as appropriate. 80.         We reiterate our support to the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Georgia within its internationally recognised borders.  We stand firm in our support for Georgia’s right to decide its own future and foreign policy course free from outside interference.  We call on Russia to withdraw the forces it has stationed in Georgia without its consent.  We further call on Russia to reverse its recognition of the Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions of Georgia; to end the militarisation of these regions and continued attempts to forcibly separate them from the rest of Georgia through the construction of border-like obstacles; and to cease the human rights violations and abuses, including arbitrary detentions, and harassments of Georgian citizens.  We highly appreciate Georgia’s substantial contributions to NATO operations, which demonstrate its commitment and capability to contribute to Euro-Atlantic security.  We remain committed to making full use of the NATO-Georgia Commission and the Annual National Programme (ANP) in deepening political dialogue and practical cooperation with Georgia.  We reiterate the decision made at the 2008 Bucharest Summit that Georgia will become a member of the Alliance with the Membership Action Plan (MAP) as an integral part of the process; we reaffirm all elements of that decision, as well as subsequent decisions.  We welcome the progress made in implementing the enhanced Substantial NATO-Georgia Package, including Crisis Management, Cyber Security, Military Engineering, and Secure Communications, as well as new initiatives in the areas of Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Defence and Training Facilities.  To advance its Euro-Atlantic aspirations, Georgia must make progress on reforms, including key democratic reforms, and make best use of the ANP. 81.         We reiterate our support for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Republic of Moldova within its internationally recognised borders and call on Russia to withdraw all of its forces stationed in the Transnistrian region without Moldova’s consent.  We stand firm in our support for Moldova’s right to decide its own future and foreign policy course free from outside interference, and fully respect Moldova’s constitutional neutrality.  NATO is stepping up political and practical support to strengthen its resilience and uphold its political independence in light of the deteriorating security environment.  Allies welcome Moldova’s efforts to promote democratic reforms and are committed to supporting Moldova as it advances its European integration.  NATO will continue to provide practical assistance through the enhanced Defence Capacity Building Package, as Moldova works to strengthen its security and defence capabilities and modernise its Armed Forces. 82.         The Middle East and Africa are regions of strategic interest.  We will deepen our political engagements and public diplomacy outreach to our long-standing partners in the Mediterranean Dialogue and Istanbul Cooperation Initiative.  We will also increase our outreach to relevant regional organisations, including the African Union and the Gulf Cooperation Council.  We are implementing the Defence Capacity Building packages for Iraq, Jordan, Mauritania, and Tunisia.  We will also explore with the Jordanian authorities the possibility of establishing a NATO Liaison Office in Amman. 83.         NATO and Allies remain committed in our support to Iraq and its ability to stabilise the country.  We recognise the continued efforts and progress of the Government of Iraq and the Iraqi Security Forces to combat ISIS/Da’esh.  We encourage further progress in Iraq’s fight against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.  Our NATO Mission Iraq continues to deliver non-combat advisory and capacity building support to the Iraqi security institutions in the greater Baghdad area, and has deepened collaboration with Iraq’s Ministry of Defence.  Based on the request from the Iraqi government, we are considering broadening NATO Mission Iraq, by evolving it to provide advice to the Iraqi Ministry of Interior on its Federal Police.  NATO Mission Iraq will continue to be demand-driven, and will be carried out with the full consent of the Iraqi authorities, in full respect of Iraq’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and in close coordination with relevant partners and international actors. 84.         Iran’s support to the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine has an impact on Euro-Atlantic security.  We call upon Iran to cease its military support to Russia, in particular its transfer of Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) which have been used to attack critical infrastructure, causing widespread civilian casualties.  We express our serious concern over Iran’s malicious activities within Allied territory.  We also call upon Iran to refrain from destabilising actions, including seizures of maritime vessels, and to play a constructive role in fostering regional stability and peace. 85.         The Indo-Pacific is important for NATO, given that developments in that region can directly affect Euro-Atlantic security.  We welcome the contribution of our partners in the Asia-Pacific region – Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and the Republic of Korea – to security in the Euro-Atlantic, including their commitment to supporting Ukraine.  We will further strengthen our dialogue and cooperation to tackle our shared security challenges, including on cyber defence, technology and hybrid, underpinned by our shared commitment to upholding international law and the rules-based international order. 86.         NATO’s engagement with other international and regional organisations, including the United Nations, the OSCE, and the African Union, contributes to international security.  We will strengthen these interactions to advance our shared interests.  We are exploring the possibility of establishing a Liaison Office in Geneva to further strengthen our engagement with the United Nations and other relevant international organisations. 87.         We will ensure that our political decisions are adequately resourced.

Nova Kakhovka: Who benefits from breaching the dam?,"Ukraine, Russia trade blame for destruction of Nova Kakhovka dam",0.5467844591673033,2023-06-06,2023-06-06,"A huge dam in the Russian-occupied area of southern Ukraine has been breached, unleashing a flood of water downstream. So who benefits from this act of vandalism?With both sides, Russia and Ukraine, blaming the other for breaching the dam, there are echoes of last year's unexplained Nordstream gas pipeline explosions. In both cases western suspicions have immediately fallen on Russia. But both times Moscow has responded with: ""It wasn't us. Why would we do this? This hurts us"".In the case of the Kakhovka dam breach Russia can point to at least two ways it damages their own interests. The flooding of land downstream has forced it to evacuate troops as well as civilians eastwards, away from Kherson and the banks of the broad River Dnipro. This will provide some limited respite for Kherson's residents who have had to live with daily Russian artillery and missile strikes.Secondly, this could affect the water supply for Russian-occupied Crimea, an arid peninsula that relies on fresh water from a canal close to the breached dam. Since it was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014 it has become a heavily fortified piece of land that both Russia and Ukraine claim as their own.But the breaching of the Kakhovka dam needs to be seen in the wider context of the Ukraine war and more specifically in the light of Ukraine's summer counter-offensive, which shows signs of already being under way.In order for this counter-offensive to succeed, it needs to break Russia's stranglehold over a swathe of territory it seized last year that connects Crimea to Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. If Ukraine can find a way to break through Russian defensive lines south of Zaporizhzhia and split that territory in two then it can isolate Crimea and achieve a major strategic victory. But the Russians have learnt a lot of lessons since their full-scale invasion in February last year. They've looked at the map, worked out where Ukraine is most likely to attack and spent the last few months building truly formidable lines of fortifications to block any Ukrainian advance towards the Sea of Azov. It's by no means certain that Ukraine was planning to send its forces around to the western side of those defences. The High Command in Kyiv sensibly keeps its cards close to its chest to keep Russia guessing. But this action, whoever did it, now makes that option far more problematic. The Dnipro was already a wide river by the time it reaches southern Ukraine and getting an armoured brigade across it, under Russian artillery, missile and drone fire would be extremely hazardous. With the dam across it now breached and huge swathes of land downstream flooded the area on the left (eastern) bank opposite Kherson has effectively become a no-go area for Ukrainian armour.One historical footnote is that Russia does have past form in this area. In 1941 Soviet troops blew up a dam over the same River Dnipro to block the advance of Nazi troops. Thousands of Soviet citizens are said to have perished in the ensuing floods.The bottom line now though, is that whoever breached the Kakhovka dam this week has upset the strategic chessboard in southern Ukraine, forcing both sides to make a number of major adjustments and possibly delaying Ukraine's next move in its long-promised counter-offensive.","Kyiv has accused Russian forces of blowing up a large dam in southern Ukraine, while the Moscow-installed official in the city of Nova Kakhovka in the Russian-controlled portion of the Kherson region blamed the structure’s destruction on Ukrainian shelling. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused “Russian terrorists” ofdestroying the dam early on Tuesdayand said the outrage “confirms for the whole world that they must be expelled from every corner of Ukrainian land”. “Not a single meter should be left to them, because they use every meter for terror,” said Zelenskyy, who called an emergency meeting of the country’s national security council. “The terrorists will not be able to stop Ukraine with water, missiles or anything else,” he wrote on Twitter. But the Kremlin accused Kyiv of sabotaging the dam to distract attention from a purportedly faltering counteroffensive against Russian forces. “We can state unequivocally that we are talking about deliberate sabotage by the Ukrainian side,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. He added that Ukraine was also aiming to deprive Russian-annexed Crimea of the freshwater it receives from the reservoir via the North Crimean Canal. Commenting on allegations that Russia was responsible for the blast, Peskov said: “We can strongly reject this. We officially declare that here we are definitely talking about deliberate sabotage from the Ukrainian side.” The dam, 30 metres (some 98 feet) tall and 3.2km (2 miles) long, was built in 1956 on the Dnipro River as part of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant. The southern command of Ukrainian armed forces said the “scale of the destruction” was being assessed as Ukraine’s military administration for the Kherson region called on people to be ready to evacuate from villages on the right bank of theDnipro River before expected flooding. “The water level is rising and everyone who is in the danger zone must: Turn off all electrical appliances; take documents and essentials; take care of loved ones and pets; follow the instructions of rescuers and policemen,” the Kherson administration said on its Telegram channel. “About 16,000 people are in the critical zone on the right bank of the Kherson region,” said Oleksandr Prokudin, head of the Kherson military administration, adding that there was already flooding in eight areas along the Dnipro River. Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the Ukrainian presidential office, accused Russia of destroying the dam in “a panic” in order to slow down the Ukrainian counteroffensive, saying the consequences of Russia’s actions were “already catastrophic”. “On a vast territory, all life will be destroyed; many settlements will be ruined; colossal damage will be done to the environment,” he said. The office of the prosecutor general said Ukraine was investigating the incident as a possible war crime and as possible criminal environmental destruction, or “ecocide”. But RIA Novosti news agency quoted the Moscow-installed mayor of Nova Kakhovka, Vladimir Leontiev, as saying the dam had been hit by shelling which he blamed on Ukraine. “There were several hits” on the dam, he said, according to the Russian news agency. “This crime cannot be written off. This is a terrorist act directed against civilians, Ukrainians did it,” he said. Al Jazeera’s Charles Stratford, reporting from Kyiv, said analysts had long seen the dam as a potential target for both sides in the war. The dam is vital for water supply and irrigation in Russian-occupied Crimea, while Russia could see its destruction as a way of making it more difficult for Ukrainian forces to cross the Dnipro River and enter Crimea in a ground offensive, Stratford said, adding that the evacuation of settlements in the area had already begun. “We are also hearing from the Ukrainians that they believe … water levels will reach a critical point around five hours from now. We also know there are ongoing evacuations from some of the settlements that are going to be affected,” he said. The Soviet-era dam in the Russian-controlled part of the Kherson region could unleash a flood across the war zone, according to Ukrainian and Russian forces. Unverified videos on social media showed a series of intense explosions around the dam. Other videos showed water surging through its remains with bystanders expressing their shock, sometimes in strong language. Ukraine controls five of the six dams along the Dnipro, which runs from the country’s northern border with Belarus down to the Black Sea and is crucial for the entire country’s drinking water and power supply. The Nova Kakhovka dam – the one furthest downstream – is controlled by Russian forces and contains an 18-cubic-kilometre (4.3-cubic-mile) reservoir which supplies water to the Crimean Peninsula, which was annexed by Russia in 2014, and to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which is also under Russian control. Ukraine’s nuclear operator Energoatom said in a Telegram statement that the blowing up of the dam “could have negative consequences for the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant”, but the situation is “controllable” at the moment. The United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency wrote on Twitter that its experts were closely monitoring the situation at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant upstream, and there was “no immediate nuclear safety risk” at the facility. The IAEA is aware of reports of damage at#Ukraine’s Kakhovka dam; IAEA experts at#ZaporizhzhyaNuclear Power Plant are closely monitoring the situation; no immediate nuclear safety risk at plant.#ZNPP — IAEA – International Atomic Energy Agency ⚛️ (@iaeaorg)June 6, 2023  Europe’s largest nuclear facility uses water from the dam to cool six reactors as well as spent fuel and emergency diesel generators. IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said in a statement that alternative sources of water near the facility should be sufficient to guarantee its safety. “A main one is the large cooling pond next to the site that by design is kept above the height of the reservoir,” he said. “It is therefore vital that this cooling pond remains intact. Nothing must be done to potentially undermine its integrity. I call on all sides to ensure nothing is done to undermine that.” According to the Ukraine War Environmental Consequences Working Group, a total collapse in the dam would wash away much of the left bank and a severe drop in the reservoir has the potential to deprive the nuclear plant of crucial cooling, as well as dry up the water supply in northern Crimea. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg called the attack “outrageous” and said it highlighted the devastation wrought by Moscow’s invasion. “The destruction of the Kakhovka dam today puts thousands of civilians at risk and causes severe environmental damage. This is an outrageous act, which demonstrates once again the brutality of Russia’s war in Ukraine,” Stoltenberg wrote on Twitter. European Union chief Charles Michel pledged to hold Russia accountable for the “war crime” of destroying civilian infrastructure. “Shocked by the unprecedented attack of the Nova Kakhovka dam. The destruction of civilian infrastructure clearly qualifies as a war crime – and we will hold Russia and its proxies accountable,” Michel wrote on social media. Lithuania’s president and the foreign ministers of Latvia and Estonia also said the incident amounted to a war crime for which Russia must be held accountable. “Today we witness an unprecedented Russian attack against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure,” Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda tweeted. “The destruction of a major dam is a crime of war that directly threatens thousands of people. Russia must be held accountable for it,” he said. “And Ukraine must win this war to stay safe!”"
Ukraine war: First underground school to be built in Kharkiv,Ukraine to build first underground school to protect from Russian air raids,0.5463644185146406,2023-10-02,2023-10-03,"Ukraine's first underground school will be built in the north-eastern city of Kharkiv, Mayor Ihor Terekhov has said. ""Such a shelter will allow thousands of children to continue their in-person education safely even during missile threats,"" he said.Rocket attacks hit the Kharkiv region again on Monday - a regular occurrence.Ukraine says more than 360 educational facilities have been destroyed and over 3,000 damaged since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022.According to the UN children agency Unicef, only a third of Ukraine's schoolchildren currently study in-person, amid continuing deadly Russian missile and drone attacks as well as shelling.Many of those pupils have been forced to attend classes in underground metro stations and other makeshift shelters - often without proper heating.Last week, the EU's Fundamental Rights Agency said many schools in the 27-member bloc were struggling to integrate children who have fled the war in Ukraine. It said there were currently about 1.3 million Ukrainian children in the EU.In Sunday's post on social media, the Kharkiv mayor announced that ""it is here that we plan to build the first underground school in Ukraine"".Mr Terekhov said the school ""will meet the most modern requirements for defensive buildings"".And he stressed that the city authorities ""will not reduce educational expenditure by a single hryvnia [Ukraine's currency] this year or next year, despite the lack of budget funds"".The mayor gave no details on when the underground school would open, and how many pupils would be able to study there.Last month, more than 1,000 Kharkiv pupils started their new school year at five underground stations that were turned into the so-called ""metro-schools"".The students are ferried by buses, and study in two shifts: the early one starts at 09:00 local time, followed by the late one at 13:00. Police and rescuers are on duty at each underground station.""Lessons in the metro. Could you ever imagine that Ukrainian children will study in the underground? This is our reality now,"" Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said at the time.Kharkiv - Ukraine's second-largest city located only 30km (19 miles) from the Russian border - was heavily bombed during the first weeks of Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion launched in February 2022.Local residents even witnessed fierce street fighting in the city - when Russian troops attempted to capture Kharkiv.They were eventually pushed back during a lightning Ukrainian counter-offensive last autumn.","Ukraine plans to build its first fully underground school in theeastern city of Kharkivto shield students from Russian bomb and missile attacks, the city’s mayor said. Parts ofKharkiv City, which is located less than 35km (20 miles) from the Russian border, have been subjected to nearly daily Russian aerial attacks, which can strike before residents have time to reach underground shelters. “We are planning to build Ukraine’s first underground school, which will address the most modern regulatory requirements for protective structures,” Kharkiv’s Mayor Ihor Terekhov wrote on the Telegram messaging app. “This shelter will allow thousands of children in Kharkiv to continue safe, in-person education even during missile threats,” Terekhov said. The mayor did not provide details on when the school will open but noted that authorities in Kharkiv would not reduce spending on education in the 2023-24 period, “despite the lack of funds from the budget”, the independent, Russian-language news site Meduza reported on Tuesday.     While Ukrainian schools in front-line areas have been forced to move online throughout the war, Kharkiv organised some 60 separate classrooms throughout its metro stations before the beginning of the new school year on September 1, creating space for more than 1,000 children to study safely. Ukraine’s Ministry of Education says that 363 educational institutions have been destroyed and nearly 3,800 damaged throughout the country since the war began with Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Kharkiv, which is Ukraine’s second-largest city, had a pre-war population of more than 1.4 million. Oleh Synyehubov, the governor of the Kharkiv region of which the city of Kharkiv is the administrative centre, said that in the 24 hours to Monday, one civilian was killed and several houses damaged as a result of Russia’s shelling and rocket attacks."
Tucker Carlson interviews Russia's Putin - Kremlin,Decoding Putin’s ‘obsessive ideas’ in the Tucker Carlson interview,0.5463044463358679,2024-02-08,2024-02-09,"Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson has interviewed Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, the Kremlin says.Carlson said earlier on X he wanted to do the interview because ""Americans have a right to know all they can about a war they are implicated in"".It's Mr Putin's first one-on-one interview with a Western journalist since the full-scale war in Ukraine.The interview will be broadcast at 18:00 EST (23:00 GMT) on Thursday, Carlson announced.He said it would air on his website, tuckercarlson.com. He had initially promised to upload the interview live and unedited to his X account. Elon Musk, who owns the platform, had ""promised not to suppress or block the interview"".Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the meeting had been recorded on Tuesday.Ukraine's deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said: ""The only interview that is safe in this situation is the interrogation in The Hague.""Her remark referred to an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC), accusing Vladimir Putin of war crimes and the unlawful deportation of children from Ukraine to Russia.Tucker Carlson's visit to Moscow has been reported on voraciously in Russian state media, with near-constant coverage of his every move.""There are risks to doing an interview like this, obviously, so we've thought about it over many months,"" Carlson said on his announcement video.Carlson added that he had paid for the trip to Russia himself, and wanted to do the interview because ""most Americans are not informed"" on the conflict which is ""reshaping the world"" - blaming the mainstream media.Since the war in Ukraine began, he said, Western journalists had interviewed Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky - whom he has previously called a ""dictator"" - many times.But they were ""fawning pep sessions"" aimed at amplifying Mr Zelensky's demand to get the US more and more involved in the war, Carlson insisted. ""That is not journalism - it is government propaganda.""Meanwhile, ""not a single Western journalist has bothered to interview"" Vladimir Putin, Carlson said.Steve Rosenberg, the BBC's Russia Editor, posted that the BBC has ""lodged several requests with the Kremlin in the last 18 months. Always a 'no' for us"".The FT's Moscow bureau chief, Max Seddon, said it was quite something to complain that not enough American journalists were reporting on the Russian side of the invasion, when two American journalists were ""in jail right now for doing just that"". The Wall Street Journal's Evan Gershkovich and Alsu Kurmasheva of Radio Free Europe have both been held in pre-trial detention since last year.Russian journalist Yevgenia Albats pointed out that she and hundreds of her colleagues had had to go into exile to keep reporting on the war, while Carlson was ""shooting from the $1,000 Ritz suite in Moscow"".Russian journalists are under extreme reporting restrictions - local media are banned from calling it a ""war"": it is meant to be called a ""special military operation"".Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine has devastated the country and its people. The United Nations has said that Russian forces are responsible for rapes, ""widespread"" torture and killings in Ukraine.Russia has also annexed four more regions of Ukraine, after its illegal takeover of Crimea in 2014.Tucker Carlson has been an outspoken defender of Mr Putin since the war began. Just before Russia's invasion, he claimed that ""hating Putin has become the central purpose of America's foreign policy"", but urged his viewers to ask themselves why. ""Has Putin ever called me a racist? Has he threatened to get me fired for disagreeing with him?"" Carlson said as Russian troops started to mass on Ukraine's border. ""These are fair questions, and the answer to all of them is: No. Vladimir Putin didn't do any of that.""After Russia had invaded, he changed his tone slightly during a different show, saying ""Vladimir Putin started this war... He is to blame for what we're seeing tonight in Ukraine"".Tucker Carlson was one of America's top-rated cable TV hosts - but he abruptly left Fox News last year. While at the US network, his shows frequently set the agenda for conservatives and, by extension, the Republican party.He was hugely influential as the anchor of a primetime political talk show between 2016 and 2023 and has since launched a show on X.","Russian President Vladimir Putin has told conservative US journalist Tucker Carlson that ending Moscow’s almost two-year-old invasion of Ukraine is “simple”. In his first interview with a Western reporter since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began two years ago, the Kremlin handpicked Carlson, a former Fox News superstar-turned-online commentator. The reason is obvious – Carlson has characterised the Russia-Ukraine war as a “border dispute”, called on Americans to cut off multibillion aid packages to Kyiv, and compared Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to a “rat” and a “pimp”. During the two-hour interview recorded in a Kremlin audience hall with gilded furniture, Carlson did not pressure Putin the way he used to sandbag the pro-Democrat guests on the Fox News show he wasfired from last year. Putin’s goal appears obvious – he wanted Carlson to urge Republicans to stop supporting Ukraine and concentrate on domestic problems. “You have issues on the border, issues with migration, issues with the national debt,” Putin told Carlson, who looked gullible and sheepish for most of their sit-down. “You have nothing better to do, so you should fight in Ukraine? Wouldn’t it be better to negotiate with Russia?” When Carlson asked whether Putin could just call US President Joe Biden to “work it out”, Putin refused – but said the solution was “very simple”. “If you really want to stop fighting, you need to stop supplying weapons. It will be over within a few weeks. That’s it. Then we can agree on some terms,” he said. Carlson did not even try to refute Putin’s outlandish and ungrounded claims. One was Putin’s belief that elected leaders do not run the United States. “So, twice you’ve described US presidents making decisions and then being undercut by their agency heads. So, it sounds like you’re describing a system that’s not run by the people who are elected in your telling,” Carlson said. “That’s right,” Putin said without offering further explanation – and Carlson readily agreed. Then he asked Putin who was behind the 2022explosionin the Baltic Sea that damagedNord Stream, a natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany that was crucial for Moscow’s coffers. Carlson called it “the biggest act of industrial terrorism ever”, but did not dispute Putin’s claim that it was the CIA that had allegedly blown up the pipeline – and presented no concrete evidence whatsoever. Putin began the interview with a lengthy lecture on Eastern Europe’s history, in which he reiterated the Kremlin’s manipulative view onKyivan Rus, a medieval superpower whose disintegration spawned today’s Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. Carlson seemed completely ignorant about the issue – and just kept nodding in bewilderment when Putin told him about a Viking prince named Ruric whose descendants ruled Kyivan Rus. One of them, Prince Vladimir, converted to Orthodox Christianity a millennium ago. According to Putin’s logic, Russia was the only legitimate successor to Kyivan Rus, and the very idea of Ukraine was “invented” by czarist Russia’s archrival – Austria. “Before World War I, Austrian general staff relied on the ideas of Ukrainianisation and started actively promoting the ideas of Ukraine and the Ukrainianisation,” Putin said. To Carlson’s audience and many in the West, the lecture may seem boring and irrelevant. But to Ukrainians, Putin’s interpretation of events is a sobering and threatening reminder that the Kremlin denies Ukraine’s very right to exist. “Because all of these anecdotes about Prince Vladimir and Rurik have to tell all sceptics just one thing – this man has obsessive ideas,” said Maria Kucherenko, from Come Back Alive, a Kyiv-based charity. “And he won’t stop at anything to make them real,” she told Al Jazeera. Ukrainian officials and public figures who have met with Putin face to face have long maintained that the Russian president is determined to subjugate and annihilate Ukraine no matter what. “He is tough and he behaves like he has this almost divine power, over Ukraine in particular,” Yuriy Vitrenko, who headed Naftogaz, Ukraine’s state energy company, at the time, told this reporter in 2021 recalling his encounters with Putin. Putin reiterated his old claims that today’s Ukraine is an “artificial state” created by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin who annexed areas in Poland, Hungary and Romania making them part of Soviet Ukraine. Putin also suggested that Hungary, whose nationalist helmsman Viktor Orban remains the most pro-Russian leader within the European Union, “has the right to take back its lands.” An observer compared Putin’s intention to those of Nazi dicatator Adolf Hitler who triggered World War II by annexing areas in Eastern Europe that were populated by ethnic Germans. “I think that the response to his Hitlerism on the part of North American and European elites will resolutely be harsh and will lead to more military aid to Ukraine,” Nikolay Mitrokhin of Germany’s Bremen University told Al Jazeera. “Here Putin worked for Biden by trying to animate Trump’s audience.” To other Ukrainian observers, the interview offered nothing but tired Kremlin tropes. “The only remarkable thing in this interview is the size of the table – it’s tiny! The rest we have seen and heard a gazillion times,” Svetlana Chunikhina, vice president of the Association of Political Psychologists, a group in Kyiv, told Al Jazeera. “Tucker goddamned Carlson served very well as a microphone stand for the crazy maniac who for two hours rambled about how he loves to kill Ukrainians.” To a Russian observer, the interview is a Kremlin public relations stunt designed to convince average Russians that Putin’s war did not turn their nation into an international pariah spurned by the West. “They want to show that Russia doesn’t confront the civilised world but only separate elites within it. To sort of emphasise that there are other elites, and here’s a well-known journalist interviewing [Putin],” said Sergey Biziyukin, an exiled opposition activist from the western Russian city of Ryazan. “And that once [these elites] win elections, the West will admit that Russia is right,” he told Al Jazeera referring to Donald Trump’s possible victory in the November presidential vote and to the recent success of several nationalist and far-right groups in Europe. The interview’s timing was critical for Ukraine. On Wednesday, Republicans blocked a multibillion aid package that was critical for Kyiv – while Zelenskyy announced his highly divisive decision to fireValerii Zaluzhnyi, the highly trusted and influential top general. However, to Ukrainian servicemen, the interview is nothing but a demonstration of weakness. “They’re two losers trying to support each other, trying to voice their conspiracy theories,” said Valentin, a Ukrainian drone operator stationed in the eastern region of Donetsk who watched parts of the interview on his cellphone. “They can’t face the truth about Ukraine that is real and will prevail,” he told Al Jazeera by phone."
Ukraine war: US says Russia using North Korea ballistic missiles,"Russia used North Korean missiles in Ukraine, US says",0.5452971447804855,2024-01-05,2024-01-04,"Russia has used ballistic missiles and launchers supplied by North Korea in its war on Ukraine, the US has said.National Security Council spokesman John Kirby called it a ""significant and concerning escalation"" relating to Pyongyang's support for Russia.He said the US would raise the matter at the UN Security Council and impose additional sanctions on those working to facilitate arms transfers.Moscow has denied any such collaboration.Hours after the White House made the accusations, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for missile launch vehicle production to be expanded in the country.The North Korean leader visited Russia to discuss potential military co-operation in September. The US has previously accused Pyongyang of supplying Russia with weapons, but this is the first time US intelligence has shared details about ballistic missiles - self-guided rockets that can reach targets 900km (500 miles) away.It is unclear what North Korea will get in return for providing the weapons to Russia. Some Western countries have raised concerns over the potential transfer of weapons or military technologies to Pyongyang.In 2017, a report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies think tank suggested that North Korea was able to quickly develop new missiles by obtaining a Soviet RD-250 rocket engine from illicit channels operating in Russia or Ukraine. Ukraine denied the allegation and said Russia was to blame.But that year, North Korea was able to rapidly expand its missile arsenal, introducing two new systems: the medium-range Hwasong-12 and the intercontinental Hwasong-14.Speaking during a White House press briefing on Thursday, Mr Kirby said Russia's procurement of ballistic missiles from North Korea was a direct violation of numerous UN Security Council resolutions.""We will demand that Russia be held accountable for yet again violating its international obligations,"" he said.He also said the US believed Russia was planning on purchasing close-range missiles from Iran, but that it had not done so yet.The UK said it ""strongly condemns"" Russia's use of ballistic missiles sourced from North Korea in Ukraine.""North Korea is subject to a robust sanctions regime, and we will continue to work with our partners to ensure that North Korea pays a high price for supporting Russia's illegal war in Ukraine,"" a spokesperson for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said.In his briefing, Mr Kirby also urged US Congress to approve extra US funding for Ukraine ""without delay"".""The most effective response to Russia's horrific violence against the Ukrainian people is to continue to provide Ukraine with vital air defence capabilities and other types of military equipment,"" he said.""Iran and the DPRK [North Korea] are standing with Russia. Ukrainians deserve to know that the American people and this government will continue to stand with them.""The last US military aid package to Ukraine, worth some $250m (Â£195m), was approved by the White House on 27 December.Talks on further funding have stalled in Congress because of a lack of support among Republicans, who insist that tougher security measures on the US-Mexico border must be part of any military aid deal.Ukraine has warned that its war effort and the country's public finances are at risk if further Western aid does not come soon.","The United States has said that Russia is using ballistic missiles from North Korea and is seeking close-range ballistic missiles from Iran. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said on Thursday that recently declassified intelligence found that North Korea had provided Moscow with the weapons, at least one of which was fired into Ukraine on December 30, landing in an open field in the Zaporizhia region. Russia also launched “multiple” of the North Korean missiles onTuesdayduring an overnight attack, he added. Kirby also said that a Russia-Iran deal had not been completed but that the US “is concerned that Russia’s negotiations to acquire close-range ballistic missiles from Iran are actively advancing”. He said Washington and its allies will now raise the matter at the United Nations Security Council as it signals a breach of US sanctions against North Korea. The Biden administration has repeatedly looked to make the case that the Kremlin has become dependent on North Korea and Iran for the weapons it needs to continue its military operation in Ukraine and has disclosed findings it says prove that. So far, North Korea and Iran are largely isolated on the international stage for their nuclear programmes and human rights records. In October, the White House said that North Korea had delivered more than 1,000 containers of military equipment and munitions to Moscow. Britain on Thursday condemned Russia’s use of North Korean missiles in recent attacks against Ukraine. “We urge North Korea to cease its arms supply to Russia,” the UK’s Foreign Office spokesperson said in a statement. Earlier on Thursday, Ukraine announced that its air force had conducted a raid on a Russian command post near the occupied city of Sevastopol and hit a military unit in a separate attack on the Crimean Peninsula. Air Force Commander Mykola Oleshchuk posted a video on the Telegram app showing smoke rising from an explosion near Sevastopol, a Crimean port that serves as the main headquarters of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet. “Thanks again to the Air Force pilots and everyone who planned the operation for perfect combat work,” he said. The Moscow-installed governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhayev, described the attack as “the most massive in recent times”. He said one person was hospitalised after a piece of shrapnel struck. Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had foiled a Ukrainian attack, destroying 10 incoming missiles over the peninsula."
"Ukraine war: Russia executed 77 civilians detained by its forces, UN says",UN documents summary execution of 77 Ukrainian civilians,0.5410700371235726,2023-06-27,2023-06-27,"Russian forces summarily executed 77 civilians they had arbitrarily detained during Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, a UN report says. Another male detainee died from torture, inhumane conditions and denial of medical care, the report adds.The UN documented 864 individual cases of arbitrary detention by Russia since it launched its invasion last February.Ukraine also violated international law by detaining civilians, though on a much smaller scale, the report adds.""We documented the summary execution of 77 civilians while they were arbitrarily detained by the Russian Federation,"" Maltilda Bogner, head of the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission told a press briefing in Geneva on Tuesday. Some 72 of those killed were men and five were women. Summary executions, or the immediate and deliberate killing of individuals without a fair and full trial, is a violation of human rights.Russia denies committing atrocities or attacking civilians in Ukraine.The mission did not document any summary executions of civilian detainees by Ukrainian forces.Ms Bogner said there was also evidence Russian forces and law enforcement had engaged in ""widespread torture and ill-treatment of civilian detainees"". ""Torture was used to force victims to confess to helping Ukrainian armed forces, compel them to cooperate with the occupying authorities, or intimidate those with pro-Ukrainian views,"" she said.Overall, the report documented more than 900 cases of arbitrary detention of civilians, including children and elderly people - with the ""vast majority"" perpetrated by Russia.In 91% of those cases, detainees described being subjected to ""torture and ill-treatment, including sexual violence"" by Russian interrogators, the report said. There were 75 cases of arbitrary detention by Ukrainian security forces, mostly of people suspected of conflict-related offences. ""We documented that over half of those arbitrarily detained were subjected to torture or ill-treatment by Ukrainian security forces,"" Ms Bogner said. ""This happened while people were being interrogated, usually immediately after arrest.""The UN mission's report is the latest evidence of atrocities carried out by Russian forces in Ukraine. In April 2022 near the beginning of the conflict, more than 400 bodies of civilians were found in Bucha, a town on the outskirts of Kyiv. In March this year, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant against President Vladimir Putin for suspected war crimes. ","A United Nations mission in Ukraine has expressed grave concern over the summary execution of more than 70 Ukrainian civilians by Russian forces while also documenting other breaches of international law by both warring sides. The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) on Tuesday released its findings gathered between the start ofRussia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbouring countryin February last year to May of this year. “OHCHR is gravely concerned by the summary execution of 77 civilians – 72 men and 5 women – while they were arbitrarily detained by the Russian Federation, and the further death of one detainee (a man) as a result of torture, inhumane detention conditions and/or denial of necessary medical care,” read the report, referring to the UN’s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The UN agency also documented 864 cases of arbitrary detention by Russian troops, many of which also amounted to enforced disappearances. It also reported the detention of 260 civilians “based on their perceived political views or other legitimate exercise of freedom of expression”. The true number of cases might vary considering that Russia did not provide OHCHR with any access to conflict-related detainees, despite repeated requests, the UN agency said. More than 90 percent of the reported cases described being subjected to torture and ill-treatment, including sexual violence. “Such treatment appeared to be carried out to force the victims to confess to provision of assistance to Ukrainian armed forces, to compel them to cooperate with the occupying authorities, or to intimidate those considered to hold pro-Ukrainian views,” said the report.    Ukrainian security forces have also been found guilty of unlawfully detaining at least 75 individuals – mostly suspected of conflict-related criminal offences. They also held 65 civilians incommunicado to extract confessions. “Fifty-seven percent of interviewed detainees described being subjected to torture and ill-treatment by Ukraine, predominantly in unofficial places of detention and, to a lesser extent, in pre-trial detention facilities,” it said. OHCHR also raised concern over the “vagueness and overly broad” wording of a law introduced in Ukraine in March last year that established criminal liability for collaborationists. Under this law, the office of Ukraine’s prosecutor general opened more than 5,400 criminal proceedings leading to 500 guilty verdicts. “The vagueness and overly broad terminology in the legal provisions raise concerns with respect to the principle of legality and have led to arbitrary detention in a number of cases,” the UN agency said. So far, Ukraine has convicted 23 Russians, OHCHR said, adding that it was not aware of any criminal proceeding launched against Ukrainians involved in arbitrary detention or enforced disappearance."
Russia accuses Ukraine of Moscow drone attack,Russia says it foiled a Ukrainian drone attack on Moscow,0.5350352751263648,2023-07-24,2023-07-24,"Russia has accused Ukraine of being behind a drone attack that damaged at least two buildings in the capital Moscow early on Monday morning. The Russian defence ministry said two drones were ""suppressed and crashed"", adding that there were no casualties. Russia's state-owned Tass news agency reported that one drone fell close to the defence ministry.Ukrainian officials are yet to comment, but they rarely claim responsibility for attacks inside Russia. In a separate development, Russian-installed officials ordered people to evacuate one district of Crimea - the Ukrainian southern peninsular annexed by Moscow in 2014 - after a reported overnight Ukrainian drone attack.Kremlin-appointed regional head Sergei Aksenov said an ammunition depot was hit in the northern Dzhankoi area, and residents of nearby villages were told to leave their homes. He reported no casualties.Meanwhile, Ukraine said four people were injured and a grain hangar was destroyed in an overnight Russian drone attacks on two ports on the River Danube, an alternative export route to the Black Sea, its southern Odesa region.Russia has been launching near-constant attacks on the Odesa region - where Ukraine's major Black Sea ports are located - since Russia withdrew from a landmark grain deal last week.In Moscow, the city's Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said the drone strikes in the Russian capital hit ""two non-residential"" buildings around 04:00 local time (01:00 GMT). In a post on social media, he added that the buildings had not sustained any major damage.But state news agencies reported that some drone fragments were found just 2km (1.2 miles) away from the defence ministry's buildings.""A Kyiv regime attempt to carry out a terrorist act using two drones on objects on the territory of the city of Moscow was stopped,"" the Russian defence ministry said in a statement.Russian news agencies reported that drone debris was also found along the city's Komsomolsky Avenue. Moscow's transport department wrote on Telegram that traffic along the route was blocked and photos showed emergency services working at the scene. Traffic was also stopped on Likhachev Avenue, where a high-rise office building was damaged. Footage published on the military Zvezda TV channel showed missing windows at the top of the building. Moscow has accused Ukraine of a host of drone attacks on its territory in recent months. Earlier this month, Russia said Ukraine launched a drone attack on Moscow, forcing flights to be diverted from Vnukovo International Airport. Ukraine did not claim responsibility. And in May Kyiv denied carrying out a drone attack on the Kremlin, which Russia said amounted to an attempt on President Vladimir Putin's life. Monday's attack comes just a day after Russia targeted Odesa with missile strikes, destroying the historical Transfiguration Cathedral. Unesco, the UN's cultural agency, said it was ""deeply dismayed and condemns in the strongest terms"" the attack on the historic centre of Odesa.Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky vowed retaliation for the attack. ""They will definitely feel this,"" he said during his nightly address from Kyiv. ""The target of all these missiles is not just cities, villages or people. Their target is humanity and the foundations of our entire European culture.""","Russia’s air defence forces have “suppressed” a Ukrainian drone attack on Moscow, the Russian defence ministry has announced, accusing Kyiv of launching a “terrorist act” against the country’s capital. The attack early on Monday came a day after Ukraine vowed to “retaliate” for a Russian missile attack on the Black Sea port of Odesa. “A Kyiv regime attempt to carry out a terrorist act using two drones on objects on the territory of the city of Moscow was stopped,” the Russian defence ministry said. “Two Ukrainian drones were suppressed and crashed. There are no casualties.” There was no comment from Ukraine. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said the drone strikes occurred at around 4:00am local time (01:00 GMT). The Russian TASS news agency said that one of the drones fell on Komsomolsky Prospekt, which is close to Russia’s defence ministry, while another hit a business centre on Likhacheva Street near one of Moscow’s main ring roads. The Reuters news agency reported two loud explosions before the reported attacks. The RIA Novosti news agency posted a video of the business centre, with some damage visible to the top of the tall building. The road around it was closed.    Moscow lies around 500km (310 miles) from the Ukrainian border but have been hit by several drone attacks this year, with one even hitting the Kremlin in May. Earlier this month, Russia said it had downed five Ukrainian drones that disrupted the functioning of Moscow’s Vnukovo international airport. Meanwhile in Ukraine, Russian forces have pounded the the port city of Odesa since Moscow quit a deal allowing Ukrainian grain to be exported through the Black Sea last week. The latest strike on the city on Sunday killed two people and severely damaged a historic cathedral. Clergymen rescued icons from rubble inside the badly damaged Transfiguration Cathedral, which was demolished under Stalin in 1936 and rebuilt in the 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The Ukrainian government condemned the cathedral strike as a “war crime”, saying it had been “destroyed twice: by Stalin and Putin”. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pledged retaliation: “They will definitely feel this,” he said. “We cannot allow people around the world to get used to terrorist attacks,” Zelenskyy added in his evening speech late on Sunday. “The target of all these missiles is not just cities, villages or people. Their target is humanity and the foundations of our entire European culture.”"
Ukraine dam: What we know about Nova Kakhovka incident,"Ukraine, Russia trade blame for destruction of Nova Kakhovka dam",0.5343314595313077,2023-06-08,2023-06-06,"A huge dam in the Russian-controlled area of southern Ukraine has been destroyed, unleashing a flood.Ukraine's military and Nato have accused Russia of blowing up the dam, while Russia has blamed Ukraine. Thousands of people have been evacuated from low-lying areas either side of the river Dnipro.UN humanitarian aid chief Martin Griffiths has warned of grave and far-reaching consequences. Here's what we know so far.The Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant is in the city of Nova Kakhovka in the Kherson region. The city is currently under Russian occupation. The dam was built in the Soviet era and is one of six that sit along the Dnipro river, which stretches from the very north of the country into the Black Sea. In Kherson region, Russia occupies the left, or southern, bank while Ukraine controls the right, or northern, bank.The dam holds back a huge reservoir, which locals call the Kakhovka Sea as you cannot see the other bank in certain places. Video footage showed a massive breach in the dam, with water surging through it and flooding downstream in the direction of Kherson. Ukrainian dam operator UkrHydroEnerho said the Nova Kakhovka station was ""fully destroyed"" and could not be restored.It's unclear when exactly the dam was first damaged, but satellite images suggest its condition deteriorated over a number of days. As water from the vast Kakhovka reservoir poured through the damaged dam, agricultural land and dozens of villages and towns were quickly flooded.  Thousands of people from both sides of the river have been evacuated from their homes, but the full scale of the disaster is not yet clear. There are also major environmental concerns. The river has been contaminated with 150 tonnes of industrial lubricant, said President Volodymyr Zelensky, and another 300 tonnes was at risk of leaking.Agricultural land has been washed away and the consequences of the flooding on local farmland is likely to be felt for years.Landmines are also being dislodged by the floodwaters, prompting concerns not just for residents in Kherson, but also those coming to provide assistance. Erik Tollefsen, head of the Red Cross's weapon contamination unit said they had lost track of where the landmines were: ""All we know is that they are somewhere downstream.""President Zelensky visited the flood-hit region on Thursday and said the priority was to ""protect lives and help people as much as possible"". He also visited a crossing point in the city where people were being evacuated from the flooded area and a medical facility. It's not yet clear what caused the breach in the dam, but Ukraine's military has accused Russia of deliberately blowing it up.Moscow may have feared that Ukrainian forces would use the road over the dam to get troops across the river into Russian-held territory, as part of a counter-offensive.Mykola Kalinin, chief engineer at a hydropower and water management engineering company in Ukraine, Ukrhydroproject, claimed that an explosion was the cause. The dam, he told Ukrainian data journalism site Texty, was ""built to withstand a super-powerful impact from the outside"". Mr Kalinin concludes that it was mined from the inside.But Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov blamed Ukraine, calling it an act of ""sabotage"" that would deprive the Crimean peninsula - an area annexed by Russia in 2014 -  of water. Neither Ukraine nor Russia's claims have been verified by the BBC. Alternative theories of what could have caused, or at least contributed, to the breaching of the dam have been put forward.Fighting in the area could have affected the structure, Mark Mulligan, professor of Physical Geography at University College London, told the BBC.""Structural failure resulting from the impact of earlier damage associated with the war remains a possibility,"" Prof Mulligan said.A second theory he put forward was that Russia, which controls the dam, deliberately allowed water levels to rise in the reservoir behind it - making a collapse more likely and more impactful.According to analysis of satellite imagery carried out by the US Foreign Agricultural Service, water levels rose sharply over the last few months.""The very high level of water in the reservoir coupled with previous damage, leading to uncontrolled flows of water through the dam could lead to catastrophic structural failure,"" Prof Mulligan said.However, the dam's destruction is hard to assess on satellite imagery alone, as much of the damage is underwater.""At this stage nobody knows except those on the ground, all else is speculation,"" Prof Mulligan added.Mr Zelensky has accused the international community of not reacting fast enough to the flooding, and said without drinking water, food or medicine it was impossible to know how many people would die. He has accused international organisations, like the Red Cross, of losing the ability to save lives. The World Bank has offered to conduct a rapid assessment of the damage and Ukraine's most urgent needs.What was the purpose of the dam?It held back a vast reservoir that supplied water to communities upstream, and provided cooling water to the nuclear power station at Zaporizhzhia, around 160km (100 miles) away, which is under Russian control.The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said there was no immediate nuclear safety risk but it was monitoring the situation.It later said that if the dam did fall below 12.7m, the lowest level at which water can still be pumped upstream to Zaporizhzhia, there were alternative water sources to keep the nuclear plant cool.The dam was also a vital channel carrying water from the river to Russian-occupied Crimea, meaning water supplies there are likely to be affected.After Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, Ukraine blocked a channel carrying water from Nova Kakhovka, triggering a water crisis on the peninsula.Russian forces reopened the channel after last year's invasion. But without the dam, dropping water levels could once again jeopardise the flow of water along the channel.Russia has previously carried out several attacks on dams throughout Ukraine since the invasion, causing widespread flooding and disrupting power supplies.","Kyiv has accused Russian forces of blowing up a large dam in southern Ukraine, while the Moscow-installed official in the city of Nova Kakhovka in the Russian-controlled portion of the Kherson region blamed the structure’s destruction on Ukrainian shelling. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused “Russian terrorists” ofdestroying the dam early on Tuesdayand said the outrage “confirms for the whole world that they must be expelled from every corner of Ukrainian land”. “Not a single meter should be left to them, because they use every meter for terror,” said Zelenskyy, who called an emergency meeting of the country’s national security council. “The terrorists will not be able to stop Ukraine with water, missiles or anything else,” he wrote on Twitter. But the Kremlin accused Kyiv of sabotaging the dam to distract attention from a purportedly faltering counteroffensive against Russian forces. “We can state unequivocally that we are talking about deliberate sabotage by the Ukrainian side,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. He added that Ukraine was also aiming to deprive Russian-annexed Crimea of the freshwater it receives from the reservoir via the North Crimean Canal. Commenting on allegations that Russia was responsible for the blast, Peskov said: “We can strongly reject this. We officially declare that here we are definitely talking about deliberate sabotage from the Ukrainian side.” The dam, 30 metres (some 98 feet) tall and 3.2km (2 miles) long, was built in 1956 on the Dnipro River as part of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant. The southern command of Ukrainian armed forces said the “scale of the destruction” was being assessed as Ukraine’s military administration for the Kherson region called on people to be ready to evacuate from villages on the right bank of theDnipro River before expected flooding. “The water level is rising and everyone who is in the danger zone must: Turn off all electrical appliances; take documents and essentials; take care of loved ones and pets; follow the instructions of rescuers and policemen,” the Kherson administration said on its Telegram channel. “About 16,000 people are in the critical zone on the right bank of the Kherson region,” said Oleksandr Prokudin, head of the Kherson military administration, adding that there was already flooding in eight areas along the Dnipro River. Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the Ukrainian presidential office, accused Russia of destroying the dam in “a panic” in order to slow down the Ukrainian counteroffensive, saying the consequences of Russia’s actions were “already catastrophic”. “On a vast territory, all life will be destroyed; many settlements will be ruined; colossal damage will be done to the environment,” he said. The office of the prosecutor general said Ukraine was investigating the incident as a possible war crime and as possible criminal environmental destruction, or “ecocide”. But RIA Novosti news agency quoted the Moscow-installed mayor of Nova Kakhovka, Vladimir Leontiev, as saying the dam had been hit by shelling which he blamed on Ukraine. “There were several hits” on the dam, he said, according to the Russian news agency. “This crime cannot be written off. This is a terrorist act directed against civilians, Ukrainians did it,” he said. Al Jazeera’s Charles Stratford, reporting from Kyiv, said analysts had long seen the dam as a potential target for both sides in the war. The dam is vital for water supply and irrigation in Russian-occupied Crimea, while Russia could see its destruction as a way of making it more difficult for Ukrainian forces to cross the Dnipro River and enter Crimea in a ground offensive, Stratford said, adding that the evacuation of settlements in the area had already begun. “We are also hearing from the Ukrainians that they believe … water levels will reach a critical point around five hours from now. We also know there are ongoing evacuations from some of the settlements that are going to be affected,” he said. The Soviet-era dam in the Russian-controlled part of the Kherson region could unleash a flood across the war zone, according to Ukrainian and Russian forces. Unverified videos on social media showed a series of intense explosions around the dam. Other videos showed water surging through its remains with bystanders expressing their shock, sometimes in strong language. Ukraine controls five of the six dams along the Dnipro, which runs from the country’s northern border with Belarus down to the Black Sea and is crucial for the entire country’s drinking water and power supply. The Nova Kakhovka dam – the one furthest downstream – is controlled by Russian forces and contains an 18-cubic-kilometre (4.3-cubic-mile) reservoir which supplies water to the Crimean Peninsula, which was annexed by Russia in 2014, and to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which is also under Russian control. Ukraine’s nuclear operator Energoatom said in a Telegram statement that the blowing up of the dam “could have negative consequences for the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant”, but the situation is “controllable” at the moment. The United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency wrote on Twitter that its experts were closely monitoring the situation at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant upstream, and there was “no immediate nuclear safety risk” at the facility. The IAEA is aware of reports of damage at#Ukraine’s Kakhovka dam; IAEA experts at#ZaporizhzhyaNuclear Power Plant are closely monitoring the situation; no immediate nuclear safety risk at plant.#ZNPP — IAEA – International Atomic Energy Agency ⚛️ (@iaeaorg)June 6, 2023  Europe’s largest nuclear facility uses water from the dam to cool six reactors as well as spent fuel and emergency diesel generators. IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said in a statement that alternative sources of water near the facility should be sufficient to guarantee its safety. “A main one is the large cooling pond next to the site that by design is kept above the height of the reservoir,” he said. “It is therefore vital that this cooling pond remains intact. Nothing must be done to potentially undermine its integrity. I call on all sides to ensure nothing is done to undermine that.” According to the Ukraine War Environmental Consequences Working Group, a total collapse in the dam would wash away much of the left bank and a severe drop in the reservoir has the potential to deprive the nuclear plant of crucial cooling, as well as dry up the water supply in northern Crimea. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg called the attack “outrageous” and said it highlighted the devastation wrought by Moscow’s invasion. “The destruction of the Kakhovka dam today puts thousands of civilians at risk and causes severe environmental damage. This is an outrageous act, which demonstrates once again the brutality of Russia’s war in Ukraine,” Stoltenberg wrote on Twitter. European Union chief Charles Michel pledged to hold Russia accountable for the “war crime” of destroying civilian infrastructure. “Shocked by the unprecedented attack of the Nova Kakhovka dam. The destruction of civilian infrastructure clearly qualifies as a war crime – and we will hold Russia and its proxies accountable,” Michel wrote on social media. Lithuania’s president and the foreign ministers of Latvia and Estonia also said the incident amounted to a war crime for which Russia must be held accountable. “Today we witness an unprecedented Russian attack against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure,” Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda tweeted. “The destruction of a major dam is a crime of war that directly threatens thousands of people. Russia must be held accountable for it,” he said. “And Ukraine must win this war to stay safe!”"
What now for Wagner after Prigozhin's death?,Russia confirms death of Wagner chief Prigozhin after genetic tests,0.5312918798833937,2023-08-25,2023-08-27,"Yevgeny Prigozhin spent almost a decade building the Wagner paramilitary group.It became central to Russia's war effort in Ukraine and Prigozhin's troops helped to spread Russian influence across the globe, propping up allies of President Vladimir Putin in Africa and Syria. Now his death has sparked a flurry of speculation about the group's future. Western security officials are wondering who will take his place and what will happen to the mercenaries he once led. Dr Joana de Deus Pereira, senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), told the BBC's World Tonight programme that Prigozhin's death would likely lead to ""a certain revamping"" of the group. But she said that overall Wagner's operations would probably continue in much the same way as it had under Prigozhin's leadership. ""The organisation will persist in the future probably with another name, but it has already proved it has the capacity to adapt and to morph,"" she said. ""We have to look at Wagner not only as a single man but as an ecosystem, as a hydra with many many heads and many diverse interests in Africa."" Ruslan Trad, a security analyst with the Atlantic Council, agreed. He told the BBC that Prigozhin's death would likely see someone with connections to Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU, installed to lead the group in his place.But he suggested that the main challenge for Mr Putin may be finding someone with deep enough pockets to fund the paramilitary's operations, while not posing a direct challenge to his regime. ""They will try to find a new financier because Prigozhin was the main person with money there,"" Mr Trad said. ""I think it will be more difficult to find a new financier because [Wagner] have good commanders, but money is important here. Maybe they will [install] someone from the close circle around Putin."" BenoÃ®t Bringer, a journalist whose documentary The Rise of Wagner charted the paramilitary's rise, told the BBC that one of the leading contenders is GRU General Andrey Averyanov. ""It is likely that Putin needed time to secretly organise the transition. This would explain why he waited two months before getting rid of Prigozhin,"" he added. Emily Ferris of Rusi observed that Moscow ""will have likely learned its lesson that personalities like Prigozhin with their own dangerous ambitions are a wildcard,"" adding that ""any new [Wagner] leader would likely be someone handpicked by the Kremlin"". For much of the past year Wagner was Russia's most effective fighting force in Ukraine, with its troops successfully taking the eastern cities of Soledar and Bakhmut after bloody battles. But Ms Ferris said Prigozhin's death was unlikely to seriously impact the course of the war. ""Wagner troops have been out of action in Ukraine since the rebellion, and their troops stationed either in Belarus, or absorbed back in to the Ministry of Defence, so the impact immediately on the Ukraine war, where the Russian forces are still holding back the Ukrainian counter-offensive, is likely to be minimal for now,"" she observed. She added that it appeared unlikely that Wagner troops would return to the battlefield in Ukraine, at least in the short term. Thousands of Wagner fighters followed Prigozhin to Russia's western neighbour, Belarus, following an aborted armed revolt against Russia's top military brass in June. On Friday, Belarus' authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko said up to 10,000 Wagner fighters would ""in the next few days"" be in the group's main camp in Osipovichi, south-east of Minsk.""Wagner lived, Wagner is alive, and Wagner will live in Belarus, no matter if someone would not like it,"" he was quoted as saying by Belarus' state-run Belta news agency.He was speaking shortly after satellite images analysed by BBC Verify had shown that several of the tents at the camp were being dismantled.The photos were taken by the US-based Planet Labs company. It is not clear exactly when the work began and whether occupants of the tents are housed elsewhere in Belarus or have left the country.The US-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty media group reported on Thursday that as many as 101 of 273 tents in the camp had already been taken down.Addressing the issue, Mr Lukashenko said only ""extra tents"" were being removed as there was no need to have so many of them.Still, the future of Wagner fighters is unclear, as many Belarusian, Russian and Western experts argue that Mr Lukashenko is de facto President Putin's puppet, obeying his orders.At the same time, some reports on social media suggest that several Wagner fighters have already made explicit threats against Mr Putin for what they allege is his role in Prigozhin's death. Equally unclear is the future of Wagner's troops abroad. The group has become a key pillar of Russian foreign policy, with its forces helping to prop up governments in Syria, Mali, the Central African Republic and Libya in exchange for lucrative mining rights.In recent days Prigozhin is believed to have been present in West Africa, where Western analysts fear the group was seeking to widen its reach into other countries, including Niger where a coup has just taken place.Some had speculated that the decapitation of the group's leadership could force Russia to re-evaluate its attempts to seek influence in the region, but many experts believe the group's decentralised command on the continent should allow it to continue its operations unhindered by Prigozhin's death.Following June's mutiny, Russian officials were reported to have flown to Libya to meet Khalifa Haftar, the renegade general challenging the UN-recognised government in Tripoli, and assured him of the Wagner Group's continued support, regardless of Prigozhin's fate. Mr Trad told the BBC that he believed Wagner was so heavily integrated in the defence infrastructure of African countries that their operations would be untroubled by Prigozhin's death. ""The commanders stationed in Syria, or Central African Republic or Mali, they already have very good models in place there and they have the freedom to act,"" he said. ""Local commanders are not impacted because the operations are separately operational, they have different resources for this and even now they are recruiting for Syria and Africa operations."" And he said the group's arms length relationship with Russian intelligence would remain a valuable tool for Moscow, allowing it to operate in the ""grey zone"" where it could pursue Russia's interests, but allowing officials to deny involvement. Mr Bringer told the BBC that Wagner was ""essential in Africa"" in terms of promoting Russian interests. ""The structure will certainly continue to exist there, perhaps no longer under the name of Wagner, but with a new head loyal to the Kremlin,"" he said. Anton Mardasov, a non-resident scholar at the Middle East Institute's Syria Program, said even in the wake of Prigozhin's failed uprising in Russia, Wagner commanders abroad largely escaped Kremlin reprisals to avoid ""weakening Moscow's overall position"". But he said other mercenary companies were increasingly rivalling Wagner's role in Syria. After June's mutiny Mr Mardasov said that a number of Wagner troops had been offered a transfer to a competing company called PMC Redut. ""Redut has been working in Syria in parallel with Wagner for a long time,"" Mr Mardasov told the BBC. ""It is on the Redut that the military is betting in Syria, but they were afraid of fast steps."" In the medium-term, therefore, it seems unlikely that Wagner's operations will be significantly impacted by its benefactor's death. But in the longer term Wagner's operations look set to reform into something new, Emily Ferris of Rusi said. ""Most likely is that Wagner will splinter into two, with the remaining leaderless groupings in Belarus disbanded, and the other faction active abroad morphing into something else that can be a tool of Russian foreign policy,"" she told the BBC. As for Prigozhin's legacy, Mr Bringer told the BBC that Wagner had ""demonstrated to the Kremlin how a private shadowy army, capable of operating totally out of the law, could be useful in its hybrid wars, as well as to gain influence abroad."" ""The name of Wagner may disappear, but not the mercenaries in the field and the method he created.""","Russian investigators have confirmed the death ofYevgeny Prigozhin, founder of the mercenary group Wagner, in aplane crashearlier this week based on results of genetic tests. Svetlana Petrenko, spokesperson of the country’s Investigative Committee, said in a statement on Sunday that forensic testing identified all 10 bodies recovered at the site of Wednesday’s crash and the findings “conform to the manifest” of the plane. The statement did not offer any details as to what might have caused thecrash.    Russia’s civil aviation authority earlier this week said Prigozhin, along with some of his top lieutenants, were on the list of the passengers and crew members on board the plane. Prigozhin, 62, was killed two months after he mounted a mutiny against Russia’s military that President Vladimir Putin decried as “treason”. The Russian presidentsent his condolenceson Thursday to the families of those who died in the crash. “He [Prigozhin] was a talented person, a talented businessman, he worked not only in our country, and achieved results, but also abroad, particularly in Africa,” Putin said."
What do Vladimir Putin and Tucker Carlson gain from Moscow interview?,What did Vladimir Putin say to Tucker Carlson? Five key takeaways,0.5181368746010726,2024-02-09,2024-02-09,"Russian President Vladimir Putin's highly anticipated interview with conservative US media personality Tucker Carlson has aired.The interview, which was recorded on Tuesday, was posted on Carlson's website and X, formerly known as Twitter. The high-profile sit-down marks the first time the Russian leader has agreed to an interview with a Western media outlet since he launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost two years ago and comes as fighting in the country has reached a stalemate.Carlson introduced the interview in front of a snowy Kremlin and said it had been recorded two days before.Prior to the interview, he falsely claimed that other journalists were uninterested in talking to the Russian leader and that ""not a single Western journalist has bothered to interview"" Mr Putin since the invasion of Ukraine. Countless reporters from Western countries, including the BBC's Russia Editor Steve Rosenberg, have sent the Kremlin repeated interview requests. None of these have been granted. Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov himself admitted that Carlson was incorrect during a news briefing on Wednesday, telling the BBC in Moscow: ""Mr Carlson is not correct, and he couldn't have known that. We receive a lot of requests for interviews with the president.""But the interview is a major coup for Carlson, who has rebounded rapidly since he was spectacularly fired by Fox News last year, after reportedly falling out of favour with owner Rupert Murdoch. It allows him to present his new media company, which launched on X last year, as a major player in the media landscape. During the interview, Carlson pushed for the release of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, asking Mr Putin if he ""would be willing to release him to us and we'll bring him back to the United States"". Mr Putin said he believed a deal could be struck to release Mr Gershkovich, 32, ""if our partners take reciprocal steps"".Carlson's visit has come at an opportune time for the long-time Russian leader, whose media appearances are tightly choreographed and controlled by the Kremlin. In the US, attempts to pass legislation granting new military aid for Ukraine - widely viewed as essential to continuing the war - have stalled in Congress. On Wednesday, the latest bill that would have allocated $60bn of crucial funding for Kyiv was advancing through the Senate but faced stiff opposition from Republicans in the House. In the absence of fresh military aid, Ukraine's attempts to drive Russian forces from the country and launch new counter-offensives in the south and the eastern Donbas region have proved practically impossible. Some senior Republicans, including the party's Senate leader Mitch McConnell, remain committed to forcing through that new aid. But they face increasing hostility from hard-right members of their own party, who have baulked at the spiralling cost of the conflict and are pushing against US involvement in global conflicts.The Kremlin will be hoping that, by doing an interview with a prominent conservative TV presenter, Republican lawmakers will be susceptible to Moscow's narratives usually only parroted within domestic Russian media. Carlson has also had a long and mutually beneficial relationship with Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, who has expressed scepticism about supporting Ukraine.Carlson's platform offers an opportunity for the Kremlin to reach a wider, potentially sympathetic and heavily conservative audience in the US. In the past, the former Fox News host has launched scathing attacks on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and allied himself with Mr Putin's drive to embrace so-called ""traditional values,"" a phrase which has included attacks on LGBT people in Russia. Kremlin spin-doctors also have an eye on Europe, which will be left to support Ukraine financially if America withdraws assistance. Politics on the continent are changing. Surveys show increasing levels of hesitancy among the European public about continuing support for Ukraine. A number of right-wing populist parties, some of them with pro-Russian leanings, have had success in elections in various countries. Others, including in economic powerhouses like France and Germany, are doing well in the polls.But there is also a domestic element to the proceedings. Russia will hold presidential elections next month, and while the contest is almost certain to be won by Mr Putin - with his sole anti-war challenger disqualified on Thursday - the interview with Carlson allows the Russian leader to present himself as an international statesman with a global presence to his home audience. Indeed, Russian state media have spent several days treating Carlson as a major celebrity. In breathless coverage, state TV followed the media personality's arrival and broadcast footage of various trips to restaurants and a visit to see the Spartacus ballet at the Bolshoi Theatre.Finally, Moscow will be closely watching growing signs of internal political divisions in Ukraine. On Thursday, President Zelensky said he was replacing his top military commander, Gen Valery Zaluzhny, amid rumours of a rift between the two men. That will be music to Mr Putin's ears - his ultimate goal, short of the military conquest of Ukraine, is the removal of the Zelensky government in order to replace it with a pro-Russian one under his control. Failing that, the Kremlin leader is hoping Europe and America will tire of the war and put pressure on the Ukrainians to begin negotiations to end the conflict on terms that would be favourable to Moscow.","On Thursday, President Vladimir Putinspent two hoursbeing quizzed by former Fox News host Tucker Carlson in a highly anticipated TV interview. Theinterviewtook place just ahead of the second anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and at a time when United States politicians are pushing to restore military funding to Ukraine. Here are the five key takeaways: Putin revealed that, at some point, former US President Bill Clinton told him that Russia would have an opportunity to be welcomed into the military alliance, NATO. “At a meeting here in the Kremlin with the outgoing President Bill Clinton, right here in the next room, I said to him, I asked him: ‘Bill, do you think if Russia asked to join NATO, do you think it would happen?’ Suddenly he said, ‘You know, it’s interesting. I think so,’” said Putin who was speaking through an interpreter. “But in the evening, when we met for dinner, he said: ‘You know, I’ve talked to my team, no, no, it’s not possible now.’ You can ask him. I think he will watch our interview, he’ll confirm it,” the Russian president said. “I wouldn’t have said anything like that if it hadn’t happened. Okay, well, it’s impossible now,” he added. “Would you have joined NATO?” Carlson asked. “Look, I asked the question, is it possible, or not, and the answer I got was no,” Putin said. “But if he had said yes, would you have joined NATO?” Carlson said. “If he had said yes, the process of rapprochement would have commenced, and eventually it might have happened if we had seen some sincere wish on the other side of our partners. But it didn’t happen. Well, no means no. Okay, fine,” Putin said. Putin also highlighted that they were promised that NATO would not expand to the East. “Not an inch to the East … and then what? They said, ‘Well, it’s not enshrined on paper, so we’ll expand.'” “There were five waves of expansion. We tolerated all that. We were trying to persuade them. We were saying, ‘Please don’t. We are as bourgeois now as you are. We are a market economy, and there is no Communist Party power. Let’s negotiate’,” Putin added. Putin said that it might be possible to free Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who is awaiting trial on spying charges, in exchange for a Russian prisoner. The Russian president suggested that, in return, Moscow wanted Germany to free Vadim Krasikov, who was convicted of the 2019 murder of a Chechen dissident in Berlin. Gershkovichwas arrestedon March 29, 2023 in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg and accused of trying to obtain defence secrets. He and his newspaper strongly reject the charges and the US government has designated him as wrongfully detained. “We are willing to solve it but there are certain terms being discussed via special services channels. I believe an agreement can be reached,” said Putin, stressing that Western powers will have to take what he called “reciprocal steps”. “There have been many successful examples of these talks crowned with success. Probably this is going to be crowned with success as well but we have to come to an agreement,” said Putin. Russia and the US have agreed high-profile prisoner swaps in the past – most recently in December 2022 when Moscow traded Brittney Griner, a US basketball star convicted of a drugs offence in Russia, for Russian arms trafficker Viktor Bout. Carlson asked Putin: “Can you imagine a scenario where Russia is ready to send troops to Poland?” “Only in one case if Poland attacks Russia, why? Because we have no interest in Poland, Latvia or anywhere else,” Putin said. US politicians have said we “have to continue to fund the Ukrainian effort, or US soldier citizens could wind up fighting there. How do you assess that?” Carlson asked. That argument is based on the fact that Poland and the Baltic states are NATO members, and the alliance’s principle of collective security would kick in if any if them were attacked, necessitating US forces to intervene directly. “This is a provocation. I do not understand why American soldiers should fight in Ukraine,” Putin said. “Well, if somebody has the desire to send regular troops, that would certainly bring humanity to the brink of a very serious global conflict. This is obvious,” Putin added. “Do the United States need this? What for? Thousands of miles away from your national territory. Don’t you have anything better to do? You’ve issues on the border, issues with migration, issues with the national debt… you have nothing better to do, so you should fight in Ukraine? “Wouldn’t it be better to negotiate with Russia? Make an agreement. Already understanding the situation that is developing today, realising that Russia will fight for its interests to the end.” Putin also said a solution would be possible if the US stopped supplying weapons. “If you really want to stop fighting, you need to stop supplying weapons. It will be over within a few weeks, that’s it, and then we can agree on some terms. Before you do that, stop,” Putin said. Putin also blamed the CIA for the explosions of theNord Stream pipelines, cutting off a major route for Russian gas exports to Europe and fuelling geopolitical tensions. “Who blew up Nord Stream?” Carlson asked. Putin replied: “You, for sure.” Carlson jokingly responded, “I was busy that day”. Putin said, “You personally might have an alibi, but the CIA has not such alibi”. “Do you have evidence that NATO or the CIA did it,” Carlson said. The Russian president responded he “won’t get into details” but you should “look for someone who is interested” and who “has capabilities”. Many people might be interested but not all “of them are capable of sinking to the bottom of the Baltic Sea and carrying out this explosion”, Putin said. Putin said the world is changing faster than “during the collapse of the Roman Empire”. He also said: “Mankind is currently facing many threats due to the genetic researchers – it is now possible to create this superhuman. A specialised human being. A genetically engineered athlete, scientist, military man. There are reports that Elon Musk has already had the chip implanted in the human brain in the US.” “What do you think of that?” Carlson asked “I think there’s no stopping Elon Musk. He will do as he sees fit,” Putin said. “Nevertheless, you need to find some common ground with him, search for ways to persuade him,” Putin explained. He said that humanity needed to think about what to do about the advances in genetics and artificial intelligence and suggested the nuclear arms control treaties of the Cold War could be a guide. “When there arises an understanding that the boundless and uncontrolled development of artificial intelligence or genetics or some other modern trends, cannot be stopped, that these researches will still exist just as it was impossible to hide gunpowder from humanity… when humanity feels a threat to itself, to humanity as a whole, then, it seems to me, there will come a period to negotiate at the interstate level on how we will regulate this,” Putin added."
Russia returns four Ukrainian children in Qatari deal,Ukrainian children repatriated from Russia through Qatari mediation,0.51812810864168,2023-10-16,2023-10-16,"Russia has agreed to return four Ukrainian children to their families, as part of a deal brokered by Qatar.The youngest is two years old and the oldest is 17.The repatriation is part of a pilot scheme to return more of the thousands of children taken by Russia following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year.Ukraine says it has identified 20,000 children who it alleges were abducted by Russia.However the number of those deported is thought to be much higher.The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Russia's President Vladimir Putin in March, accusing him and his commissioner for children's rights Maria Lvova-Belova of the unlawful deportation of Ukrainian children.Russia insisted that its motives were purely humanitarian, claiming it evacuated hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian children to protect them from danger, with top officials scorning the indictment at the time. The return of the four children will test a scheme worked on by Qatar after it headed talks with Moscow and Kyiv, a diplomat who asked to remain anonymous due to the scheme's sensitivity told news agencies. It is hoped that further repatriations would follow if the first was successful, they added.However, getting the children out of Russia has not been straightforward. In at least one case a child had to travel home via Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. One of the four children to be returned, a seven-year-old, was reunited with his grandmother on Friday and arrived in Ukraine on Monday.The other three children, also reunited with their families, are expected to arrive in Ukraine later on Monday or Tuesday.They are among thousands of Ukrainian children who Kyiv says were forcibly separated from their families, taken across the border into Russia and faced an active effort to strip them of their Ukrainian identity. The BBC has previously found that Ukrainian children in Russia were frequently told there was nothing in their country to return to and were subjected, to varying degrees, to a ""patriotic"" Russian education.In some cases Ukrainian families have been forced to make gruelling journeys into Russia to get their children back.It is thought that so far only around 400 Ukrainian children have returned before Qatar mediated the four's return.""They want to separate children from their biological families, Russify these children, hide these children and transfer them to another ethnic group,"" Daria Gerasymchuk, an adviser to the Ukrainian president for children's rights and rehabilitation previously told the BBC. However, work to reunite children with their families would continue, Ms Lvova-Belova said in a post on her Telegram channel, quoting President Putin as saying: ""We have never been against children being reunited with their families.""Russia would also help pay transportation and accommodation costs, and where necessary carry out DNA analysis, she added.Qatari minister Lolwah Al Khater confirmed the mediation in a statement, calling the repatriations ""only a first step"".""We are encouraged by the commitment and openness shown by both sides throughout the process, which we sincerely hope will lead to more initiatives aimed at de-escalating tensions and building trust between the two parties,"" she added.","Qatar has announced that its mediators have succeeded in securing Russian agreement for the return of four Ukrainian children to their families in what is hoped to be the first phase of repatriations for more children. The children, who range in age from two to 17, have been received at the Qatari mission in Moscow which “facilitated the hosting of the children and their families…and accompanied them to their destination”, according to a statement by the Qatari Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This first repatriation of Ukrainian children is part of a longer-term mechanism Qatar negotiated with both sides after months of secret talks, according to a Qatari official who spoke to Reuters. Commenting on the repatriation, Qatari Minister of State for International Cooperation Lolwah al-Khater said in a statement: “Today, we celebrate the power of unity as we witness the reunification of children and their families. I extend my deepest gratitude to the State of Russia… and the State of Ukraine… Their tireless efforts, alongside the State of Qatar’s commitment, have been instrumental in facilitating this heartwarming success. “We stand resolute in our commitment to this humanitarian cause and hope that our collaboration remains an inspiring symbol of hope and compassion.” Ukraine says up to 20,000 children have been taken by Russia into the country or territory that it holds. In May 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree making it easier for Russians to adopt Ukrainian children who were “without parental care”. In March, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova, Russia’s commissioner for children’s rights, stating that it had “grounds to believe [they bear] responsibility for the war crime of … unlawful transfer of population from occupied areas of Ukraine to the Russian Federation, in prejudice of Ukrainian children.” Both individuals dismissed the ICC warrants and accusations while Ukraine welcomed the court’s decision. Observers at the time worried that this would spelltrouble for any future diplomatic attemptsto mediate the situation, but the successful launch of this mechanism signals some hope for a solution."
Ukraine war: Wagner-linked senior general Sergei Surovikin 'resting',Surovikin: Russian general missing since Wagner mutiny ‘resting’,0.5163995715775261,2023-07-13,2023-07-12,"A former Russian commander who has not been seen in public since the Wagner mutiny in June is ""resting"", according to a senior MP in Moscow's parliament.Andrei Kartapolov, chair of the defence committee, said Gen Sergei Surovikin was ""not reachable"", fuelling speculation about his whereabouts.Unconfirmed reports say Gen Surovikin has been held for questioning about his alleged involvement in the mutiny.He is said to enjoy close relations with Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin.Wagner's mercenaries attempted a brief mutiny on 23 and 24 June, threatening to march on Moscow.The mutiny ended after the intervention of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, who apparently made a deal with Prigozhin.Wagner's troops have been told they can either join the Russian armed forces, go home or go to serve in Belarus.On Wednesday the Russian defence ministry said the group was completing the process of handing over weapons and military equipment, surrendering more than 2,000 items including tanks, rocket launch systems, anti-aircraft guns and artillery.It published video of the hardware, along with large quantities of small arms and ammunition.There has been no independent confirmation that the supplies came from Wagner.Gen Surovikin was last seen in public in a video during the mutiny urging the Wagner forces to call a halt to their action.Media reports days later said he had been arrested, but there has been no official confirmation of his whereabouts.A blogger close to the Russian military said on Monday there were unconfirmed reports that the general was in the notorious Moscow prison Matrosskaya Tishina. He added that the only thing that was certain was that Gen Surovikin ""has not been home"".However, on Thursday Moscow city official Alexei Melnikov said he had visited the prison and two other jails in the capital and Gen Surovikin was not in any of them.The general was put in charge of Russian forces in Ukraine in October but removed three months later.He gained a reputation for brutality during Russian operations in Syria, where he became known as ""General Armageddon"".In Ukraine he oversaw devastating attacks on energy infrastructure, leaving millions of civilians without power or water over the winter.He was replaced in January by Chief of Staff Gen Valery Gerasimov, becoming his deputy.","A Russian lawmaker has saidSergei Surovikin, a deputy commander of Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine, who has not been seen in public since theWagner Group mutiny, is “resting”. Dubbed “General Armageddon” for his aggressive tactics in the Syrian and Chechen conflicts, he was last seen when he posted a video appeal urging top mercenary Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Wagner chief, to cease his rebellion in Russia last month. Andrey Kartapolov, head of the Russian State Duma Defence Committee, said in a video posted to social media on Wednesday, “Surovikin is currently resting. [He is] not available for now.”  Last month, a New York Times report based on a United States intelligence briefing said that Surovikin had advance knowledge of themutinyand that the Russian government was investigating whether he was complicit. Some Russian outlets reported that the missing official had been arrested, but there was no official confirmation and the Kremlin declined to answer questions. Shortly after the Wagner rebellion ended, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, when asked whether President Vladimir Putin still trusted Surovikin, said: “[Putin] is the supreme commander-in-chief and he works with the defence minister and with the chief of the General Staff.” Several of Russia’s leading generals dropped out of public view following the mercenaries’ armed rebellion on June 23-24, which aimed to oust Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Commander-in-Chief Valery Gerasimov. On Monday, Gerasimov was seen in a video for the first time since the episode, pictured listening to a report about Ukrainian missile attacks. In scenes that shocked the world, Russia’s Wagner Group mercenaries began their uprising on June 23. They quickly seized a southern Russian city and threatened to march on Moscow. They halted their advance, with Prigozhin claiming he did not want to overthrow Putin, but rather protest against the conditions endured by his forces in Ukraine. The Wagner chief had for months railed against Russia’s top brass, accusing them of failing to properly arm his fighters despite their alleged successes in Ukraine. Regardless, Prigozhin’s mutiny is widely understood to have posed the most serious challenge to Putin since he assumed the presidency in 1999. Ultimately, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko brokered a deal between Russia and Wagner to end the rebellion. Prigozhin and his men were to move to Belarus, but Lukashenko announced last week that the Wagner chief only visited the country and was now back in Russia. On Monday, the Kremlin announced that Putin, who has cast the Wagner chief as a backstabber, met with Prigozhin five days after the short rebellion. According to Pavel Felgenhauer, a defence and military analyst based in Moscow, an “uneasy ceasefire” is being observed by Russia and Wagner.    "

Darya Trepova: Russian woman jailed for 27 years for cafe bomb killing,Russian court jails woman for 27 years over killing of pro-Kremlin blogger,0.5157052199190223,2024-01-25,2024-01-25,"Russian woman Darya Trepova has been sentenced to 27 years in jail for the killing of pro-war blogger Vladlen Tatarsky last April.Tatarsky was killed by a bomb in a statuette Trepova gave him, as he was about to give a talk in St Petersburg. Dozens were injured in the blast.Trepova, 26, denied the charges, saying she thought the statuette contained a listening device. She said she had acted on the orders of a Ukrainian contact, and was set up.The sentence is one of the harshest imposed on a woman in Russia's history.The attack on Tatarsky, 40, (real name Maxim Fomin) happened on 2 April, 2023. Trepova was charged with ""a terrorist act carried out by an organised group causing intentional death"" and the ""illegal possession of explosive devices by an organised group"".Russian investigators have accused Ukraine of being behind the attack, and Ukrainian officials have neither confirmed nor denied this.But Trepova gave evidence in court that she was following orders from a man in Ukraine known as Gestalt (German for ""shape""). His identity is not known.She said she made contact with him via Ukraine-based journalist Roman Popkov. She is opposed to Russia's war in Ukraine and had been seeking to go there to work as a journalist.Trepova said that under Gestalt's instruction she gained Tatarsky's trust, introducing herself to him as an art student named Anastasia Kriulina and attending his talks.In March Gestalt sent her the statuette, she said, assuring her that it contained a wiretap and a tracker. She said she expressed concern that it might contain a bomb.""I feel great pain and shame that my gullibility and my naivety led to such catastrophic consequences. I didn't want to hurt anyone,"" Trepova told the court this week, quoted by Reuters.""I feel especial pain and shame that a terrorist act was carried out by my own hands.""Tatarsky was a well-known blogger with more than half a million followers, and had a criminal past.Born in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, he said he joined Russian-backed separatists when they released him from jail, where he was serving time for armed robbery.He was part of a pro-Kremlin military blogger community that has taken on a relatively high-profile role since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022.Tatarsky was among those who have gone so far as to criticise the Russian authorities, slamming the military and even President Vladimir Putin for setbacks on the battlefield.But he was posthumously awarded the Order of Courage by Mr Putin.Trepova's sentencing comes just after another controversial pro-war figure, the former commander of Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine Igor Girkin, was sentenced to four years in jail for ""calls to carry out extremist activities"". ","A Russian court has sentenced antiwar activist Darya Trepova to 27 years in prison for killing a prominent ultra-nationalist blogger in an attack that Moscow said was orchestrated by Ukraine. In April last year, Vladlen Tatarskywas killed in a St Petersburg cafeafter Trepova gave him a miniature statue rigged with explosives. As he accepted the gift, the outspoken commentator was killed on the spot. The court in St Petersburg convicted Trepova on “terrorism” charges on Thursday. The 26-year-old defended herself saying she did not purposefully kill Tatarsky, whose real name is Maxim Fomin, but was induced to believe the object she handed him was a secret listening device. Earlier this week, the activist told the court she was acting under orders from a man in Ukraine whom she knew as “Gestalt” (German for “Shape”), who had been sending her money and instructions for several months. “I feel great pain and shame that my gullibility and my naivety led to such catastrophic consequences. I didn’t want to hurt anyone,” Trepova said. Her decision to collaborate with Ukrainians was motivated by her opposition toRussia’s military offensive in Ukraine, she said. More than 30 other people were injured in the blast, which tore off the facade of the St Petersburg cafe. Tremova told the court she had explicitly asked her handler in Ukraine if the statue was a bomb. “I was very scared and asked Gestalt: ‘Isn’t this the same as with Daria Dugina?’” she said, referring to the daughter of an influential pro-war Russian nationalistwho was assassinatedin a car bombing attack in the Russian capital in 2022. Tatarsky was an influential military blogger, one of the most prominent among a group of hardline correspondents that have gained a huge following since Russia launched its offensive in Ukraine in February 2022. They publish exclusive information about the campaign from front-line sources and occasionally criticise Moscow’s military tactics, pushing for a more aggressive assault. Born in eastern Ukraine, Tatarsky was a convicted bank robber who escaped from prison to fight with Russian-backed separatists against Ukraine’s armed forces when the conflict in the east first broke out in 2014. He advocated for a much more aggressive military campaign against Ukraine. Putin posthumously bestowed a top award, the Order of Courage, on Tatarsky, citing his “courage and bravery shown during professional duty”. After his murder, Russian authorities accused Ukraine of orchestrating the killing. Senior Ukrainian officials have neither claimed responsibility nor denied involvement, with presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak describing it as “internal terrorism”. Moscow has accused Ukraine of staging several attacks and assassinations inside Russia, including the killing of Dugina and the failed car bombing attack against pro-Kremlin writer Zakhar Prilepin.

Rishi Sunak says the UK discourages use of cluster bombs in Ukraine,Timeline: Use of controversial cluster bombs in past conflicts,0.5151214876047621,2023-07-08,2023-07-10,"Rishi Sunak has reiterated that the UK ""discourages"" the use of cluster bombs after the US agreed to supply them to Ukraine.The UK is one the countries to have banned the weapons, which have a record of killing civilians, under an existing convention.The PM emphasised the government's continued support for Ukraine. On Friday, US President Joe Biden said he had made a ""very difficult decision"" to supply them to Kyiv.Spain and Canada, two of 123 nations to ban cluster bombs, have criticised the decision to send them, which has also been condemned by human rights groups.Cluster munitions are a method of dispersing large numbers of tiny bomblets from a rocket, missile or artillery shell that scatters them in mid-flight over a wide area.They are meant to detonate on impact, but a significant proportion of them fail to explode initially - often when they land on wet or soft ground. This means they can explode at a later date, killing or injuring people.Neither the US, Ukraine or Russia are signatories of the international treaty - the Convention on Cluster Munitions - banning the use or stockpiling of them over the indiscriminate damage they can inflict on civilian populations.Speaking to reporters in Selby, Yorkshire, on Saturday, Mr Sunak said the UK is ""signatory to a convention which prohibits the production or use of cluster munitions and discourages their use"".""We will continue to do our part to support Ukraine against Russia's illegal and unprovoked invasion, but we've done that by providing heavy battle tanks and most recently long-range weapons, and hopefully all countries can continue to support Ukraine,"" he added.""Russia's act of barbarism is causing untold suffering to millions of people.""Mr Sunak is due to meet with Mr Biden in London on Monday, ahead of a Nato summit in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius on Tuesday.Rishi Sunak spoke carefully when asked for his response to the US now giving cluster munition to Ukraine. He didn't criticise the US's decision but did point out that the Convention discourages use of the bombs. The UK is the second largest provider of military assistance to Ukraine - only behind the US. As the conflict in Ukraine evolves, so too are the responses of Kyiv's allies - on this issue the US and UK have gone in different directions. Mr Biden justified supplying the weapons by saying the ""Ukrainians are running out of ammunition"". Speaking to CNN in an interview due to air on Sunday, he said it had taken ""a while to be convinced"" to make the ""very difficult decision"" to send them.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has hailed the ""timely"" move to deliver the bombs.Ukraine's Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov said his troops would not use them in urban areas to avoid risking civilian lives, adding ""these are our people, they are Ukrainians we have a duty to protect"".But Spanish Defence Minister Margarita Robles has said her government's position is that cluster bombs should not be used for the ""legitimate defence of Ukraine"".Germany, which has also signed the convention, said it would not provide them to Ukraine but that it understands the American position.In a statement, the Canadian government said it does not support the use of the weapons and emphasised its commitment to ""putting an end to the effects cluster munitions have on civilians - particularly children"".Human Rights Watch said both sides had used the weapons in the war, causing ""numerous deaths and serious injuries to civilians"".These comments were echoed by Amnesty International, who said cluster munitions pose ""a grave threat to civilian lives, even long after the conflict has ended"".The UN human rights office has also been critical, calling for their use to ""stop immediately"". Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said the military alliance takes no position on cluster munitions.Tobias Ellwood, the chairman of the UK's defence select committee, urged the US to ""reconsider"" its decision - which he said was the ""wrong call and will alienate international goodwill"".""Their use leaves deadly unexploded ordnance over the battlefield, killing and injuring civilians long after the war is over,"" the Conservative MP added. Russia described the US decision as an ""act of desperation"" in the face of the ""failure of the much-touted Ukrainian counteroffensive"".","Several countries have announced they will not send Ukrainecluster munitionsfollowing the United States’ decision to send the controversial weapons to the front line. On Friday, Washington confirmed it would supply Kyiv with the widely condemned bombs as part of a new $800m security package. US President Joe Biden defended his decision as difficult but necessary, saying Ukraine needed them and has assured Washington that the bombs would not be used to target territory in Russia. More than 100 countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany and Canada, have signed an accord under the Convention on Cluster Munitions to ban the production, stockpiling, use and transfer of cluster bombs. Paul Hannon, of the Cluster Munitions Coalition (CMC), said the US move will “contribute to the terrible casualties being suffered by Ukrainian civilians both immediately and for years to come”. Cluster munitions typically release large numbers of smaller bomblets that can kill indiscriminately over a wide area but have a high failure rate leaving those that fail to explode to pose a danger for decades after a conflict ends. Here is a timeline of the use of the weapons throughout history: 1943, Battle of Kursk (World War II): Soviet forces dropped cluster munitions on German forces in Kursk, western Russia. 1943 in the UK (World War II): Germany released 1,000 butterfly bombs on Grimsby, a port city in northeast England. 1960s and 70s, Vietnam War: US forces targeted Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam with cluster munitions during the Cold War. According to amonitor,  the US dropped 413,130 tonnes of cluster munitions over Vietnam between 1965 and 1973. Citing authorities, the Red Crossreportedthat Laos is contaminated by about 80 million cluster submunitions, affecting all 17 provinces and resulting in 300 yearly casualties. 1975-88 in Western Sahara: Moroccan forces used cluster munitions against non-state armed groups. 1978, Lebanon: During Israel’s invasion, Tel Aviv used cluster munitions in southernLebanon. 1979-89, Afghanistan: Soviet forces used cluster munitions in Afghanistan from 1979 to 1989. 1982, Falklands War: British forces released cluster bombs on Argentinean infantry positions during the 10-week undeclared war, in which hundreds died. 1991, Gulf War: According to Human Rights Watch, the 61,000 aerial-delivered cluster munitions released by the US and its allies accounted for “about one-quarter of the bombs dropped on Iraq and Kuwait”. 1992-95, Bosnian War: Yugoslav forces used available cluster munitions during the war for independence. According to the CMC, in 1992, 195 people in Bosnia and Herzegovina were victims of cluster bombs. During the war, the highest number of causalities reached 175, with 31 deaths. 1994-96, First Chechen War: Russian forces used cluster munitions against Chechen independence groups. 1995, Croatia: On May 2-3, Serbian forces attacked Zagreb using cluster bombs. 1996-99 in Sudan: Sudanese government forces air-dropped cluster munitions in southern Sudan. 1998, Ethiopian-Eritrean War: Ethiopia and Eritrea exchanged bomb strikes, with Ethiopia attacking the Asmara airport and Eritrea targeting the Mekelle airport. 1998-99, Albania: Yugoslav forces launch cross-border rocket attacks on Albania. 1999 in Yugoslavia (Kosovo War): NATO allies dropped 1,765 cluster bombs containing 295,000 bomblets. 2001-02, Afghanistan War: The US dropped 1,228 cluster bombs containing 248,056 bomblets in Afghanistan between October 2001 and March 2002, according to HRW. 2003-06, Iraq War: Nearly 13,000 cluster munitions were used by the UK and the US during three weeks of combat, according to the CMC. 2008, Georgian war: Russia used air- and ground-launched cluster bombs during a conflict in South Ossetia. Georgia also used cluster munitions. Together, their cluster munitions killed at least 16 civilians and injured another 54. 2011 in Libya: Then-President Muammar Gaddafi’s forces used cluster munitions in a village in Misrata, Libya. Ongoing since 2012 in Syria: The use of cluster munitions in the Syrian conflict started in 2012, since the Arab Spring revolutionary protests. 2014-15, Crimea: Russia and Ukraine used cluster munitions during Moscow’s invasion to annex Crimea,accordingto Human Rights Watch (HRW). 2015-18 in Yemen: Saudi Arabia used UK-made cluster bombs againstHouthirebels in Yemen 2022, Ukraine War: According to HRW, Russia and Ukraine have extensively used cluster bombs during the conflict."
Zelensky in Washington: Ukrainian president at White House for talks with Biden,Zelenskyy culminates Washington visit with a White House pledge of $128m,0.514465026549617,2023-09-21,2023-09-21,,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has made his second visit to Washington, DC, since Russian forces launched a full-scale invasion of his country. But unlike in his first trip to the United States Capitol, Zelenskyy faceda congress less inclinedto back the war effort with large aid packages, despite pledges from top Democrats to “stand behind” Ukraine. In brief public remarks before the White House Cabinet on Thursday, Zelenksyy struck a note of gratitude, calling his negotiations in Washington “productive” and “strong”. “Thank you for all these 575 days,” he said, referencing the length of time since Russia invaded in February 2022. “Thanks to the American people, all these days they are together with us, with Ukrainians, with ordinary people, all of us.” He also highlightednew military assistance, worth $128m, announced by US President Joe Biden on Thursday. “It has exactly what our soldiers need now,” he said, calling it a “very powerful package”. Biden, a Democrat, used his presidential “drawdown authority” to authorise the aid, as further funds for Ukraine prove to be a sticking point in the US Congress. “Today, I approved the next tranche of US security assistance to Ukraine, including more artillery, more ammunition, more anti-tank weapons,” he said. “And next week, the first US Abrams tanks will be delivered to Ukraine.” The Cabinet meeting culminates a whirlwind charm offensive from the Ukrainian president, who travelled to New York earlier this week torally supportamong world leaders atthe United Nations. But as Zelenskyy faced US lawmakers on Thursday, the stakes were particularly high. Since the full-scale Russian invasion began in 2022, the US has committed more money than any single country to aid Ukraine, with much of that support taking the form of military assistance. The US Congress itself has approved aid amounting to over $113bn. But the last time Congress voted on an aid package wasin December— andcontrol of the House of Representativeshas since switched hands, from Democrats to Republicans. Nevertheless, Biden has called on Congress to approvean additional $24bnfor Ukraine aid, a request that Republicans, particularly on the far right, have baulked at. Some have called instead to slash funding for Ukraine, in favour of domestic priorities and limited government spending. That perspective was on full display on Thursday, as Zelenskyy toured Capitol Hill. US media reported that House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy refused Zelenskyy’s request to address a joint session of Congress during his visit, as he hadlast December. And while the Ukrainian leader was meeting with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle,28 Republican Congress memberssigned and published a letter on Thursday opposing additional expenditures for Ukraine. The US Congress is facing a September 30 deadline to pass budget legislation or face a government shutdown. “The American people deserve to know what their money has gone to,” the 28 Republicans wrote. “How is the counteroffensive going? Are the Ukrainians any closer to victory than they were 6 months ago? What is our strategy, and what is the president’s exit plan?” They added it would be “an absurd abdication of congressional responsibility” to grant President Biden’s request for more aid without answers first. Al Jazeera correspondent Kimberly Halkett said the contrast in reception to Zelenskyy’s first wartime appearance in Washington, DC, last December was stark. “There is a lot more pushback on Capitol Hill than Volodymyr Zelenskyy is used to,” she said from outside the White House. “Initially, he had received a warm welcome, bipartisan support in terms of approvals for funding for Ukraine’s defence and standing ovations all around. But this time there have been questions about how that money will be spent, where the past money has gone, and even whether the US can afford it.” She warned that “war fatigue” among the US public would be an ongoing hurdle to Zelenskyy’s cause.    Still, Congressional Democrats rallied in support of Ukraine spending, echoing the party’s commitment to “stand behind” the war-torn country. “This is a struggle between Ukraine and Russia,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in hisweekly press briefingon Thursday. “But it is also a struggle on the global stage between democracy and autocracy, between freedom and tyranny, between truth and propaganda, between good and evil. And it’s important for us to stand behind Ukraine until victory is won.” Biden echoed those sentiments later at the White House Cabinet meeting. “The entire world has a stake in making sure that no nation, no aggressor, is allowed to take a neighbour’s territory by force. The American people will never waver in their commitment to those values,” he said. As Biden shook hands with Zelenskyy and prepared to leave the Cabinet meeting, a reporter shouted from the sidelines to ask whether the US Congress would ultimately pass the requested aid for Ukraine. Biden paused before responding. “I’m counting on the good judgement of the United States Congress,” he said. “There’s no alternative.”"
How Russia reacted after Prigozhin plane crash,Will Russia’s Putin benefit from Prigozhin’s presumed plane crash death?,0.5121093762640962,2023-08-24,2023-08-24,"Russia is a country full of surprises.People here were shocked this summer after drones attacked the centre of Moscow on several occasions, causing explosions and damage to buildings.Then, the Russian rouble took an unexpected tumble - briefly tipping the dollar rate to over 100 roubles.Add to that, a failed mission to the Moon: Russia's 'Luna-25' lander was lost in space, destroyed as it collided with the lunar surface last week.But today, as the news broke that Yevgeny Prigozhin's plane had fallen out of the sky, crashing in a fireball in Russia's Tver Region, most people were far from shocked. In fact, most Russians were probably surprised it hadn't happened sooner.Speculation had been swirling for weeks in Russia about exactly what fate awaited Yevgeny Prigozhin. Exactly two months ago, the Wagner boss launched his brief mutiny.His mercenaries seized a major Russian city and even marched on Moscow. After the rebellion was called off, many thought Prigozhin's days were numbered. After all, the mutiny was a significant humiliation for the Kremlin, and President Putin isn't the kind of man to forgive and forget.About an hour after the crash, the Russian Federal Aviation Agency Rosaviatsiya released a statement confirming that Yevgeny Prigozhin's name was on the passenger manifest.That is unusually quick for Rosaviatsiya: the agency is usually much slower to respond to such incidents. That raised eyebrows here.Russian state TV is keeping reporting of the incident to a minimum, quoting government officials with no comment. In its main evening news bulletin, Kremlin-controlled Channel One dedicated just 30 seconds to the story.It is a well-known fact in Russia that state TV channels often wait until they receive official instructions regarding the tone of reporting.As for the Wagner group itself, Telegram channels linked to the mercenaries have claimed that Prigozhin ""was killedâ€¦.by traitors of Russia"". At the Wagner HQ in the city of St Petersburg, a makeshift shrine has appeared. Images on Russian media show people bringing flowers and candles to the Wagner Centre.Attention is now turning to what happened on board the flight. According to Russian media, investigators are looking into a number of possible causes, including ""external actions"".Commenting on the incident, political analyst Tatiana Stanovaya said that the cause of the plane crash is not important - more significant is the message it sends to any other potential mutineers: ""Everyone will see this as an act of retaliation and retributionâ€¦From Putin's perspective, as well as many among the security and military officials, Prigozhin's death should serve as a lesson.""Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.","Kyiv, Ukraine– Yevgeny Prigozhin, the foul-mouthed chief of the Wagner private army who masterminded an aborted mutiny against the Kremlin, has not been officially pronounced dead. Russian authorities have yet to confirm via a DNA test that the 62-year-old’s body was among the charred and mangled remnants of 10 people found in the debris of the private jet that crashed 350km (217 miles) northwest of Moscow late on Wednesday. Prigozhin was, however, listed as one of the plane’s passengers – along with the company’s founder and neo-Nazi sympathiser Dmitry Utkin nicknamed Wagner.  Few doubt Prigozhin’s presumed death, that took place exactly two months after the June 23 “justice march”, as he called it, of thousands of Wagner’s best fighters towards Moscow. The rebellion sowed panic in the Kremlin and reportedly forced Russian President Vladimir Putin to flee Moscow. The uprising was triggered by a months-old conflict with Russia’s Ministry of Defence that delayed or sabotaged ammunition supplies to Wagner on the front lines of southeastern Ukraine. The march stopped only 200km (124 miles) south of Moscow after Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko promised Prigozhin and all of Wagner a safe haven in his forested ex-Soviet nation bordering Ukraine. A top expert on Wagner is all but certain that Prigozhin is dead. “I’ve heard from a source in Wagner close to him that it’s likely true,” John Lechner, an investigative reporter in the United States who is writing a book about Prigozhin summarising years of research, told Al Jazeera shortly after Russian media reported the plane crash. Al Jazeera was unable to independently verify the claim. But those who doubt the demise cite Prigozhin’s penchant for disguises – and his chance to escape to the Central African Republic, Mali or other African nations where Wagner provides “security services” to local strongmen in exchange for a stake in mining and trading local natural resources. Russian police discovered a stash of fake passports with Prigozhin’s mugshots and names of other people a day after the failed coup, and framed photos of him wearing wigs, glasses and beards were found in his St Petersburg mansion and immediately ridiculed in online memes. “It’s nice and easy to fake one’s own death,” Ukrainian defence expert Maria Kucherenko, who authored a detailed report on Wagner, wrote on Facebook late Thursday. But there are no chances of really faking Prigozhin’s death in Russia, given the scrutiny of officials and forensics experts investigating the crash, said another analyst. “There could have been rumours [of fake death] had he done it in Africa, but not in Russia, where a DNA test will be quickly performed,” Nikolay Mitrokhin of Germany’s University of Bremen told Al Jazeera.  The DNA tests will be scrupulously monitored by the Kremlin given that it is the main benefactor of Prigozhin’s death, Mitrokhin said. “Judging by the sources, the plane was shot down. That’s what easy to believe. It is very beneficial for Russian authorities who can always shift the blame to an [air defence] lieutenant or major who made the mistake,” he said. According to a cellphone video purportedly showing Prigozhin’sLegacy Embraer jetmidair, it was falling, not gliding down, and apparently had only one engine running. A plume of smoke that did not resemble exhaust was seen behind the plane, and its tail and one of the wings fell far apart from the fuselage, which may indicate that the crash was caused by an explosion, according to the photos and videos from the crash site. In another amateur video showing the falling plane, witnessessay they had heard“two explosions”. Air defence forces routinely shoot at a plane twice to ensure it is hit. A source in Russia’s main aviation oversight body told the Tsargrad television channel that the plane was “blown up”. However, Flightradar 24, a Swedish aircraft tracker, said that the Brazilian-made jet went up to 8,500 metres (28,000 feet). Very few air defence weapons can hit a plane that high – and the Kremlin allegedly used two S-300 missiles, the VChK-OGPU Telegram channel with links to Russian law enforcement agencies claimed. Putin, a former KGB colonel who headed the FSB, the main KGB successor, in the late 1990s, is notoriously vindictive. Kremlin critics cite the case of Alexander Litvinenko, an FSB expert on organised crime who accused Putin of profiting from drug trafficking and money laundering. Litvinenko defected to the United Kingdom and died an agonising death in 2006 after drinking tea laced with radioactive polonium-210, an extremely rare and expensive poison. Putin called Litvinenko a “traitor”, and London said the Russian president “probably” sanctioned the assassination. “Traitors” was the epithet Putin used in his televised address on the day of Prigozhin’s mutiny. And even though the riot was called off and Wagner marched back to Russia-occupied areas in southeastern Ukraine, Putin’s reputation suffered greatly. High treason charges against Wagner chief and officers who shot down several Russian aircraft during their march were dropped a day later. Unlike other Putin allies who prefer to keep a low profile, Prigozhin was a motormouth. For months before the mutiny, he lambasted Russia’s top brass. And after it, thousands of key Wagner fighters relocated to hastily built camps in Belarusian forests. Some were spotted near the Suwalki Gap near the Polish-Lithuanian border that separates Belarus from Kaliningrad, Russia’s Baltic exclave. Prigozhin visited Russia several times and even met with Putin, while Wagner’s recruitment centres continued to operate. So, Putin may have followed the example of cinematic mafia boss Michael Corleone by serving his revenge cold, a Russian opposition activist said. “Prigozhin was relocated from the country. Within two months, they redistributed his assets, checked all contact chains, and replaced everything in the system that needed replacement. And now just got rid of [Prigozhin and his top lieutenants],” Sergey Bizyukin told Al Jazeera. “I don’t know whether [Prigozhin] had a chance to sit it all out in Belarus, but that was his only teeny-weeny chance” to survive, Bizyukin said. But since Wagner proved to be so effective, it may continue to exist and operate in Ukraine and elsewhere – even if it’s not just “bled dry, but decapitated”, according to independent military analyst David Gendelman. The plane crash reportedly wiped out Wagner’s top brass. One of the killed passengers was Valery Chkalov, a key Prigozhin ally in charge of Wagner’s logistics in Ukraine, Syria and Africa. Others were key lieutenants Yevgeny Makaryan and Sergey Propustin. But the company’s resources, including battle-tested fighters and smoothly functioning operations in Africa, are too valuable for the Kremlin to let Wagner disband, Gendelman said. “So, they will most likely keep operating under new control affiliated somehow with Russia’s leadership. And, perhaps, such control has already been organised as part of preparation to behead the organisation,” he told Al Jazeera. But Wagner’s – and Moscow’s – clout in Africa may eclipse because of the rising influence of China and other core members of the now-expanding BRICS bloc. “Russia’s sway in Africa will weaken irrespective of personalities at the helm” of Wagner, Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kushch told Al Jazeera."
Ukraine war: ICC 'undeterred' by arrest warrant for chief prosecutor,ICC war crimes prosecutor ‘wanted’ in Russia over Putin warrant,0.5116583268120757,2023-05-20,2023-05-20,"The International Criminal Court says it is ""undeterred"" by Russia putting its chief prosecutor on a wanted list.It comes two months after the ICC's Karim Khan issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin.In a statement on Saturday, the court said the move was an attempt to undermine its ""lawful mandate to ensure accountability for the gravest crimes"".Russia, which is not an ICC member, previously described the warrant against Mr Putin as being ""void"".Mr Khan, a British lawyer, issued the arrest warrant for President Putin in March. It alleged he is responsible for war crimes, and has focused its claims on the unlawful deportation of children from Ukraine to Russia.A warrant was also issued for Russia's child rights commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova on similar charges.More than 16,000 children are thought to have been forcibly transferred to Russia from Ukraine since the war began, according to officials in Kyiv. The ICC said at the time there were reasonable grounds to believe both Mr Putin and Ms Lvova-Belova bore individual criminal responsibility.The Kremlin's investigative committee in turn announced this week that it would begin an investigation into Mr Khan for the ""criminal prosecution of a person known to be innocent"". In a statement on Saturday, the Hague-based ICC said it was ""aware and profoundly concerned about unwarranted and unjustified coercive measures reportedly taken against ICC officials"".Branding the measures ""unacceptable"", the court said it would not be prevented from continuing to ""deliver on its independent mandate"".Mr Khan is yet to comment on the action against him. Meanwhile, the special representative of the United Nations secretary-general for children and armed conflict, Virginia Gamba, came under separate scrutiny after she reportedly met with Ms Lvova-Belova in Moscow.The Russian was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying the conversation was ""constructive and sincere"".Rights groups and senior officials took issue, though, with some suggesting the meeting was inappropriate.""Ukrainian victims deserve to see Lvova-Belova behind bars in The Hague, not meeting with high-level UN officials,"" Balkees Jarrah, associate director in the International Justice Programme at Human Rights Watch, said. Last September, Ms Lvova-Belova complained that some children removed from the city of Mariupol ""spoke badly about the [Russian President], said awful things and sang the Ukrainian anthem.""","Moscow has issued an arrest warrant for the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor who in Marchprepared a warrantfor the arrest of Russia’s President Vladimir Putin on war crimes charges, Russian media reported on Friday. Karim Khan, the prosecutor at the Hague-based war crimes court, was added to the Interior Ministry’s wanted list, Russia’s state-owned TASS news agency reported on Friday, citing the ministry’s database. A picture of the ICC prosecutor, who is a citizen of the United Kingdom, could be seen in the Russian interior ministry’s database on Friday,according to news reports. Russia’s Investigative Committee, which handles major crimes, said in March thatKhan was being probedfor the “criminal prosecution of a person known to be innocent” – in reference to the war crime charges against Putin. The ICC prosecutor was also being investigated for allegedly preparing “an attack on a representative of a foreign state enjoying international protection”, Russian investigators said at the time. The ICC member states on Saturday said they were “deeply concerned” by Russia’s decision. The Presidency of the Assembly of States Parties to the ICC, the court’s management oversight body, said in a statement it “regrets these acts of intimidation and unacceptable attempts to undermine the mandate of the International Criminal Court to investigate, sanction and prevent the commission of the gravest international crimes.” In a separate statement, the court said the measures were “unacceptable” and that it “will remain undeterred in the conduct of its lawful mandate to ensure accountability for the gravest crimes of concern to the international community as a whole.” The wanted notice described Khan as a man born on March 30, 1970 in Edinburgh, Scotland but did not specify his alleged offence. Russia opened the criminal probe into Khan after the ICC announced anarrest warranthad been issued for Putin over accusations he had committed war crimes by unlawfully deporting thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia.     Announcing the arrest warrants in March, the ICC said there were “reasonable grounds to believe that Mr Putin bears individual criminal responsibility” for the abductions of Ukrainian children, and “for having committed the acts directly, jointly with others and/or through others (and) for his failure to exercise control properly over civilian and military subordinates who committed the acts”. The ICC was later forced to issue astatementof concern after former Russian President Dmitry Medvedevthreatened to hitthe war crimes court in The Hague with hypersonic missiles. Earlier this month, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called the ICC “a puppet in the hands of the so-called collective West”, the Moscow Times reported. Russia, which is not a member of the ICC, has said the warrant is “void”. The international court also issued an arrest warrant against Maria Lvova-Belova, Russia’s presidential commissioner for children’s rights. Kyiv says more than 19,000 Ukrainian children have been deported to Russia since the beginning of Moscow’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, with more than 4,000 believed to be orphans. Many are allegedly placed in institutions and foster homes. Rights groups and the top US justice envoy on Saturday criticised a meeting between Virginia Gamba, the special representative of the UN secretary-general for children, and Lvova-Belova. Russia’s ombudsman for children’s rights said on her website on Friday that she held a working meeting with the top UN official. “The conversation turned out to be constructive and sincere – without politics,” she said. “After all, we are united by a sense of personal responsibility for the life and safety of children.” Balkees Jarrah, associate director in the International Justice Program at Human Rights Watch, said “Ukrainian victims deserve to see Lvova-Belova behind bars in The Hague, not meeting with high-level UN officials.” US Ambassador for Global Justice Beth van Schaack said on social media Friday night that such a meeting would be “deeply concerning.”   "
Belgorod: Russia blames Ukraine for shelling inside border,"Russia thwarts more Belgorod attacks, blames Ukraine",0.5089727102704691,2023-06-01,2023-06-02,"The Russian region of Belgorod has again come under attack from across the Ukrainian border, with at least eight people reportedly hurt in shelling. Russia's defence ministry has also claimed it thwarted other attempts by Ukraine to ""invade"" the region. Kyiv has not commented on the allegations but has denied involvement in previous attacks across the border.The latest strikes come more than a week after one of the most significant cross-border raids since the war began.Belgorod's governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said Ukraine's armed forces shelled several districts on Thursday, damaging buildings. No fatalities have been reported but Mr Gladkov said hundreds of families would be evacuated once the situation became calmer. Mr Gladkov added that as a result, some school exams in Shebekino had been cancelled and the authorities were now devising a way to allow students to secure university places without sitting them. He also said that there had been an explosion in Belgorod city, which was thought to have been caused by a drone. Two people were injured in that attack. Alongside the shelling, Russia's defence ministry has claimed its servicemen in the region repelled several attacks.It said in a statement on Thursday evening that more than 50 Ukrainian ""terrorists"", four armoured combat vehicles, a Grad multiple rocket launcher and a pickup truck were destroyed. It has not been possible to independently verify the reports.There have been conflicting reports about violence on the border.BBC Verify has seen videos from two pro-Ukrainian paramilitary groups, the Freedom of Russia Legion and the Russian Volunteer Corps, announcing raids into Russia's territory.Despite this, local officials have denied reports of a Ukrainian troop breakthrough in Shebekino adding that the situation remains difficult and that the ""shelling is ongoing"".Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russian President Vladimir Putin was aware of the situation in Belgorod and criticised the international committee for failing to condemn Ukraine. There have been a spate of attacks inside Russia in recent weeks. Earlier this week, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Ukraine of trying to frighten Russians following drone attacks in the capital, Moscow. Kyiv has denied involvement in any of the attacks. But the US is investigating whether any of its military equipment was used in the earlier incursion in Belgorod on 22 May and said it did not support any attack on Russian soil. Meanwhile, three people have died during another attack on Ukraine's capital, Kyiv. An 11-year-old girl is reported to be among the dead. It is the fourth attack on the city this week and comes after 17 strikes were launched on Kyiv throughout May. It comes as the country's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, again called for Ukraine to be allowed to join Nato and the EU.He was visiting Moldova for the European Political Community summit, where he also met European Commission President Ursula von Der Leyen.He said their talks touched on security guarantees for Ukraine while it's waiting to join Nato. ","Russia’s defence ministry has said it thwarted three cross-border attacks near the town of Shebekino, as it accused Ukraine of using what it said were “terrorist formations”. Shebekino lies in the Belgorod region, which has been targeted in a number of attacks since May. “Overall, the attack involved up to 70 militants, five tanks, four armoured vehicles, seven pick-up trucks and a Kamaz truck,” the Russian defence ministry said on Thursday evening, reporting at least three attempted crossings. It said it used air force and artillery to repel the attacks and killed more than 50 Ukrainian fighters. The Russian Volunteer Corps (RVC), a far-right paramilitary group of ethnic Russians that supports Ukraine, claimed to be fighting inside Russia. “The second phase promised by the RVC’s commander has begun!” it said on Telegram, referring to a previous incursion, alongside images of fighters firing weapons. Another anti-Kremlin group that calls itself the Freedom of Russia Legion also announced a plan to launch a cross-border raid. The Belgorod region saw an unprecedented two-day armed incursion last week and has come under intensified fire in the past days. Ukraine denies its military is involved in theincursionsand says they are conducted by Russian volunteer fighters. Vyacheslav Gladkov, the Belgorod region’s governor, accused Ukrainian armed forces of repeatedly shelling Shebekino with Soviet-designed grad 122mm rockets, setting alight a dormitory and damaging an administrative building. Gladkov said at least 12 people had been wounded in the previous 24 hours. Residents poured into centres for displaced people in Belgorod city. “There are many families with children, including infants and disabled people. We will try to provide them with as much care as possible,” said city mayor Valentin Demidov. Two people were wounded in the city when a drone crashed near a petrol station, he added. It was not possible to independently verify accounts from either side. The RVC and Freedom of Russia Legion claimed responsibility for last month’scross-border raidthat marked one of the most serious attacks on Russian territory since Moscow began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine."
Nato summit: Ukraine's future membership to be discussed by leaders in Vilnius,"NATO membership of Ukraine, Sweden in focus at Vilnius summit",0.5029699561221599,2023-07-11,2023-07-10,"Nato leaders are gathering in Lithuania for a crucial summit that could shape the direction of the war in Ukraine and the future of the Western alliance. The 31 allies hope to show Russia they have the resolve to support Ukraine militarily for the long term. They arrive with a welcome boost after Turkey dropped its objections to Sweden joining the alliance.But there remains disagreement over what to say about Ukraine's own ambitions of future membership. It is thought some allies will promise Kyiv new security guarantees designed to deter future Russian aggression. They will also discuss providing more weapons and ammunition. On the membership issue, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wants Nato to say Ukraine could join as soon as possible after the fighting ends - setting out explicitly how and when this could be achieved. But some Nato nations are reluctant to go too far, fearing the promise of near-automatic membership could give Russia an incentive both to escalate and drag out the war. Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, said no final decision had been made on the language of the final communiquÃ©, but added: ""I am absolutely certain that we will have unity and a strong message on Ukraine.""But after late night talks on Monday, he announced that Turkey had agreed to support Sweden's application to join Nato. The news was welcomed by the US and Germany, as well as Sweden itself.Turkey had spent months blocking Stockholm's application, accusing it of hosting Kurdish militants. Mr Stoltenberg said the two sides had worked together to address Turkey's ""legitimate security concerns"".Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan earlier suggested he would back Sweden if the EU re-opened frozen membership talks with Ankara - a request that was rejected by EU officials.Over their two-day meeting, Nato leaders are expected to agree new plans to deter and defend the alliance against future Russian aggression by beefing up their forces in the east. And they are also expected to step up their financial commitment, making the target of spending 2% of national wealth on defence a minimum figure, rather than a general ambition. Rishi Sunak's spokesman said the UK prime minister would call on allies directly to meet this target. Security is tight in Vilnius, with Nato forces - including Patriot air defence missiles - defending a summit taking place only a short distance from Belarus and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The overarching aim of the meeting is for Nato to convince President Vladimir Putin of the alliance's long-term military commitment to Ukraine. Officials hope this could begin to change the Russian leader's thinking, putting doubt in his mind that he can outwait the West. As such, some see this summit as potentially as important as military gains on the battlefield in persuading Mr Putin to change his strategy. So some Nato members will promise Ukraine new security guarantees. US President Joe Biden has suggested Ukraine could get the kind of military support his country gives Israel - long-term commitments designed to deter potential aggressors. The alliance will also deepen its institutional links with Ukraine. An existing forum - the Ukraine Nato Commission - will be upgraded to a Ukraine Nato Council. This will give Ukraine the ability to summon meetings of the alliance as an equal partner round the table. ""The right to consult is not insignificant,"" said one official.But perhaps most importantly, some members are expected to set out more explicitly Ukraine's pathway to joining the alliance. Nato agreed at its 2008 summit in Bucharest that Ukraine ""will"" become a member and supported its application. But the alliance did not say how and when this might happen. Critics say giving Ukraine a destination but no itinerary allowed Mr Putin to risk his invasions in both 2014 and 2022. Mr Biden will meet Mr Zelensky at the summit, a US official told Reuters, although the Ukrainian president is yet to officially confirm his participation at the event.Kyiv accepts Nato cannot formally invite Ukraine to join while fighting rages. That would risk plunging the alliance into war with Russia, as Nato would be obliged under Article 5 of its treaty to defend any member that is under attack.Instead, Kyiv wants a clear promise of post-war membership with a timeline, so it knows victory will bring the security guarantee of Nato's nuclear umbrella.  One way for Nato to signal its desire to welcome Ukraine into its ranks would be to shorten the so-called membership application plan, known as the MAP. This is the formal process which tests whether a country meets Nato's strict military and governmental standards - and it can take decades. But it is what Nato might actually say about Ukraine's potential membership that is dividing the alliance. The Baltic states and eastern European nations are pushing for as much clarity as possible. They want the alliance to make clear how much progress Ukraine has made towards membership, especially how much more closely its army can operate with other Nato forces, now that it shares similar weapons and strategies. They also want Nato to make clear what further conditions Ukraine must meet to achieve membership. Gitanas Nauseda, the president of Lithuania, said Nato should avoid Ukraine's membership becoming a horizon: ""The more you walk towards it, the farther it is.""But some allies - including the US and Germany - are cautious about promising Ukraine too much. They want Ukraine to do more to tackle corruption, strengthen its judiciary and ensure civilian control over its military. Some also worry about Nato getting dragged into open conflict with Russia. They fear promising Ukraine membership after the war would give Putin an incentive both to escalate the conflict and drag it out, maintaining low-intensity fighting to prevent Ukraine ever joining. Other allies also fear losing room for manoeuvre in any post-war negotiations. They want to use the promise of Nato membership as a carrot for Ukraine and a stick for Russia, but only after the fighting has ended.

The military alliance members will seek to reaffirm their support for war-torn Ukraine on Tuesday and Wednesday, overcome differences over Sweden’s perspective NATO membership, and display a united stance against Russia’s aggression. “This week, at the NATO summit, we will strengthen our deterrence and defence, including with more investment. We will step up our support for Ukraine, and move Ukraine closer to NATO,” the military alliance’s Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters in Vilnius. “Lithuania seeks this summit to be remembered as the summit of decisions – not just declarations,” Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda said in a tweet on the eve of the summit. For Ukraine, a key decision after the Vilnius summit is to gain confirmation on its NATO membership. Kyivappliedto become a member of the alliance last September, seeking to fortify its borders with Russia. Since then, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, his officials – and Ukrainians within the country and around the world – have been lobbying NATO nations to speed up Kyiv’s accession process. But NATO members remain divided over the issue of offering Kyiv the alliance membership amid an ongoing war despite a broad consensus to signal strong support for Ukraine. Nations like the United States and Germany have displayed a restrictive stance towards the idea, compared to NATO’s Baltic members like Lithuania and Poland. In aninterview with broadcaster CNNover the weekend, US President Joe Biden said that Ukraine was still in the middle of a war with Russia, and if Kyiv became a NATO member, then it would drag the entire alliance into the battlefield – a sentiment shared by Germany, Turkey and some other NATO members. “For example, if you did that, then, you know – and I mean what I say – we’re determined to commit every inch of territory that is NATO territory. It’s a commitment that we’ve all made no matter what. If the war is going on, then we’re all in war. We’re at war with Russia, if that were the case,” Biden said. The US leader was referencing NATO’s cornerstone for collective defence – Article 5, which states that an armed attack against one NATO member is an armed attack against all. But a day before the onset of the summit, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in a tweet that “following intensive talks, NATO allies have reached consensus on removing MAP (Membership Action Plan) from Ukraine’s path to membership”. He welcomed this decision and said that it offers Ukraine clarity on becoming a NATO member. Following intensive talks, NATO allies have reached consensus on removing MAP from Ukraine's path to membership. I welcome this long-awaited decision that shortens our path to NATO. It is also the best moment to offer clarity on the invitation to Ukraine to become member. — Dmytro Kuleba (@DmytroKuleba)July 10, 2023  Moreover, on Friday, when Stoltenberg was asked whether NATO’s declaration regarding Kyiv’s Ukraine membership will be stronger than the alliance’s 2008 Bucharest Summit Declaration, when Ukraine and Georgia were promised a similar future in NATO, Stoltenberg said that there are differences this year. “One important difference is that Ukraine has come much closer to NATO, because NATO allies have worked closely with Ukraine for many years, especially since 2014. So, this has ensured a much higher level of cooperation and interoperability between Ukraine and NATO,” he said. Meanwhile, the Kremlin has said that Ukraine becoming a member of NATO would demand “a harsh response” from Russia.    But NATO chief Stoltenberg told reporters in Brussels on Friday that at the Vilnius summit, he expects the alliance to agree to a multiyear programme of assistance to Ukraine, in the face of threats from Russia. “We have already pledged 500 million euros [$548m] for critical needs, including fuel, medical supplies, de-mining equipment and pontoon bridges. We will also help build Ukraine’s security and defence sector, including with military hospitals. And we will help Ukraine transition from Soviet-era to NATO equipment and standards,” he said. He added that NATO will also upgrade its political ties with Kyiv by setting up a NATO-Ukraine Council, which Zelenskyy will inaugurate as a part of this week’s summit. According to Stoltenberg, the Council would act like a consultation mechanism between NATO members and Ukraine, whereby if Kyiv feels threatened, specific issues could be instantly discussed and decided by the Council, bringing Ukraine closer to the alliance. “The NATO-Ukraine Council is a step in the right direction for Kyiv because it will send quite a strong message not only to Ukrainians but also to the Russian President Vladimir Putin,” Harry Nedelcu, geopolitics director at Rasmussen Global and leader of its Ukraine Advisory Service, told Al Jazeera. “But at this summit, the serious debate with respect to Ukraine is going to be on providing Kyiv with more security guarantees in the interim period, until the country joins NATO. These guarantees would include enhancing Ukraine’s military capabilities, and also helping the country develop its own military industry to sustain itself,” Nedelcu added. So far, the US, Germany, the United Kingdom and other countries have said they would pledge to embolden Ukraine militarily in the face of Russian aggression. While strengthening and supporting Ukraine remains a key priority at the Vilnius summit, another pressing matter is Sweden’s future in NATO. Sweden and Finland applied to become NATO memberslast May. While Finland has joined, Turkey and Hungary have been holding up Sweden’s membership. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused Sweden of providing safe haven to members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and the Democratic Union Party (PYD) in Syria, both of which Ankara considers “terrorist” organisations. Erdogan also asked Sweden to lift an arms embargo on Turkey imposed in 2019 after Ankara’s incursion into northern Syria. He said these were important “security concerns” for Turkey that had to be resolved before he agreed to NATO’s enlargement.    While Sweden has passed an “anti-terrorism” law and lifted the arms embargo, the recent incident of theburning of the Quranin the country has once again angered Turkey, and Erdogan has repeatedly expressed that Stockholm has not done enough to quash Kurdish groups. Erdogan and Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson will meet in the presence of Stoltenberg before the Vilnius summit begins to resolve their differences. “A good scenario would be if in Vilnius, Erdogan says, ‘I am satisfied with the actions of the Swedish parliament and I am ready to put this in front of my Parliament’,” a senior NATO official told journalists in a press briefing before the summit. “There are more than 50 percent of chances that this happens, but let’s see,” he added. According to Bruno Lete, security and defence expert at the German Marshall Fund of the United States (GMF) in Brussels, from a technical perspective there is nothing that prevents Sweden from becoming a NATO member. “Sweden has one of the most performant armed forces in Europe. So, this is really a political problem,” he told Al Jazeera. “Turkey is using its veto on Swedish membership to pursue its self-interest. Turkey is interested in regaining access to the US F-16 jet fighter programme. The country was removed from the programme years ago after it decided to buy Russian S-400 systems despite warnings from Washington not to do so,” he said. “At this point, negotiations between Turkey and Sweden are still in a deadlock. But the real kingmaker here is the United States, which has decision-making power on pulling Turkey back into the jet fighter programme. The problem is that Washington is not so keen to do so,” Lette said, adding that once Turkey ratifies Sweden’s membership, Hungary will follow suit. In his interview with CNN, Biden acknowledged Turkey’s ambitions and said that Turkey is seeking to modernise its F-16 fleet, along with Greece. “And so, what I’m trying to, quite frankly, put together is a little bit of a consortium here, where we’re strengthening NATO in terms of military capacity of both Greece as well as Turkey, and allow Sweden to come in. But it’s in play. It’s not done,” Biden said. Prior to his departure to the Vilnius summit, Erdogan denied links between Sweden’s NATO membership and Ankara’s F-16 goal. But he said if Turkey became a member of the European Union, it would speed up Sweden’s NATO membership. In a press conference in Vilnius before the summit, Stoltenberg said he supported Turkey’s EU membership and highlighted that it is still possible that Sweden could join NATO at the summit.  Another key priority for the transatlantic military alliance is countering threats from China, an integral issue for leaders from Japan, Australia, New Zealand and South Korea who are also attending the summit. At the NATO summit last year in Spain’s capital Madrid, the alliance identified China as a “systemic challenge to Euro-Atlantic security” and has acknowledged Beijing’s “no-limits” partnership with Russia. But according to GMF’s Lete, while the leaders from Asia, Australia and New Zealand want NATO to weigh in further on China, the alliance’s goal to partner with these nations is merely for information exchange and situational awareness and is not a military partnership. “A recent proposal to increase the NATO presence in Asia by opening a representation office in Tokyo was actually blocked by France. The alliance focuses on addressing the Chinese strategic threat here locally in Europe, not by expanding its presence in Asia,” he said. “I believe NATO is well equipped to deal with external threats and the rapidly changing world order,” Lete said. “Its core mission to defend Europe and bind both sides of the Atlantic is more relevant than ever. But in my opinion, the biggest challenge NATO will need to deal with in the future emerges from the inside.”"
Russian influencer Ivleeva fined for hosting 'almost naked' party,‘Almost naked’ celebrity party triggers backlash in wartime Russia,0.5018028900564977,2023-12-29,2023-12-29,"TV presenter and influencer Anastasia Ivleeva has already apologised twice for hosting an ""almost naked"" party in a Moscow club that sparked a moral backlash in wartime Russia.Now Lefortovo court in Moscow has imposed a 100,000-rouble (Â£870; $1,100) fine on her for arranging it.""I would like to ask you, the people, for a second chance,"" she pleaded in an Instagram video this week.She was convicted of organising a mass presence that violated public order.But Friday's fine may not be the end of her public humiliation.A remorseful Ivleeva has already promised to donate the proceeds of ticket sales to charities. But another court has registered a billion-rouble class action lawsuit against her for ""moral damage"", signed by 22 people, who want her to hand the billion to a group that donates money to Russians fighting in Ukraine.After the party, held on 20 December at Moscow's Mutabor nightclub, video emerged of well-known Russian celebrities dressed in underwear and lingerie, and in one case a strategically placed sock and a pair of shoes.What had been a private party quickly became public property amid a wartime climate of increasing intolerance. It also served as a distraction from anger at the rising price of eggs.Russian rapper Vacio, whose single-sock outfit led to his arrest, has since been handed a 15-day jail term for ""disorderly conduct"". Otherwise known as Nikolai Vasiliev, he was found guilty of promoting ""non-traditional sexual relations"" and handed a fine twice that of Ivleeva's.In the words of BBC Russia Editor Steve Rosenberg, pro-Kremlin bloggers, MPs and activists, who supported the war, were furious. ""How could celebrities be out partying like this while Russian soldiers were putting their lives on the line in the 'special military operation'?""""Our soldiers on the front line are definitely not fighting for this,"" said pro-censorship activist Yekaterina Mizulina, who runs Russia's League for a Safe Internet.More from Steve Rosenberg: Moral backlash for guests of Ivleeva's 'almost naked' partyOther guests have been punished in different ways, with concerts or sponsorship contracts cancelled. Some are said to have been removed from Channel One's glitzy pre-recorded New Year's Eve TV show, which many Russians may now watch to spot who has been edited out.Veteran singer Lolita Milyavskaya says her gigs are being cancelled and she is being ""cut out of television"". Anastasia Ivleeva herself has seen her face vanish from mobile firm MTS's advertising campaign and her business is facing an audit from the tax service.Former Eurovision singer Dima Bilan and TV presenter Ksenia Sobchak have said sorry too.So-called king of Russian pop Philipp Kirkorov was as profuse in his apology to the public as any of his fellow guests, saying simply: ""There are moments in everyone's life when you walk through the wrong door.""Widely regarded as President Vladimir Putin's favourite singer, Kirkorov appealed for his ""mistake"" not to affect his career in ""Russia, the only country I exist in as an artist and as a citizen"".Suggestions that he might be deprived of his ""Order of Honour"" appear to be false, but he has been removed from a poster for a New Year's Eve TV film called ""Ivan Vasilievech changes everything"".The remake of a popular old Soviet-era film features Kirkorov as Peter the Great and the TV channel director has said some of the scenes are being re-shot before it airs.The Kremlin has, meanwhile, distanced itself from the outcry. ""Let you and I be the only ones in the country who aren't discussing this topic,"" spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.","A rapper who partied at a Moscow nightclub wearing nothing but a strategically-placed sock has been jailed for 15 days, and several other Russian stars have issued public apologies after a celebrity party with the dress code “almost naked” triggered a storm of criticism and a slew of investigations. The crackdown came after pictures from the party, which took place on the night of December 20 and was organised by TV presenter and actress Anastasia Ivleeva, began circulating on social media. Amid the scantily-clad celebrities at the Mutabor nightclub was Vacio, the rapper, while Ivleeva was pictured flaunting an emerald-studded chain around her backside worth 23 million roubles ($251,000) at a time when some Russians are struggling to get by. Conservative legislators, bloggers and others were fiercely critical, contending the images were unseemly, even unpatriotic, for the country, which launched a full-scale invasion of neighbouring Ukraine in February 2022. The issue has dominated the headlines for days, pushing out stories about rising egg prices and other concerns. Maria Zakharova, a spokesperson for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that the event had “stained” those who took part, but that they now had a chance to work on themselves, the Ura.ru news outlet reported. Vacio, whose legal name is Nikolai Vasilyev, was jailed by a Moscow court for 15 days and fined 200,000 roubles ($2,182) under the LGBTQ “propaganda” law, which was toughened last year and bans positive information on lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender people. Ivleeva issued two public apology videos following the event, including one on Wednesday, where she said she regretted her actions and deserved everything she got but hoped she could be given “a second chance”. Her name has since disappeared as one of the public faces of major Russian mobile phone operator MTS, the tax authorities have opened an investigation that carries a potential five-year jail term, and a Moscow court has accepted a lawsuit from a group of more than 20 people demanding she pay out one billion roubles ($10.9m) for “moral suffering”. If successful, they want the money to go to a state fund that supports Russian veterans from the war in Ukraine. Russia’s flamboyant pop king Filipp Kirkorov also asked for forgiveness after footage circulated of him wearing a sparkling lace outfit with futuristic sunglasses. “In today’s difficult and heroic times, an artist of my calibre … cannot and should not be so irresponsible when participating in various events,” he said. Other partygoers have also recorded apologies, including journalist Ksenia Sobchak whose late father Anatoly was once a friend and boss of President Vladimir Putin. “To hold such events at a time when our guys are dying in the [Ukrainian] special military operation and many children are losing their fathers is cynical,” said Yekaterina Mizulina, director of Russia’s League for a Safe Internet, a body founded with the authorities’ support. Russia calls its invasion a “special military operation“. “Our soldiers on the front line are definitely not fighting for this.” The scandal comes when Putin, who is expected to comfortably win another six-year term in elections in March, has doubled down on social conservatism, repeatedly condemning Western countries for supposedly undermining “traditional values“. In November, Russia’s Supreme Court ruled that the “LGBT movement” should be designated as “extremists.” Standing outside the Bolshoi Theatre on Thursday, Nadezhda, one Moscow resident, told the Reuters news agency she was outraged and thought those who went to the party should be punished. “If you’re partying, at least don’t film it,” she said. “At such a difficult time [for Russia], they should at least be ashamed. Aren’t they ashamed before those who are fighting for us?”"
Russia strikes civilian ship in Black Sea port of Odesa - Ukraine,Ukraine says Russia struck civilian ship near Odesa,0.5016957099140748,2023-11-08,2023-11-08,"At least one person has been killed after a Russian missile struck a civilian ship entering the Ukrainian Black Sea port of Odesa, Ukrainian officials say.According to the southern defence forces, the Liberian-flagged vessel was struck by an anti-radar missile. A 43-year-old harbour pilot died, while three Filipino crewmembers and a port worker have been injured.There was no immediate comment from Russia on the incident.According to Odesa's Regional Prosecutor's Office, which is investigating, the attack was launched at 16:45 local time (14:45 GMT) on Wednesday. The ship was reportedly moored at the time it was struck.One of the injured workers was hospitalised. Ukraine's Infrastructure Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said on social media that the ship was supposed to be transporting iron ore to China. Vessels entering and leaving the port of Odesa have been at risk of Russian attack since Moscow pulled out of a deal earlier this year that allowed for the safe export of Ukrainian grain. Ukraine has since opened a temporary corridor to allow vessels to come and go from its ports. The Russian defence ministry said it regards all cargo ships in the Black Sea bound for Ukraine as potential military targets. According to Mr Kubrakov, Wednesday's attack is the 21st targeted assault on port infrastructure since Russia withdrew from the deal in July. At least eight people were wounded and a historic museum was damaged on Sunday during Russian airstrikes on Odesa, Ukrainian officials said. ","Russia has fired a missile at a Liberia-flagged civilian ship entering a port in the Black Sea region ofOdesa, according to the Ukrainian army. A harbour pilot was killed and four of the ship’s crew were injured in the attack on Wednesday. “The missile hit the structure of a civilian vessel flying the Liberian flag as it was entering the port,” the army said. “Three crew members, citizens of the Philippines, were injured, one of them was hospitalised. The pilot was killed and another port worker was injured,” it added. Since a United Nations-brokered deal guaranteeing safe passage for civilian shipsfell through in July, both Kyiv and Moscow have ramped up military activity and attacks in the Black Sea. “Continuing the terror of civilian shipping, the enemy insidiously fired an Kh-31P anti-radar missile in the direction of one of the ports of Odesa region from tactical aircraft in the Black Sea,” the Ukrainian army said. The collapse of the UN-backed grain export dealprompted Moscow to warnthat any ships entering Ukrainian ports could be viewed as potential military targets. Ukraine subsequently announced the launch of a new “humanitarian corridor” – a sea route for civilian ships – that avoids international waters. But Russia has continued to attack Ukraine’s grain-exporting ports and infrastructure. EU membership prospects On Wednesday, the European Union’s executiverecommendedopening formal membership talks with Ukraine, as soon as it meets final conditions, in a major show of support for Kyiv in itsbattle against Russia. “This is a strong and historic step that paves the way to a stronger EU with Ukraine as its member,” Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyposted on social media. Zelenskyy also said that Ukraine would still try to deliver battlefield results by the end of the year and that he remained sure Kyiv would eventually have success in the war despite difficulties at the front. Acknowledging the slow progress of Kyiv’s counteroffensive in the occupied south, in an interview by video link at the Reuters NEXT conference in New York, he also touted a Ukrainian battlefield plan for 2024 that he said he could not disclose. His tone contrasted with the gloomier assessment last week of his commander-in-chief who said the fighting now in its 21st month might be heading towards a deadlock and a war of attrition that could play into Russia’s hands."
Ukraine's defence minister Oleksii Reznikov dismissed,Ukraine’s Zelenskyy moves to replace Oleksii Reznikov in defence shake-up,0.5009237151039974,2023-09-04,2023-09-03,"Ukraine's Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov has confirmed that he is leaving his post.Mr Reznikov had led the ministry since before the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022.President Volodymyr Zelensky announced Mr Reznikov's dismissal on Sunday, saying it was time for ""new approaches"" in the defence ministry.Rustem Umerov, who runs Ukraine's State Property Fund, has been nominated as Mr Reznikov's successor.In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Mr Reznikov confirmed that he had submitted his resignation letter to the country's parliament.Ukrainian media has speculated that he will become Kyiv's new ambassador in London, where he has developed good relations with senior politicians. The 57-year-old has become a well-known figure since the beginning of the war in Ukraine. Internationally recognised, he has regularly attended meetings with Ukraine's western allies and played a key role in lobbying for additional military equipment.But his dismissal has been anticipated for some time. Last week, Mr Reznikov told reporters he was exploring other positions with the Ukrainian president.According to local media, the former defence minister said that if Mr Zelensky offered the opportunity for him to work on another project he would probably agree. Ukrainian defence advisor Yuriy Sak told the BBC that Mr Reznikov spearheaded the transformation of the ministry, laying the groundwork for future NATO membership. ""His legacy is that he has convinced ministers of defence around the world that the impossible is possible,"" he said in reference to Mr Reznikov's successful lobbying of foreign governments for arms. But experts have observed that the cabinet reshuffle is unlikely to lead to any major change in Ukraine's battlefield strategy, with Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi - the commander of Ukraine's armed forces - overseeing the campaign. Mr Reznikov's dismissal comes amid a wider anti-corruption drive in Mr Zelensky's administration - which has been seen as essential to Ukraine's ambitions to join Western institutions like the EU.According to the Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index, Ukraine ranks 116th out of 180, but efforts in recent years have seen its position improve significantly.While Mr Reznikov is not personally accused of corruption, there have been a number of scandals at the ministry of defence involving the procurement of goods and equipment for the army at inflated prices.Earlier this year Mr Reznikov's deputy, Vyacheslav Shapovalov, resigned in the wake of the scandal. It was widely reported at the time that Mr Reznikov barely held on to his own post. At the time, he said the stress he had endured was ""hard to measure precisely"", adding that his ""conscience is absolutely clear"".The defence ministry has also been rocked by several recent arrests at regional recruitment offices, where officers have been accused of taking bribes to allow men to avoid Ukraine's military draft.On Friday, the US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan met with senior Ukrainian anti-corruption officials and urged them to continue prosecuting anti-graft cases ""no matter where they lead"". Mr Umerov, who was nominated by the president, represented Ukraine in peace talks at the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion. The ex-MP allegedly suffered symptoms of suspected poisoning during peace negotiations in March 2022 alongside Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich - who was also part of the negotiating party. In a statement posted to Facebook he later denied the reports, urging people not to trust ""unverified information"".  Speaking to the BBC at the time, he said it took courage to find solutions but he was determined ""to find [a] political and diplomatic resolution to this brutal invasion"".A member of the Crimean Tatar community, he has become a key member of Mr Zelensky's international outreach efforts, focussing on fostering ties in the Islamic world. Mr Reznikov's dismissal comes as Ukraine wages a slow and bloody counter-offensive after securing more advanced weapons from Western allies.Progress on the frontline has been slow but top Ukrainian generals said on Sunday that their forces have broken through a key line of Russian defences in the south of the country. Meanwhile, Russia reported several attempted drone attacks on its territory overnight. The defence ministry said it shot down two drones over the Kursk region, which borders Ukraine, early on Monday. The region's governor Roman Stravoit also reported on Sunday that debris from a destroyed drone had caused a fire at a non-residential building in the city of Kurchatov. Elsewhere, Russia launched its own 3.5-hour overnight assault on the south of Ukraine's Odesa region, with the governor reporting that 17 drones were downed. ""Unfortunately, there are also hits,"" added Oleh Kiper, who said there had been damage to ""several settlements"" in the region of Izmail. But he said there were no casualties or injuries.Izmail is one of Ukraine's two major grain-exporting ports on the Danube River in the Odesa region. The Danube ports have become Ukraine's major exporting route since the collapse of the Black Sea grain deal in July. Moscow has launched frequent attacks on the Danube since withdrawing from the deal.Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he would ask parliament this week to dismissDefence Minister Oleksii Reznikovand to replace him with Rustem Umerov, head of Ukraine’s main privatisation fund. The announcement on Sunday, made in Zelenskyy’s nightly video address to the nation, sets the stage for the biggest shake-up of Ukraine’s defence establishmentduring the war. Reznikov, who was named defence minister in November 2021, has helped secure billions of dollars of Western military aid to assist the war effort, but has been dogged by graft allegations surrounding his ministry that he described as smears. “I’ve decided to replace the Minister of Defense of Ukraine. Oleksii Reznikov has been through more than 550 days of full-scale war,” Zelenskyy said. “I believe the ministry needs new approaches and other formats of interaction with both the military and society as a whole.” The change of defence minister must be approved by parliament, but is likely to be supported by a majority of lawmakers in the Verkhovna Rada. Zelenskyy said he expected parliament to approve Umerov’s appointment. Umerov, a 41-year-old ex-lawmaker who is a Crimean Tatar, has headed Ukraine’s State Property Fund since September 2022 and has played a role in sensitive wartime negotiations on, for instance, the Black Sea grain deal. Zelenskyy’s announcement comes after Reznikov claimed the F-16 fighter jets supplied by Ukraine’s allies would be deployed by next spring and boasted about the country’s plans to increase drone production in an interview with the Ukrainian state news agency Ukrinform. “I think this autumn there will be a boom in the production of various Ukrainian drones: flying, floating, crawling, etc, and this will continue to grow in volume,” Reznikov said. Earlier on Sunday, Zelenskyy spoke with his counterpart French President Emmanuel Macron to discuss the “functioning” of asea corridorset up by Kyiv for safe navigation of ships after Moscow exited a landmark grain deal. The phone call came on the eve of asummitin Russia between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who wants to revive the grain deal, and as Moscow hit Ukraine’s Odesa region with drones. “We also discussed ways to ensure the functioning of the grain corridor and enhance the security of the Odesa region,” Zelensky said on social media after a phone call with Macron. Ukraine this week said four more ships had gone through its temporary maritime corridor in the Black Sea, set up last month to ensure safe navigation.

The US accusations raised questions over South Africa’s professed stance of non-alignment and neutrality over Russia’s war in Ukraine and concerns about possible Western sanctions. South African officials were quick to reject the claims, with Ramaphosa’s government launching an independent inquiry led by a retired judge."
