Who was Hamas leader Saleh al-Arouri killed in Beirut?,"Who was Saleh al-Arouri, the Hamas leader killed in Beirut?",0.9779724266914104,2024-01-02,2024-01-03,"Saleh al-Arouri was one of the most senior figures in the Hamas hierarchy - a leading man on both the political and military fronts. The 57-year-old was the deputy head of Hamas's political bureau, and helped establish the group's military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades.He had remained deeply involved with the group's military affairs.He was killed in an explosion in Beirut's southern suburb of Dahiyeh, an attack widely blamed on Israel.Saleh al-Arouri joined Hamas in 1987, and helped establish the group's military presence in the occupied West Bank.He was one of the closest connected Hamas officials to both Iran and Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon. He had served time in Israeli prisons. After his release he was a negotiator in a deal that saw more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners being released in return for the freeing of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in 2011.On 27 October this year the Israeli army had demolished his West Bank home in the town of Arura, near Ramallah. Arouri was living in Lebanon at the time of his death.Lebanese media reported that he was killed in an Israeli drone attack on Hamas's office in the southern Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh, alongside six others who were reported to have also been members of Hamas. This is not just about who was killed but where he was killed. A senior Hamas official killed in a Hezbollah stronghold in Lebanon is bound to make things even more precarious at a very volatile junction in the fighting.Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati described the killing as a new Israeli war crime that aimed to drag Lebanon into a new phase of the conflict.Hezbollah called the attack a ""serious assault on Lebanon, its people, its security, [and] sovereignty"" and warned that ""this crime will never pass without response and punishment"".Izzat Al-Rishq, a member of the Hamas Political bureau called it a ""cowardly assassination by the Zionist occupation"". Israel's military has not commented, telling the BBC it does not respond to reports in foreign media. Israel is widely reported to commit targeted killings on foreign soil, but rarely comments on cross-border strikes. Mark Regev, adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, did not say that Israel was responsible but called the attack a ""surgical strike"" against Hamas's leadership.The country and the wider region now faces an anxious wait to see how Hezbollah reacts, and whether Israel's war in Gaza spills over into Lebanon.","A drone strike in Beirut’s southern suburbs of Dahiyeh, a Hezbollah stronghold, killed senior Hamas official Saleh al-Arouri on Tuesday. The drone hit a Hamas office, leaving six people dead, Lebanon’s state news agency reported. Hamas confirmed the death of al-Arouri and called it a “cowardly assassination” by Israel, adding that attacks on Palestinians “inside and outside Palestine will not succeed in breaking the will and steadfastness of our people, or undermining the continuation of their valiant resistance”. “It proves once again the abject failure of this enemy to achieve any of its aggressive goals in the Gaza Strip,” the group said. Following the news of the death of al-Arouri, mosques in Arura, the occupied West Bank town of north Ramallah, are mourning his death and a general strike has been called in Ramallah for Wednesday. Here is what to know about the Hamas official killed in Lebanon. Al-Arouri, 57, was the deputy chief of Hamas’s political bureau and one of the founders of the group’s armed wing, the Qassam Brigades. He had been living in exile in Lebanon after spending 15 years in an Israeli jail. Before the war began on October 7, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had threatened to kill him. In recent weeks, al-Arouri took on the role of spokesperson for the group and told Al Jazeera last month that Hamas would not discuss an exchange deal for the captives the group is holding before the war ends in Gaza. The United States labelled al-Arouri as a “global terrorist” in 2015 and issued a $5m reward for any information on him. While there has been no official response from Israel about the death of the Hamas official, Mark Regev, an adviser to Netanyahu, told the US outlet MSNBC that Israel does not take responsibility for this attack. But, added, “Whoever did it, it must be clear: this was not an attack on the Lebanese state.” “Whoever did this did a surgical strike against the Hamas leadership,” he said. However, Danny Danon, a former Israeli envoy to the United Nations, hailed the attack and congratulated the Israeli army, Shin Bet, the security service and Mossad, Israel’s intelligence agency, for killing al-Arouri. “Anyone who was involved in the 7/10 massacre should know that we will reach out to them and close an account with them,” he said on X in Hebrew, referring to the October 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel that killed nearly 1,200 people. Israel’s relentless bombing and artillery shelling of Gaza since then has killed more than 22,000 Palestinians, including more than 8,000 children. According to Israeli media, the government has ordered cabinet ministers not to give any interviews about al-Arouri’s death after Danon’s tweet. Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned the attack on the Beruit suburb and said it was a “new Israeli crime” as well as an attempt to pull Lebanon into the war. Mikati also warned against the “Israeli political upper echelon resorting to exporting its failures in Gaza to the southern border to impose new facts on the ground and change the rules of engagement”. Hezbollah said that the attack on Lebanon’s capital “will not pass without punishment”."
South Africa files ICJ case accusing Israel of 'genocidal acts',South Africa files case at ICJ accusing Israel of ‘genocidal acts’ in Gaza,0.9613096302063819,2023-12-29,2023-12-29,"South Africa has filed a case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) alleging that Israel is engaging in ""genocidal acts"" in Gaza.The UN court confirmed the application concerning alleged violations of Israel's obligations under the Genocide Convention.Israel has strongly rejected the allegation, calling it ""baseless"".""Israel rejects with disgust the blood libel spread by South Africa"", the foreign ministry said.The ICJ, which is based in the Hague in the Netherlands, is the UN's principal judicial organ. It settles disputes between states and gives advisory opinions on international legal issues.Following its application to the ICJ, South Africa's presidency said in a statement that the country was obliged ""to prevent genocide from occurring"".""South Africa is gravely concerned with the plight of civilians caught in the present Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip due to the indiscriminate use of force and forcible removal of inhabitants,"" it said.""Furthermore, there are ongoing reports of international crimes, such as crimes against humanity and war crimes, being committed as well as reports that acts meeting the threshold of genocide or related crimes... have been and may still be committed in the context of the ongoing massacres in Gaza.""The 84-page document states that the ""acts and omissions by Israel"" are ""genocidal in character because they are intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group"".The application asks the ICJ for a hearing to take place next week and requests that a number ""provisional measures"" be indicated by the court, including that Israel cease all military activities in Gaza.Lior Haiat, a spokesman for Israel's foreign affairs ministry, said South Africa's claim ""constitutes despicable and contemptuous exploitation of the Court.""He said South Africa was ""cooperating with a terrorist organisation that is calling for the destruction of the State of Israel"" and said Hamas was ""responsible for the suffering of the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip by using them as human shields and stealing humanitarian aid from them"".""Israel is committed to international law and acts in accordance with it, and directs its military efforts only against the Hamas terrorist organization and the other terrorist organizations cooperating with Hamas,"" Mr Haiat said.""Israel has made it clear that the residents of the Gaza Strip are not the enemy, and is making every effort to limit harm to the non-involved and to allow humanitarian aid to enter the Gaza Strip.""South Africa has been highly critical of Israel's military operation in Gaza.In early November, it recalled all of its diplomats from Israel. Israel, in turn, recalled its ambassador from Pretoria.In addition, the South African national assembly voted to suspend all diplomatic relations with Israel, but the government has not yet formally responded to the vote.South Africa previously filed a referral to a different court, the International Criminal Court (ICC), relating to alleged war crimes by Israel in Gaza. The ICC â€‹investigates and tries individuals charged with genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Israel does not recognise the ICC.The current war between Israel and Hamas was triggered by the 7 October Hamas attack on southern Israel, which killed about 1,200 people - most of them civilians - and saw about 240 others taken hostage.More than 21,500 people have been killed in Gaza - mostly children and women - during Israeli retaliatory attacks on Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.","South Africa has filed a case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), accusing it of crimes of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza after nearly three months of relentless Israeli bombardment has killed more than 21,500 people and caused widespread destruction in the besieged enclave. In an application to the court on Friday, South Africa described Israel’s actions in Gaza as “genocidal in character because they are intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group”. “The acts in question include killing Palestinians in Gaza, causing them serious bodily and mental harm, and inflicting on them conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction,” the application said. The ICJ, also called the World Court, is a UN civil court that adjudicates disputes between countries. It is distinct from the International Criminal Court (ICC), which prosecutes individuals for war crimes. As members of the UN, both South Africa and Israel are bound by the court. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has compared Israel’s policies in Gaza and the occupied West Bank with his country’s past apartheid regime of racial segregation imposed by the white-minority rule that ended in 1994. Several human rights organisations have said that Israeli policies towards Palestinians amount to apartheid. PRESS RELEASE:#SouthAfricainstitutes proceedings against#Israeland asks the#ICJto indicate provisional measureshttps://t.co/WedDXvtBD4pic.twitter.com/VCCDyORrLy — CIJ_ICJ (@CIJ_ICJ)December 29, 2023  South Africa said Israel’s conduct, particularly since the war began on October 7, violates the UN’s Genocide Convention, and called for an expedited hearing. The application also requests the court to indicate provisional measures to “protect against further, severe and irreparable harm to the rights of the Palestinian people” under the Convention. “South Africa is gravely concerned with the plight of civilians caught in the present Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip due to the indiscriminate use of force and forcible removal of inhabitants,” a statement from South Africa’s Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO) said, adding that the country has “repeatedly stated that it condemns all violence and attacks against all civilians, including Israelis.”    “South Africa has continuously called for an immediate and permanent ceasefire and the resumption of talks that will end the violence arising from the continued belligerent occupation of Palestine,” the statement added. Israel has rejected global calls for a ceasefire saying the war would not stop until the Hamas group, whose October 7 attack triggered the current phase of the conflict, was destroyed. Some 1,200 people were killed in the Hamas attack in Israel. The Palestinian group has said its attack was against Israel’s 16-year-old blockade of Gaza and expansion of settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories. Settlement expansions pose the biggest hurdle in the realisation of a future Palestinian state comprising Gaza, occupied West Banka and East Jerusalem. In the latest development in Israel’s war on Gaza, tens of thousands of newly displaced Palestinians in the centre of the Palestinian enclave on Friday were forced to flee further south as Israel expanded its ground and air offensive in the centre of the enclave. Israel has faced global condemnation for the mounting toll and destruction and is accused of meting out collective punishment on the Palestinian people. The court application is the latest move by South Africa, a vociferous critic of Israel’s war, to ratchet up pressure after its lawmakers last month voted in favour of closing down the Israeli embassy in Pretoria and suspending all diplomatic relations until a ceasefire was agreed. Al Jazeera’s Gabriel Elizondo, reporting from the United Nations headquarters in New York, said the move was “clearly a very important step to try to hold some accountability to Israel.” “Now that South Africa is pushing this to the ICJ, it will be on [the UN’s] agenda to try to make a ruling on this very important question,” he added. On November 16, a group of 36 UN experts called on the international community to “prevent genocide against the Palestinian people”, calling Israel’s actions since October 7 a “genocide in the making”. “We are deeply disturbed by the failure of governments to heed our call and to achieve an immediate ceasefire. We are also profoundly concerned about the support of certain governments for Israel’s strategy of warfare against the besieged population of Gaza, and the failure of the international system to mobilise to prevent genocide,” the experts said in a statement. Israel has rejected South Africa’s move as “baseless”, calling it “blood libel.” “South Africa’s claim lacks both a factual and a legal basis, and constitutes despicable and contemptuous exploitation of the Court,” Israel’s minister of foreign affairs, Lior Haiat, said in a statement posted on X. “Israel has made it clear that the residents of the Gaza Strip are not the enemy, and is making every effort to limit harm to the non-involved and to allow humanitarian aid to enter the Gaza Strip,” the statement added. “It does rally public opinion to the reality of what’s going on in Palestine, not just in Gaza but also in the West Bank,” said Al Jazeera’s senior political analyst Marwan Bishara. According to Article 2 of the Genocide Convention, genocide involves acts committed with the “intent to destroy, either in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group.” “Where the disagreement lies is whether there is intent or no intent,” Bishara said. “The three leading Israeli officials have declared the intent, starting with Israeli President Herzog when he said there are ‘no innocents’ in Gaza, the defence minister who said Israel will impose collective punishment on the people of Gaza because they are ‘human animals’,” Bishara said, adding that prime minister Netanyahu also used a biblical analogy in a statement widely interpreted as a genocidal call. The Palestinian ministry of foreign affairs welcomed South Africa’s move, and called on the ICJ to take immediate action to “prevent further harm to the Palestinian people”. “Israel’s stated policy, acts and omissions are genocidal in character are  committed with the requisite specific intent to the destruction of the Palestinian people under its colonial occupation and apartheid regime in violation of its obligations under the Genocide Convention,” a statement by the ministry said. “The State of Palestine appeals to the international community and the Contracting Parties to the Convention to uphold their obligations and support the Court in the proceedings.”   "
Yemen's Houthi rebels hijack cargo ship in Red Sea,Yemen’s Houthi rebels seize cargo ship in Red Sea,0.9077102987863368,2023-11-19,2023-11-19,"Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi rebels say they have seized an Israeli cargo ship in the Red Sea.They said the vessel was then taken to a port in Yemen.Israel said the ship was not Israeli, and no Israelis were among its crew. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said this was ""another act of Iranian terrorism"". Iran has not commented. Houthis had threatened to hijack Israeli ship within their reach over Israel's war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.Israel says 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 taken hostage during the surprise Hamas attack on the south of the country on 7 October.Israel has launched a massive military operation - involving air and artillery strikes as well as ground troops - with the aim of eliminating Hamas.The Hamas-run health ministry says the death toll in Gaza since then has reached 12,300. More than 2,000 more are feared to be buried under rubble.The Houthis have fired several missiles and drones towards Israel just after Israel launched its retaliatory operation.The US said at the time that all the missiles and drones were intercepted by its warship in the Red Sea.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) described the attack on the ship - which it did not name - as a ""very grave incident of global consequence"".The IDF said the vessel was on its way from Turkey to India when it was seized in the southern Red Sea near Yemen.Although Israel says the seized vessel does not have any connection with it, unconfirmed reports suggest the ship may have an Israeli owner.In Sunday's statement on social media, Mr Netanyahu said that Israel ""strongly condemns the Iranian attack against an international vessel"".He said the ship was owned by ""a British company and is operated by a Japanese firm"", adding that ""25 crew members of various nationalities including Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Filipino and Mexican"" were on board the ship. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian has recently said that what he called resistance groups allied to Tehran were ""cleverly adjusting pressure"" on Israel and its supporters.Earlier this month, the Houthis shot down a US military drone off Yemen's coast, American officials said.The Houthis have been locked in a prolonged civil war with Yemen's official government - backed by Saudi Arabia - since 2014. ","Yemen’s Houthis say they have taken control of a cargo ship in the southern Red Sea as thewar in Gazasends tensions soaring in the region. The Houthis, who control northern Yemen and its Red Sea coast, said the ship was Israeli, but Israel described it as a British-owned and Japanese-operated cargo vessel with no Israeli nationals on board. Some 25 people are believed to have been on board the Galaxy Leader – reported to be partly owned by an Israeli businessman and sailing under the flag of Bahamas – when it was seized en route from Turkey to India. Ownership details in public shipping databases associated the ship’s owners with Ray Car Carriers, founded by Abraham “Rami” Ungar, who is known as one of the richest men in Israel. Ungar told The Associated Press news agency he was aware of the incident but could not comment as he awaited details. A ship linked to himexperienced an explosionin 2021 in the Gulf of Oman. Israeli media blamed it on Iran at the time. International shipping often involves a series of management companies, flags and owners stretching across the globe in a single vessel. Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree said the seizure of the ship was in response to the “heinous acts against our Palestinian brothers in Gaza and the West Bank”. “If the international community is concerned about regional security and stability, rather than expanding the conflict, it should put an end to Israel’s aggression against Gaza,” he wrote on X. The Houthis have launched several missile and droneattacks against Israelsince October 7, when an attack by Hamas inside Israel prompted an Israeli ground and air offensive on Gaza. Last week, the Iran-aligned Houthis said they could target Israeli ships in the Red Sea and the Bab al-Mandeb Strait. Saree renewed the warning that any ship belonging to Israel or those who support it will be a legitimate target for Houthi forces. “We confirm our continuation of military operations against [Israel] until the aggression and ugly crimes against our Palestinian brothers in Gaza and the West Bank stop,” said Saree.    In a statement, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Israel was not involved in the ship’s ownership, operation or the makeup of its international crew. It alleged the attack was an “Iranian act of terrorism” with consequences for international maritime security. “This … represents an escalation in Iran’s belligerence against the citizens of the free world, with concomitant international ramifications vis-a-vis the security of global shipping routes,” said the statement released by the prime minister’s office, without providing any evidence about Iran’s involvement. “There were no Israelis on the ship,” it continued, adding the 25 crew members are from Ukraine, Mexico, the Philippines and Bulgaria, among other countries. On Monday, Iran denied the Israeli claims. Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani told reporters in Tehran that regional resistance groups make decisions and take actions based on their own interests.   "
US sanctions Israeli settlers over West Bank violence,US imposes sanctions on four Israeli settlers over West Bank violence,0.8916122239447845,2024-02-01,2024-02-01,"US President Joe Biden has approved sanctions on four Israeli settlers accused of attacking Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.Mr Biden signed a broad executive order, saying violence in the West Bank had reached ""intolerable levels"".The sanctions block the individuals from accessing all US property, assets and the American financial system.Violence in the West Bank has spiked since Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October.Some 370 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since then, according to the UN. The majority of those have been killed by Israeli forces but at least eight of them have been killed by Israeli settlers, the UN said.The new executive order means the US government has the power to sanction any foreign nationals who attack, intimidate or seize the property of Palestinians.The sanctions are a first by the US administration - a rare step targeting Israelis - and comes as Mr Biden travels to the state of Michigan, which has a large Arab-American population that has been critical of his support for Israel.The Arab American Institute, an advocacy group, earlier said that since the start of the conflict, support by Arab Americans for the Democratic Party has plummeted from 59% in 2020 to just 17%.On Thursday, a senior official in the Biden administration said the president had repeatedly raised concerns with Israel about violence by settlers.The executive order sets out the groundwork for how the US will respond to further attacks in the West Bank, and is an escalation compared to the visa restrictions it imposed on some individuals last year.""The situation in the West Bank - in particular high levels of extremist settler violence, forced displacement of people and villages, and property destruction - has reached intolerable levels and constitutes a serious threat to the peace, security and stability"" of the region, Mr Biden said in a letter to Congress explaining his reasoning.A senior administration official said the initial round of sanctions - targeting four people - were against ""individuals that have directly perpetrated violence and those who have engaged in repeated acts of intimidation, property destruction, leading to the forced displacement of Palestinian communities"".They said one person initiated and led a riot that led to the death of a Palestinian civilian in the town of Huwara, while another had attacked people with stones and clubs.They added that the executive order was ""non-discriminatory"" and applied to both Israelis and Palestinians who direct or take part in violent acts or threats against civilians, intimidation, destroying, seizing property or terrorism.  The US Treasury named the four sanctioned Israelis as David Chai Chasdai, 29; Yinon Levi 31; Einan Tanjil, 21; and Shalom Zicherman 32. Three of them lived in West Bank settlements and one lived near the occupied region's border, the Treasury said.These US sanctions cannot be applied to American citizens, some of whom are thought to be involved in the violence.  State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said the US does believes the sanctions ""will have an impact on these four individuals"" and expects Israel to ""do more to hold accountable those responsible for settler violence"".Shortly after Mr Biden signed the executive order, Israel signalled its dissatisfaction and described the majority of West Bank settlers as ""law-abiding"".""Israel takes action against all law-breakers everywhere, and therefore there is no need for unusual measures on the issue,"" a statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said.The response was yet another sign of a deepening public rift between the US and Israel.The two leaders are long-term allies, but have disagreed in recent weeks about the idea of creating an independent Palestinian state. The US believes a Palestinian state alongside Israel - known as a ""two-state solution"" - is vital for long-term stability in the region.Mr Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected the idea, and the White House acknowledged last month that the US and Israeli governments ""clearly see things differently"".Those comments dampened hopes in some circles that the conflict could result in Israeli and Palestinian leaders restarting diplomatic negotiations and kickstarting the dormant peace process.","Washington, DC –The United States has imposed sanctions on several Israeli settlers for attacking Palestinian communities in the occupied West Bank, accusing them of undermining stability and security in Israel and the Palestinian territories. The announcement on Thursday comes amid increasing pressure on President Joe Biden over hisunwavering supportfor Israel’s war on Gaza as he campaigns for re-election in November. The sanctions target David Chai Chasdai, Einan Tanjil and Yinon Levi, who are accused of assaulting and intimidating Palestinians. They also target Shalom Zickerman, who is accused of assaulting Israeli activists. The sanctions will freeze the individuals’ assets in the US and restrict financial dealings with them. Earlier, Axios reported that the Biden administration hadconsidered sanctioning ultranationalist government ministersItamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, but decided against the move. “There are no plans to target with sanctions Israeli government officials at this time,” White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Thursday, adding that the US informed the Israeli government before announcing the sanctions. The White House also announced a new decree to penalise perpetrators of “extremist settler violence” in the West Bank. US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said in a statement that settler violence “poses a grave threat to peace, security, and stability in the West Bank, Israel, and the Middle East region, and threatens the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States”. The executive order coincides with Biden’s visit on Thursday to Michigan, a Midwestern swing state that is home to a largeArab American community.    Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared to reject the US move, saying that the overwhelming majority of West Bank settlers are “law-abiding citizens”. “Israel acts against all Israelis who break the law, everywhere; therefore, exceptional measures are unnecessary,” his office said in a statement. Reporting from Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, Al Jazeera’s Charles Stratford cited Palestinians as saying that Israeli authorities do not hold settlers accountable for attacks. “In many, many incidents, we see settlers acting with either the tacit support or the actual physical support of the Israeli military in these attacks,” Stratford said. The announcement comes as the Biden administration continues to workto secure $14bnin additional aid to the Israeli government, whose forces often accompany and protect settlers during their attacks on Palestinians. Israeli authorities rarely prosecute suspects in violence against Palestinians. Last month, Israeli settlers and an off-duty police officer fatally shot 17-year-old Palestinian AmericanTawfiq Ajaqin the West Bank, according to his family. The Biden administration has called for an investigation into the case, but Israeli authorities have not made any arrests in the killing of the US teenager. Raids by Israeli settlers and soldiers against West Bank towns and villages have increased since the outbreak of the war on Gaza on October 7, killing hundreds of Palestinians.    “This [executive order] will allow the United States to issue financial sanctions against those directing or participating in certain actions, including acts or threats of violence against civilians, intimidating civilians to cause them to leave their homes, destroying or seizing property, or engaging in terrorist activity in the West Bank,” Sullivan said. In the same statement, the US national security adviser emphasised Washington’s support for what he called “Israel’s right to defend itself”. Despite growing calls for a ceasefire globally, andmounting evidenceof Israeli abuses, the Biden administration has pushed on with its support for the war on Gaza, arguing that Hamas must be eliminated. Washington says it has been in discussions with Israel to minimise civilian casualties and allow more aid into Gaza. But Biden has so far resisted calls to use his administration’s assistance to Israel as leverage to pressure the US ally to end rights violations against Palestinians. Israeli leaders – includingNetanyahu– have been openly defying the Biden administration in their vocal rejection of the establishment of a Palestinian state. “Good that Biden will impose targeted sanctions on Israeli settlers who attack Palestinians,” human rights advocate Kenneth Roth wrote in a social media post. “Now how about conditioning [or stopping] military aid and arms sales to Israel until it stops bombing and besieging Palestinian civilians in Gaza.”    The Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), an advocacy group, also played down the significance of the sanctions, saying that Biden should penalise Israeli officials responsible for settler violence and end US support for the war on Gaza. “It makes no sense for the Biden administration to oppose killing Palestinian civilians in the West Bank while enabling the killing of Palestinian civilians in Gaza,” CAIR said in a statement. For his part, Abed Ayoub, executive director at the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), called the sanctions “empty”, saying that they are far from groundbreaking. Ayoub said the White House sees the sanctions as a “safe way” to appeal to some voters who are angry over Biden’s backing for the war on Gaza. “That’s the intent of all of this. That’s why it was released today during Biden’s trip to Michigan,” Ayoub told Al Jazeera. He added that targeting a few individual settlers risks normalising the broader settlement movement and called for stricter measures to ensure accountability. “We know that many of these settlers are American. Open those settlers up the civil and criminal liability in the US,” he said."
US says Israel to begin daily four-hour military pauses in Gaza,"Israel to begin daily four-hour ‘pauses’ in fighting in north Gaza, US says",0.8470359582615608,2023-11-09,2023-11-09,"Israel will begin to implement daily four-hour military pauses in areas of northern Gaza, US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said.However Israel's defence minister stressed they were only ""localised and pinpoint measures"" that would ""not detract from the war fighting"".President Biden said there would be two ""humanitarian passages"" allowing people to leave areas of fighting.On Thursday heavy fighting was reported around two big hospitals in Gaza City.Meanwhile, pictures once again showed thousands of Palestinians fleeing south from the city and other northern areas.Mr Biden also said the US was trying to increase humanitarian supplies and assistance to Gaza. He said he was aiming for 150 trucks of aid per day to enter the territory.However the UN said the amount of aid entering Gaza was only meeting ""a fraction"" of people's needs and the humanitarian situation was ""intolerable"". A conference in Paris earlier heard repeated appeals for a ceasefire in Gaza.Israel has been bombarding Gaza for over a month and began a major ground offensive almost two weeks ago with the objective of destroying Hamas, which it, the US and other Western powers consider a terrorist organisation.The war began after an unprecedented cross-border assault on southern Israel by Hamas gunmen on 7 October, in which 1,400 people were killed and 240 others taken hostage.Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says 10,800 people have been killed in the territory since then, while 1.5 million have fled their homes.Mr Biden said Israel was ""fighting an enemy embedded in the civilian population, which places innocent Palestinian people at risk"" but that Israel had ""an obligation to distinguish between terrorists and civilians and fully comply with international law"".On Thursday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had raided Hamas's ""military quarter"" near Al-Shifa Hospital and killed 50 ""terrorists"".A witness said he had also seen tanks opening fire near Al-Quds Hospital.About 2,000 patients and 50,000 displaced people are said to be inside Al-Shifa Hospital, which is located in Gaza City's northern Rimal neighbourhood and is the largest medical complex in Gaza.Its director, Mohammed Abu Selmia, told the Associated Press that Israeli troops were about 3km (2 miles) away and that conditions there were ""disastrous in every sense of the word"". In footage filmed inside the hospital on Thursday, a man who was accompanied by two children tells a journalist that they had been walking on a street, trying to flee south, when an Israeli tank opened fire at them.""The remains of seven or eight martyrs were left at the scene,"" he says.An unverified video posted on social media overnight also purportedly showed a number of people being helped after being hit by shrapnel from a shell on a street close to Al-Shifa.The IDF has previously alleged that Hamas is also operating underground command centres beneath Al-Shifa itself. Hamas and hospital staff have denied the accusation.Fierce battles were also reported on Thursday around Al-Quds hospital, which is 2.3km (1.4 miles) to the south-west in the Tal al-Hawa neighbourhood.Hamouda Musa, 34, told the BBC he and his neighbour had escaped from a building opposite the hospital after he saw four tanks and a bulldozer advancing from the coast, 1km away to the north. ""They were firing intensely towards a nearby residential building,"" he said. ""We fled under a barrage of bullets via a back street. We miraculously came back from the dead.""On Wednesday, the Palestinian Red Crescent said that areas in close proximity were struck, injuring patients and displaced people, and damaging buildings.The hospital also said on Wednesday that its main generator had been shut down because of a shortage of fuel, forcing it to close its surgical ward, oxygen generation plant and MRI ward.The clashes and strikes in the north, as well as the struggle to secure enough drinking water and food to survive, has prompted some of the several hundred thousands of civilians staying there to flee southwards in recent days.Pictures from drones showed a stream of people walking along Salah al-Din Road and crossing the Wadi Gaza river, after the IDF opened the route for a sixth consecutive day. An estimated 50,000 people fled the north on Wednesday, which was 10 times more than on Monday.Although the IDF has ordered civilians to move south of Wadi Gaza for their own safety, it has continued to carry out strikes on what it says are Hamas targets in areas where hundreds of thousands have sought refuge.The Hamas-run interior ministry in Gaza said 12 people had been killed and many more injured in an Israeli air strike on a house in the central town of Deir al-Balah on Thursday. There was no immediate comment from the IDF.While visiting Egypt's Rafah Crossing with Gaza on Wednesday, UN human rights chief Volker TÃ¼rk said both sides in the conflict had committed war crimes. ""The atrocities perpetrated by Palestinian armed groups on 7 October were heinous, they were war crimes - as is the continued holding of hostages.""""The collective punishment by Israel of Palestinian civilians amounts also to a war crime, as does the unlawful forcible evacuation of civilians. The massive bombardments by Israel have killed, maimed and injured in particular women and children,"" he added.Israel has insisted it has been acting in complete compliance with international law and that it has done everything possible to minimise civilian casualties.It has also rejected the UN's warnings of a humanitarian crisis in Gaza, arguing that there is sufficient food, water and fuel despite the ""complete siege"" it imposed in response to Hamas's attack, and has rejected its calls for a ceasefire unless the hostages are released.The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), Philippe Lazzarini, told the Paris conference on Gaza that there had to be a ceasefire so that more aid could be delivered.He called the volume currently coming through Rafah ""blatantly inadequate"".A total of 756 lorries have crossed from Egypt since 21 October. Before the war, an average of 500 lorry loads entered Gaza every working day from Egypt and Israel.","Israel has agreed to begin daily four-hour pauses in fighting innorthern Gazato allow people to flee hostilities, the White House has announced, in what it called a step in the right direction. US National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said the firsthumanitarian pausewould be announced on Thursday, adding that Israel had committed to announcing each four-hour window at least three hours in advance. “We’ve been told by the Israelis that there will be no military operations in these areas over the duration of the pause, and that this process is starting today,” Kirby said. US President Joe Biden told reporters that he had asked Israel for a “pause longer than three days” during negotiations over therelease of some captivesbeing held by Palestinian group Hamas, but he ruled out the chances of a general ceasefire. Kirby made clear that there would be noceasefirebetween Israel and Hamas, saying it would help the Palestinian group “legitimise what they did” on October 7, “and we simply are not going to stand for that at this time”. Biden had asked Israeli Prime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahuto institute the daily pauses during a call on Monday. Biden, when asked if he was frustrated by Netanyahu over the delays in instituting humanitarian pauses, said, “It’s taken a little longer than I hoped.” Meanwhile, Israel said it has not agreed to any ceasefires, but will continue to allow brief, localised pauses to let in humanitarian aid. “There’s no ceasefire, I repeat there’s no ceasefire. What we are doing, that four-hour window, these are tactical, local pauses for humanitarian aid,” Israeli military spokesperson Richard Hecht said. Taher al-Nono, a political adviser to Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, said on Thursday that unspecified negotiations were continuing and no deal had been reached with Israel so far. He gave no more detail in a statement posted on the group’s Telegram channel. Reporting from Washington, DC, Al Jazeera’s Kimberly Halkett said these pauses “will allow for the potential release of captives that Hamas is currently holding … and for medicine and food to get in and for those living inside Gaza who have dual nationality to get out”. “The United States also said it aims to get 150 aid trucks in Gaza daily,” she added. At least 10,812 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks on Gaza since October 7. In Israel, the death toll over the same period stands at more than 1,400. A spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said any humanitarian pauses should be done in coordination with the United Nations to be most effective. Stephane Dujarric added that “obviously, in order for this to be done safely for humanitarian purposes, it would have to be agreed with all parties to the conflict to be truly effective.” Marwan Bishara, Al Jazeera’s senior political analyst, called the US announcement a distraction. “There’s an unravelling genocide in Gaza and we’re talking about some humanitarian pause, which is absolutely meaningless. [What] we should be focused on is the ongoing genocide, the ongoing killing, the ongoing expulsion, the ongoing ethnic cleansing, the mass slaughter of children,” Bishara said. “This is the thing that’s going on while Mr Biden [is] and Mr Netanyahu is wasting everyone’s time about some four-hour humanitarian pause.” Bishara added that the discourse has highlighted how unable – and unwilling – the Biden administration has been to pressure the Israeli government to end the conflict. “I think it doesn’t have the will and I think it doesn’t want to seem like, in Washington, there’s daylight between the United States and Israel,” he said. “And because this administration has widely and foolishly, in my opinion, boxed itself in behind Netanyahu, and now is finding it difficult to distance itself without looking foolish.” The US announcement has fallen woefully short of the needs in Gaza, Abdel Hamid Siyam, a Middle East expert at Rutgers University, told Al Jazeera. “Pauses are not a solution,” he said, adding that what is needed is a “ceasefire so that humanitarian aid can come in uninterrupted, that foreigners can leave the country, and maybe negotiations can take place”. “If this is only a pause to allow people to move from the north to south, it did not work in the past, it will not work in the future,” he said. “In four hours, people cannot come. They don’t have cars, they don’t have fuel. It’s not going to work.” “There is mounting pressure on Israel now to open up for a real ceasefire, a real truce for a day or two or three. I think that is coming in the next few days,” he said. Indirect talks were taking place inQatar– which also played a role in the freeing of four captives by Hamas last month – about a larger release of hostages. CIA Director William Burns was in Doha on Thursday to discuss efforts to win the release of captives in Gaza, with the Qatari prime minister and the head of Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency, according to a US official. Burns met Mossad chief David Barnea and Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, said the official, who talked to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. Qatar is a frequent go-between in international dealings with Hamas.   "

Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry has said 11,000 people have been killed in the territory since then and the UN has warned of a ""humanitarian disaster"".The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa - which runs the largest humanitarian operation in Gaza - said on Tuesday that the lack of fuel meant it could no longer unload or distribute aid from lorries that arrived at Rafah. Although Wednesday's delivery means the UN will now be able to fill up its vehicles, Israel has banned it from using any of the fuel to provide basic services to 1.5 million people who have fled their homes, more than half of which are sheltering in Unrwa facilities.""Our entire operation is now on the verge of collapse,"" Unrwa's Commissioner General, Philippe Lazzarini, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. ""By the end of today, around 70% of the population in Gaza won't have access to clean water,"" he added. ""To have fuel for trucks only will not save lives anymore. Waiting longer will cost lives.""The agency's Gaza chief, Thomas White, said 23,000 litres represented only 9% of what it needed daily to sustain life-saving activities and demanded that aid ""be delivered based upon need - not based upon conditions set by parties to a conflict"". Earlier, Mr White said all three sewage pumps and 10 water pumps in the southern town of Rafah had stopped working because they had run out of fuel, as had the desalinisation plant in the nearby city of Khan Younis.Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis has also been forced to halt all services except for emergencies and 24 ambulances have been taken out of service.Many other health, water and sanitation facilities have already been forced to shut down across the Strip due to lack of fuel, damage, attacks and insecurity. Palestinian telecommunications firms have also said that they expect to switch off phone and internet services on Thursday due to a lack of fuel for data centres and exchanges, according to the UN.The Netblocks internet observatory said on Wednesday that metrics showed a new gradual decline in internet connectivity in Gaza and that residents' ability to communicate was likely to be reduced.On Tuesday, 91 lorries carrying food, medicines, health supplies, bottled water, blankets, tents and hygiene products entered Gaza from Egypt, the UN said, bringing the total since the Rafah crossing reopened on 21 October to 1,187.The UN has described that as a ""drop in the ocean"", noting that about 500 lorries would cross into Gaza each day on average before the war began.","The first truck delivering fuel to the Gaza Strip since the war began has arrived in the besieged enclave. The diesel fuel truck arrived in Gaza via the Rafah border crossing with Egypt on Wednesday. However, it is “not at all enough”, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) said, adding that use of the fuel has been “restricted” by Israel. “Just received 23,027 LT [6,083 gallons] of fuel from Egypt (half a tanker) – but its use has been restricted by Israeli authorities – only for transporting aid from Rafah,” Tom White, the director of UNRWA Affairs in the Gaza Strip, said in a post on X. “No fuel for water or hospitals. This is only 9% of what we need daily to sustain lifesaving activities,” he continued. “This is the equivalent of half a truck! Not at all enough. Much more is needed. Fuel is being used as weapon of war, this must stop,” UNRWA said on X. #Gaza👇 fuel. This is the equivalent of half a truck! not at all enough! Much more is needed.

Limited deliveries of humanitarian aid have been crossing from Egypt into Gaza since October 21, but Israel had refused to let any fuel enter. On Tuesday, it gave approval for 24,000 litres (6,340 gallons) of diesel to be allowed into Gaza, but it is meant only for UN trucks and not for Gaza’s hospitals, which are shutting down because they have no fuel to power their generators. The fuel was delivered to the UN “to facilitate the delivery of aid after trucks on the Palestinian side stopped operating for lack of fuel”, an Egyptian source told the Agence France-Presse news agency. The Israeli Ministry of Defence unit that handles Palestinian civilian affairs had said earlier: “UN trucks transporting humanitarian aid through the Rafah crossing will be refuelled at the Rafah crossing, per US request.” Fuel shortages have already caused or contributed to the closure of hospitals, bakeries, sewage pumping stations, water desalination plants and water wells and are threatening to shut down telecommunication data centres and connection points within 48 hours, the UN said on Tuesday. Gaza’s two main telecommunications companies, Paltel and Jawwal, warned on Wednesday of a “complete telecom blackout in the coming hours” in the Gaza Strip due to a lack of fuel.

By the end of today, around 70% of the population in Gaza won’t have access to clean water.” Aid agencies in Gaza say a chronic lack of fuel has hampered efforts to deliver food, water and medicine to Palestinians in Gaza, which is under siege as Israel wages a war that has killed at least 11,200 people. Israel’s bombardment and ground offensive followed the Hamas attacks on October 7, which killed 1,200 Israelis. On Tuesday, 91 trucks carrying food, medicine, bottled water, blankets and tents entered Gaza from Egypt, but the UN says deliveries since October 21 – 1,187 trucks in total – can meet only a fraction of Gaza’s needs. Distribution of the aid had largely come to a halt because of lack of fuel, it said."

Another armed group, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, said two of those killed were its members and were brothers. It added that one of them had been receiving treatment at the hospital.The security camera video from Ibn Sina hospital shows several members of the Israeli undercover unit - men and women - hurrying through a corridor, training their weapons left and right.

""They executed them in cold blood by firing bullets directly into their heads in the room where they were being treated.""The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the guardian of the Geneva Conventions which codify international humanitarian law, has expressed concern over the raid. ""Under international humanitarian law, hospitals and medical patients should be respected and protected at all times"", the ICRC said, adding that it would raise the issue ""as part of its confidential dialogue with the concerned authorities"".Tensions have soared in the West Bank since the 7 October attacks, with near daily Israeli arrest raids and clashes with Palestinians. Jenin, a militant stronghold, has been a focus of such raids for months.Since 7 October, Israeli forces have killed at least 357 Palestinians - militants, civilians and attackers - in the West Bank, while Israeli settlers have killed at least eight, according to the United Nations.Palestinians from the West Bank have killed at least 10 Israelis in attacks in the West Bank and Israel in the same period.In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the Hamas suspect who was killed had ""planned a raid attack inspired by the October 7th massacre"". On that date, waves of Hamas gunmen invaded Israel from Gaza, killed about 1,200 people - mainly civilians - and took about 250 others back to Gaza as hostages.The attack triggered Israel's military campaign in Gaza, with the declared aim of destroying Hamas. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 26,600 Palestinians - mostly women and children - have been killed in the Israeli offensive.The official Palestinian news agency in the West Bank, Wafa, said the three Palestinians in the hospital had been ""assassinated"".According to its sources in the hospital, about 10 members of Israeli special forces dressed in civilian clothes went to the third floor, where they killed the men using weapons fitted with silencers.Dr Naji Nazzal said one of the men, who PIJ identified as its member, had been receiving treatment at the hospital since 25 October for a spinal injury which had left him paralysed.Correction 13th February: This article wrongly reported that about 1,300 people had been killed following the 7th October attack by Hamas. This was based on counting those who later died from their injuries in addition to the figure of more than 1,200. The article has been amended to now refer to about 1,200 deaths, a figure which includes those deaths and which Israel says is not final.","Israeli forces disguised as medical staff and civilians have shot dead three Palestinians inside a hospital in the city of Jenin in the occupied West Bank. The killings were carried out by undercover operatives while the men were sleeping at Ibn Sina Hospital, according to statements issued by the Palestinian Ministry of Health and the Israeli army on Tuesday. “This morning three young men were martyred by the bullets of the occupation [Israeli] forces who stormed the Ibn Sina Hospital in Jenin and shot them,” the Ministry of Health in Ramallah said. The Israeli army said its troops had “neutralised” the men, who were hiding in the hospital and belonged to a “Hamas terrorist cell”. Security camera footage circulated online appeared to show about a dozen undercover personnel, including three in women’s clothing and two dressed as medical staff, pacing through a corridor of the hospital with assault rifles. The Israeli military identified one of the men killed as Mohammad Jalamneh, 27, who it claimed was planning an imminent attack and had been transferring weapons and ammunition to other members. The two other men killed, brothers Basil and Mohammad Ghazawi, were hiding inside the hospital and were involved in attacks, the military alleged. “A gun was found on a wanted person, which was confiscated by the forces,” the army statement added. Al Jazeera’s Charles Stratford, reporting from Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, said: “One can only imagine the terror of the patients and staff at the hospital in Jenin.” “It’s just another example of how determined the Israeli army is to keep up raids as it targets armed resistance fighters across the occupied Palestinian territory,” he added. Hamas said in a statement that the Israeli army’s “crimes will not go unanswered”, adding that the killings are a “continuation of the occupation’s ongoing crimes against our people from Gaza to Jenin”.    One of the men, Basil Ghazawi, was injured and in bed when he was killed, said the Palestinian armed group. Basil was injured by missile fragments following an Israeli drone attack on October 25 targeting a group of men near the Jenin camp cemetery and had been receiving treatment at the hospital for three months, according to Al Jazeera sources. Hamas confirmed that Jalamneh was one of its members. The Jenin Brigade, which includes a number of Palestinian armed resistance groups, said in a statement that two of the three men were members of Islamic Jihad. Jalamneh’s father Walid told Al Jazeera from Jenin that the path his son took was the “path of the honorable – of the free.” “The path that my son Mohammad took, many of our sons have gone through before him. He was not alone; they found no other way to deal with this occupation, other than with firepower, because this occupation and enemy does not deal with us, even our children, except with firepower,” said Walid. “They tried to achieve “peace” for tens of years. I want to ask those who are betting on “peace,” does this enemy want peace? Tens of years of negotiations, while the occupation is stealing more land, killing thousands of Palestinians, insisting to keep the Palestinian people under occupation, in front of the world’s eyes, because they consider themselves to be above the law,” he continued. The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned “in the strongest terms the occupation forces’ assassination of the three young men”. Thousands of Palestinians thronged the streets of Jenin as the funeral ceremony for the three men was underway. They were to be buried at a cemetery in the Jenin refugee camp. The mother of the Ghazawi brothers said the two were loved by everyone. “The last time I saw them was yesterday night … I was in the hospital,” she said in a video shot by local media, adding that she went home as Mohammad said he would stay with Basil. “I was still waking up this morning when I heard that special forces raided the hospital … They were killed while they were asleep,” the mother said. Ahmad Shawish, a friend of Mohammed, said he was a “very kind” person. “Mohammad was very loved,” Shawish told Al Jazeera from Jenin. “He would not let anyone get upset from him. If anyone of his friends or family were bothered, he would apologize and make things right even if it wasn’t his fault,” continued Shawish.    According to the medical staff one of the three Palestinians killed in the hospital was being treated for an injury received during a previous army raid months ago, Al Jazeera’s Stratford reported. “The Israeli army often surrounds and in some instances has attacked the three Palestinian hospitals in Jenin during nightly raids on the city,” he said. “But this is the first time they have entered a civilian medical facility in what seems to have been a well-planned, targeted assassination operation that Palestinian authorities are calling another violation of international law,” he added. Al Jazeera’s Rory Challands, reporting from occupied East Jerusalem, said that assailants were dressed as doctors, nurses and even civilians. “This unit comprised Israeli police and army personnel. They went up to the third floor of the hospital and shot three young Palestinians dead,” he said. “It does not look like there was any attempt to arrest these men. They were killed as they were sleeping,” he added. Violent clashes were reported in the area surrounding the hospital.  Since the beginning ofIsrael’s war on Gaza, Israeli forces have carried out raids and arrests in the occupiedWest Bankon a daily basis. Hundreds of people have beenkilled and arrestedsince Hamas’s October 7 attacks on Israel, in which about 1,140 people were killed and some 240 taken captive. Approximately 100 of thecaptives were returnedto Israel under a truce deal last November in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. At least 26,637 people have been killed and 65,387 wounded in Israeli attacks on Gaza."

The debris and shrapnel are hitting the walls and flying in the streets,"" he wrote.In an interview with the BBC in the hours after Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel, Alareer caused widespread offence by calling it ""legitimate and moral"". He said it was ""exactly like the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising"".The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising was a revolt that took place in German-occupied Poland in 1943 and saw Jews use weapons smuggled into the ghetto to try to resist Nazi efforts to transport people to the extermination camps.Alareer was one of the founders of ""We Are Not Numbers"", a Palestinian non-profit set up in 2015 that joined writers from around the world with young people in Gaza to ""tell the stories behind the numbers of Palestinians in the news"".He was the co-editor of the book, Gaza Unsilenced, and the editor of Gaza Writes Back: Short Stories from Young Writers in Gaza, Palestine.Paying tribute on social media, former student Jehad Abusalim described Alareer as a mentor and friend who had ""truly cared about his students beyond the classroom"". Alareer, he added, taught him English and viewed the language as a ""way to break free from Gaza's prolonged siege, a teleportation device that defied Israel's fences and the intellectual, academic, and cultural blockade of Gaza"".He was ""full of energy, life & humour.

The 44-year-old Alareer was a prominent professor at the Islamic University of Gaza and one of the leaders of a young generation of authors in the enclave. He was killed alongside several family members by an air strike in Gaza City on Wednesday. “My heart is broken,” Gaza poet Mosab Abu Toha said in a post on social media.    A post shared by Mosab Abu-Toha Poetry (@mosab_abutoha)  Alareer also co-founded the We Are Not Numbers project, which provides writing workshops for young Gaza Palestinians. In an interview with Al Jazeera, his co-founder, Pam Bailey, spoke of a huge loss. “A lot of people knew about Refaat, through his books, through his poetry. That’s why you are hearing about him today because so many people loved him for that,” she said, telling how he had humanised the struggles of people in Gaza. However, Alareer had also stirred controversy in recent weeks, comparing Hamas’s attacks on Israel on October 7  to the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Since the Israeli army began its relentless bombardment of the Gaza Strip, Alareer remained in his home town Shujayea in northern Gaza, which he had previouslydescribedas “the epitome of resurrection that refuses to kneel to Israel’s barbarity”. He regularly posted updates from the region describing how the heavy shelling was destroying Palestinian homes, businesses and lives. “It is unspeakable, the brutalities,” Alareer said in aninterviewonThe Electronic Intifada podcast, as the sound of loud explosions could be heard in the background. “No matter how many tweets or livestreams you see, the reality on the ground is so much more terrible than it is on social media … We don’t deserve this. We’re not animals like the Israelis think. Our kids deserve better,” he said. Weeks before he was killed, Alareer said in a post on X that if he died, the news should become “a tale.” If I must die, let it be a tale.#FreePalestine#Gazapic.twitter.com/ODPx3TiH1a — Refaat in Gaza 🇵🇸 (@itranslate123)November 1, 2023  Many Palestinians remember Alareer for how he wrote and spoke about the liberation of Palestine and resisted Israel’s occupation. Ahmed Nehad, a friend and former pupil of the prominent Gaza academic and poet, says Alareer’s “legacy will live forever”. “He coached thousands of Gazan youth, men and women to write about Palestine,” Nehad told Al Jazeera. “I remember writing and reciting my first lines of poetry for him five years ago, and I remember how he loved to hear them, and how he always helped us.” Sami Hermez of Northwestern University in Qatar told Al Jazeera that Alareer was “someone who spoke to thousands”. “It’s hard when you have 17,000 people [dead], and we are unable to follow the stories of each and every one of them. This one touches me because I’m also a professor and writer just like Dr Refaat,” Hermez said. But Alareer could also be controversial. After Hamas’s unprecedented attacks on Israel on October 7, in an interview with the BBC, Alareer said the attacks were “exactly like the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising,” angering many Jewish groups around the world. The uprising in 1943 was the largest act of Jewish resistance against the Nazis in occupied Poland during World War II. Following the outcry, the BBC agreed that “his comments were offensive” and said it did not “intend to use him again”. Ahmed Bedier, from the NGO United Voices for America, said that Alareer’s regular interviews on television stations and radio shows, where he described what was happening in Gaza and the occupied West Bank to Western audiences, was the main reason that “[the Israeli army] wanted to silence him”. “The international sentiment has begun shifting against Israel,” Bedier told Al Jazeera. “So they’re trying to silence any other narrative other than theirs.”"
How the Israel-Hamas hostage deal came together,Behind the scenes: How the Israel-Hamas truce deal came together,0.807420585950128,2023-11-22,2023-11-22,"In the days immediately after the 7 October attack on Israel, a secret cell was set up to work for the release of some 240 hostages captured by Hamas. So began an ""extremely excruciating five-week process"" involving four countries, co-ordination between spy masters and high stakes presidential calls, says a senior US administration official.  Israel and Hamas have now agreed that 50 Israeli women and children will be released over a four-day pause in the fighting, in exchange for 150 Palestinian prisoners, also women and children.As the breakthrough deal was announced, the official described to journalists how it happened.  Qatar spearheaded the effort, he said, approaching Israel and the US with a proposal to establish a cell that would work quietly and intensely on the issue. Doha acted as the main channel to Hamas, but Egypt was also part of the complex negotiating arrangement.  The first breakthrough came on 23 October, when Hamas released two American women. That was the ""pilot"" project, said the administration official, which ""proved the concept"". After that, efforts for a larger release began in earnest. Israel delegated the head of Mossad, David Barnea, as its negotiator and he regularly consulted the CIA chief Bill Burns on the contours of a deal.  The process was painfully protracted because messages had to be passed from Doha or Cairo to Hamas in Gaza and then back out again. And the talks were highly technical, painstakingly hammering out details on corridors, surveillance, timeframes and total numbers.  The administration official said President Joe Biden was ""directly and personally"" engaged, calling up the leaders of Israel and Qatar at critical times. Mr Biden saw a hostage deal as the ""only realistic path to secure a multi-day humanitarian pause in the fighting"", said the official, because the Israelis made clear they would not stop their offensive for anything else.  That calculation is part of the agreement, which offers to extend the suspension of hostilities if Hamas releases more hostages.  ""We also have confidence thatâ€¦as we are in the pause period, additional women and children will come out,"" said the US official.  One of the sticking points was a failure by Hamas to clearly identify who would be in the initial group of 50. It eventually produced the information when President Biden called the Emir of Qatar and said this was a deal breaker, said the official.  Just as they appeared to be closing in on an agreement in mid-November everything stalled, he said, because communications with Hamas ""went dark"". He did not elaborate, but it was also around this time that Gaza ran out of fuel.  The administration official said when communications were restored it still took time to work out gaps in the very detailed agreement because of Israel and America's high level of distrust with Hamas.  He sidestepped questions about whether the hostage deal and the negotiations channel that brokered it offered a path towards ending the war.  But he said when it came to the hostages, ""what I just described for the last five weeks is not going to stop. As we go through this initial phase, we're determined to get everybody home"".","Shortly after the Hamas group took captives during their deadly assault onsouthern Israel on October 7, the government of Qatar contacted the White House with a request: Form a small team of advisers to help get the captives freed. That effort, which began in the days after the captives were taken, finally bore fruit with the announcement ofa trucemediated by Qatar and Egypt and agreed by Israel, Hamas and the United States. Here is how it unfolded, as pieced together by Al Jazeera. Some of these details are based on Reuters interviews with two US officials.    📢 We facilitated the release of 2 more hostages, transporting them out of#Gazathis evening. Our role as a neutral intermediary makes this work possible & we are ready to facilitate any future release. We hope that they will soon be back with their loved ones. — ICRC (@ICRC)October 23, 2023     "
Israel says hostage's body found near main Gaza hospital,"Body of Hamas captive Yehudit Weiss found near Gaza hospital, Israel says",0.8004139739908652,2023-11-16,2023-11-17,"Israel's military says its soldiers have found the body of an Israeli hostage taken into Gaza by Hamas in its attack last month.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said 65-year-old Yehudit Weiss was discovered in a house near Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City.It said that her family had been informed, and her body would be returned to Israel.Ms Weiss was kidnapped from her home in Be'eri near the Gaza border.She had been recovering from breast cancer when Hamas launched its deadly attack on 7 October, but was without her medication when she was taken, according to the Bring Them Home Now group.Ms Weiss worked in her kibbutz's kindergartens, managed the dining room and specialised in nursing before she retired, the group said.She was a ""loving full-time grandmother"", it said, adding she had a love for culture, sports, travelling and baking.Her husband, Shmulik, a rabbi, was killed in the Hamas assault.In a statement, the IDF said that Kalashnikov rifles and rocket-propelled grenades were among the weapons discovered where her body was located.""Unfortunately, Yehudit was murdered by terrorists in Gaza and we did not get to her in time,"" IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said in a news briefing on Thursday evening.He did not give further details on how she was killed.So far only four of the 240 hostages who were abducted by Hamas last month have been freed.  Israeli officials say that at least 1,200 people were killed in Hamas's cross-border attack on 7 October by hundreds of gunmen.Since Israel started its counter-attack, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry has said 11,400 people have been killed in the territory.Al-Shifa, Gaza City's largest hospital, became the focus of fighting at the start of the week, and was raided by the Israeli military on Wednesday morning.The IDF says Hamas has been using the hospital as a command centre, and has spent two days searching the complex for evidence of this. Hamas denies operating there and the BBC cannot independently verify claims by either side.Currently more than 650 patients, 500 medical staff and over 5,000 displaced people are taking shelter in the hospital. Its director Muhammad Abu Salmiya said conditions were ""tragic"" at the site, and the hospital has run out of oxygen and water.","The body of Yehudit Weiss, one of about 240 people taken captive by Hamas during its October 7 attacks, has been recovered, Israel’s military has said. Weiss, a 65-year-old mother of five, was found by Israeli soldiers in a “structure” adjacent to the al-Shifa Hospital, military officials said on Thursday. “Yehudit was murdered by the terrorists in the Gaza Strip, and we didn’t manage to reach her in time,” Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari told a televised briefing. Weiss was taken from Kibbutz Be’eri on October 7 when Hamas fighters stormed into southern Israel in the largest attack on the country in decades. Weiss’ husband, Shmulik Weiss, was killed in their home during the attack, according to Israeli officials. Bring Them Home Now, a support group for the captives and their families, described Weiss as a “loving full-time grandmother” who had a love of travelling, baking and sports. The group said she had been recovering from breast cancer at the time of her capture. Israeli officials said military equipment including Kalashnikov rifles and RPGs were found in the same location as Weiss’s body. The announcement came as Israeli forces continued to undertake a major military operation at al-Shifa Hospital, the biggest medical facility in Gaza, amid growing concern for the welfare of patients and staff inside and duelling narratives about the complex’s role in the war. Israel has claimed that the hospital has been used as a Hamas command centre, and on Thursday released a video showing images of a cache of weapons and a hole in the ground surrounded by rubble. Hamas and hospital officials have denied Israeli claims that the complex has been used to plan and carry out military operations. Hamas official Bassem Naim described the claims as a “farce” and said the group did not rule out the possibility that Israeli soldiers had planted the weapons themselves. Ashraf al-Qudra, a spokesman for the Health Ministry in Gaza, on Thursday warned that“thousands of women, children, sick and wounded” were at risk of deathat the hospital as Israeli forces continued to occupy the complex."
Shipping firms pause Red Sea journeys over attacks,Shipping companies pause Red Sea journeys after Houthi attacks,0.7927083986690835,2023-12-15,2023-12-15,"Danish shipping company Maersk has said it is pausing all journeys through the Red Sea.The decision comes after a spate of attacks on vessels launched from a part of Yemen controlled by the Houthis - an Iran-backed rebel movement.The group has declared its support for Hamas and say it is targeting ships travelling to Israel.The Red Sea is one the world's most important routes for oil and fuel shipments.German transport company Hapag-Lloyd later said it was making a similar move.The firm owns a ship that recently came under attack, and confirmed to the BBC later on Friday it was also suspending operations in the area until Monday.In a statement to the BBC, Maersk, one of the world's biggest shipping companies, said: ""The recent attacks on commercial vessels in the area are alarming and pose a significant threat to the safety and security of seafarers.""Following the near-miss incident involving Maersk Gibraltar yesterday and yet another attack on a container vessel today, we have instructed all Maersk vessels in the area bound to pass through the Bab al-Mandab Strait to pause their journey until further notice.""The Bab al-Mandab strait - also known as the Gate of Tears - is a channel 20 miles (32km) wide, and known for being perilous to navigate.It sits between Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula and Djibouti and Eritrea on the African coast.It is the route by which ships can reach the Suez Canal from the south - itself a major shipping lane. Avoiding it means vessels must take much longer routes, for example navigating around southern Africa.About 17,000 ships and 10% of global trade pass through it every year. Any ship passing through Suez to or from the Indian Ocean has to come this way.Maersk pausing its Red Sea shipping journeys ""could not come at a more difficult time"", director general at the Institute of Export & International Trade Marco Forgione said.""This impacts every link in the supply chain... and will only increase the chances of critical products not making their destinations in time for Christmas,"" he added.At least two other cargo ships in the strait came under attack on Friday. The US says one was hit with a drone and another by missiles, blaming the Houthis for both attacks.The Houthis did not confirm the drone strike, but said they did fire missiles at two boats.The group has controlled parts of Yemen since seizing power from the country's government in 2014, triggering an ongoing civil war.Speaking before the announcements by Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd, US national security adviser Jake Sullivan - who is on a trip to the Middle East - said the Houthis were threatening freedom of navigation in the Red Sea, which is vital for oil and goods shipments.""The United States is working with the international community, with partners from the region and from all over the world to deal with this threat,"" he said.Earlier this month, a US warship shot down three drones fired from Houthi-controlled territory in Yemen after three commercial vessels came under attack in the Red Sea.Just days before that incident, the US said another warship had captured armed men who had earlier seized an Israeli-linked tanker off Yemen's coast.Last month, the Houthis released video footage showing armed men dropping from a helicopter and seizing a cargo ship in the southern Red Sea.","Two shipping companies have announced they will pause all journeys through the Red Sea after a series of attacks on shipping by Yemen’s Houthi rebels. Danish shipping company Maersk said on Friday it was suspending its vessels’ passage through the key Bab al-Mandeb Strait, and the German container shipping line Hapag-Lloyd said it would pause journeys in the Red Sea until Monday. The announcements come after attacks from Houthi-controlled Yemen hit two Liberian-flagged ships in the Bab al-Mandeb strait earlier on Friday, a US defence official told the news agency Reuters. A projectile, believed to be a drone, struck one of the vessels, causing a fire but no injuries, the official said. The ship was identified as the Liberia-flagged Al-Jasrah, a 370-metre (1,200-foot) container ship built in 2016. Private intelligence firm Ambrey said the vessel, owned by German transport company Hapag-Lloyd, “sustained physical damage from an aerial attack” north of the Yemeni coastal city of al-Makha (Mocha). “The projectile reportedly hit the port side of the vessel and one container fell overboard due to the impact. The projectile caused a fire on deck” that was reported over radio, Ambrey said. Two ballistic missiles were fired in the second attack, one of which struck a vessel, causing a fire, which the crew was working to extinguish, the US official said. The Associated Press news agency identified the vessel struck in the second attack as the Liberain-flagged MSC Palatium III. “Following the near-miss incident involving Maersk Gibraltar yesterday [Thursday] and yet another attack on a container vessel today, we have instructed all Maersk vessels in the area bound to pass through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait to pause their journey until further notice,” said a statement from Maersk, one of the world’s largest shipping companies. German container shipping line Hapag-Lloyd has paused all its sailings through the Red Sea until December 18, a spokesperson said on Friday. “Then we will decide for the period thereafter,” the spokesperson added. The Houthis said in a statement that they had fired missiles at two ships – the MSC Alanya and MSC Palatium III. The statement did not mention Al Jasrah. An MSC spokesperson said there had been no attack on the Alanya. Asked about the Houthi claim of an attack on the Palatium III, the spokesperson provided no further comment. The Houthis said both vessels had been heading to Israel. However, Alanya and Palatium III both listed Jeddah in Saudi Arabia as their destination, according to data from ship tracking and maritime analytics provider MarineTraffic. “We will continue to prevent all ships heading to Israeli ports until the food and medicine our people need in the Gaza Strip is brought in,” the Houthi statement said. “We assure all ships heading to all ports of the world apart from Israeli ports that they will suffer no harm and they must keep their identification device on,” it said. The Iran-aligned Houthis, who control much of Yemen but are not recognised internationally, have said that they aretargetingshipping to pressure Israel during its offensive on Gaza, which has killed more than 18,700 people in thetwo-month-old waragainst Hamas, which governs the enclave. Speaking in Tel Aviv, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said, “While the Houthis are pulling the trigger, so to speak, they’re being handed the gun by Iran.” TheHouthishave said they will target any ship travelling to Israel, irrespective of its nationality, and are now launching regular attacks, although they are mostly unsuccessful. A Hapag-Lloyd spokesman told the AFP news agency that its ship was en route from the Greek port of Piraeus to Singapore. There were no casualties and the vessel was now travelling on towards its destination.    Sullivan, who is visiting Israel, said the Houthi rebels were threatening freedom of movement in the Red Sea, vital for massive oil and goods shipments. “The United States is working with the international community, with partners from the region and from all over the world to deal with this threat,” he told reporters. The attacks on Friday occurred near Bab al-Mandeb, the narrow strait between Yemen and northeast Africa through which much of global commerce flows. Some 40 percent of international trade passes through the area, which leads to the Red Sea, Israel’s southern port facilities, and the Suez Canal. Insurance costs for ships transiting the area have jumped in recent days, amounting to increases in the tens of thousands of dollars for larger ships like oil tankers, reports say. While warships passing through the Red Sea are well equipped and can retaliate, commercial vessels do not have the same protections. Crews under fire by heavy weapons typically abandon the bridge and control their vessels remotely from an armoured citadel. Israel’s regional rivals have cited the high Palestinian death toll and occupation of much of Gaza as motivating their attacks, raising the risk of the conflict spreading further. The rebels have tried to hijack and capture several ships, succeeding at least once in November. They typically order them to surrender and head to a Yemeni port, and open fire if they do not comply. US, French and British warships arepatrollingthe area and have shot several missiles out of the sky.   "
Israel says it will allow two trucks of fuel a day into Gaza,Israel agrees to allow ‘minimal’ two trucks of fuel a day into Gaza,0.7881765945916501,2023-11-18,2023-11-18,"Israel says it will allow two fuel trucks a day to enter the Gaza Strip, after pressure to do so from the US.A US State Department official says around 140,000 litres of fuel will be allowed in every two days. Most of that is intended for trucks delivering aid, as well as supporting the UN in providing water and sanitation, the official said.The rest is for mobile phone and internet services, which had been cut off due to a lack of fuel.On Friday, the company which provides Gaza's communications said that its services were returning after receiving some fuel via Unrwa, the UN's agency for Palestinian refugees. The US official said Washington exerted considerable pressure on Israel to push this fuel agreement through. The deal had been agreed in principle weeks ago, the official added, but was delayed by Israel for two reasons. Israeli officials told the US that fuel had not actually run out in southern Gaza, and they also wanted to wait and see if they could negotiate a hostage deal first. The head of Unrwa warned on Thursday that the agency may have to suspend all of its activities due to the lack of fuel.In its latest situation report, the agency said it required ""160,000 litres of fuel every day for basic humanitarian operations"" - more than double what has been agreed. Earlier, an Israeli official said the new fuel allowance would be brought in through the Rafah crossing to the civilian population in the southern Gaza Strip via the UN, provided that it does not reach Hamas.The Israeli official said the fuel would give ""minimal"" support to water, sewage and sanitation systems, in order to prevent the outbreak of epidemics that could spread in the area.International organisations have repeatedly expressed grave concerns over the humanitarian situation unfolding in the Gaza Strip. The World Health Organization (WHO) has previously warned of ""worrying trends"" in the spread of disease in Gaza, where the lack of fuel and Israeli bombardment have severely disrupted the healthcare system and sanitation facilities. On Friday, Richard Peeperkorn, the WHO's representative in the Palestinian Territories, said that more than 70,000 cases of acute respiratory infections and over 44,000 cases of diarrhoea had been recorded, according to Reuters - figures significantly higher than expected.Fuel is needed in Gaza to run the enclave's desalination plant, to provide electricity to homes and hospitals, and for sanitation, transport, and communications infrastructure. It is also crucial for the delivery of aid around the territory.Israel has been blocking fuel from entering Gaza, arguing that it could be stolen by Hamas and used for military purposes. Before the latest war Israel provided the majority of Gaza's electricity, and some was produced by the enclave's sole power plant which is no longer functioning.On Saturday in Gaza's south, the director of Nasser hospital in Khan Younis said it had received the bodies of 26 people, and 23 others with serious injuries, after an air strike on a residential building in Hamad city.The Israeli military has not yet commented on the report.Meanwhile, the Red Crescent said at least five Palestinians were killed in an Israeli air strike on a building in the Balata refugee camp in the West Bank city of Nablus.The Israeli army said it was checking on the reports.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has told Israel to take ""urgent"" action to ""de-escalate tensions in the West Bank, including by confronting rising levels of settler extremist violence"".The strike happened a day after Israeli military said it killed at least seven militants in two separate confrontations in the West Bank.Israel's latest siege and military operation began following Hamas's brutal 7 October attack, when the group - which is banned as a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and other powers - killed around 1,200 people and took more than 230 people hostage, according to Israeli authorities. At least 12,000 people have been killed in the territory since Israel began its retaliatory strikes, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in the Palestinian enclave. ","Israel is allowing two trucks of fuel into Gaza every day to keep the besieged enclave’s water and sewage system operational, as its forces continue their air and ground siege of the territory. Israel’s war cabinet said 140,000 litres (37,000 gallons) of fuel could enter every two days after it received a “special request” from the United States. Israel banned fuel supplies into Gaza when it launched a military campaign in the Strip on October 7. Acute shortages have threatened aid deliveries and communications. Tzachi Hanegbi, national security adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said the fuel would be used to “operate the sewage and water systems run by UNRWA”, the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees. “We took that decision to prevent the spread of epidemics. We don’t need epidemics that will harm civilians or our fighters. If there are epidemics, the fighting will stop,” he said. Hanegbi described the quantity as“very minimal”. A US State Department official, offering more details, said Israel had committed to allowing in 120,000 litres (31,700 gallons) of fuel every 48 hours for UNRWA’s trucks and other needs like desalinisation of water, sewage pumping and for bakeries and hospitals in the south of Gaza. An additional 20,000 litres (5,300 gallons) every two days would be allowed in to power generators of telecoms company Paltel, which had warned of an imminent blackout of its cellphone network due to a lack of fuel. But aid groups have said the fuel ration is far from enough. Reporting from occupied East Jerusalem, Al Jazeera’s Rory Challands said: “Tzachi Hanegbi is basically justifying allowing this trickle of fuel in, for a domestic audience, as a way of keeping the military operation going on in Gaza. “He is saying pandemics, if they break out, would not just affect the population of Gaza but also affect Israeli troops and hurt their fighting ability. And he is also saying that this decision basically gives diplomatic space to Israel to carry on pushing that military offensive.” US officials have been pushing Israel to allow fuel in for some time. After not complying for weeks, “now, Netanyahu’s government believes that granting this wish from the US basically means that that criticism is going to start dying down,” Challands said. On Wednesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken made calls to members of Israel’s war cabinet and warned that the fuel shortage risked a humanitarian catastrophe among Gaza’s 2.3 million residents, a State Department official said. But Israeli officials argue that Hamas should release hostages before it eased the pressure on Gaza. Challands said allowing fuel into Gaza is “incredibly unpopular among the far right” in Israel. “They feel while the fuel is being given, the captives are not being returned,” he said, noting how Israel’s National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir has said that “there is no sense in giving the enemy humanitarian gifts”. Andreas Krieg, senior lecturer of security studies at King’s College London told Al Jazeera that for Israel, this decision about allowing limited supplies of fuel into Gaza is not really “an act of empathy”. “This is more about them knowing that the clock is ticking,” he said. “They know the international community, especially Western allies of Israel, are increasingly nervous about what Israel is doing. Especially the Biden administration wants to see this is coming to an end somehow.”"
Israeli tanks surround north Gaza's Indonesian Hospital,Israeli tanks besiege Gaza’s Indonesian Hospital,0.7874291736724226,2023-11-20,2023-11-20,"Israeli tanks have reportedly encircled Gaza's Indonesian Hospital, where the Hamas-run health ministry said 12 people were killed on Sunday night.The hospital's director, Dr Marwan Al-Sultan, told the BBC that the post-operative care department was hit and troops were only about 20m (66ft) away.On Monday evening, he said intermittent shooting could still be heard on site.The Israeli military said its forces targeted ""terrorists"" who had opened fire at them from within the hospital.The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said he was ""appalled"". ""Health workers and civilians should never have to be exposed to such horror, and especially while inside a hospital,"" Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.Health ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra accused Israel of ""tightening its noose"" around the hospital in the north of the enclave, and later told AFP news agency 200 patients had been evacuated by bus to Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis.He said the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) was helping to coordinate the evacuation of the remaining 400 patients.Meanwhile, 28 premature Palestinian babies evacuated on Sunday from Gaza City's besieged Al-Shifa Hospital, which Israeli forces raided last week, have been transported to Egypt for treatment.Israel launched a major military campaign in Gaza in response to a cross-border attack by hundreds of Hamas gunmen on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and about 240 others taken hostage.Gaza's health ministry says more than 14,000 people have been killed in the territory since Israel launched its retaliatory campaign against Hamas. The UN Security Council has called for ""urgent and extended humanitarian pauses"" for ""a sufficient number of days"" to allow UN agencies to safely enter the sealed-off territory.But five days on, the International Rescue Committee says the killing and suffering of Palestinians has increased, and has urged the Security Council and others to bring about a ceasefire ""without limits on its duration, to protect lives and allow aid to flow"".On Monday morning, video footage verified by the BBC showed several tanks stationed on a road about 240m (800ft) north-east of the Indonesian Hospital, which is funded by Indonesia.The official Palestinian news agency, Wafa, cited medical sources as saying that dozens of Israeli armoured vehicles were in the surrounding area and that snipers were on rooftops, preventing ambulances from reaching the hospital. The health ministry said 12 wounded patients and people with them were killed and dozens more were wounded when an Israeli shell reportedly hit the second floor of the facility.Dr Al-Sultan told the BBC that he heard gunfire all around the building overnight and that at least 10 people were killed. Al Jazeera posted a video that the Qatar-based network said showed journalist Anas al-Sharif walking through the hospital following the incident. The body of at least one person could be seen, as well as damage to ceilings and equipment in several rooms and corridors. Sharif reported that ""victims are piling up on the floor"" and that there was ""an overwhelming state of panic among patients"". Hospitals are specifically protected under international humanitarian law. Any military operation around hospitals must take steps to spare patients, medical staff and other civilians inside them.A spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said: ""Overnight, terrorists opened fire from within the Indonesian Hospital in Gaza toward IDF troops operating outside the hospital. In response, IDF troops directly targeted the specific source of enemy fire. No shells were fired toward the hospital.""""Despite the challenges the IDF faces in a war against a terrorist organisation which operates out of hospitals, the IDF is committed to international law and takes numerous measures to minimize harm to non-combatants.""Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden said he believed a deal to free hostages in Gaza was close, as the ICRC said its president had travelled to Qatar to meet with Hamas and Qatari government representatives.US national security spokesman John Kirby said he believed ""we're closer than we've ever been, so we're hopeful"". The ICRC does not take part in negotiations leading to hostage releases but is there to facilitate any deal that is agreed.That has been the process with the four hostages freed so far - Qatari negotiations with Hamas followed by the ICRC retrieving the hostages from agreed locations and bringing them back to Israel.Qatar's prime minister has said a deal to free some of the hostages now hinges on ""minor"" practical issues. On Sunday night, the IDF released new videos from Al-Shifa Hospital, where it has claimed there was a vast underground Hamas command centre. It said one showed a tunnel leading to a blast-proof door and that two others taken from CCTV cameras showed two hostages - one of them wounded - being taken to the hospital on 7 October. The IDF also said a pathologist's report and its intelligence had shown a female Israeli soldier whose body was recovered from a building near Al-Shifa last week had been injured in an Israeli air strike and then killed by a member of Hamas inside the hospital. Hamas has denied using Al-Shifa and other hospitals as shields for its fighters.At the same time, the WHO has said it was finalising its plans to complete the evacuation of between 250 to 260 seriously wounded or ill patients trapped at Al-Shifa.""These include around 29 patients with spinal injuries, 22 patients with kidney failure requiring kidney dialysis,"" the WHO's Regional Emergency Director, Dr Richard Brennan, told the BBC.""The vast majority of the remaining patients have complicated war injuries - terrible fractures and amputations, bad burns, head, abdominal, chest injuries, and many of which are complicated by severe wound infection.""Thirty-one premature babies were evacuated from Al-Shifa to the Emirates Hospital in southern Gaza on Sunday by the Palestinian Red Crescent and UN, with the assistance of the IDF. At least five other babies had previously died after being removed from their incubators due to a lack of power after the hospital ran out of fuel.On Monday, 28 of the evacuated babies were taken to Egypt via the Rafah border crossing for treatment. Some are being admitted to the hospital in El-Arish while others in more serious conditions are being flown to Cairo.Dr Mohamed Salama, head of the neo-natal unit at al-Ahli Emirates hospital, told the BBC that the parents of two babies had refused to send them to Egypt ""due to personal circumstances"". A third baby was being kept in Gaza because his condition was stable and his parents were unknown, he said.Dr Brennan described the evacuation as ""one of the few bits of good news we've had during this conflict"", but noted that the babies had ""a long road ahead of them"" to recover.In a separate development, medical charity MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF) said its clinic in Gaza City came under fire on Monday morning.""Our colleagues saw that a wall was torn down and part of the building was engulfed by fire as heavy fighting took place all around it. An Israeli tank was seen in the street,"" a statement said.An MSF member of staff and 20 family members were in the clinic and in extreme danger, while 50 other people were in nearby buildings, it added.There was no immediate comment from the IDF.On the Front Line: Jeremy BowenBBC News International Editor Jeremy Bowen on what it's like reporting from inside Israel and Gaza (UK only).Available now on BBC iPlayer","Israeli tanks have surrounded northern Gaza’s Indonesian Hospital after artillery fire killed at least 12 Palestinians in the complex, according to the war-torn enclave’s Ministry of Health. Ashraf al-Qudra, Gaza’s Health Ministry spokesperson, told Al Jazeera on Monday that “the situation is catastrophic” in the Indonesian Hospital, where hundreds of people remain trapped. “The Indonesian Hospital staff are insisting they will stay to treat the wounded. There are about 700 people, including medical staff and injured people, inside the hospital,” he said. The Israeli military, which rarely publicises troop movements, had no immediate comment. The Palestinian news agency Wafa said the facility in the northeast Gaza town of Beit Lahiya had been hit by artillery fire. Palestinian health officials said there were frantic efforts to evacuate civilians out of harm’s way. Hospital staff denied there were any armed militants on the premises. Indonesia’s Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi condemned Israel’s actions and urged Tel Aviv’s partners to “stop its atrocities”. “The attack is a clear violation of international humanitarian laws. All countries, especially those that have close relations with Israel, must use all their influence and capabilities to urge Israel to stop its atrocities,” she said in a statement.    The advance on the facility, set up in 2016 with funding from Indonesian organisations, came a day after the World Health Organization evacuated 31 premature babies from al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. They were among more than 250 critically ill or wounded patients stranded there since Israeli forces entered the compound. The territory’s largest health facility is beingevacuatedat gunpoint after being under siege for several days with 7,000 people inside. The United Nations humanitarian agency OCHA has reported the “collapse of services” at hospitals across northern Gaza following widespread air strikes and the lack of fuel and medical supplies. The Israeli military claims Hamas, the group that rules Gaza, has built underground infrastructure below hospitals for military usage, which Hamas and medical officials deny. Marwan Abdallah, a medical worker at the Indonesian Hospital, said Israeli tanks were visible from the windows. “You can see them moving around and firing,” he said. “Women and children are terrified. There are constant sounds of explosions and gunfire.” Abdallah said the hospital had received dozens of dead and wounded in air raids and shelling overnight. Israel launched its offensive against Gaza after a wave of cross-border raids by Hamas on October 7 killed more than 1,200 people, the majority of them civilians, according to Israeli authorities. The Hamas-run government says the death toll from Israel’s aerial bombardment and ground operations in the Palestinian territory has reached 13,000, thousands of them children."
Japan condemns Yemen's Houthi rebels hijack of cargo ship in Red Sea,Yemen’s Houthi rebels seize cargo ship in Red Sea,0.765461961679469,2023-11-20,2023-11-19,"Japan has condemned the hijacking of a Japanese-operated, British-owned cargo ship in the Red Sea by Iran-backed Houthi rebels.The Yemeni militia claimed the vessel was Israeli, and a spokesman said the seizure was only the beginning of a ""battle at sea"". Israel said the ship was not Israeli and a Japanese government spokesperson said it was operated by Nippon Yusen.Japan's chief cabinet secretary said it was working towards the ship's release.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blamed the Houthi's backer, Iran, for the hijacking.Mr Netanyahu said neither the vessel nor the crew were Israeli and called it an ""Iranian attack on an international ship"". Iran has denied involvement.Japanese shipping company Nippon Yusen - also known as NYK Line - said the ship, named Galaxy Leader, was carrying 25 crew members when it was seized near Hodeida, Yemen on its way to India.Those on board are believed to include Bulgarian, Mexican, Filipino and Ukrainian nationals. Galaxy Leader is owned by Galaxy Maritime Ltd, which is registered in the Isle of Man. It is owned by Ray Car Carriers, which is co-owned by Israeli businessman Abraham Ungar, according to documents from the Isle of Man Government's Companies registry.In a statement quoted by Reuters news agency, Galaxy Maritime Ltd said the ship was ""illegally boarded by military personnel via a helicopter"" on Sunday, and was now being held at the port of Hodeidah in Yemen. Unverified video footage released by the Houthis on Monday and aired on the group's TV channel, Al Masirah, showed armed men descending from a helicopter onto the ship.Mr Ungar told The Associated Press news agency he was aware of the incident but could not comment on it. ""The government of Japan absolutely condemns such an act,"" said Hirokazu Matsuno, Japan's chief cabinet secretary said on Monday, adding there were no Japanese nationals among the crew.He said ministries and agencies were working with the relevant countries for the early release of the vessel and its crew.""We are also urging related countries such as Saudi Arabia, Oman and Iran to strongly urge the Houthis to release the ships and sailors as soon as possible.""Matthew Miller, spokesman for the US state department, called the Houthi's seizure of the ship ""a flagrant violation of international law"" and demanded the ""immediate release of the ship and its crew"".Mohammed Abdulsalam, a spokesman for Yemen's Houthi rebels, said on X, formerly Twitter, the group's seizure of the vessel was only ""the start"" of its fighters waging ""battle at sea"".Houthi's military spokesman, Yahya al-Sarea, claimed the ship was Israeli and had been taken to a port in Yemen.The group had earlier threatened to target any Israeli ship within their reach in response to Israel's retaliatory military action in the Gaza Strip following the 7 October attack by Hamas militants.More than 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 taken hostage during the surprise Hamas attack on the south of the country, according to the Israeli government. In retaliation, it launched a massive military operation to try and eliminate Hamas - involving air and artillery strikes as well as ground troops - with the aim of eliminating Hamas.According to the Hamas-run health ministry, the death toll in Gaza since then has reached 13,300. More than 2,000 more are feared to be buried under rubble.The Houthis have fired several missiles and drones towards Israel just after Israel launched its retaliatory operation.The US said at the time that all the missiles and drones were intercepted by its warship in the Red Sea.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) described the attack on the ship as a ""very grave incident of global consequence"".The IDF said the vessel was on its way from Turkey to India when it was seized in the southern Red Sea near Yemen.Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian has recently said that what he called resistance groups allied to Tehran were ""cleverly adjusting pressure"" on Israel and its supporters.Earlier this month, the Houthis shot down a US military drone off Yemen's coast, American officials said.The Houthis have been locked in a prolonged civil war with Yemen's official government - backed by Saudi Arabia - since 2014. Additional reporting by Shruti Menon","Yemen’s Houthis say they have taken control of a cargo ship in the southern Red Sea as thewar in Gazasends tensions soaring in the region. The Houthis, who control northern Yemen and its Red Sea coast, said the ship was Israeli, but Israel described it as a British-owned and Japanese-operated cargo vessel with no Israeli nationals on board. Some 25 people are believed to have been on board the Galaxy Leader – reported to be partly owned by an Israeli businessman and sailing under the flag of Bahamas – when it was seized en route from Turkey to India. Ownership details in public shipping databases associated the ship’s owners with Ray Car Carriers, founded by Abraham “Rami” Ungar, who is known as one of the richest men in Israel. Ungar told The Associated Press news agency he was aware of the incident but could not comment as he awaited details. A ship linked to himexperienced an explosionin 2021 in the Gulf of Oman. Israeli media blamed it on Iran at the time. International shipping often involves a series of management companies, flags and owners stretching across the globe in a single vessel. Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree said the seizure of the ship was in response to the “heinous acts against our Palestinian brothers in Gaza and the West Bank”. “If the international community is concerned about regional security and stability, rather than expanding the conflict, it should put an end to Israel’s aggression against Gaza,” he wrote on X. The Houthis have launched several missile and droneattacks against Israelsince October 7, when an attack by Hamas inside Israel prompted an Israeli ground and air offensive on Gaza. Last week, the Iran-aligned Houthis said they could target Israeli ships in the Red Sea and the Bab al-Mandeb Strait. Saree renewed the warning that any ship belonging to Israel or those who support it will be a legitimate target for Houthi forces. “We confirm our continuation of military operations against [Israel] until the aggression and ugly crimes against our Palestinian brothers in Gaza and the West Bank stop,” said Saree.    In a statement, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Israel was not involved in the ship’s ownership, operation or the makeup of its international crew. It alleged the attack was an “Iranian act of terrorism” with consequences for international maritime security. “This … represents an escalation in Iran’s belligerence against the citizens of the free world, with concomitant international ramifications vis-a-vis the security of global shipping routes,” said the statement released by the prime minister’s office, without providing any evidence about Iran’s involvement. “There were no Israelis on the ship,” it continued, adding the 25 crew members are from Ukraine, Mexico, the Philippines and Bulgaria, among other countries. On Monday, Iran denied the Israeli claims. Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani told reporters in Tehran that regional resistance groups make decisions and take actions based on their own interests.   "
Israel orders evacuations from city in south Gaza as offensive widens,Israel orders evacuations as onslaught on Gaza widens,0.749829217795256,2023-12-04,2023-12-04,"Israel's military has ordered the evacuation of a fifth of the main city in southern Gaza, as it expands its ground offensive against Hamas.A map showed six northern and central areas of Khan Younis where an estimated 167,000 people needed to leave. Witnesses also reported seeing tanks to the east, and a doctor said a local hospital was overwhelmed by casualties.In Gaza City, an unconfirmed report says 50 people were killed when Israeli air strikes hit two schools.According to the Palestinian news agency Wafa, they died in schools sheltering displaced people in the city's Daraj neighbourhood. Reuters news agency has said that the strikes are still to be independently verified and that the Hamas-run health ministry could not be reached for comment. The Israeli army said it was looking into the report. Many of Gaza's 2.3 million residents are sheltering in the south after being previously ordered to leave the north.The Israeli military said it would operate with ""maximum force"" in the south, as it had done in the north - where there has been widespread destruction over the past eight weeks.Israel launched a full-scale campaign in Gaza in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and about 240 others taken hostage. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says almost 15,900 people have been killed in the territory since the war began, while the UN says a humanitarian catastrophe is unfolding.A temporary ceasefire that lasted for seven days, which led to the release of 105 of the hostages and 240 Palestinians held in Israeli jails, fell apart on Friday.BBC Gaza correspondent Rushdi Abu Alouf, who is currently in Istanbul, says about 200 Israeli air strikes were reported overnight.About 15 to 20 locations were targeted in and around Khan Younis, where the local population has swelled to as much as 1.2 million, according to local authorities. The central town of Deir al-Balah, about 8km (5 miles) to the north, was also bombed heavily.Dozens of casualties, including women and children, arrived at Khan Younis's Nasser Hospital from different areas. Many were dead or seriously injured.Mohammed Eid wiped tears from his bandaged face as he lined up among the mourners by bodies covered in white shrouds outside the hospital on Monday morning.""We were sleeping safely, minding our own business. Suddenly, a bomb fell on us, and the whole building was destroyed,"" he told the BBC.""My brother was torn into pieces, and so was his wife. My daughter was killed, and his daughters were killed, including his littlest. We can't find my mum, and my niece.""Later, witnesses and local journalists in Gaza reported that they had seen Israeli tanks and armoured vehicles on the eastern outskirts of Khan Younis, by Abasan and Khuzaa, which is nearest to the boundary fence with Israel.  Moaz Mohammed told AFP news agency that he had seen tanks moving down the main north-south highway, Salah al-Din Road, which has been one of two Israeli-designated evacuation routes. The tanks were ""firing bullets and tank shells at cars and people trying to move through the area"" between Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, he said.At the same time, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) warned civilians to avoid a section of Salah al-Din Road in the same area, saying it now constituted a ""battlefield"" and was ""extremely dangerous"".The IDF also posted a map that ordered residents of six northern and central neighbourhoods of Khan Younis - al-Mahatta, al-Katiba, Hamad, al-Satir, Bani Suheila and Ma'in - to leave immediately to ""preserve your safety and security"". According to the UN, the marked area in Khan Younis was home to almost 117,000 people before the war. It also includes 21 shelters where 50,000 displaced people are currently living.The map tells them to move to al-Fukhari, east of Khan Younis, and Rafah's al-Shaboura and Tal al-Sultan neighbourhoods, which are already overcrowded. IDF chief spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a statement that Israeli forces were continuing to operate with ""maximum force against Hamas terrorists and infrastructure, while minimising harm to the civilians that Hamas places around them as shields"".""We are dropping leaflets with QR codes that opens a map guiding Gazans to safer areas. The map is divided into neighbourhood numbers indicating where civilians in a specific area should go to avoid being in the crossfire,"" he added.The IDF has introduced the scheme because it is under heavy pressure from the US to protect civilians. However, our Gaza correspondent says he has spoken to Palestinians in the affected areas who are not aware of the map or cannot see it because there is no internet coverage.""This is a joke, not a map, because we don't know where to go,"" a displaced person who was sheltering in Khan Younis told him.Meanwhile, an orthopaedic surgeon at the European Hospital in Khan Younis told the BBC that it was overwhelmed by hundreds of wounded.""It is chaotic - we can't absorb any more patients and they keep coming,"" Dr Paul Ley said. ""We have more than 360 people on the operating list, which is impossible to deal with."" Dr Ley also said the hospital's corridors and grounds were full with 6,000 to 7,000 displaced people, some of whom were medics who had fled the north.""Anaesthetics and pain killers are a big problem - we are running out slowly so we are lowering our safety standards. We never leave the hospital and our presence here has been notified to the Israelis, but shrapnel has reached the hospital,"" he added.MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res also warned that more than 100 dead and over 400 injured people had arrived at the emergency room of Al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah in the last 48 hours, and that there was no space for new patients.The UN said on Monday that four hospitals in the north were partially operating and admitting patients, with only limited services. The 12 hospitals in the south are partially functional, but bed capacity is only half what it was before the war and only one hospital can perform complex surgery.","Israel has ordered Palestinians to evacuate several more areas as it widens its bombardment of the Gaza Strip, killing hundreds. The Israeli military declared on Monday via the social media site X that it was defining “safe areas” for Gaza civilians to minimise harm to them. However, hundreds more Palestinians have been killed since the onslaught resumed on Friday, and it is unclear where civilians might seek safety. Al Jazeera journalists on the ground say it is difficult to heed the orders in real time, with nowhere safe remaining in the enclave. Israel published a map on Friday, dividing Gaza into “evacuation zones” and asking people to follow their announcements for their safety. However, the maps, which include nearly 2,500 grids, have confused many, while unreliable internet and electricity make keeping updated a challenge. On Monday, an update with three arrows pointing south was issued. The instruction came the day after the Israeli military said it had expanded its ground operation to all of Gaza, targeting “Hamas centres in all” of the enclave. The renewed bombardment follows the end on Friday of the seven-day pause in thefightingbetween Israeli forces and Hamas fighters, which had allowed an exchange of about 105 Israeli and foreign hostages held by Hamas for 240Palestinian prisoners. More than 15,500 people have been killed, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health, in nearly two months of warfare that broke out after a Hamas cross-border raid on southern Israel on October 7 in which 1,200 Israelis were killed and about 240 taken hostage. Intense air raidsovernight killed more than 100 Palestinians, according to the Hamas authorities. That raises the death toll in Gaza since Saturday to more than 800. Israel has also stepped up attacks on the city of Khan Younis in the south, which was previously designated as a safe area, leading thousands of displaced Palestinians to flee to the city. “This comes as hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have fled their homes and have been displaced,” said Al Jazeera’s Hamdah Salhut, reporting from occupied East Jerusalem. “While the Israelis are chalking up battle plans for the southern part of the Gaza Strip, the reality is that there is no safe place in Gaza at the end of day 58 of this war. “It is worth noting that the Israeli military has not shown huge military achievements or accomplishments, but rather what we have seen is a dire humanitarian catastrophe that has unfolded inside of the Gaza Strip.”    Israeli security forces also continued their raids in the occupied West Bank overnight and early on Monday morning. They targeted the cities and towns of Ramallah, Jenin, Silwad, Jaffna, Jalazoun, Qalqilya and Hebron, arresting dozens of people, according to the Palestinian Wafa news agency. Palestinian officials told Al Jazeera that at least two Palestinians were killed in the morning during an Israeli army raid in Qalqilya in the north. Israeli army radio confirmed that two “gunmen” were killed and one wounded following a raid in the city. Local sources told Al Jazeera that both bodies were taken away by the Israeli forces. Reporting from Hebron, Hoda Abdel-Hamid said it is a common practice and that Israeli authorities are holding the bodies of 25 Palestinians killed in raids since October 7. More than 3,500 people have been arrested, she added, and the majority are being held without charges. A total of 256 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since October 7, including six prisoners who died in Israeli custody.   "
Gaza war: Premature babies evacuated from al-Shifa hospital,Babies evacuated from al-Shifa Hospital to southern Gaza amid Israel war,0.7422427020122422,2023-11-19,2023-11-19,"Thirty-one premature Palestinian babies have been evacuated from Gaza City's al-Shifa hospital, which the World Health Organization (WHO) has described as a ""death zone"".The babies have been taken to an Emirati hospital in the southern city of Rafah, close to the Egyptian border.Hundreds of people, including patients, left from al-Shifa on Saturday.The hospital - the territory's largest and most modern - is under the control of Israeli troops.They have been searching the complex for evidence that it served as headquarters of Hamas.On Saturday, hundreds of people, including some patients, evacuated the hospital, but some 300 critically ill people remained as well as 33 premature babies. A Red Crescent spokeswoman told the BBC that one baby then died on Friday evening and another on Saturday morning.On Sunday the 31 surviving babies were evacuated by the Red Crescent in coordination with the UN.World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the babies were ""very sick"", had been moved under ""extremely intense and high-risk security conditions"", and were now ""receiving urgent care in the neonatal intensive care unit"" in Rafah.Dr Mohammad Zaqout, general director of hospitals in the Gaza Strip, told AP some of the babies were dehydrated or had developed gastritis due to unsanitised water. Lack of medications had caused others to develop sepsis, and some had hypothermia as they could not be placed in incubators.The babies had been accompanied by six health workers and 10 staff family members, Dr Tedros said.Doctors at al-Shifa had previously said newborns had died after power for incubators was cut off due to a lack of fuel.Red Crescent spokeswoman Nebal Farsakh told the BBC that some of the premature babies' parents had been killed in Israeli air strikes. The BBC is not able to independently verify this.She said the surviving parents had been ordered to leave Gaza City - where al-Shifa hospital is located - before the babies' evacuation, and their current whereabouts were unknown.A Gaza health ministry Facebook page urged the babies' parents to rejoin their babies at the hospital in Rafah.Israel has not yet commented, though it previously said it would help evacuate babies to a ""safer hospital"".  The WHO was planning further missions to take the remaining patients and staff out of al-Shifa once safe passage guarantees had been secured, he said.Al-Shifa's hospital director Dr Muhammad Abu Salima has called on the WHO and the UN to help the medical teams and patients ""leave this desolated place"". He told BBC Arabic there were about 25 medical staff left at the hospital, but that without water and electricity they were unable to properly care for the hundreds of remaining patients.""The hospital, now, is a ghost house in the full sense of the word,"" he said. ""Corpses are spreading out in the emergency department, patients are screaming, the medical staff is quite helpless, while the army is walking freely around in the hospital,"" he said.Israel has said Hamas has a command centre under al-Shifa - a claim Hamas has denied - but has not yet provided substantial evidence of this. Later on Sunday the Israeli military released footage which it said showed a ""55m-long terror tunnel, 10m deep underneath the Shifa hospital"". The footage shows a tunnel leading to a door. The IDF said investigations were ""continuing to uncover the route of the tunnel"".Earlier this week, Israel military spokesman Lt Col Jonathan Conricus, said it could take weeks to fully search the medical complex.Hamas, classified as a terrorist organisation in many Western countries, attacked Israel on 7 October, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 240 hostage.Israel has launched a massive retaliatory operation - involving air and artillery strikes as well as ground troops - with the aim of eliminating Hamas.The Hamas-run health ministry says the death toll in Gaza since then has reached 12,300. More than 2,000 more are feared to be buried under rubble.","The most vulnerable patients atal-Shifa Hospital– dozens of prematurely born babies in critical condition – have been evacuated to the south of the Gaza Strip. Of the39 babieswho had been left without incubators when al-Shifa Hospital was left short of fuel and medical supplies afterIsraeli forces raided on Wednesday, 31 have made it out. Mohammed Zaqout, director-general of hospitals in Gaza, told journalists that “all 31 premature babies in al-Shifa Hospital … have been evacuated” along with three doctors and two nurses, and “preparations are under way” for them to enter Egypt. Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from the Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza, said the babies were on their way to southern Gaza hospitals. Six Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) ambulances transported them, in an effort coordinated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the group said in a post on its Facebook page. Israeli forcesordereddoctors, patients and displaced people at Gaza’s al-Shifa Hospital to evacuate the medical compound, forcing some to leave by gunpoint, doctors and Palestinian officials told Al Jazeera on Saturday. A WHO team that visited the hospital on Saturday reported that there were still hundreds of patients there, including many in extremely critical condition, trauma patients with severely infected wounds, and others with spinal injuries who are unable to move. “Patients and health staff with whom they spoke were terrified for their safety and health, and pleaded for evacuation,” the agency said, describing al-Shifa as a death zone. Doctors said that four babies had died during the raid. The babies were transferred to the south of Gaza “in preparation for their transfer to the Emirates Hospital in Rafah”, the PRCS said. Later in the day, Ashraf al-Qidra, spokesperson for the Health Ministry in Hamas-controlled Gaza, told a news conference that the babies had been moved to Tal al-Sultan Hospital in Rafah and will be sent to Egyptian hospitals with their families tomorrow."
Turkey Israel: 'Seven arrested for passing information to Mossad',Turkey arrests seven suspected of selling information to Israel’s Mossad,0.7373893732198002,2024-02-02,2024-02-02,"Turkish security forces have arrested seven people on suspicion of passing information to the Israeli intelligence service Mossad, unnamed officials say.The arrests came after a joint raid by police and officials from Turkey's MIT intelligence agency in Istanbul and the western city of Izmir.A month ago 34 people with suspected Mossad links were charged with spying.Turkey's president has warned Israel of ""serious consequences"" if it targets Hamas members on Turkish soil. Turkey - unlike most Western countries and some Arab states - does not classify Hamas as a terrorist organisation.There is strong support for the Palestinians in Turkey, with tens of thousands regularly attending rallies in Istanbul and other cities.Ankara has as not yet made a formal statement about Friday's arrests.But media reports via unnamed officials say MIT discovered that Mossad was using private detectives to monitor, photograph and track suspected Hamas members.In January Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said the 34 detainees were charged with ""political or military espionage"" on behalf of Israeli intelligence.Mossad is believed to have recruited Palestinians and Syrian nationals living in Turkey as part of its operations.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been involved in an increasingly bitter war of words with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu since Israel's war with Hamas began.He has described Mr Netanyahu's actions in Gaza as ""genocide"" and last month compared him to Hitler.Israeli intelligence officials have vowed to target Hamas outside the Palestinian territories, including in Lebanon, Qatar and Turkey.Israel launched its war against the Islamist group after its fighters crossed into Israel on 7 October and carried out a series of deadly attacks which led to the deaths of about 1,200 people.Some 250 people were taken back to Gaza as hostages - with 105 subsequently released during a truce in November.Correction 13th February: This article wrongly reported that about 1,300 people had been killed following the 7th October attack by Hamas. This was based on counting those who later died from their injuries in addition to the figure of more than 1,200. The article has been amended to now refer to about 1,200 deaths, a figure which includes those deaths and which Israel says is not final.","Police in Turkey have arrested seven people on suspicion of selling information to Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency related to tracking and monitoring local targets. The suspects were taken into custody in a joint operation of police and Turkey’s National Intelligence Organisation (MIT) following raids in Istanbul and the Aegean province of Izmir, state news agency Anadolu reported on Friday. They are believed to have attempted to monitor and photograph the targets, place tracking devices on them and gain other information for Mossad, state broadcaster TRT reported quoting unnamed security sources. Ankara has previously warned Israel of “serious consequences” if it tries to hunt down members of the Palestinian group Hamas living outside Palestinian territories, including in Turkey. The head of Israel’s domestic Shin Bet security agency said in December that his organisation was prepared to target Hamas anywhere, including in Lebanon, Turkey and Qatar. MIT had determined that Mossad was using private detectives to follow its targets, according to TRT. Mossad is alleged to have recruited Palestinian and Syrian nationals in Turkey as part of an operation against foreigners living in the country. Turkey, unlike its Western allies, does not classify Hamas as a “terrorist” organisation. Turkish PresidentRecep Tayyip Erdoganhas condemned Israel for itswar in Gazaand has repeatedly criticised Western countries for supporting Tel Aviv’s campaign. Last month,34 peoplewere detained by Turkish police on suspicion of spying for Israel. They were accused of planning to carry out activities, including surveillance and “pursuing, assaulting and kidnapping” foreign nationals living in Turkey. At the time, Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said most of the suspects were charged with committing “political or military espionage” on behalf of Israeli intelligence. Following the January 2 arrests, Anadolu cited a prosecution document as saying the operation targeted “Palestinian nationals and their families … within the scope of the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict”."
Hamas deputy leader Saleh al-Arouri killed in Beirut blast,"Who was Saleh al-Arouri, the Hamas leader killed in Beirut?",0.7338920998290925,2024-01-03,2024-01-03,"Israel has insisted the assassination of a Hamas leader in Beirut was not an attack on Lebanon, as its enemies warned of ""punishment"" for his death.Israel has neither confirmed nor denied that it killed Saleh al-Arouri, but a spokesman called it a ""surgical strike against the Hamas leadership"".Hamas denounced it as a ""terrorist act"", while its ally Hezbollah said it was an assault on Lebanese sovereignty.Lebanon's PM accused Israel of trying to ""drag"" it into a regional war.Lebanese media report that Arouri, a deputy political leader of Hamas, was killed in a drone strike in southern Beirut on Tuesday along with six others - two Hamas military commanders and four other members.He was a key figure in the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas's armed wing, and a close ally of Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas leader. He had been in Lebanon acting as a connection between his group and Hezbollah.There have been near daily exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and Israeli forces since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, but so far the violence has been limited to the area along the Israel-Lebanon border.Hezbollah - which, like Hamas, is considered a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK and others - is the largest political and military force in Lebanon and has ministers in the country's government.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) refused to comment on the assassination of Saleh al-Arouri, but said its troops were ""highly prepared for any scenario"".""The IDF is in a very high state of readiness in all arenas, in defence and offence,"" spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari told a briefing.""The most important thing to say tonight is that we are focused and remain focused on fighting Hamas,"" he added.Israeli government adviser Mark Regev also stopped short of confirming Israel had carried out the attack, but he told MSNBC: ""Whoever did it, it must be clear that this was not an attack on the Lebanese state. ""It was not an attack even on Hezbollah, the terrorist organisation. ""Whoever did this did a surgical strike against the Hamas leadership. Whoever did this has a gripe with Hamas. That is very clear.""Arouri, 57, is the most senior Hamas figure to be killed since Israel went to war with the group after its 7 October attack.On that day, waves of Hamas gunmen invaded Israel and attacked communities around the border, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 240 to Gaza as hostages. Israel launched a military offensive in response, with the declared aim of destroying Hamas. Since then, more than 22,000 Palestinians - mostly women and children - have been killed in Israeli strikes on Gaza, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.Lebanon's state news agency said Arouri had been killed by an Israeli drone attack on a Hamas office in the southern Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh.A witness from Reuters news agency saw firefighters and paramedics gathered around a high-rise building where there was a large hole in what appeared to be the third floor.Video footage on social media showed a car in flames and extensive damage to buildings in what is a busy residential area.Dahiyeh is known as a stronghold of Hezbollah.Mr Haniyeh, the leader of Hamas's political bureau, called the attack a ""cowardly... terrorist act, a violation of Lebanon's sovereignty, and an expansion of its circle of aggression"".Hezbollah said that it considered Arouri's death ""to be a serious assault on Lebanon, its people, its security, sovereignty, and resistance, and the highly symbolic and significant political and security messages it contains"".It said the attack was ""a dangerous development in the course of the war... and we in Hezbollah affirm that this crime will never pass without response and punishment"". ""Its hand is on the trigger, and its resistors are in the highest levels of readiness and preparedness,"" it added.Iran, a major supporter of both groups, said Arouri's killing would ""undoubtedly ignite another surge in the veins of resistance"".An Israeli security cabinet meeting scheduled for Tuesday evening to discuss the post-war plan for Gaza was cancelled.The Lebanese Foreign Minister, Abdallah Bou Habib, told BBC Radio 4 his government was talking to Hezbollah to ""impress on them that they should not respond themselves"" but that: ""We don't tell them, we dialogue with them in this regard.""Over the next 24 hours it will become clear ""whether they respond or not"", he said, adding: ""We are very concerned, [the] Lebanese don't want to be dragged, even Hezbollah does not want to be dragged into a regional war."" And he called on the West to ""pressure Israel to stop also all its violence and all of its actions, not only on Lebanon, not only on Beirut, but also in Gaza"".Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously vowed to eliminate Hamas's leaders, wherever they are.Arouri was also considered the de facto leader of Hamas's military wing in the West Bank, overseeing attacks there, according to Israeli media reports.He is believed to have been involved in the kidnapping and killing of three Israeli teenagers in the occupied West Bank in 2014, reports say, and had served time in Israeli jails for other attacks.The Times of Israel says he was also one of the Hamas officials most closely connected to Iran and Hezbollah.","A drone strike in Beirut’s southern suburbs of Dahiyeh, a Hezbollah stronghold, killed senior Hamas official Saleh al-Arouri on Tuesday. The drone hit a Hamas office, leaving six people dead, Lebanon’s state news agency reported. Hamas confirmed the death of al-Arouri and called it a “cowardly assassination” by Israel, adding that attacks on Palestinians “inside and outside Palestine will not succeed in breaking the will and steadfastness of our people, or undermining the continuation of their valiant resistance”. “It proves once again the abject failure of this enemy to achieve any of its aggressive goals in the Gaza Strip,” the group said. Following the news of the death of al-Arouri, mosques in Arura, the occupied West Bank town of north Ramallah, are mourning his death and a general strike has been called in Ramallah for Wednesday. Here is what to know about the Hamas official killed in Lebanon. Al-Arouri, 57, was the deputy chief of Hamas’s political bureau and one of the founders of the group’s armed wing, the Qassam Brigades. He had been living in exile in Lebanon after spending 15 years in an Israeli jail. Before the war began on October 7, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had threatened to kill him. In recent weeks, al-Arouri took on the role of spokesperson for the group and told Al Jazeera last month that Hamas would not discuss an exchange deal for the captives the group is holding before the war ends in Gaza. The United States labelled al-Arouri as a “global terrorist” in 2015 and issued a $5m reward for any information on him. While there has been no official response from Israel about the death of the Hamas official, Mark Regev, an adviser to Netanyahu, told the US outlet MSNBC that Israel does not take responsibility for this attack. But, added, “Whoever did it, it must be clear: this was not an attack on the Lebanese state.” “Whoever did this did a surgical strike against the Hamas leadership,” he said. However, Danny Danon, a former Israeli envoy to the United Nations, hailed the attack and congratulated the Israeli army, Shin Bet, the security service and Mossad, Israel’s intelligence agency, for killing al-Arouri. “Anyone who was involved in the 7/10 massacre should know that we will reach out to them and close an account with them,” he said on X in Hebrew, referring to the October 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel that killed nearly 1,200 people. Israel’s relentless bombing and artillery shelling of Gaza since then has killed more than 22,000 Palestinians, including more than 8,000 children. According to Israeli media, the government has ordered cabinet ministers not to give any interviews about al-Arouri’s death after Danon’s tweet. Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned the attack on the Beruit suburb and said it was a “new Israeli crime” as well as an attempt to pull Lebanon into the war. Mikati also warned against the “Israeli political upper echelon resorting to exporting its failures in Gaza to the southern border to impose new facts on the ground and change the rules of engagement”. Hezbollah said that the attack on Lebanon’s capital “will not pass without punishment”."
Netanyahu says Israel 'not successful' at minimising Gaza casualties but blames Hamas,Israel ‘not successful’ in minimising Gaza civilian casualties: Netanyahu,0.7319386897539032,2023-11-17,2023-11-17,"Israel's prime minister has said it is trying to minimise civilian casualties in the war in Gaza but has been ""not successful"", blaming this on Hamas.In an interview with CBS News, Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas was firing at Palestinians trying to get safety.Hamas ""don't give a hoot about the Palestinians"", he said.More than 11,500 people have been killed in Gaza, Hamas's health ministry says, since Israel went to war after Hamas's deadly attack on 7 October.Some 1,200 people were killed and about 240 were taken back to Gaza as hostages when Hamas gunmen burst through the border and attacked Israeli communities and military bases.Several of the missing people have since been confirmed dead, with Hamas blaming Israeli air strikes, although the claim cannot be independently verified.Mr Netanyahu told the BBC's US partner CBS that Israel would ""try to finish the job"" of wiping out Hamas in Gaza with minimal civilian casualties.He said: ""That's what we're trying to do: minimal civilian casualties. But unfortunately, we're not successful.""Mr Netanyahu said the Israeli military dropped leaflets urging people to leave certain areas and called civilians on their mobile phones warning them to leave but claimed Hamas was preventing this ""at gun point"".""Any civilian death is a tragedy. And we shouldn't have any because we're doing everything we can to get the civilians out of harm's way, while Hamas is doing everything to keep them in harm's way,"" he said.He added Hamas had ""fired at the safe corridors that we provided for the Palestinians"".Addressing Israel's military raids on Al-Shifa hospital - the biggest medical facility in Gaza - Mr Netanyahu said there were ""strong indications"" that Israeli hostages were being held there and this was ""one of the reasons we entered"".He said there were no hostages at the hospital when forces entered the hospital on Wednesday, claiming: ""If there were [hostages], they were taken out.""Israel said it has further intelligence about those being held, but Mr Netanyahu said ""the less I say about it, the better"".Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of housing a major base underneath Al-Shifa - something which Hamas and hospital authorities have always denied.Mr Netanyahu did not elaborate on what information Israel had to suggest that hostages had been held at Al-Shifa.But he said Israel had ""concrete evidence"" that there were ""terrorist chieftains and terrorists"" in the hospital who he said had fled as Israel's forces entered.""Hamas was using the patients in that hospital as a human shield,"" he said.Mr Netanyahu said Israel had warned the hospital authorities it was going to enter the facility and to move patients out of the way, adding they were ""doing this very gingerly"" because they were trying to ""do the moral thing"".Israel's military said its soldiers had found the bodies of two hostages - 65-year-old Yehudit Weiss and 19-year-old soldier Noa Marciano - in the vicinity of the hospital.","The Israeli military is doing all it can to get civilians out of harm’s way amid its war in Gaza, but its attempts to minimise casualties are “not successful,” said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The Israeli leader’s comments came after he was asked by US television channel CBS News on Thursday whether the killing of thousands of Palestinians in retaliation for the October 7 attack by Hamas would fuel hatred in a new generation. “Any civilian death is a tragedy. And we shouldn’t have any because we’re doing everything we can to get the civilians out of harm’s way, while Hamas is doing everything to keep them in harm’s way,” Netanyahu said. “So, we send leaflets, [we] call them on their cell phones, and we say: ‘leave’. And many have left,” Netanyahu said. The same day, Israel’s air force dropped leaflets in parts of south Gaza telling people to evacuate for their own safety. It was not clear where they were supposed to evacuate to as Israel continues to wage war across the besieged territory. Weeks earlier, Israel also used leaflet drops in northern Gaza to warn civilians to move to the south. Hundreds of thousands have done so, in a mass displacement that many Palestinians fear could become permanent.    Israel has said the goal of its military campaign is to destroy Hamas. “The other thing that I can say is that we’ll try to finish that job with minimal civilian casualties. That’s what we’re trying to do: minimal civilian casualties. But unfortunately, we’re not successful,” the Israeli prime minister said. Netanyahu then said he wanted to draw a parallel with something related to Germany, but he was interrupted by the CBS interviewer, who asked him a question about Gaza’s post-war security. Palestinian civilians have borne the brunt of Israel’s weeks-long military campaign, which has come in response to the attack by Hamas that Israel says killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Hamas also took about 240 people of different nationalities as captives, according to Israel. On Friday, the Israeli military said it had retrieved the body of one of the captives, a female soldier, from a building near Gaza’s al-Shifa Hospital which has become the main focus of the Israeli assault this week. The soldier’s death was confirmed on Tuesday after Hamas issued a video of her alive, followed by images of what the group said was her body after she was killed in an Israeli air strike.    The Israeli military claimed to have found a tunnel shaft used by Hamas at al-Shifa Hospital. A video, which could not immediately be verified, showed a deep hole in the ground, surrounded by rubble, wood, and sand. It appeared the area had been excavated; a bulldozer appeared in the background. The army said its troops also found a vehicle in the hospital containing a large number of weapons. Hamas said in a statement on Thursday evening that claims by the Pentagon and US State Department that the group uses al-Shifa for military purposes “is a repetition of a blatantly false narrative, demonstrated by the weak and ridiculous performances of the occupation army spokesman”. The United States is confident in an assessment from its own intelligence agencies on Hamas activities in al-Shifa Hospital and will neither share nor elaborate on it, White House spokesperson John Kirby said on Thursday. Human Rights Watch said hospitals have special protections under international humanitarian law. “Hospitals only lose those protections if it can be shown that harmful acts have been carried out from the premises,” the watchdog’s UN Director Louis Charbonneau said. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, on his first visit to Israel since the October 7 Hamas attack, called on Israel to do more to protect civilians in Gaza. “I understand your rage but let me ask you not to be consumed by rage,” Borrell said. Gaza health authorities deemed reliable by the United Nations say at least 11,500 people have been confirmed killed in an Israeli bombardment and ground invasion – more than 4,700 of them children. Two-thirds of the Gaza Strip’s population of 2.3 million has been made homeless by the war."
"Israel losing global support over Gaza bombing, Biden says",Biden warns Israel risks losing support over ‘indiscriminate’ Gaza bombing,0.731468414954457,2023-12-12,2023-12-12,"US President Joe Biden has said Israel is starting to lose global support over its ""indiscriminate bombing"" of Gaza.His comments, made to donors at a fundraising event on Tuesday, marked his strongest criticism yet of Israel's leadership. Mr Biden has offered unwavering public support to the country since Hamas launched its attacks on 7 October.And while he reiterated that Israel could count on US backing, he issued a direct warning to its government.""Israel's security can rest on the United States, but right now it has more than the United States. It has the European Union, it has Europe, it has most of the world,"" he told donors to his 2024 re-election campaign in Washington.""But they're starting to lose that support by indiscriminate bombing that takes place,"" he said.Mr Biden, however, added that there was ""no question about the need to take on Hamas"" and Israel had ""every right"" to do so.The US leader has faced growing pressure, including from within his own Democratic Party, to rein in Israel's military campaign. His remarks align with his administration's recent approach to the war, with officials urging Israel to ""put a premium on human life"" and give clearer instructions to allow people to avoid the conflict.Senior US officials have also displayed increasing discontent at Israel's military response.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has said more than 18,400 people have been killed by Israeli bombing since 7 October, when Hamas broke through Israel's heavily guarded perimeter and killed 1,200 people.In a statement later on Tuesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had received the ""full backing"" of the US for its ground war as well as its goal of destroying Hamas and recovering hostages.He added that Washington had blocked ""international pressure to stop the war"".""Yes, there is disagreement about 'the day after Hamas' and I hope that we will reach [an] agreement here as well,"" he said.Mr Biden alluded to the pair's disagreement in his comments on Tuesday and said Mr Netanyahu had to ""change"" his government as well as his stance on a two-state solution, which top US officials have been promoting as the post-war path.That proposal is favoured by the international community to end the decades-long conflict, and would lead to the creation of an independent Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank existing alongside Israel.""This is the most conservative government in Israel's history,"" Mr Biden said. ""This government in Israel is making it very difficult for him. They don't want a two-state solution.""His comments reflect the emerging disagreements about what direction to take after the war. Mr Netanyahu has said he opposes US calls to have the Palestinian Authority, which currently administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, take over control of Gaza.While Mr Biden's words were his bluntest yet, senior American officials have increasingly expressed discontent with Israel's military campaign.Secretary of State Antony Blinken said just days ago that there was a ""gap"" between pledges by Israeli authorities to spare civilians in Gaza and the reality on the ground.","US President Joe Bidenhas warned that Israel risks losing international support over its “indiscriminate bombing” of civilians in its war against Hamas in the besieged Gaza Strip. “Israel’s security can rest on the United States, but right now it has more than the United States. It has the European Union, it has Europe, it has most of the world supporting them,” Biden said to donors during a fundraiser on Tuesday. “They’re starting to lose that support by indiscriminate bombing that takes place,” Biden said. More than 18,000 people have been killed and nearly 50,000 others wounded in the Israeli assault on Gaza since October 7, according to the Palestinian health officials. Many more dead are uncounted under the rubble or beyond the reach of ambulances. Israel launched its onslaught in response to a raid by Hamas fighters from Gaza who killed about 1,200 people and took 240 others captive in southern Israel, according to Israeli authorities. Speaking at a political fundraiser, Biden also criticised the Israeli cabinet. “This is the most conservative government in Israel’s history,” the president said. “He [Netanyahu] has to change this government. This government in Israel is making it very difficult.” He also said that Israel “can’t say no” to a Palestinian state, which Israeli hardliners, including in Netanyahu’s government, have opposed. Biden’s sharp comments coincided with White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan preparing to travel to Israel for talks with the Israeli war cabinet. Netanyahu said in a statement on Tuesday that Israel had received “full backing” from the US for its ground offensive on Gaza and that Washington had blocked “international pressure to stop the war.” “There is disagreement about ‘the day after Hamas’ and I hope that we will reach agreement here as well,” he added. Washington has said it envisions an eventual return by the Palestinian Authority to Gaza, which Hamas seized from the West Bank-based body in 2007.    The comments came before the UN General Assembly was expected to vote on a call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, after the US vetoed a draft resolution in the Security Council last week. In October the General Assembly had called for “an immediate, durable and sustained humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities” in a resolution adopted with 121 votes in favour, 14 against – including the US – and 44 abstentions. Some diplomats predict the resolution on Tuesday would garner greater support than the previous motion. “The US is looking more and more isolated on the international arena and that is not a good place for the United Nations and President Biden to be,” Salman Shaikh, a policy adviser at The Shaikh Group told Al Jazeera. Canada, Australia and New Zealand issued support for a ceasefire in Gaza in a joint statement on Tuesday.    In Gaza, Israeli shelling targeted both ahospitaland anUNWRA schoolin northern Gaza. In Khan Younis, southern Gaza’s main city, residents said Israeli tank shelling was now focused on the city centre. United Nations human rights chief Volker Turk described the situation in Gaza as “well beyond breakdown”, and another UN agency said that 18 percent of Gaza’s infrastructure had been destroyed since the war began. “If you look at the humanitarian situation at the moment, it is so precarious … extremely precarious,” Turk said. “It’s on the verge of well beyond breakdown.” The UN’s satellite analysis agency UNOSAT examined high-resolution satellite images to determine that nearly 40,000 buildings have been destroyed in the besieged enclave, with 80 percent of the damage in northern Gaza."
Ahed Tamimi: Israeli forces arrest Palestinian activist in West Bank,Israel arrests Palestinian activist Ahed Tamimi in occupied West Bank raids,0.7257971043997413,2023-11-06,2023-11-06,"The prominent Palestinian activist Ahed Tamimi has been arrested by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank.Ms Tamimi, 22, was detained overnight in the village of Nabi Saleh, the Palestinian Prisoners' Society said.Israel's military told AFP news agency she was suspected of ""inciting violence and terrorist activities"".Israeli media reported that Ms Tamimi was arrested in connection with a post on Instagram that threatened to ""slaughter"" Jewish settlers.""[By comparison] you will say that what Hitler did to you was a joke,"" she is purported to have written, referring to the mass murder of six million Jews in the Holocaust by Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany, according to the newspaper Haaretz. The post is no longer visible online, nor is the account carrying Ms Tamimi's name and photo where it was published last week. Israel's far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, posted a photograph on X, formerly known as Twitter, that appeared to show an Israeli soldier restraining Ahed Tamimi in a bedroom. He accused her of expressing ""sympathy and support for the Nazi human beings on social media"" and vowed: ""Zero tolerance with terrorists and supporters of terrorism!""However, Ms Tamimi's mother, Nariman, denied that she wrote the post.""There are dozens of [online] pages in Ahed's name with her photo, with which she has no connection,"" she told AFP.Ahed Tamimi became an international symbol of resistance to Israel's occupation as a teenager. In 2015, the then-14-year-old was photographed biting an Israeli soldier who was trying to detain her younger brother.  Two years later, she was arrested after being filmed slapping and kicking an Israeli soldier during a confrontation outside her home. An Israeli court subsequently sentenced her to eight months in prison.The Palestinian Prisoners' Society said Ms Tamimi was one of at least 70 Palestinians arrested in Israeli raids across the West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem on Sunday night.That raised to 2,150 the total reportedly detained there since 7 October, when Hamas gunmen from the Gaza Strip carried out an unprecedented attack on Israel in which 1,400 people were killed and 240 were taken hostage.Israel has bombarded Gaza continuously since then and sent in ground forces more than a week ago with the aim of destroying Hamas. More than 9,700 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.The West Bank has seen an alarming surge in violence at the same time.According to the UN, 141 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces, most of them during confrontations that followed Israeli search-and-arrest raids or during protests in solidarity with Gaza. It says eight others have been killed by Israeli settlers, who human rights groups have accused of escalating a campaign of violent attacks on Palestinian communities. Two Israelis have been killed by Palestinians over the same period.Some 600,000 Jews live in 140 settlements built since Israel's occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war. Most of the international community considers the settlements illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.","Israeli forces have arrested Ahed Tamimi, a prominent 22-year-old Palestinian activist, for “inciting terrorism”. They announced the arrest on Monday following another round of overnight raids and fighting in the occupied West Bank. Violence has been spilling over into the territory since the start of the Israel-Hamas war last month. Al Jazeera correspondent Zein Basravi reported multiple raids by the Israeli army across the West Bank, including in the village of Nabi Saleh, near Ramallah, whereAhed Tamimiwas arrested. The activist “was arrested on suspicion of inciting violence and terrorist activities”, an army spokesperson said. “Tamimi was transferred to Israeli security forces for further questioning.” Nariman Tamimi, the activist’s mother, told Anadolu news agency that Israeli forces had searched the house and confiscated the mobile phones of the family members. Her father Bassem Tamimi was arrested by Israeli forces during a raid in the town last week, with no information of his whereabouts. Israeli media reported that Ahed Tamimi had called for the murder of settlers in the West Bank in an Instagram post. An Israeli security source shared the alleged Instagram post with AFP when questioned about the reason for her arrest. However, Nariman denied that her daughter wrote the post. “There are dozens of (online) pages in Ahed’s name with her photo, with which she has no connection,” she said. The Israeli army celebrated Ahed Tamimi’s arrest, publishing a picture on Facebook and asking: “Where is her smile now?” Tamimi and her family members are well-known activists and have led Nabi Saleh’s non-violent resistance for nearly a decade. Her father has been arrested numerous times by Israeli forces and has spent at least four years in prison. Ahed Tamimi became an icon of Palestinian resistance since a video of her 2012 confrontation with an Israeli soldier, who had arrived at the family house to arrest her brother, went viral. She was previously arrested by the Israeli army in December 2017 following further confrontations, alongside her mother and 20-year-old cousin Nour. Indicted on 12 charges, including assault, incitement and past instances of stone-throwing, she was jailed for eight months. Ahed Tamimi’s arrest came amid another night of Israeli raids and fighting in the occupied West Bank, with the occupying forces intensifying nightly raids on Palestinian homes, villages and cities in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. Reporting from Ramallah, Basravi said it was a hectic night, with multiple cities across the West Bank witnessing raids and open clashes between the army and armed Palestinian fighters. Footage showed roads and cars destroyed. At the Shuafat refugee camp, one of the largest military raids took place. It is known to be home to several Palestinian armed groups. The Israeli army arrested an adviser to the Palestinian Authority (PA) government and Fatah member Rafat Alian was detained during a live interview. Israel has arrested about 1,740 Palestinians inovernight raidsin the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem since October 7. Most are being held under laws and military orders that allow detention without trial or charge."
Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah makes first speech on Israel-Gaza war,Hezbollah’s Hassan Nasrallah speech on Israel-Hamas war: Key takeaways,0.7152330397934514,2023-11-03,2023-11-03,"Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the Lebanese Shia Islamist group Hezbollah, is addressing his followers in his first public comments since the Israel-Hamas war broke out.The speech is likely to indicate the group's next moves, as its fighters and the Israeli army are engaged in intense attacks on the Lebanon-Israel border.This has raised fears the area could become another front in the conflict.So far, however, the violence has largely been contained.Since Hamas carried out the 7 October attacks on Israel, killing more than 1,400 people, Lebanon has been on edge, closely watching Hezbollah. The group has intensified its attacks on Israel, which is retaliating. But both sides have apparently taken steps to avoid a dangerous escalation, and most strikes have been limited to the border area.This, however, could change. Israel is pushing ahead with its ground invasion of Gaza, with the goal of eliminating Hamas, while the number of Palestinians killed in the territory has passed 9,000, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Hamas, meanwhile, has repeatedly urged its allies to join the fight, and many wonder whether Hezbollah will answer those calls.Hezbollah - which, like Hamas, is considered a terrorist organisation by the UK, the US and others - is the largest political and military force in Lebanon. This means the group's decisions reverberate far beyond its support base, and many here and elsewhere are anxiously waiting for Nasrallah's speech - followers and foes.Nasrallah's whereabouts, as ever, remain a mystery. His address will be broadcast in public screenings organised by the group across the country, and is being framed by Hezbollah as a significant moment. They took the unusual step of announcing it five days in advance and, earlier this week, released dramatic short videos featuring Nasrallah, fuelling the expectation of a major announcement.Many in Lebanon still remember the devastating month-long war Hezbollah fought against Israel in 2006, and worry that the group may drag the country into another conflict. One of Hezbollah's aims is the destruction of Israel, which sees the group as a more formidable enemy than Hamas. Hezbollah has a vast arsenal of weapons that includes precision-guided missiles that can strike deep into Israeli territory, and tens of thousands of well-trained, battle-hardened fighters.The Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has promised a response of ""unimaginable"" magnitude if Hezbollah opens a second front in the conflict. And the US, which reportedly urged Israel to not launch a large-scale attack on the group, has sent two aircraft carriers to the eastern Mediterranean to prevent the spread of the conflict.A full-scale war would be disastrous for Lebanon, and there is little public support for it outside Hezbollah's followers. The country is suffering from years of economic crisis, and political impasse has left it without a properly functioning government. Another scenario - perhaps the most likely, some observers say - is an increase of the group's attacks, signalling a response to Hamas's calls, while keeping the fighting limited to northern Israel.The Biden administration is also, in public and through back-channels, warning Iran against escalating the situation. Iran supports the so-called Axis of Resistance, an alliance that includes Hezbollah - its most important force - as well as militias in Iraq, Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, the Houthis in Yemen, and Hamas.It is not clear how much direct influence Tehran has over the groups, but it is unlikely that they take any major decisions without Iran's blessing. On Sunday, the Iranian President, Ebrahim Raisi, said Israel's ""crimes had crossed the red lines, which may force everyone to take action"". Washington, he added, ""asks us to not do anything, but they keep giving widespread support to Israel"". A source close to Hezbollah told me, on condition of anonymity, last week, that Nasrallah - who is known for his angry anti-Israeli and anti-American speeches - was closely monitoring the situation and remained in constant contact with the group's military leadership, despite his public silence.""Hezbollah is following all details,"" the source said. ""They make calculations all the time.""

Fighting between Hezbollah and Israelhas escalated along their fraught border in recent weeks. The Lebanese armed group claims to have lost 57 fighters while Israel says that six of its soldiers have been killed in their exchange of fire and missiles. At least six civilians have also been killed. Many expected Nasrallah to announce the group’s next moves, but he refrained from doing so, instead condemning the Israeli attacks Gaza. Here are the key highlights from his address: Nasrallahbegan the speechby praising “the fallen martyrs” of Hezbollah and the other groups fighting Israel, as well as the civilians killed. He then also thanked the “strong and brave Iraqi and Yemeni hands who are now involved in this holy war,” in an apparent reference to armed groups in the two countries — including theHouthis in Yemen— who are allies of Hezbollah and have launched attacks against Israel or the United States in recent days. He described the October 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel, in which more than 1,400 people were killed, as “a big event to shake this oppressive … occupying, usurping Zionist regime and its supporters in Washington and London”. He said the “operation was 100 percent Palestinian in terms of both decision and execution.” “That element of secrecy was the linchpin to this emphatic success of the operation, it came as a surprise, shocking surprise, unlike what’s assumed by many.” “This operation has no bearing on any decision or move to be taken by any other faction within the resistance axis,” Nasrallah said, referring to the Iran-led coalition of anti-Israel forces in the region. “At any point of time when there is a battle, they start to speak about the Iranian nuclear programme, the US-Iran negotiations,” Nasrallah said. In reality, he claimed, “the secrecy surrounding the entire operation” on October 7 proved that the attack was solely about the Palestinian cause, and unrelated “to any international or regional issue”. “Since the Iranian revolution … [Iran has] always been openly adopting and supporting resistance factions in Lebanon, Palestine and in the region. However, they do not exercise any form of authority or control over these factions or in their leadership. And what happened … proves this fact.” Nasrallah also blamed the US for the continuing violence in Gaza. “Gaza and the Gazans have been reeling under the brunt of barbaric, ferocious, brutal, ruthless, merciless aerial bombardments,” he said. He accused the US of remaining “silent” in the face of “the imagesof thousands of babies and childrentorn apart in Gaza as a result of the Israeli missiles”. Nasrallah said the US response exposed the West’s “hypocrisy” on issues like democracy and the rule of law. “We’re living in a jungle. We all must establish this fact. The United States is totally responsible for the war raging in Gaza, against unarmed defenceless people,” he said.    Nasrallah said that Hezbollah entered “the war” the day after the Hamas attack happened. “Some claim that we are about to engage in the war. I am telling you, we have been engaged in this battle since October 8,” Nasrallah said. “The Islamic resistance in Lebanon started operation the very next day.” “What’s taking place on our front is very important and significant,” said Nasrallah, claiming that the conflict on the border with Israel was the hottest it had been since 1948. “Yet I assure you this will not be the end. This will not be sufficient.”    Nasrallah also made a call to other Arab countries to help Gaza. “We are calling on the Arab and Muslim states to cut off oil and gas and food supplies from Israel,” Nasrallah said, echoing a demand made by Iran earlier this week. He said that he hoped that “at a point of time, the whole humanity will listen to the sound of reason”."
Rashida Tlaib censured over Israel-Gaza comments,US House votes to censure Rashida Tlaib over Israel-Hamas war comments,0.7090959178688138,2023-11-08,2023-11-08,"The US Congress has voted to censure its only Palestinian-American member over comments she made on the Israel-Gaza war.Michigan Democrat Rashida Tlaib was rebuked for her defence of the chant ""from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free"".The resolution formally condemned her for ""calling for the destruction of the state of Israel"".The measure passed by 234 to 188 votes. Twenty-two Democrats voted to censure.Ms Tlaib posted a video to Twitter on Friday that included a clip of protestors using the chant, which critics say calls for Palestinian control of all land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, including Israel. The video also accused President Joe Biden of supporting genocide in Gaza and called for a ceasefire.The Anti-Defamation League and Jewish groups say the slogan, used at protests around the world, is a call for the destruction of Israel.Pro-Palestinian activists argue that most people using it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the elimination of Israel itself.Ms Tlaib later defended her use of the slogan, calling it ""an aspirational call for freedom, human rights and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction, or hate."" The comment stirred up cross-party condemnation and criticism from allies in her own state, prompting two separate measures seeking to censure her.Republican Representative Rich McCormick, who represents Georgia, introduced a resolution on Monday, accusing Ms Tlaib of ""calling for the destruction of the state of Israel and dangerously promoting false narratives"" about Hamas's attack on Israel.Twenty-two Democrats joined the vast majority of Republicans voting for Ms Tlaib's censure.After the vote, Ms Tlaib told the house that her comments were directed at the Israeli government.""I can't believe I have to say this, but Palestinian people are not disposable. We are human beings, just like anyone else,"" she said.More than 1,400 Israelis were killed in the 7 October attack by Hamas. The Hamas-run health ministry says that more than 10,300 Palestinians have since been killed in Israeli attacks.The Biden administration has dismissed calls for a ceasefire in favour of a humanitarian pause to allow aid, food and water into Gaza.","The United States House of Representatives has voted to censure Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian American in Congress, over her comments on the Israel-Hamas war. The House voted 234 to 188 on Tuesday night to censure the three-term Democratic congresswoman from Michigan. Some 22 members of her own party joined the Republicans in backing a resolution that claimed Tlaib had been “promoting false narratives regarding the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel and for calling for the destruction of the state of Israel”. The punishment is one step below expulsion and follows a failed censure resolution last week. More than 10,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel began itsbombardment of Gazaa month ago after the armed group Hamas killed at least 1,400 people and took more than 200 captive in an attack on Israel. The US, long Israel’s most fervent supporter, has resisted calls for a ceasefire, despite growing global anger over the humanitarian crisis in the densely-populated territory of 2.3 million people. While criticising the Israeli response and US support for it, Tlaib has also repeatedly condemned Hamas’s assault. Ahead of the vote, defended her position saying she would “not be silenced” or allow her words to be distorted. With some progressive Democrat colleagues by her side, she stressed her criticism had always been directed towards the Israeli government and its leadership under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “It is important to separate people and government,” she said. “The idea that criticising the government of Israel is anti-Semitic sets a very dangerous precedent. And it’s been used to silence diverse voices speaking up for human rights across our nation.” The debate on the censure resolution, introduced by Rich McCormick, a Republican from Georgia, was emotional and intense, with some representatives focusing on the slogan “from the river to the sea“, which Tlaib has used frequently, calling it an “aspirational call for freedom, human rights and peaceful coexistence”. As she defended her position, Tlaib was overcome. “Palestinian people are not disposable,” she said, taking a long pause. Her grandmother lives in a village in the occupied West Bank. Brad Schneider, a Jewish Democrat from Illinois, said he believed it was important to debate what the words meant. “It is nothing else but the call for the destruction of Israel and murder of Jews,” he said. “I will always defend the right to free speech. Tlaib has the right to say whatever she wants.” He added, “But it cannot go unanswered.” It was unclear if Schneider supported the resolution’s final passage. Other Democrats warned of the risks to free speech from the censure and the precedent it would set. “This resolution not only degrades our constitution, but it cheapens the meaning of discipline in this body for people who actually commit wrongful actions like bribery, fraud, violent assault and so on,” said Jamie Raskin, who defended Tlaib against the resolution. Lawmakers who are censured are asked to stand on the floor of the House as the censure resolution is read aloud to them. With the vote, Tlaib will become the second Muslim-American woman in Congress after Ilhan Omar to be formally admonished this year over criticism of Israel. Republicans voted in February toremoveOmar from the House Foreign Affairs Committee."
US launches fourth round of strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen,US launches new strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen,0.7064739255632417,2024-01-18,2024-01-18,"The US has carried out a fourth round of strikes on Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen, Pentagon officials confirmed on Wednesday night. Some 14 Houthi missiles, which the US says may have been intended for attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, were targeted by American forces. Centcom - the US Middle East command - said the sites were struck by Tomahawk missiles fired from US Navy vessels.The strikes come as the US designated the Houthis as ""global terrorists"".US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said the move, which reversed a decision to remove the designation in the early days of the Biden administration, was in response to the militants' ongoing attacks on commercial shipping in the region.The Houthis began attacking merchant vessels in November, saying they were responding to Israel's military operation in Gaza. Since then, the group has launched dozens of attacks on commercial tankers passing through the Red Sea, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes.In response, the US and UK launched a wave of air strikes against dozens of Houthi targets on 11 January. The strikes - supported by Australia, Bahrain, the Netherlands and Canada - began after Houthi forces ignored an ultimatum to cease their attacks in the region.Wednesday's strikes on Houthi targets followed further attacks on commercial shipping. Hours earlier, the group struck a US owned and operated vessel for the second time this week. The rebels used a one-way drone to target the M/V Genco Picardy in the Gulf of Aden, Centcom said. The ship suffered some damage, but no crew members were injured in the attack. On Monday, the Houthis hit another US vessel with a ballistic missile, in what appeared to be the group's first successful attack on an American ship since their campaign began. US officials said Wednesday's strikes were pre-emptive, and destroyed weapons which were due to be fired imminently by the militants. ""These missiles on launch rails presented an imminent threat to merchant vessels and US Navy ships in the region and could have been fired at any time, prompting US forces to exercise their inherent right and obligation to defend themselves,"" Centcom said in a statement. ""These strikes, along with other actions we have taken, will degrade the Houthi's capabilities to continue their reckless attacks on international and commercial shipping in the Red Sea, the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, and the Gulf of Aden,"" the statement added. The UK's ministry of defence told the BBC that it was not involved in the latest wave of strikes. Centcom's commander, Gen Micheal Kurilla, said the US would continue to take action against the Houthis as long as its fighters ""continue to endanger international mariners and disrupt the commercial shipping lanes in the Southern Red Sea and adjacent waterways"". Yemen has been devastated by a civil war that escalated in 2015, when the Houthis seized control of large parts of the west of the country from the internationally recognised government and a Saudi-led coalition intervened in an effort to restore its rule.The fighting has reportedly left more than 160,000 people dead and triggered one of the world's worst humanitarian crises, with two thirds of the population - 21 million people - in need of some form of aid.","The United States military says its forces launched strikes on 14 Houthi missiles “that were loaded to be fired” from Yemen in the fourth day of direct attacks on the Iran-aligned group in less than a week. The missiles posed a threat to commercial ships and US Navy vessels in the region, the US Central Command (CENTCOM) said on Wednesday. The group, which controls most of Yemen and has been attacking ships in the region since November, said it will not stop its strikes on shipping routes despite increasing assaults by the US military. “We will not give up targeting Israeli ships or ships heading towards ports in occupied Palestine … in support of the Palestinian people,” the group’s spokesperson, Mohammed Abdelsalam, told Al Jazeera on Thursday. “These missiles on launch rails … could have been fired at any time, prompting U.S. forces to exercise their inherent right and obligation to defend themselves,” CENTCOM said on X. The strikes are meant to degrade the Houthis’ “capabilities to continue their reckless attacks on international and commercial shipping in the Red Sea, the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, and the Gulf of Aden”, it added. U.S. CENTCOM Strikes Houthi Terrorist Missile Launchers In the context of ongoing multi-national efforts to protect freedom of navigation and prevent attacks on U.S. and partner maritime traffic in the Red Sea, on Jan. 17 at approximately 11:59 p.m. (Sanaa time), U.S. Central…pic.twitter.com/MMCQbzr1f7 — U.S. Central Command (@CENTCOM)January 18, 2024  The Houthi-controlled Saba news agency said the US and the United Kingdom launched the strikes in the provinces of Hodeidah, Taiz, Dhamar, al-Bayda and Saada overnight. However, CENTCOM did not mention any involvement of the UK in the latest attacks. “It is an open war, and they must endure the earth-shattering, powerful, and crushing strikes and responses, God willing,” Houthi official Ali al-Qahoum wrote on X after the latest strikes. The US on Wednesdayredesignated the Yemeni group as a “terrorist” organisationin response to its continuing attacks and threats to shipping and imposed sanctions on it. The designation does not go into effect for 30 days. The Houthis said the designation will not affect its operations to prevent Israeli ships or vessels heading to Israel from crossing the Red Sea, the Arabian Sea and the Bab al-Mandeb Strait. Rights advocates and analysts say the US move maynegatively affect Yemeni civilians. The Houthis, who support the Palestinian armed group Hamas, launched their attacks in response toIsrael’s war on Gaza. Their strikes have slowed trade between Asia and Europe and alarmed major world powers. Earlier on Wednesday, CENTCOM said a drone launched from areas controlled by the Houthi rebels in Yemen struck the US-owned ship Genco Picardy in the Gulf of Aden. It inflicted some damage, but no injuries, it said.   "
ICJ says Israel must prevent genocide in Gaza,ICJ rules Israel must prevent acts of genocide in Gaza: Key takeaways,0.7059838812418912,2024-01-26,2024-01-26,"The UN's top court has ordered Israel to take all measures to prevent genocidal acts in Gaza, but stopped short of telling it to halt the war.The highly anticipated hearing was part of a controversial case brought by South Africa.South Africa had asked the court to order Israel to stop military action straight away pending a decision on whether Israel has committed genocide.Israel has vehemently rejected the accusation as ""wholly unfounded"".Friday's hearing at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) at The Hague was the first time the judges have issued a ruling as part of the case which began two weeks ago. A verdict on the central allegation of genocide is expected to take much longer, possibly years.Although the court did not call for a halt to Israel's military action, as South Africa had asked it to do, it is being interpreted as a victory for those who support South Africa's case. The ICJ found it did have jurisdiction on the matter, and decided there was a plausible case under the 1948 Genocide Convention, and that the Palestinian population in Gaza was at real risk of irreparable damage.""For the implementation of the international rule of law, the [ICJ's] decision is a momentous one,"" said South Africa in a statement. It called Friday's ruling a ""significant milestone in the search for justice for the Palestinian people"".The Palestinian foreign minister said the ruling showed that ""no state is above the law"", adding it ""should serve as a wake-up call for Israel and actors who enabled its entrenched impunity"".Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not address the ruling directly but said ""Israel's commitment to international law is unwavering. Equally unwavering is our sacred commitment to defend our country."" He said South Africa's allegation that Israel was committing genocide was ""not only false, it's outrageous, and decent people everywhere should reject it"".Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant dismissed the ruling, saying Israel ""does not need to be lectured on morality in order to distinguish between terrorists and the civilian population in Gaza"".A spokesman for Hamas, the Palestinian group whose unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October triggered the war, called the outcome ""important"", saying it contributed to ""isolating Israel"", Reuters news agency reported. The ICJ ordered Israel to take a series of measures against potentially genocidal acts against Palestinians in Gaza. These include measures not only on the battlefield but also against public incitement to genocide. It also ordered Israel to take ""immediate and effective measures"" to enable the provision of aid to people in Gaza.The court said Israel must report on its compliance to the court within one month.Although orders issued by the ICJ are legally binding, it does not have the power to enforce them. Israel is not expected to commit itself to the orders.More than 26,000 Palestinians - mostly women and children - have been killed in Gaza by Israel's bombardment since 7 October, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. Israel launched its offensive after waves of Hamas gunmen burst through the border early that day, killing about 1,200 people - mainly civilians - and taking about 250 others back to Gaza as hostages.Correction 13th February: This article wrongly reported that about 1,300 people had been killed following the 7th October attack by Hamas. This was based on counting those who later died from their injuries in addition to the figure of more than 1,200. The article has been amended to now refer to about 1,200 deaths, a figure which includes those deaths and which Israel says is not final.","The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has delivered its highly anticipated interim ruling in South Africa’s case against Israel over alleged genocidal acts in Gaza. Here are thehighlightsof the provisional measures ordered on Friday by the court in a case that has drawn global interest: The World Court ordered Israel to take action to prevent acts of genocide as it wages war against the Hamas group in the Gaza Strip. In the ruling, 15 of the 17 judges on the ICJ voted for emergency measures that covered most of what South African had asked for, with the notable exception of ordering a halt to Israeli military action in Gaza. Israel’s military operation has laid waste to much of the densely populated enclave and killed more than 26,000 Palestinians in nearly four months, according to Gaza health authorities. The war has now carried on for more than 100 days since Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, killing 1,139 people and taking 240 captive. The court stopped short of calling for an immediate ceasefire. Less than two years ago in March 2022, it had ordered Russia to halt its war on Ukraine after Kyiv took Moscow to the ICJ. On Friday, the ICJ refrained from repeating the interim measures it had ordered against Russia — which Moscow has ignored. South African Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor, who was at the court when the judges delivered their ruling, said she had been “hoping” for the provisional measures to include the order of a ceasefire. But Pandor also argued that she did not see how Israel could implement the measures directed by the ICJ without a ceasefire.  Israel had insisted in its arguments this month that the ICJ did not have jurisdiction in the case. But on Friday, Judge Joan Donoghue, the president of the ICJ, said the court had concluded that it could rule on the matter and specifically that it could order provisional measures. She highlighted South Africa’s prior public statements suggesting that Israel might have violated its commitments under the 1948 Genocide Convention. Additionally, Donoghue pointed out that Israel has consistently rejected any allegations of genocide in Gaza. She highlighted the opposing positions held by the involved parties to underline that a dispute exists between the two parties. Donoghue said that, based on the evidence presented, some of the acts and omissions by Israel and its officials seem to fall within the scope of the Genocide Convention. The court also warned Israel to “take all measures in its power to prevent” acts that could fall under the Genocide Convention, set up as the world grappled with the horrors of the Holocaust. It also said Israel should “prevent and punish” any incitement to genocide. South Africa has accused Israel of “genocidal” acts intended to cause the “destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group”. It had urged the court to order Israel to “immediately suspend” its military operations in Gaza and allow humanitarian aid to reach civilians there. The judges ruled that Israel must report to the court within a month on what it is doing to uphold the order to take all measures within its power to prevent acts of genocide in Gaza. Donoghue said the ruling creates international legal obligations for Israel.    The court also ruled Israel must promptly implement “immediate and effective” measures to guarantee the delivery of urgently required humanitarian aid and basic services to Gaza. Hamas, which has governed Gaza for the past 16 years, hailed the court’s “important” ruling, saying it “contributes to isolating Israel”. “The [International] Court of Justice’s decision is an important development which contributes to isolating Israel and exposing its crimes in Gaza,” it said in a statement."
Iran denies involvement in drone strike that killed three US troops,Iran denies involvement in drone attack that killed 3 US soldiers in Jordan,0.6990928868007482,2024-01-29,2024-01-29,"Iran has denied involvement in a drone attack on a US base near Jordan's border with Syria that killed three US troops.The US blamed the attack, which also left dozens injured, on ""radical Iranian-backed militant groups"".US President Biden vowed revenge and said: ""We shall respond.""It is the first time that a strike has killed US troops in the region since the start of the war in Gaza triggered by Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel.There have been other attacks on US bases in the region, but before Sunday there were no fatalities, according to the US military.The Islamic Resistance in Iraq has claimed it was behind the attack.The umbrella group emerged in late 2023 and is comprised of several Iran-affiliated militias operating in Iraq. It has claimed other attacks against US forces in recent weeks.In a statement, the group said it had targeted three US bases in Syria - identifying them as Shaddadi, Tanf and Rukban. However, Rukban is on the Jordanian side of the border with Syria. The group also said it targeted an Israeli oil facility in the Mediterranean.The BBC's US partner CBS reported that US troops were in their sleeping quarters when the drone struck their Tower 22 base in the early hours of the morning.A defence official said the drone came in ""very low and very slow"" at the same time that a US drone was returning to the base from a mission.As a result, the auto-response features of the air defence system were turned off so as not to shoot down the US drone, the official said, which meant there was little to no warning for troops at the base.The Iraqi government has condemned the attack and called for ""an end to the cycle of violence"" in the Middle East.Iraqi government spokesman Bassem al-Awadi said it was willing ""to collaborate on establishing fundamental rules to prevent further repercussions in the region and curb the escalation of conflict"".Mr Biden said the US ""will hold all those responsible to account at a time and in a manner of our choosing"".On Monday White House national security spokesman John Kirby said the US was seeking a ""very consequential"" response to the attack but does not want a wider war with Iran or the region.The administration believed a single drone was used to target US troops in Jordan, Mr Kirby said.Iran denied US and British accusations that it supported militant groups blamed for the strike.Nasser Kanaani, Iran's foreign ministry spokesman, said it was ""not involved in the decision making of resistance groups"" in how they chose to ""defend Palestinians or their own countries"".Iran's intelligence minister Esmail Khatib said that regional armed groups aligned with Iran respond to ""American aggressors"" at their own discretion.The White House said Mr Biden was briefed about the attack on Sunday morning by US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and other officials.""Jill and I join the families and friends of our fallen - and Americans across the country - in grieving the loss of these warriors in this despicable and wholly unjust attack,"" Mr Biden said in a statement.The names of the servicemen killed and injured have not yet been released as officials work to notify their families.UK Prime Minister â€‹Rishi Sunak condemned the attack and urged Iran to ""continue to de-escalate tensions"" in the region. ""We stand resolutely with our allies to bring stability and peace to the region,"" he said.Downing Street echoed the US assessment and said it believed ""the attack was carried out by radical Iran-backed militant groups operating in Syria and Iraq"".US officials said at least 34 military personnel were being evaluated for possible traumatic brain injury, and that some of the injured soldiers were medically evacuated from the base for further treatment.They also said the drone struck living quarters at the base, which, if confirmed, could explain the high number of casualties.US Central Command and President Biden said the attack was on a base in Rukban, northeastern Jordan, near the Syrian border. It was later named by US officials as Tower 22. In December, US officials said that US bases in Iraq and Syria had been attacked at least 97 times since 17 October. Last month, the US carried out airstrikes against Iran-affiliated groups after three US servicemembers were injured, one critically, in a drone attack on a base in northern Iraq.Earlier in January, one retaliatory US strike in Baghdad killed a militia leader accused of being behind attacks on US personnel. In a pre-recorded interview with ABC News that aired on Sunday morning, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen CQ Brown said that America's aim in the region is to ""not have the conflict broaden"".""The goal is to deter them and we don't want to go down a path of greater escalation that drives to a much broader conflict within the region.""US and coalition troops are also stationed in the Red Sea after the Iran-backed Houthis began attacking commercial ships in the region. The Yemen-based group says it is targeting vessels in the region in support of Palestinians in Gaza, where Israel is fighting Hamas.The US military has previously said ""these unlawful actions have nothing to do with the conflict in Gaza"".""The Houthis have fired indiscriminately into the Red Sea, targeting vessels impacting over 40 countries around the world,"" US Central Command has said.Two Navy Seals are presumed dead after they went missing in January during an operation off the coast of Somalia to seize Iranian-made weapons bound for Houthis in Yemen. ","Iran has denied involvement in adrone attack in Jordanthat killed three US military personnel and injured dozens of others, state media has reported. US President Joe Biden and UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron have blamed Iran-backed groups for Sunday’s attack near the border with Syria. “As we have clearly stated before, the resistance groups in the region are responding [to] the war crimes and genocide of the child-killing Zionist regime and… they do not take orders from the Islamic Republic of Iran,” Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Nasser Kanaani was quoted saying by IRNA on Monday. “These groups decide and act based on their own principles and priorities as well as the interests of their country and people.” Kanaani said claims of Iranian involvement were motivated by “specific political goals to reverse the realities of the region” and were “influenced by third parties, including the child-killing Zionist regime”. Iran’s mission to the United Nations also said in a statement carried by IRNA that Tehran had “no connection and had nothing to do” with the attack, which it blamed on “conflict between US forces and resistance groups in the region”. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella organisation of Iran-backed armed groups, has claimed responsibility for the attack. The drone strike on Tower 22, a logistics support base, marked the first loss of American life by enemy fire since the start of the war in Gaza. Biden, who has staunchly backed Israel’s war in Gaza, condemned the “despicable and wholly unjust attack” and has vowed to hold all those responsible “to account at a time and in a manner [of] our choosing”. Washington has accused Iranian-backed groups of carrying out dozens of attacks on US military installations in Iraq and Syria since the start of the war."

"Shani Louk: Woman missing after Hamas attack is dead, says mother","Israel says German-Israeli woman Shani Louk, taken by Hamas, is dead",0.6906808834342246,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"The mother of Shani Louk, an Israeli-German woman thought to have been kidnapped by Hamas gunmen at a music festival in Israel, says her daughter is dead.Speaking to German media, Ricarda Louk said she had been told by the Israeli military that a DNA sample taken from part of a skull bone proved to be Shani's. Her body has not yet been found. Shani's sister also confirmed the death on social media. Adi Louk wrote on Instagram on Monday that Shani had been killed in the ""massacre at Re'im"" - a reference to the attack staged by Hamas in southern Israel, near the Gaza Strip, on 7 October.But it was not clear from the reports where or when the fragment of her skull had been found.Israel's foreign ministry wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that it was ""devastated"" to have to share the news of her death.The 22-year-old had been attending the festival near the Kibbutz Re'im when gunmen opened fire and sent terrified partygoers fleeing through the desert.More than 260 people were killed, the Israeli authorities said, while others were taken hostage.Soon after the attack, a video began circulating widely on social media, showing the body of a young woman being paraded through the streets in the back of a flatbed truck, surrounded by armed fighters and others yelling ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is Greatest).The woman was lying face down but Ms Louk's family say they identified her from her dreadlocks and distinctive tattoos.While there was speculation online and in the media that she was dead, Ms Louk's mother said at the time she believed her daughter was alive. ""We were sent a video in which I could clearly see our daughter unconscious in the car with the Palestinians and them driving around the Gaza Strip,"" Ricarda Louk said in an appeal for information posted online. Speaking to the German TV news channel RTL/ntv on Monday, Ricarda Louk said she now assumed her daughter had been dead since 7 October and may have been shot in the head during the Hamas attack. ""At least she [Shani] didn't suffer,"" she said, adding that it was good to have certainty. More than 1,400 people were killed in the attacks by Hamas, according to the Israeli authorities, but there has been a delay in identifying some people due to the poor condition of some of the bodies. More than 220 are thought to have been taken hostage and four people have been released.Meanwhile, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 8,000 people have been killed since Israel's retaliatory bombing began. ","Israeli authorities have said that a 23-year-old German-Israeli woman named Shani Louk, abducted by the Palestinian armed group Hamas duringan attackon southern Israel, is dead. The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a social media post on Monday that it had confirmed the death of Louk, snatched at amusic festivalwhere Hamas fighters killed more than 200 people. “Our hearts are broken,” the social media post reads, adding that Louk had been “paraded” around Gaza. “May her memory be a blessing.” The circumstances of Louk’s death were not immediately clear. Louk’s sister Adi spoke of her “great sorrow” as she shared the news of Shani’s death on Instagram. Speaking with the German outlet RTL/nt-v, Shani’s mother Ricarda Louk said that the body of her daughter had not been found, but a piece of her skull with matching DNA had been recovered. Ricarda said that she believes her daughter has been dead since the assault on October 7, in which Hamas killed more than 1,400 people. The mother said that she believes her daughter was possibly shot in the head. “At least she didn’t suffer,” she told RTL/n-tv. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the news of Louk’s death was “terrible” and showed the need to hold Hamas to account. There was no immediate comment from Hamas. The October 7 attack saw hundreds of Hamas fighters break through the Israeli security barrier around the besieged Gaza Strip and enter a series of townsin southern Israel, killing entire families, including women and children. “What we saw on the Gaza-Israel border goes far beyond a pogrom. We saw a slaughterhouse,” Israeli President Isaac Herzog told Germany’s Bild newspaper in an interview in which he confirmed Louk’s death. More than 220 people, including Israelis and foreigners, were alsotaken captivein the attack.    Since the attack, Israel has carried out a devastating campaign of air raids on Gaza, which it has placed under total siege, cutting off access to water, electricity, food and fuel. Family members of those held captive have pleaded fortheir returnand human rights groups and the United Nations have also called for the immediate release of the hostages. On Monday, Hamas released footage that purports to show three captive women delivering a brief statement in which they blame Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the October 7 attack and call for aprisoner exchangeto secure their release. “She [one of the captives] blamed him [Netanyahu] for the failure of the October 7 attack, from preventing it from happening, for saying that no army was present, no one came to help us,” said Al Jazeera correspondent Sara Khairat. Statements offered by people being held captive are often given under duress. Netanyahu denounced the video as “cruel psychological propaganda” in a response on Monday."
David Cameron worried Israel may have broken international law in Gaza,British FM ‘worried’ Israel may have breached international law in Gaza,0.6901806546613063,2024-01-09,2024-01-09,"Lord David Cameron has said he is ""worried"" Israel may have broken international law in Gaza.The foreign secretary said he regularly consulted government lawyers over incidents in the war, but refused to say whether the legal advice suggested Israel had acted illegally.Lord Cameron stressed the government had not changed its support for Israel.Since the outbreak of war following Hamas' attack on 7 October, over 23,000 Palestinians have been killed.The Hamas-run health ministry says more than 59,000 Palestinians have been injured.Israel declared war on Hamas after the group led a massive attack on communities inside Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking some 240 others back to Gaza as hostages.Israel is also fighting a claim from South Africa that it is committing ""genocidal"" acts in Gaza at the International Court of Justice.Lord Cameron said he did not agree with South Africa's claim.Speaking during his first grilling by MPs since joining the House of Lords, the former prime minister said: ""I don't think that is helpful, I don't agree with it, I don't think it's right"".During a tense exchange with SNP MP Brendan O'Hara, Lord Cameron said he has seen things ""deeply concerning"" during the crisis but did not directly criticise the country's actions.He called on Israel to allow in more humanitarian aid and restore water supplies to northern Gaza.But Lord Cameron repeatedly side-stepped questions on whether he had seen legal advice suggesting Israel had breached international law, telling the foreign affairs committee ""I don't want to answer that question"".He said: ""If you're asking me am I worried that Israel has taken action that might be in breach of international law because this particular premises has been bombed or whatever?""Yes, of course I'm worried about that, and that's why I consult the Foreign Office lawyers when giving this advice on arms exports.""But he hinted that government lawyers had not suggested international law had been broken. He told MPs the legal advice he had seen was ""consistent with the fact we have not changed"" rules on exporting weapons to Israel. Tory MP Bob Seely put it to Lord Cameron that he had seen legal advice suggesting the Israeli government is ""vulnerable to a challenge from the Hague court and from elsewhere that in some of the things they are doing in, potentially, in relation to proportionality, there is a vulnerability.""""It's close to that,"" Lord Cameron replied. Downing Street later said Israel needs to ""act carefully"" and avoid risking further escalation in its war with Hamas.Asked if Rishi Sunak shares Lord Cameron's concerns about whether Israel has been acting within international law, the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""It is an issue we continue to keep under review and obviously we have made our views clear to the Israeli government at a number of levels on this.""The spokesman added: ""Fundamentally, though, we recognise that it is Israel that is responding to a terror attack, first and foremost.""Two British nationals are still being held hostage by Hamas as heavy bombardment and fighting continues to shake the region, Lord Cameron told the committee.Asked if he knew if the hostages are alive, Lord Cameron said: ""I just don't want to say any more. We don't have any information to share with you.""During a ceasefire in November, 105 hostages were released by Hamas.Lord Cameron's comments come as US secretary of state Antony Blinken held talks in Israel seeking to set a plan for Gaza's post-war future.Mr Blinken has called for winding down of the Israeli military campaign in Gaza to reduce regional tensions.US officials have called for the Palestinian Authority, which governs parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, to take over in Gaza and for negotiations to resume on the creation of a Palestinian state. ","British Foreign Minister David Cameron has said he is worried that Israel’s war on Gaza may have included breaches of international law, and while the advice he received so far was that Israel was compliant, there were questions to answer. Speaking to the British parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee on Tuesday, Cameron said some of what he had seen during the war in the besieged Palestinian territory was “deeply concerning”. Asked during a question-and-answer session with lawmakers if Israel could be “vulnerable to a challenge” from the International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Hague over whether its actions were proportionate, Cameron said the stance was “close to that”. While the former prime minister did not directly answer questions about whether he had received legal advice that Israel might have broken the law, he said some incidents had raised questions over whether there had been breaches. “Am I worried that Israel has taken action that might be in breach of international law because this particular premises has been bombed, or whatever? Yes, of course,” Cameron said. He added that there was always a “question mark” over whether a given incident had broken international law, which lawyers would examine and advise him over. “The advice has been so far that they [Israel] have the commitment, the capability and the compliance [with international law], but on lots of occasions, that is under question,” he said.    The United Kingdom has reaffirmed its support for Israel multiple times and backed its right to defend itself against Hamas, but has also called on the Israeli military to show restraint and act within international law in its offensive in Gaza. The Foreign Affairs Committee scrutinises the work of the UK’s foreign ministry, to which Cameron was appointed late last year. During Israel’s relentless bombardment of Gaza, at least 23,210 people have been killed, according to the Palestinian health ministry, and most homes in the Gaza Strip have beendestroyed. Cameron, who sits in the parliament’s upper chamber as an unelected minister, said it would take “a giant effort” to rebuild Gaza due to the level of destruction being so “great”. “We’re going to need as many people as possible. It will take more than any one country to do it,” he said. He also said that he had seen figures that show Hamas fighters had lost “over 50 percent of their capability and capacity” to fire rockets into Israel. Amid growing concern over the Gaza death toll and theSouth Africa genocide caseagainst Israel, United States Secretary of StateAntony Blinkenurged Israeli leaders on Tuesday to avoid future harm to civilians and civilian infrastructure."

Cameraman Abudaqa and correspondent Dahdouh were reporting at Farhana school in Khan Younis when they were hit by an Israeli strike on Friday. Rescue teams were unable to immediately reach Abudaqa and others at the site due to Israeli bombardment. “Rescuers just managed to retrieve the cameraman Samer Abudaqa’s body,” a spokesperson for the media network said. Dahdouh was hit by shrapnel on his upper arm, and managed to reach Nasser hospital where he was treated for minor injuries. Witnesses said earlier there was heavy shelling in the area around the school. Wael Dahdouh says the network’s crew was accompanying civil defence rescuers on a mission to evacuate a family after its home was bombed. “We captured the devastating destruction and reached places that had not been reached by any camera lens since the Israeli ground operation started,” Dahdouh said from his hospital bed. As the Al Jazeera journalists were heading back on foot because the areas were not accessible by car, Dahdouh said “something big” happened that knocked him to the ground. After the explosion, Dahdouh said he pressed on his wounds and walked out of the area to get help, but by the time he reached an ambulance, medics said they could not return to the site of the attack because it was too dangerous. Subsequent efforts to coordinate a safe passage to send rescuers for Abudaqa were delayed, Dahdouh said, adding that one ambulance that tried to reach the cameraman came under fire. Many Palestinians from the central and northern parts of Gaza have sought shelter in Khan Younis since the war began in October. Many have now been pushed further south towards the strip’s southernmost city of Rafah after Israel intensified its military operations in Khan Younis. The attack comes amid violent clashes between Palestinian fighters and the Israeli army in locations across Gaza. Residents reported fighting in Shujayea, Sheikh Radwan, Zeitoun, Tuffah, and Beit Hanoon in north Gaza, east of Maghazi in central Gaza and in the centre and northern fringes of Khan Younis, according to the Reuters news service. The Al Jazeera Media Network condemned the attack and extended its condolences to Abudaqa’s family in Gaza and Belgium. “The Network holds Israel accountable for systematically targeting and killing Al Jazeera journalists and their families,” a statement read. “In today’s bombing in Khan Younis, Israeli drones fired missiles at a school where civilians sought refuge, resulting in indiscriminate casualties,” the network said. “Following Samer’s injury, he was left to bleed to death for over 5 hours, as Israeli forces prevented ambulances and rescue workers from reaching him, denying the much-needed emergency treatment,” the statement added. In late October, Wael Dahdouhlost four of his family membersin an Israeli air raid. His family had been seeking refuge in Nuseirat camp in the centre of Gaza when their home was bombed by Israeli forces, killing his wife, Um Hamza, his 15-year-old son, Mahmoud, his seven-year-old daughter, Sham, and his grandson, Adam, who died in hospital hours later. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said it was “deeply saddened” and called for an independent investigation into the attack. The press freedom group says the conflict in Gaza is the deadliest for journalists it has ever recorded. “We’re outraged by the high price, I would say the extreme price, that Palestinian journalists are paying,” the CPJ’s Carlos Martinez de la Serna told Al Jazeera, adding that there was a “clear prevailing sense of impunity.” “We need international, independent investigations to assess all these killings and those responsible need to be accountable,” said de la Serna. “It’s essential to remember that journalists under international humanitarian law are civilians, and the obligation on all parties involved in the war is to protect them, and what we’re seeing, is that journalists are being killed.” #Gaza:@pressfreedomis deeply saddened by a drone strike that killed@AJArabiccameraperson Samer Abu Daqqa and injured Gaza bureau chief Wael Al Dahdouh, and calls for an independent investigation into the attack.https://t.co/B8lRuj2w2w.  . — CPJ MENA (@CPJMENA)December 15, 2023  The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) said it was “shocked” at the attack. “We condemn the attack and reiterate our demand that journalists’ lives must be safeguarded,” it said in a post on X. An IFJ report published last week found that 72 percent of journalists who died on the job this year were killed in the Gaza war. The two journalists have worked together with Al Jazeera Arabic since before the war. “[Samer] and Wael make up a very professional, strong team on the ground, documenting everything and bringing all the facts and live pictures of what the Palestinian people have been going through,” Hani Mahmoud said. “But particularly with this war, given its intensity in scale and magnitude and the sheer amount of destruction, they have been at the forefront of covering every little detail that one might have forgotten about,” he added.

Israel to fight South Africa's Gaza genocide claim in court,Israel promises to fight South Africa genocide accusation at ICJ,0.6859569779144262,2024-01-02,2024-01-02,"Israel will fight South Africa's claim that it is committing ""genocidal"" acts in Gaza at the International Court of Justice, an Israeli spokesman has said.""History will judge you, and it will judge you without mercy,"" Eylon Levy said, addressing South African leaders.South Africa filed the case at the ICJ on Friday, to Israel's outrage.South Africa is a staunch supporter of the Palestinians and has repeatedly condemned Israel since the start of the war with Gaza on 7 October.More than 22,000 Palestinians - the majority of them civilians - have been killed in Israeli strikes since the war began, according to Gaza's health ministry which is run by the Islamist group Hamas.Israel declared war on Hamas after the group led a massive attack on communities inside Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking some 240 others back to Gaza as hostages.Following its application to the ICJ, South Africa's presidency said that the country was obliged ""to prevent genocide from occurring"".The 84-page document states that the ""acts and omissions by Israel"" are ""genocidal in character because they are intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group"".South African government lawyers are preparing for the case to be heard on 11 and 12 January, Clayson Monyela, a spokesperson for South Africa's Department of International Relations and Cooperation, said on X.The ICJ, which is based in the Hague in the Netherlands, is the UN's highest court. It settles disputes between states and gives advisory opinions on international legal issues. It does not have the power to bring prosecutions. However, its opinions carry weight with the UN and other international legal bodies.Israel intended to fight the case, Eylon Levy said, ""to dispel South Africa's absurd blood libel"".A blood libel is a term used to describe antisemitic false allegations against Jewish communities of bloodletting, originating in Europe in the Middle Ages. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu angrily rejected South Africa's allegations when it filed the lawsuit, saying ""No, South Africa, it is not we who have come to perpetrate genocide, it is Hamas.""It would murder all of us if it could. In contrast, the IDF [Israeli army] is acting as morally as possible.""It comes as Israel is already facing an investigation by the ICJ, initiated by the Palestinians, into its ""prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of... Palestinian territory"".The court has sat in judgement on Israel once before, in 2004, when it found that Israel's barrier built in and around the occupied West Bank was against international law. Israel said the barrier was built to thwart suicide bombings from the West Bank; Palestinians considered it a mechanism to take land.","Israel will appear before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague to contest South Africa’s accusation that it is committing genocide against Palestinians in its war with Hamas, an Israeli government spokesman says. South Africalaunched the case against Israel on Friday, saying the magnitude of death, destruction and the extent of the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip meets the threshold of the 1948 Genocide Convention under international law. South Africa also asked the court to order Israel to stop its attacks in Gaza. A spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday accused South Africa of “giving political and legal cover” to the October 7 Hamas attacks on Israel, which triggered the three-month-long war. “The state of Israel will appear before the International Court of Justice at The Hague to dispel South Africa’s absurd blood libel,” Eylon Levy said. “We assure South Africa’s leaders, history will judge you, and it will judge you without mercy,” Levy added. The spokesperson said Hamas was responsible for the war it started and was “waging from inside and underneath hospitals, schools, mosques, homes and UN facilities”. For decades, South Africa hasbacked the Palestinian cause for statehood. It has likened the treatment of Palestinians to those of the Black majority in South Africa during the apartheid era, a comparison that Israel vehemently denies. Clayson Monyela, a spokesperson for South Africa’s Department of International Relations and Cooperation, said in a post on X that lawyers representing South Africa were preparing for the hearing scheduled for January 11 and 12. The announcement comes as fierce fighting continues in southern Gaza with Israeli forces bombarding the city of Khan Younis from the air and ground. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society said on Tuesday that Israeli forces hit its headquarters in Khan Younis, resulting in several deaths and injuries among the displaced people who had been sheltering there. The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza said on Tuesday that more than 200 people had been killed in 24 hours, taking the death toll from the Israeli assault on Gaza to more than 22,000."
Wael Al-Dahdouh: Al Jazeera reporter's family killed in Gaza strike,Al Jazeera condemns Israeli killing of journalist Wael Al-Dahdouh’s family,0.685907403729046,2023-10-26,2023-10-25,"The family of an Al Jazeera news reporter has been killed in an Israeli air strike on Gaza, the network has confirmed.Wael Al-Dahdouh's wife, teenage son and young daughter were all killed at a refugee camp in central Gaza on Wednesday, Al Jazeera said in a statement.It later reported that his grandson had died as well.Al Jazeera condemned the killings and Israel's ""indiscriminate attack"".According to the news organisation, Al-Dahdouh's family was living in a house at the Nuseirat camp in central Gaza after being displaced from northern Gaza following Israel's warning to residents to move south due to ongoing military action. Fifteen-year-old Mahmoud was in his final year at high school, Al Jazeera said, while his daughter, Sham, was seven years old and his grandson, Adam, was 18-months-old. Other family members were said to be buried under the rubble but some are known to have survived.The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed that it had carried out an attack targeting Hamas in the area where members of Al-Dahdouh's family were killed. When questioned by the BBC about the loss of civilian life in Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, including that of journalists and their families, IDF spokesperson Lt Col Peter Lerner said ""any loss of life is a tragedy"". Footage posted online showed Al-Dahdouh in tears in hospital, holding what appeared to be the body of his seven-year-old daughter and kneeling over the body of his teenage son. ""There is no safe place in Gaza at all,"" he said in an English translation of an interview with Al Jazeera. Al-Dahdouh is Al Jazeera Arabic's bureau chief in Gaza and has worked for the news agency for several years. Al Jazeera said it was ""deeply concerned about the safety, and well-being of our colleagues in Gaza and hold the Israeli authorities responsible for their security"".""We urge the international community to intervene and put an end to these attacks on civilians, thereby safeguarding innocent lives.""At least 24 journalists have been killed so far in the latest conflict between Israel and Gaza, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Gaza has been under continuous military bombardment by Israel following a surprise attack by Hamas fighters on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people. More than 200 people are still being held hostage.Meanwhile, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says 7,000 people have been killed there. Israel has cut off supplies of fuel, electricity and most water to the territory. A small amount of aid is now getting in through Egypt. ","Below is Al Jazeera Media Network’s statement on thekilling of journalist Wael Al-Dahdouh’s family members: The Al Jazeera Media Network extends its sincere condolences and sympathy to our colleague Wael Al-Dahdouh on the loss of his family in an Israeli airstrike. The indiscriminate assault by the Israeli Occupation forces resulted in the tragic loss of his wife, son, and daughter, while the rest of his family is buried under the rubble. Their home was targeted in the Nuseirat camp in the centre of Gaza, where they had sought refuge after being displaced by the initial bombardment in their neighborhood, following Prime Minister Netanyahu’s call for all civilians to move south. Al Jazeera is deeply concerned about the safety, and well-being of our colleagues in Gaza and hold the Israeli authorities responsible for their security. The Network strongly condemns the indiscriminate targeting and killing of innocent civilians in Gaza, which has led to the loss of Wael Al-Dahdouh’s family and countless others. We urge the international community to intervene and put an end to these attacks on civilians, thereby safeguarding innocent lives."
Palestinians must be able to stay in Gaza - Blinken,Blinken says Palestinians displaced in Gaza must be able to return home,0.6757632026892691,2024-01-08,2024-01-07,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Palestinians must not be pressured into leaving Gaza, and must be allowed to return to their homes once conditions allow.Mr Blinken condemned statements by some Israeli ministers, who called for the resettlement of Palestinians elsewhere.The US official was in Qatar on his latest Middle East tour.His comments followed reports that up to 70 people were killed at Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza.Footage from Jabalia showed bodies lying in the rubble of a destroyed building - many of them women and children.A spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that it ""acted against a military target in the strike"" and that it was ""not aware of the number of casualties mentioned"".""In response to Hamas' barbaric attacks, the IDF is operating to dismantle Hamas military and administrative capabilities,"" they said, adding that the IDF ""follows international law and takes feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm"".More than 60 Palestinians were reportedly also killed in the past day in the southern city of Khan Younis.Jabalia camp has been struck many times since Israel began its war against Hamas following the unprecedented attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October. Some 1,200 people were killed - most of them civilians - and about 240 others taken hostage in the Hamas raids. More than 22,000 people - mostly women and children - have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. It has reported at least 113 deaths over 24 hours of Israeli bombardment.""Palestinian civilians must be able to return home as soon as conditions allow,"" Mr Blinken said on Sunday. ""They cannot, they must not be pressed to leave Gaza.""Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has called for Palestinians to leave Gaza and make way for Israelis who could ""make the desert bloom"".And National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, another far-right politician, this week issued a call ""to encourage the migration of Gaza residents"" as a ""solution"" to the crisis.The official line from the Israeli government is that Gazans will eventually be able to return to their homes, though it has yet to outline how or when this will be possible.Meanwhile, the situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate. Health officials said even medical facilities including hospitals are now unsafe.Three international medical aid groups announced they were pulling out of the Al-Aqsa Hospital in central Gaza after Israel issued evacuation orders.A representative of the United Nation's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), told the BBC World Service's Newshour programme that they were ""hugely concerned by this development"".""What it means is that a hospital that was already over-crowded and overloaded and well beyond its capacity is now without absolutely critical reinforcement to support it as it deals with an ever-increasing number of casualties,"" said Gemma Connell. The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that more than 600 patients and health workers were forced to leave the hospital, according to its director.""Their locations are not currently known,"" said Mr Tedros in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. Mr Blinken's latest trip to the Middle East comes amid rising tensions in the region, with concerns that the war in Gaza could spread. Saleh al-Arouri, a top Hamas official, was assassinated in a suspected Israeli attack in southern Beirut on Tuesday along with six others - two Hamas military commanders and four other members.Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, the powerful Iranian-backed movement in Lebanon, described Arouri's assassination as a ""flagrant Israeli aggression"" that would not go unpunished. Hezbollah then fired rockets into Israel on Saturday as a ""preliminary response"" to the killing of Arouri. ""This is a moment of profound tension in the region. This is a conflict that could easily metastasize, causing even more insecurity and even more suffering,"" Mr Blinken said. Qatar's PM Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al -Thani said that the killing of Arouri had affected ""the complicated process"".Mr Blinken also said that the death of journalist Hamza al-Dahdouh, the eldest son of Al Jazeera's Gaza bureau chief who was killed in an Israeli strike in southern Gaza., was ""an unimaginable tragedy"".He added that ""far too many innocent Palestinian men, women and children"" have died in the war.Mr Blinken arrived in Qatar following stops in Jordan, Turkey and Greece. He went on to Abu Dhabi late Sunday, and on Monday is due to travel to Saudi Arabia.","US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said that Palestinian civilians must be able to return home and rejected statements byIsraeli officialscalling for the mass displacement of Gaza residents. Speaking at a press conference in Doha on Sunday alongside Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, Blinken said the United Nations can play a crucial role in allowing displaced civilians in Gaza to return home as Israel moves to a “lower-intensity phase” of its military campaign. “They [Palestinian civilians] cannot – they must not – be pressed to leave Gaza,” he said. The top US diplomat condemned thekilling of Al Jazeera journalist Hamza Dahdouh, the son of Al Jazeera’s Gaza bureau chief and correspondent Wael Dahdouh, and called it an “unimaginable tragedy”. Hamza was killed along with fellow journalist Mustafa Thuraya in an Israeli attack on southern Gaza on Sunday. Israeli forces previously killed several members of Wael Dahdouh’s immediate family in an air raid. “I can’t begin to imagine the horror that he’s experienced – not once, but now twice,” Blinken said. “This is why we are pressing the need – the imperative – not only of making sure that humanitarian assistance can get to people who need it, but that people are protected from harm from this conflict in the first place.” Tamer Qarmout, assistant professor in public policy at the Doha Institute of Graduate Studies, told Al Jazeera that while Blinken has expressed sorrow over Dahdouh’s loss, the top US diplomat has not held Israel accountable for killing journalists in Gaza.    The US Department of State has issued emergency declarations twice in recent weeks to deliver bombs to Israel without congressional oversight. At the press conference in Doha, Blinken said that all US weapons deliveries to any country, including Israel, are made with conditions that humanitarian law is respected. He said that while Israel has a right to target Hamas and ensure that the group can no longer launch attacks, it is “imperative” to protect civilians. “As operations phase down, that will certainly make it easier to ensure that civilians are not harmed and will also ensure that more assistance can get to people who need it,” he said. Qatar’s Al Thani said that the world is getting used to the images of civilian suffering in Gaza. “This is a big test for our humanity,” he said. At least 22,835 people have been killed – including 9,600 children – in Israel’s assault on Gaza since October 7, according to Palestinian officials. At least 1,140 people were killed in Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel, according to Israeli authorities, and around 240 others taken captive. Al Thani said the killing of Hamas deputy political leaderSaleh al-Arouriin Beirut has affected Qatar’s efforts to negotiate between the Palestinian group and Israel over freeing the captives. Qatar previously played a key role in mediating a seven-day truce between Israel and Hamas that saw more than 100 captives freed and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners released from Israeli jails. Al Thani said Doha continues to negotiate and that he and Blinken discussed efforts to reach a ceasefire and ensure the release of more captives. The top US diplomat was in Doha as a part of a week-long diplomacy tour in the Middle East, seeking to calm what he said is a “moment of profound tension” in the region amid Israel’s three-month-long war in Gaza. Since the Israel-Hamas war began on October 7, Israel and the Lebanese armed groupHezbollahhave frequently exchanged cross-border fire. Dozens of Lebanese civilians and more than 140 Hezbollah members have been killed in the fighting, leading to growing concern that the Gaza war could escalate into a regional conflagration. On a separate front, the Iran-alignedHouthirebels in Yemen have fired missiles at Israel and carried out several attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea in what they say are acts of solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. The group, which controls much of Yemen, say they are targeting vessels which are destined for Israel. The attacks have led to many global shipping companies including Maersk to avoid the Red Sea shipping route, and the US has responded by setting up a multinational maritime force to protect shipping lanes in the region. Blinken noted how the Houthi attacks were “hurting people around the world”, with shipping costs increasing and goods deliveries taking longer. He stressed that Washington is keen to ensure the war does not spread. “Over a dozen countries have made clear that the Houthis will be held accountable for future attacks,” Blinken said, referring to the US-led coalition. Qarmout told Al Jazeera that it is clear that the Americans are sending a clear message from Doha to neighbouring Iran, who back the Houthis, that they [the US] doesn’t want to see an escalation of the war. “There is war fatigue … It is an elections year in the US as well. I think the Americans don’t have an appetite for this conflict to escalate and to involve other parties like Hezbollah and Iran,” Qarmout said. “So I think there is a sincere will by the Americans to engage in diplomacy and achieve some gains.”"

They were named as Yotam Haim, 28, Samer Talalka, 22, and Alon Shamriz, 26.The military shared its remorse and said the three were shot by troops operating in Shejaiya, in Gaza's north. More than 100 hostages remain in captivity in Gaza after being captured in the 7 October attacks on Israel.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Friday's incident was under investigation, and that it ""expresses deep remorse over the tragic incident and sends the families its heartfelt condolences"".""Our national mission is to locate the missing and return all the hostages home,"" it added.Hundreds of people gathered in central Tel Aviv following the announcement and marched to an IDF military base in the city, calling on the government to secure a deal for the release of the remaining hostages. Demonstrators held candles and carried placards that read ""Bring [them] home"" and ""Hostage exchange now!""The bodies of the three men have been returned to Israeli territory, where checks confirmed their identities.Yotam Haim, who was kidnapped from Kibbutz Kfar Aza on 7 October, was a musician who loved animals and cooking Italian food.On the morning of the Hamas attack, he called his family and told them that his house was on fire. When he opened the window for some fresh air, Yotam was kidnapped by Hamas.Speaking to the BBC before her son's death, his mother said they had messaged each other as they hid in their home shelters - before their connection was lost.Alon Shamriz was also at Kfar Aza at the time of the attack. His family gave permission for him to be named after asking earlier that his identity not be revealed.Samer Talalka, a Bedouin, was kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Am. An avid motorcycle enthusiast, he loved to travel in the countryside and spend time with friends. He lived in the town of Hura and worked at a chicken hatchery in the kibbutz. On the morning of 7 October, he was at work. He called his sister after the attack to tell her that he had been injured by gunfire.His father told local media they lost touch at 07:00 local time on the morning of the attacks. A photograph of him being led through Gaza was shared on Telegram.Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called their deaths an ""unbearable tragedy"".""Even on this difficult evening, we will bind up our wounds, learn the lessons and continue with a supreme effort to return all our abductees home safely,"" he said.White House spokesperson John Kirby said the killings were a ""tragic mistake,"" and that the US did not have ""perfect visibility on exactly how this operation unfolded"".More than 100 hostages remain in captivity in Gaza after being captured on 7 October when Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 240 hostages - some of whom were released during a brief truce.The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry says more than 18,800 people have been killed and 50,000 injured in the enclave so far in the war that followed. Hen Avigdori, whose wife and daughter were among the released, said he often heard people say hostages could be rescued ""by military means.""But ""there is no military way"" that would bring them back safely, he wrote in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. ""The conclusion for every person who has both heart and mind is the same: Israel must initiate a deal to bring them back alive and not in coffins.""","The Israeli army has killed three captives held by Palestinian armed groups in Gaza after “mistakenly” identifying them as a threat, according to Israeli military officials. The military said on Friday that thecaptiveswere killed during combat with Palestinian groups in Gaza and expressed its condolences to the families while saying there would be “full transparency” in the investigation into the incident, which is “under review”. “During combat in Shujayea, the [Israeli army] mistakenly identified three Israeli hostages as a threat. As a result, the troops fired toward them and they were killed,” the army said in a statement. “The [Israeli army] began reviewing the incident immediately … Immediate lessons from the event have been learned, which have been passed on to all [Israeli army] troops in the field,” it added, expressing “deep remorse over the tragic incident”. The hostages were identified as three young men who had been abducted from Israeli communities during the Hamas attack on October 7 – 28-year-old Yotam Haim, 25-year-old Samer Al-Talalka and 26-year-old Alon Shamriz. The army’s chief spokesman, Daniel Hagari, said Israeli troops found the hostages and erroneously identified them as a threat. He said it was believed that the three had either fled their captors or been abandoned. Israeli troops have engaged in fierce battles with Palestinian fighters in the area in recent days. About 250 captives were taken into Gaza by Palestinian groups during the October 7 attack on southern Israel, which killed around 1,200 people, according to Israeli authorities. Israel’s war on Gaza has killed more than 18,700 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, most of them women and children. Thousands more are missing and trapped beneath the rubble. The Israeli government has repeatedly stated that bringing home all of the hostages is one of its principal aims in the war. To date, 110 of the captives have been freed, mostly during a seven-day truce last month in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli jails. Israel has also repatriated eight bodies, including on Friday those of dual Israeli-French national Elia Toledano, 28, abducted from an electronic music festival, and two 19-year-old soldiers. The deaths were announced as US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the US and Israel werediscussing a timetablefor scaling back the offensive against Hamas, even though they agree the overall fight will take months. Sullivan also met with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to discuss the besieged enclave’s postwar future. US President Joe Biden’s administration has expressed unease over Israel’s failure to reduce civilian casualties and its plans for the future of Gaza, but the White House continues to offer wholehearted support for Israel with weapons shipments and diplomatic backing. Israeli air raids and shelling continued Friday, including in the southern city of Rafah, part of the shrinking areas of tiny, densely populated Gaza to which Palestinian civilians had been told by Israel to evacuate.

Samer Abudaqa: Al Jazeera cameraman killed in Gaza drone strike,‘A wonderful human’: Al Jazeera colleagues remember Samer Abudaqa,0.6712776887050983,2023-12-16,2023-12-15,"The funeral has been held of an Al Jazeera cameraman who was killed by an Israeli drone strike on Gaza.Samer Abudaqa was wounded in the strike on a school in Khan Younis on Friday along with his colleague, Wael Al-Dahdouh.Al Jazeera said Abudaqa bled to death because a heavy bombardment prevented paramedics from reaching him.The Qatar-based network said it had referred the case to the International Criminal Court (ICC).Posting on X, formerly known as Twitter, Al Jazeera referred to Abudaqa's death as an ""assassination"", and said that its legal filing to the ICC would include repeated attacks on network crews working in the Palestinian territories.The network said Abudaqa was its 13th journalist to die on duty since it was created in 1996.Dahdouh, who lost several family members in an earlier Israeli bombing, survived the attack.During his eulogy at this colleague's funeral, Dahdouh said journalists in Gaza would ""continue to do our duty with professionalism and transparency"".He said that journalists in Gaza were carrying a ""human and noble message"" for the world amid the ongoing war and would continue to work despite Israeli attacks.According to Al Jazeera, Dahdouh was hit by shrapnel on his upper arm and managed to walk to Nasser hospital for treatment.Abudaqa also suffered shrapnel injuries, but paramedics struggled reach him as the area was under heavy bombardment from Israeli forces.Al Jazeera said the cameraman was ""left to bleed to death for over five hours,"" adding it held Israel accountable for targeting its journalists and their families.Abudaqa joined Al Jazeera in June 2004, working as a cameraman and editor. He had three sons and a daughter, and lived in the town of Abasan al-Kabira near Khan Younis.Al Jazeera's managing editor, Mohamed Moawad, described Abudaqa as ""a skilled professional but a compassionate soul who understood the power of visual storytelling"". ""His unwavering commitment to truth and storytelling has left an indelible mark on our team,"" he said on X.According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), at least 64 journalists - mostly Palestinians - have been killed since the Israel-Gaza conflict began on 7 October.The Foreign Press Association (FPA), which represents several hundred journalists working for international news organisations, said it grieved the cameraman's death. saying he was the first FPA member to be killed in the Israel-Gaza conflict.""We consider this a grave blow to the already limited freedom of the press in Gaza and call on the army for a prompt investigation and explanation.""","Friends and colleagues have paid tribute to Samer Abudaqa, an Al Jazeera journalist killed in an Israeli attack in the Gaza Strip. The Al Jazeera Media Network confirmed on Friday that Abudaqa, a cameraman for Al Jazeera Arabic in Gaza, had been hit in an Israeli drone attack while reporting at Farhana school in Khan Younis, southern Gaza. His colleague, Al Jazeera Arabic correspondent Wael Dahdouh, who lost his wife, son, daughter and grandson in aprevious Israeli bombing, was wounded. “Al Jazeera holds the Israeli Occupation Forces fully accountable for Samer’s safety, deeming this incident a deliberate attempt to target its correspondents and their families in the Gaza Strip,” Al Jazeera said in a statement. Abudaqa and Dahdouh had worked tirelessly to cover the war between Israel and Hamas, paying special attention to the plight of Palestinians in Gaza, where the Israeli siege and relentless bombardment have displaced more than 80 percent of the population and created a catastrophic humanitarian crisis. Colleagues at Al Jazeera remembered Abudaqa as an exemplary journalist and a caring man, a father of four who was beloved by those who worked alongside him.    “He was very close to me. We were sharing food and drinks together at night, sometimes he just came to me searching for anything he could do to help us, [to ask us], ‘What would you like to eat for dinner?’” Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum said from Rafah in southern Gaza. “He asked me all the time about my family members, about how I feel, what are the newest updates on the ground; he was really a brother before he was a colleague.” Abu Azzoum said that Abudaqa had hoped to reunite with members of his family after the war. “Sometimes, he showed me photos of his kids, saying, ‘This is my eldest son,’ ‘This my youngest one,’ ‘This one is the prettiest’,” he said. Al Jazeera’s Heba Akila said Abudaqa would “add humorous moments and joy to all of our gatherings”. “Samer was a wonderful human,” she said. “There is no place that is spared. There is no safe place. There is no immunity for anyone.” Dahdouh was hit by shrapnel on his upper arm, and managed to reach Nasser hospital where he was treated for minor injuries. But “Israeli forces prevented ambulances and rescue workers from reaching” Samer, “denying the much-needed emergency treatment”, Al Jazeera said. “We captured the devastating destruction and reached places that had not been reached by any camera lens since the Israeli ground operation started,” Dahdouh said from his hospital bed, noting that he felt “something big” that knocked him back onto the ground. “I am trying to gather my strength to continue with you what we started on the first day of this war. Despite everything, I expect that I will be able to be with you live on television,” he added.    Al Jazeera’s Imran Khan said all of Abudaqa’s colleagues in the occupied West Bank and Gaza were “in shock”. “There isn’t a single Palestinian journalist who you speak to that won’t tell you a story of either being detained, or being shot at, or being tear gassed, or being harassed, or their families being harassed,” Khan said from Ramallah in the occupied West Bank. “Since October 7th it has got a lot tougher to be a Palestinian journalist … and yet, they still do what they are doing,” he added. “This is really the message I have taken away from all of our colleagues in Gaza: They wake up every morning with a determination to continue reporting. I am actually in awe of it.” Four Al Jazeera journalists have lost family members in the Israeli assault on Gaza since the war began on October 7. Abudaqa is the first Al Jazeera journalist to be killed since then. Al Jazeera has called on the international community to hold Israel accountable for attacks on reporters.  Before Abudaqa’s death, the Committee to Protect Journalistsreported thatat least 64 reporters and media workers – 56 Palestinians, four Israelis, and three Lebanese – have been killed since the fighting began on October 7. “I think this is now a press freedom issue. I think we have to ask ourselves ‘What is the [Israeli military] trying to achieve? Why won’t they let foreign journalists in?” Tim Dawson, deputy general secretary of the International Federation of Journalists, told Al Jazeera. “We know that a great many Palestinian journalists have been targeted, many of them have told me that personally, which is a terrifying and unforgivable prospect.” Abudaqa joined Al Jazeera in June 2004, working as a cameraman and editor. The journalist, born in 1978, was the father of three boys and a girl. He was a resident of the town of Abasan al-Kabira near Khan Younis.

"Israel-Hamas truce in Gaza extended for two days, Qatar says","Israel and Hamas agree to extend truce by two days, Qatar says",0.6635205436341055,2023-11-27,2023-11-27,"Israel and Hamas have agreed to extend the four-day truce in Gaza for another two days, mediator Qatar says.Hamas said the extension was ""under the same conditions"", which were for 50 Israeli hostages to be released in exchange for 150 Palestinian prisoners.Israel has yet to comment, but it had offered a day's pause in the fighting for every 10 Israeli hostages freed.It came as 11 hostages were released in the final exchange under the original deal that took effect on Friday.Israeli officials said three-year-old twins and their mother were among them, along with six more children, an 18-year-old and her mother. The Israeli military said they had crossed into Israeli territory. However all of the released children's fathers remained in Gaza.Those freed included people who also held French, German and Argentine nationality, Qatar said.Thirty-three Palestinian women and teenagers in Israeli jails were due to be released under the truce deal.Hamas - which is regarded as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK and other Western powers - has freed 39 Israelis over the previous three days. In exchange, Israel has freed 117 Palestinian prisoners.Nineteen foreign nationals, one of whom has Israeli citizenship, have also been handed over by Hamas under separate agreements.The pause in the fighting is also allowing a big increase in deliveries of aid to Gaza, where there is a deepening humanitarian crisis.Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza and imposed a siege in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and about 240 others taken hostage.Gaza's Hamas-run government says more than 14,800 people have been killed in the territory since the war began.Qatari foreign ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari announced on Monday afternoon on X, formerly known as Twitter, that ""as part of the ongoing mediation, an agreement has been reached to extend the humanitarian pause for an additional two days in the Gaza Strip"".White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters the US welcomed the extension.""This humanitarian pause has already brought a halt to the fighting together with a surge of humanitarian assistance. Now, in order to extend the pause Hamas has committed to releasing another 20 women and children over the next two days,"" he said.""We would of course hope to see the pause extended further and that will depend upon Hamas continuing to release hostages.""Before the start of Monday's exchange, an Israeli official said that 184 people remained in captivity in Gaza, including 14 foreign nationals and 80 Israelis with dual citizenship.On Sunday, a Palestinian official told the BBC that Hamas was prepared to release up to 40 additional hostages, which would mean a four-day extension under the terms offered by Israel.Israel was reported to be leaning towards a more gradual, day-by-day approach. And it has made it clear that it is preparing to resume the war in Gaza at the end of the process.""At the end of the outline, we will go to realising our goals with full force: eliminating Hamas, ensuring that Gaza will not go back to being what it was and, of course, releasing all of our hostages,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video statement on Sunday evening.Earlier, Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdul Rahman Al Thani told the BBC's US partner CBS News that the agreement would be extended if Hamas was ""able to prove, to locate, and secure some of the hostages that are within the criteria of the first group, which is women and children"".But he warned that Hamas's ""very complicated structure"" presented a challenge for Qatari mediators, with the group's political leaders in Doha having to relay information to and from military commanders in Gaza.","A humanitarian pause in fighting between Israel and Hamas will be extended by two days, mediator Qatar and Hamas say, hours before an initialfour-day trucein Gaza had been set to expire. “The State of Qatar announces that, as part of the ongoing mediation, an agreement has been reached to extend the humanitarian truce for an additional two days in the Gaza Strip,” Qatari Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Majed al-Ansari said on X, formerly Twitter, on Monday. Qatar, the United States and Egypt have engaged in intensenegotiations to establish and prolong the trucein Gaza, which mediators had said was designed to be broadened and expanded. Over the course of the initial truce, a total of 50 civilian captives, all women and children, were expected to be freed by Hamas. In exchange, 150 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel were to be released and more humanitarian aid allowed into Gaza.    Ghazi Hamad, a Hamas official, said he hoped the truce could be extended further. “It [the possibility of an extension] was written in the agreement, that if Hamas gives more hostages, there will be more days of the ceasefire,” he told Al Jazeera. “We have now agreed to release more hostages and extend the agreement for two days. This is good news for our people, especially the people of Gaza. “I hope we can extend it until we reach the end of this war. We want to end the war. We are in a temporary ceasefire, but we are trying to extend it. There is lots of support from Qatar, Egypt and many Western governments to end this catastrophe,” he said. During the first three days of the truce, 39 Israeli captives werereleased by the armed groupin exchange for 117 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. As a result of parallel negotiations led by Qatar, 17 Thai citizens, one Filipino and one dual Russian-Israeli national have also been released by Hamas.    Hamas fighters seized about 240 hostages when they stormed from Gaza into southern Israel on October 7 and killed about 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials. After the attack, Israel launched a relentless bombing campaign and a ground offensive in Gaza, killing nearly 15,000 people, including more than 6,000 children, according to Palestinian officials. Reporting from Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, Al Jazeera’s Nida Ibrahim said families across the occupied Palestinian territories would be relieved by the extension. “This is a source of relief for many families, not just the families of prisoners, but also other people in the occupied West Bank who are watching in horror images coming out of the besieged Gaza Strip. “We are not just referring to the killings and children who’ve lost their lives but also to the people who have been displaced, to the wounded, to the many hungry and in a very difficult situation.”    The White House welcomed the extension of the truce and said it hopes Americans would be among the captives to be released in the next phase of exchanges. Eight to nine US citizens are believed to still be among those held. The United Nations chief also hailed the two-day extension as a “glimpse of hope and humanity” but warned it was not enough time to meet the aid needs of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. “I strongly hope that this will enable us to increase even more the humanitarian aid to the people in Gaza that [are] suffering so much – knowing that even with that additional amount of time, it will be impossible to satisfy all the dramatic needs of the population,” Guterres told reporters. The extension was announced as Hamas said it had received a list with the names of prisoners to be released later on Monday in exchange for Israeli captives, the group said on its Telegram channel. The list includes three female prisoners and another 30 children. Meanwhile, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it had informed families of the identities of the captives to be released on Monday.   "
Who was Hamas leader Saleh al-Arouri killed in Beirut?,Senior Hamas official Saleh al-Arouri killed in Beirut suburb,0.6536012261442325,2024-01-02,2024-01-02,"Saleh al-Arouri was one of the most senior figures in the Hamas hierarchy - a leading man on both the political and military fronts. The 57-year-old was the deputy head of Hamas's political bureau, and helped establish the group's military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades.He had remained deeply involved with the group's military affairs.He was killed in an explosion in Beirut's southern suburb of Dahiyeh, an attack widely blamed on Israel.Saleh al-Arouri joined Hamas in 1987, and helped establish the group's military presence in the occupied West Bank.He was one of the closest connected Hamas officials to both Iran and Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon. He had served time in Israeli prisons. After his release he was a negotiator in a deal that saw more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners being released in return for the freeing of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in 2011.On 27 October this year the Israeli army had demolished his West Bank home in the town of Arura, near Ramallah. Arouri was living in Lebanon at the time of his death.Lebanese media reported that he was killed in an Israeli drone attack on Hamas's office in the southern Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh, alongside six others who were reported to have also been members of Hamas. This is not just about who was killed but where he was killed. A senior Hamas official killed in a Hezbollah stronghold in Lebanon is bound to make things even more precarious at a very volatile junction in the fighting.Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati described the killing as a new Israeli war crime that aimed to drag Lebanon into a new phase of the conflict.Hezbollah called the attack a ""serious assault on Lebanon, its people, its security, [and] sovereignty"" and warned that ""this crime will never pass without response and punishment"".Izzat Al-Rishq, a member of the Hamas Political bureau called it a ""cowardly assassination by the Zionist occupation"". Israel's military has not commented, telling the BBC it does not respond to reports in foreign media. Israel is widely reported to commit targeted killings on foreign soil, but rarely comments on cross-border strikes. Mark Regev, adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, did not say that Israel was responsible but called the attack a ""surgical strike"" against Hamas's leadership.The country and the wider region now faces an anxious wait to see how Hezbollah reacts, and whether Israel's war in Gaza spills over into Lebanon.","Senior Hamas official Saleh al-Arouri has been killed in an Israeli drone strike on Beirut’s southern suburb of Dahiyeh, the Palestinian group and Lebanese media outlets say. Al-Arouri was killed on Tuesday in a “treacherous Zionist strike”, Hamas said on its official channel. Hamas politburo member Izzat al-Sharq called it a “cowardly assassination”. Al-Arouri was a senior official in Hamas’s politburo and was known to be deeply involved in its military affairs. He had previously headed the group’s presence in the occupied West Bank. Samir Findi Abu Amer and Azzam Al-Aqraa Abu Ammar, leaders of Hamas’ armed wing – the Qassam Brigades – were also killed, Hamas said in a message on its Telegram channel. It named four other members of the group who were also killed. Earlier, Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said the blast killed at least six people and that it was carried out by an Israeli drone. Hamas said al-Arouri’s killing would not “undermine the continued brave resistance” in Gaza, where the Palestinian group’s fighters are battling Israeli ground forces. “It proves once more the utter failure of the enemy to achieve any of its aggressive goals in the Gaza Strip,” senior Hamas official Izzat al-Rishq said in a statement. The group’s top leader Ismail Haniyeh condemned the attack as a “terrorist act”, a violation of Lebanon’s sovereignty, and an expansion of Israel’s circle of hostility against Palestinians. Haniyeh said in televised remarks that Hamas “will never be defeated”. There was no immediate comment from Israel. Mark Regev, an adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told the United States news channel MSNBC that Israel had not taken responsibility for the attack but “whoever did it, it must be clear that this was not an attack on the Lebanese state”. “Whoever did this did a surgical strike against the Hamas leadership,” Regev said in an interview. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned the killing. His office said in a statement that the attack “aims to draw Lebanon into a new phase of confrontations” with Israel at a time when Hamas ally Hezbollah has been exchanging daily cross-border fire with Israeli forces in northern Israel, the statement said. Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr, reporting from Beirut, said there was “panic” in the Lebanese capital after the attack. “The targeted killing made many people here in the capital feel that this conflict could widen and could escalate, and all eyes are now on Hezbollah’s reaction,” Khodr said. Iran, which supports both Hamas and Hezbollah, said al-Arouri’s killing would create more resistance against Israel, its state media reported. “The martyr’s blood will undoubtedly ignite another surge in the veins of resistance and the motivation to fight against the Zionist occupiers not only in Palestine but also in the region and among all freedom seekers worldwide,” Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said. Kanaani also condemned the violation of Lebanon’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Netanyahu had threatened to kill al-Arouri long before Israel’s latest assault on the besieged Gaza Strip. Israeli political analyst Akiva Eldar told Al Jazeera the killing was a much needed success for Netanyahu.    Imad Harb, director of research at the Arab Center Washington DC, agreed, saying Israel carried out the attack in search for what has become an elusive win. “So far, the Israelis have not been able to call a victory in Gaza, so assassinating Hamas leaders is partly something that they wanted to do anyway,” he told Al Jazeera. “This is an achievement for the Israeli army and for the Israeli politicians.” Since Israeli forces and Hezbollah began exchanging fire across the Lebanese-Israeli border on October 8, the fighting has largely been concentrated a few kilometres inside each country. But on several occasions, Israel’s air force has hit what it said were Hezbollah positions deeper inside Lebanon. Harb said the killing of al-Arouri is a “dangerous escalation” because it took place in Hezbollah’s area of operations, far from the border. Harb predicted Hezbollah would likely step up attacks on Israel in response to the killing but would stop short of escalating the conflict into an all-out war. Meanwhile, at mosques in Arura, the hometown of the slain Hamas leader in the West Bank, Palestinians gathered to mourn al-Arouri’s death. Protests and gatherings also took place in Ramallah and several nearby towns, such as Deir Qaddis. A general strike in Ramallah has also been called for Wednesday."
Al Jazeera bureau chief's son Hamza al-Dahdouh among journalists killed in Gaza,"Hamza, son of Al Jazeera’s Wael Dahdouh, killed in Israeli attack in Gaza",0.6527916280201007,2024-01-08,2024-01-07,"The eldest son of Al Jazeera's Gaza bureau chief has been killed in an Israeli strike in southern Gaza. Hamza al-Dahdouh, an Al Jazeera network journalist and cameraman, was driving in a car with other journalists along a road between Khan Younis and Rafah on Sunday when it was hit. Freelance journalist Mustafa Thuraya was also killed. A third journalist, Hazem Rajab, was seriously injured.Four other members of bureau chief Wael al-Dahdouh's family have been killed.His wife Amna, his grandchild Adam, his 15-year-old son Mahmoud and seven-year-old daughter Sham were killed in an Israeli strike in Nuseirat refugee camp in October.  According to Al Jazeera correspondent Hisham Zaqout, Hamza al-Dahdouh and a group of journalists were en route to the Moraj area north-east of Rafah - which was designated a ""humanitarian zone"" by the Israeli army - but which had reportedly experienced recent bombings.Many displaced Gazans had fled to the area to escape the bombardment in other regions of the territory. Hamza had intended to report on the unfolding situation and the aftermath of the bombings in the area, according to Al Jazeera.In a statement to the BBC, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said: ""An IDF aircraft identified and struck a terrorist who operated an aircraft that posed a threat to IDF troops.""We are aware of the reports that during the strike, two other suspects who were in the same vehicle as the terrorist were also hit.""Live footage from Al Jazeera showed the aftermath of the strike on the car they had been travelling in. It also showed his father Wael al-Dahdouh in tears, holding his hand and standing next to his body in a morgue in Khan Younis. He was buried in the southern city of Rafah. ""Hamza was not just part of me. He was the whole of me. He was the soul of my soul. These are tears of sadness, of loss. These are tears of humanity,"" his father said at the funeral. ""I call on the world to look closely at what's happening in Gaza.""Wael al-Dahdouh was himself wounded and his cameraman Samer Abu Daqqa was killed in a separate strike while filming last month. Mr al-Dahdouh, who has eight children, continued reporting on the war in Gaza.Hamza al-Dahdouh had one million followers on Instagram. His final post before he was killed was about his father. ""You are steadfast and patient. Do not despair of God's mercy. Be certain that he will reward you,"" he said. The Al Jazeera Media Network said in a statement that it ""strongly condemns the Israeli occupation forces' targeting of Palestinian journalists' car"".""The assassination of Mustafa and Hamza... whilst they were on their way to carry out their duty in the Gaza Strip, reaffirms the need to take immediate necessary legal measures against the occupation forces to ensure that there is no impunity,"" it added.It also alleged that the strike ""confirms without a doubt the Israeli forces' determination continue these brutal attacks against journalists and their families, aiming to discourage them from performing their mission, violating the principles of freedom of the press and undermines the right to life"".US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Hamza al-Dahdouh's death was ""an unimaginable tragedy"".He added that ""far too many innocent Palestinian men, women and children"" have died in the war.Mark Regev, a senior adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told the BBC's World This Weekend that ""Israel does not deliberately target journalists"". ""We're the only country in the Middle East that actually does have a free press. We're the only country in the entire region where the press can write bad things and criticise the leaders of government,"" he said. ""To say Israel deliberately targets the press is ridiculous, we're the only country that actually enshrines the free press.""More than 75 journalists have been killed since the war in Gaza started.More than 22,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. ","Hamza Dahdouh, the eldest son of Al Jazeera’s Gaza bureau chief, Wael Dahdouh, has been killed by an Israeli missile strike in the western part of Khan Younis, Gaza. Journalist Mustafa Thuraya was also killed in the attack, when the vehicle they were travelling in near al-Mawasi, a supposedly safe area towards the southwest, was struck by the missile. A third passenger, Hazem Rajab, was seriously injured. According to reports from Al Jazeera correspondents, Hamza and Mustafa’s vehicle was targeted as they were trying to interview civilians displaced by previous bombings. Hamza, 27, was a journalist like his father. Mustafa was also in his 20s. Speaking from the cemetery where his son had been laid to rest, Wael seemed subdued yet resigned, saying he was one of the droves of people in Gaza today who are bidding bitter farewells to their loved ones every day. He vowed to remain on his path of showing the world what is happening in Gaza, despite the pain of one loss after another. “Hamza was everything to me, the eldest boy, he was the soul of my soul … these are the tears of parting and loss, the tears of humanity,” he said. The Al Jazeera Media Network strongly condemned the attack, adding: “The assassination of Mustafa and Hamza … whilst they were on their way to carry out their duty in the Gaza Strip, reaffirms the need to take immediate necessary legal measures against the occupation forces to ensure that there is no impunity.” Reacting to the news, Gaza’s media office condemned the killing of the two journalists, denouncing “in the strongest terms this heinous crime”. Hamza was extremely attached to his family and was devastated when he heard on October 25 that an Israeli raid had hit the house his family was sheltering at in the Nuseirat refugee camp. He found out shortly after that his mother Amna, brother Mahmoud, 15, sister Sham, 7, and nephew Adam, 1, had beenkilled in the Israeli attack. His grief after their loss seemed to motivate him to work harder on covering the war on Gaza, according to his colleague. As news of Hamza’s killing spread, his wife of one year rushed to the cemetery, as did his surviving siblings, for one last look before he was buried. Wael stood by his son’s head, consoling the rest of his family as they tried to comprehend the sudden loss. His composure and strength have made Wael Dahdouh much more than the Al Jazeera Arabic bureau chief in Gaza. He is the face of the channel’s coverage of Israel’s war on Gaza and a symbol of the resilience of Gaza’s people. When he lost his wife, son, daughter, and grandson to the Israeli air raid at the end of October, the world watched, aghast, as he ran into the hospital where the bodies of his four loved ones had been moved. After saying his emotional goodbyes to his children, grandchild, and life partner, he also seemed more determined than ever to perform his job. Then in mid-December, he was badly injured in an attack thatkilled his colleague Samer Abudaqa, but he was again out and about covering the news shortly after. The Palestinian Journalists Syndicate has documented the killing of 102 journalists and the injury of 71 others by Israeli forces since hostilities began in October. The list of Al Jazeera journalists and staff who have lost members of their families or have died themselves is also growing. In December, Anas al-Shariflost his fatherto an Israeli air raid that struck his family’s house in Jabalia. A few days earlier, on December 6, Moamen Al Sharafi, a correspondent for Al Jazeera Arabic, had22 members of his family killedwhen an Israeli attack hit the house they were sheltering in at the Jabalia refugee camp. In late October, broadcast engineer Mohamed Abu Al-Qumsanlost 19 members of his family, including his father and two sisters, during Israeli air raids on the same refugee camp."
Israel says it mistakenly killed three hostages in Gaza campaign,Israeli army says it mistakenly killed three captives held in Gaza,0.6516067979343688,2023-12-15,2023-12-15,,"The Israeli army has killed three captives held by Palestinian armed groups in Gaza after “mistakenly” identifying them as a threat, according to Israeli military officials. The military said on Friday that thecaptiveswere killed during combat with Palestinian groups in Gaza and expressed its condolences to the families while saying there would be “full transparency” in the investigation into the incident, which is “under review”. “During combat in Shujayea, the [Israeli army] mistakenly identified three Israeli hostages as a threat. As a result, the troops fired toward them and they were killed,” the army said in a statement. “The [Israeli army] began reviewing the incident immediately … Immediate lessons from the event have been learned, which have been passed on to all [Israeli army] troops in the field,” it added, expressing “deep remorse over the tragic incident”. The hostages were identified as three young men who had been abducted from Israeli communities during the Hamas attack on October 7 – 28-year-old Yotam Haim, 25-year-old Samer Al-Talalka and 26-year-old Alon Shamriz. The army’s chief spokesman, Daniel Hagari, said Israeli troops found the hostages and erroneously identified them as a threat. He said it was believed that the three had either fled their captors or been abandoned. Israeli troops have engaged in fierce battles with Palestinian fighters in the area in recent days. About 250 captives were taken into Gaza by Palestinian groups during the October 7 attack on southern Israel, which killed around 1,200 people, according to Israeli authorities. Israel’s war on Gaza has killed more than 18,700 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, most of them women and children. Thousands more are missing and trapped beneath the rubble. The Israeli government has repeatedly stated that bringing home all of the hostages is one of its principal aims in the war. To date, 110 of the captives have been freed, mostly during a seven-day truce last month in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli jails. Israel has also repatriated eight bodies, including on Friday those of dual Israeli-French national Elia Toledano, 28, abducted from an electronic music festival, and two 19-year-old soldiers. The deaths were announced as US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the US and Israel werediscussing a timetablefor scaling back the offensive against Hamas, even though they agree the overall fight will take months. Sullivan also met with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to discuss the besieged enclave’s postwar future. US President Joe Biden’s administration has expressed unease over Israel’s failure to reduce civilian casualties and its plans for the future of Gaza, but the White House continues to offer wholehearted support for Israel with weapons shipments and diplomatic backing. Israeli air raids and shelling continued Friday, including in the southern city of Rafah, part of the shrinking areas of tiny, densely populated Gaza to which Palestinian civilians had been told by Israel to evacuate.

Iran seizes oil tanker St Nikolas near Oman,Iran seizes oil tanker off Oman in dispute with US,0.647627056965379,2024-01-11,2024-01-11,"Iran has seized a Marshall Islands-flagged oil tanker in the Gulf of Oman. Armed men wearing masks reportedly boarded the vessel St Nikolas, close to the Omani port of Sohar, and ordered it to sail to an Iranian port.Iranian state media, quoting the navy, said the seizure was in retaliation for the ship and oil it had aboard being confiscated by the US last year. The St Nikolas was in transit between the Iraqi port of Basra and its intended destination in Turkey.UK Maritime Trade Operations said on Thursday it had received a report that four to five ""unauthorised persons"", reportedly wearing ""military style black uniforms with black masks"", had boarded the ship at 03:30 GMT.They added that communications with the vessel had been lost and the authorities were investigating. Iranian state media quoted the army as saying the vessel is American, although it is Greek-owned.The company that manages it, Empire Navigation, said it was loaded with 145,000 tonnes of crude oil and was carrying 18 Filipinos and one Greek citizen as crew.The St Nikolas was seized in April by the US under its previous name, the Suez Rajan, as part of sanctions enforcement against Iran. Suez Rajan Limited, which formerly chartered the ship, later pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate sanctions by covertly selling and transporting oil abroad on behalf of Iran. The US has called for the immediate release of the vessel and its crew, describing the seizure as the latest attempt by Iran to disrupt international commerce.""We believe this kind of action will simply add uncertainty for commercial shipping and for regional and global economies,"" said US State Department spokesman Vedant Patel. This latest act appears to be separate from attacks carried out by Houthi rebels from Yemen in the Red Sea on the opposite side of the Arabian peninsula.Thursday's incident was in a different ocean from the Houthis' usual area of operations - where they have been attacking any ships they suspect of being linked to Israel in retaliation for the country's actions in Gaza. The US and UK have hinted they could take military action against Yemen's Houthi rebels following the largest attack yet.Carrier-based jets and warships shot down 21 drones and missiles launched by the Iran-backed group on Tuesday night.The UN Security Council passed a resolution on Wednesday demanding an immediate end to the Houthi attacks.","Iran has seized a tanker with Iraqi crude destined for Turkey in retaliation for the confiscation last year of the same vessel and its oil by the United States, Iranian state media reported, a move likely to stoke regional tensions. “The Navy of the Islamic Republic of Iran seized an American oil tanker in the waters of the Gulf of Oman in accordance with a court order,” the state-run IRNA news agency said. “After the theft ofIranian oilby the United States last year, St Nikolas tanker was seized by Iran’s Navy”, the navy said, as cited by the Iranian news agency Fars. The US condemned what it called an “unlawful seizure” and demanded Iran “immediately release the ship and its crew”. The seizure comes after weeks of attacks by Yemen’s Iranian-alignedHouthison vessels in the Red Sea. The Houthi rebels say they are carrying out the attacks in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza amid Israel’s assault on the territory. The group’s attacks have raised the risk of possible retaliatory strikes from US-led forces patrolling the busy waterway, especially after aUnited Nations Security Council voteon Wednesday condemning the Houthis. But while the Houthis have been concentrated on theBab al-Mandab Strait, to the southwest of the Arabian Peninsula, Thursday’s incident was located closer to the Strait of Hormuz, between Oman and Iran. The British maritime security firm Ambrey said the incident began at about 7:30am (03:30 GMT) when several armed men boarded the Marshall Islands-flagged St Nikolas, around 50 nautical miles east of Sohar in Oman, and then headed towards Bandar-e-Jask in Iran. TankerTrackers.com, which tracks and reports global shipments of crude oil, said the tanker was carrying “Iraqi oil” and previously went by the name Suez Rajan. Ambrey said the recently renamed tanker was previously prosecuted and fined for carrying sanctioned Iranian oil, which was confiscated by US authorities. The yearlong dispute ended with the US Department of Justice seizing one million barrels of Iranian crude. United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO), which is linked to the British military and provides warnings to sailors in the Middle East, said the incident began in waters between Oman and Iran, and it had received a report from the ship’s security manager of hearing “unknown voices over the phone” alongside the ship’s captain. Ambrey said that the men covered surveillance cameras as they boarded the vessel. As the tanker appeared to veer towards Bandar-e-Jask, its tracker was turned off, it added.    The St Nikolas was sailing from the Iraqi port of Basra to Turkey, according to MarineTraffic.com, a tracking website. The vessel was manned by a crew of 19, including 18 Filipino nationals and one Greek national, the operator said, adding that Turkish oil refiner Tupras chartered it. The Gulf of Oman, a key route for the oil industry that separates Oman and Iran, has witnessed a series of hijackings and attacks over the years, often involving Iran. Since the collapse of Iran’s nuclear deal, Iran and theUS Navy’s Fifth Fleet, which patrols the Middle East, also have had a series of tense encounters in the waterway. The US and its allies have also been seizing Iranian oil cargoes since 2019, which has led to a series of attacks in the Middle East attributed to Iran, as well as ship seizures by its military and paramilitary forces, threatening global shipping."
ICJ says Israel must prevent genocide in Gaza,ICJ orders Israel to prevent acts of genocide in Gaza,0.6444853981201557,2024-01-26,2024-01-26,"The UN's top court has ordered Israel to take all measures to prevent genocidal acts in Gaza, but stopped short of telling it to halt the war.The highly anticipated hearing was part of a controversial case brought by South Africa.South Africa had asked the court to order Israel to stop military action straight away pending a decision on whether Israel has committed genocide.Israel has vehemently rejected the accusation as ""wholly unfounded"".Friday's hearing at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) at The Hague was the first time the judges have issued a ruling as part of the case which began two weeks ago. A verdict on the central allegation of genocide is expected to take much longer, possibly years.Although the court did not call for a halt to Israel's military action, as South Africa had asked it to do, it is being interpreted as a victory for those who support South Africa's case. The ICJ found it did have jurisdiction on the matter, and decided there was a plausible case under the 1948 Genocide Convention, and that the Palestinian population in Gaza was at real risk of irreparable damage.""For the implementation of the international rule of law, the [ICJ's] decision is a momentous one,"" said South Africa in a statement. It called Friday's ruling a ""significant milestone in the search for justice for the Palestinian people"".The Palestinian foreign minister said the ruling showed that ""no state is above the law"", adding it ""should serve as a wake-up call for Israel and actors who enabled its entrenched impunity"".Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not address the ruling directly but said ""Israel's commitment to international law is unwavering. Equally unwavering is our sacred commitment to defend our country."" He said South Africa's allegation that Israel was committing genocide was ""not only false, it's outrageous, and decent people everywhere should reject it"".Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant dismissed the ruling, saying Israel ""does not need to be lectured on morality in order to distinguish between terrorists and the civilian population in Gaza"".A spokesman for Hamas, the Palestinian group whose unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October triggered the war, called the outcome ""important"", saying it contributed to ""isolating Israel"", Reuters news agency reported. The ICJ ordered Israel to take a series of measures against potentially genocidal acts against Palestinians in Gaza. These include measures not only on the battlefield but also against public incitement to genocide. It also ordered Israel to take ""immediate and effective measures"" to enable the provision of aid to people in Gaza.The court said Israel must report on its compliance to the court within one month.Although orders issued by the ICJ are legally binding, it does not have the power to enforce them. Israel is not expected to commit itself to the orders.More than 26,000 Palestinians - mostly women and children - have been killed in Gaza by Israel's bombardment since 7 October, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. Israel launched its offensive after waves of Hamas gunmen burst through the border early that day, killing about 1,200 people - mainly civilians - and taking about 250 others back to Gaza as hostages.Correction 13th February: This article wrongly reported that about 1,300 people had been killed following the 7th October attack by Hamas. This was based on counting those who later died from their injuries in addition to the figure of more than 1,200. The article has been amended to now refer to about 1,200 deaths, a figure which includes those deaths and which Israel says is not final.","The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has ordered Israel to take action to prevent acts of genocide in Gaza and provide humanitarian aid to Palestinians, though it did not call on it to immediately stop its military campaign. The court did not rule at this stage on the core of the case brought by South Africa – whether genocide has occurred in Gaza – but an overwhelming majority of its 17 judges presiding over the case voted on Friday foremergency measures to be implemented. Delivering its interim ruling, the court ordered six provisional measures. It said Israel must take all steps within its power to prevent the commission of acts within the scope of Article 2 of the 1948 Genocide Convention. Israel must also prevent its troops from committing genocidal acts, prevent incitement to commit genocide, allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza, and take effective measures to ensure the preservation of evidence related to allegations under the Genocide Convention. The ruling also called for Israel to report to the court in one month on its steps to implement the measures. The court did not order a cessation of hostilities in Gaza, where Israel’s military action has killed more than 26,000 Palestinians since the war began on October 7. But it did urge Israel to bring more measures to protect Palestinians, which it called a protected group under the Genocide Convention. Delivering the judgement, Court President Joan E Donoghue said there is sufficient evidence of dispute for the genocide case to proceed, and that the ICJ has the jurisdiction to rule on the matter. In the meantime, until a final ruling is delivered, she said the court was “of the view that Israel must take measures within its power to prevent and punish the direct and public incitement to commit genocide”.    Fifteen of the 17 judges voted for all the emergency measures to be implemented. Uganda’s Julia Sebutinde was the only judge to vote against all the measures. Israeli judge Aharon Barak, one of the judges sitting at The Hague, said, “Although I am convinced there is no plausibility of genocide,” he voted for two of the measures. He said he joined the majority “in the hope that the measure will help to decrease tensions and discourage damaging rhetoric”. Barak added he voted in favour of the measure on getting aid to Gaza in the hope that it “will alleviate the consequences of the armed conflict for the most vulnerable”. Thomas Macmanus, a law professor at Queen Mary University in London, told Al Jazeera he was not surprised that the court did not ask for a ceasefire because, in a way, it would “render Israel defenceless against an attack, and that’s not really within the purview of the court in this case”. “But what they are asking … they asked to stop the killing,” he said. “Maybe not a total cessation of hostility, and maybe now Israel can have very targeted counterterrorism operations, but they cannot continue with the attack on Gaza as we have seen over the last hundred or more days,” he added. South Africa hailed the decision and called it a “decisive victory” for international law. “South Africa sincerely hopes that Israel will not act to frustrate the application of this Order, as it has publicly threatened to do, but that it will instead act to comply with it fully, as it is bound to do,” South Africa’s Department of International Relations and Cooperation said in a statement. Palestinian Minister of Foreign Affairs Riyadh Maliki issued a statement on the ruling and welcomed the order, calling it an “important reminder” that no one is above the law. “It breaks Israel’s entrenched culture of criminality and impunity, which has characterised its decades-long occupation, dispossession, persecution, and apartheid in Palestine,” he said. Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told the Reuters news agency that the ruling was a significant development that contributed to isolating Israel and exposing its crimes in Gaza. “We call for forcing the occupation to implement the court’s decisions,” he added. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu slammed the ruling and reiterated that Israel had an “inherent right to defend itself” and that the “vile attempt” to deny this right was “blatant discrimination against the Jewish state”. While the ICJ’s decisions are final and cannot be appealed, the court also cannot enforce the measures.   "
Qatar 'appalled' by reported criticism from Israel's Netanyahu,Qatar ‘appalled’ at alleged Netanyahu criticism of mediation in Gaza war,0.641040149892865,2024-01-25,2024-01-25,"Qatar has said it is ""appalled"" by remarks attributed to Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in which he apparently called its role as a mediator in the Gaza war ""problematic"".Israeli TV broadcast what it said was a recording of Mr Netanyahu telling the families of hostages held by Hamas that ""you don't hear me thanking Qatar"". ""They have leverage... because they finance [Hamas],"" he reportedly adds.Qatar said the comments, if true, were ""irresponsible"" but ""not surprising"".The tiny Gulf emirate has had high-level contacts with Israel since the 1990s, but they have never officially established diplomatic relations.Qatar has long championed the Palestinian cause and hosts political leaders of Hamas, which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK, the US and other countries.It has also provided hundreds of millions of dollars of aid for Gaza, which has been subject to a crippling blockade by Israel and Egypt since 2006, when Hamas won legislative elections. The blockade was tightened the following year when Hamas reinforced its power in Gaza by violently ousting Palestinian Authority (PA) forces.Since 2018, Israeli governments have allowed Qatar to pay the wages of tens of thousands of civil servants in Gaza's Hamas-run government, financially support the poorest families, and fund fuel deliveries for the territory's sole power plant. Qatar insists the funding was only for civilian and humanitarian purposes. The policy sparked controversy within Israel, with critics warning it was helping Hamas to stay in power and fund its military activities.   Mr Netanyahu - who has been re-elected to office for all but one of the past 15 years - said it was a way to dissuade attacks on Israel and prevent a humanitarian disaster in Gaza.Following the cross-border attacks on southern Israel on 7 October, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 250 others were taken back to Gaza as hostages, he dismissed as a ""big lie"" accusations that he had also encouraged the payments in order to strengthen Hamas at the expense of the PA.Israel responded to the attacks by launching a large-scale military campaign in Gaza with the aim of destroying Hamas. More than 25,000 people have been killed in the fighting, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.Qatar used its ties with Hamas to help broker a week-long pause in the fighting in late November, during which 105 Israeli and foreign hostages were freed in exchange for some 240 Palestinians held in Israeli jails.The emirate has for weeks been trying to broker a new ceasefire, with Gaza's humanitarian crisis worsening and with the Israeli government coming under mounting domestic pressure to secure the release of the remaining hostages.On Tuesday, Israel's Channel 12 TV released what it said was a recording of Mr Netanyahu telling hostages' families: ""You don't hear me thanking Qatar. Have you noticed?""""Why? Because for me it is essentially no different from the UN or Red Cross, and in a certain sense is even more problematic - I have no illusions about them.""""But I'm ready to use any actor right now that helps me bring [the hostages] home,"" he added.Israel has accused the UN and Red Cross of not doing enough to support the hostages or to help get them freed.The prime minister purportedly said the reason Qatar could help was because of ""leverage"" over Hamas.""Why do they have leverage? Because they finance them.""On Wednesday night, Qatar's foreign ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari wrote on X, formerly Twitter: ""These remarks if validated, are irresponsible and destructive to the efforts to save innocent lives, but are not surprising."" ""For months, and following a successful mediation last year that led to the release of more than 100 hostages, Qatar has been engaged in regular dialogue with the negotiating parties including Israeli institutions, attempting to establish the framework for a new hostage agreement and the immediate entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza.""He added that Mr Netanyahu appeared to be undermining the mediation efforts ""for reasons that appear to serve his political career"".In response, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich wrote on X: ""Qatar is a country that supports and finances terrorism. It is Hamas's patron and is largely responsible for the massacre of Israeli citizens by Hamas."" ""One thing is certain: Qatar will not have one iota of involvement in Gaza on the day after the war,"" he added.There was no immediate comment from Qatar's foreign ministry.Meanwhile US President Biden is sending the director of the CIA to try to broker a new deal on hostages held in Gaza, the BBC's US partner CBS has confirmed. William Burns will meet the Qatari PM and directors of Mossad, Israel's secret service, in France.Correction 13th February: This article wrongly reported that about 1,300 people had been killed following the 7th October attack by Hamas.

At a meeting this week with thefamilies of captivesbeing held in Gaza, Netanyahu blamed Qatar for financing Hamas and said he was upset at a decision by the United States to extend the presence of a military base in the Gulf state, according to Israeli news outlet Channel 12. “These remarks if validated, are irresponsible and destructive to the efforts to save innocent lives, but are not surprising,” Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Majed al-Ansari said in a post on X on Wednesday. We are appalled by the alleged remarks attributed to the Israeli Prime Minister in various media reports about Qatar’s mediation role. These remarks if validated, are irresponsible and destructive to the efforts to save innocent lives, but are not surprising.For months, and… — د. ماجد محمد الأنصاري Dr. Majed Al Ansari (@majedalansari)January 24, 2024  Qatar, along with Egypt, has repeatedly engaged in negotiations to broker atruce in Gazaand ensure the entry of humanitarian aid into the besieged enclave. In November, it helped secure a weeklong pause in fighting in which more than100 captiveswere released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. The Gulf state remains involved in talks aimed at securing a new deal for the release of roughly 130 captives still being held by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups. Al-Ansari said Netanyahu’s leaked comments were detrimental to those efforts. “If the reported remarks are found to be true, the Israeli PM would only be obstructing and undermining the mediation process, for reasons that appear to serve his political career instead of prioritizing saving innocent lives, including Israeli hostages,” he said. Netanyahu, in his reportedly leaked remarks, told the families of the captives that he had intentionally not thanked Qatar for its mediation efforts, claiming it could put more pressure on Hamas. “You don’t hear me thanking Qatar … who are essentially no different from the United Nations or Red Cross, and even more problematic. I have no illusions with regards to them,” Netanyahu purportedly said in the recording obtained by Channel 12. “They have the means to put pressure [on Hamas]. And why? Because they finance them,” Netanyahu said. Al Jazeera’s Stefanie Dekker, reporting from occupied East Jerusalem, said any leak from Netanyahu’s office “isn’t usually by chance” and “is usually done for a political reason – what that is you can only question”. Netanyahuis under a lot of pressure from “all sides”, domestically and internationally, and “from people on the streets … to do more to bring back the captives”, Dekker said on Thursday.    Hassan Barari, a professor at Qatar University, told Al Jazeera that the Israeli prime minister’s alleged criticism of Qatar’s mediation efforts reflects frustration over his failures in the war. “Qatar has stepped in many times, and Qatar has succeeded in mediating between Israelis and Hamas,” Barari said, calling the comments a sign of “desperation”. “Netanyahu wants everyone to do things his own way. He fails on the battleground, he fails to convince his own people that he’s doing the right thing, and he wants to blame others and pass the buck for his failures on the Qataris,” he added. Qatar, which has hosted the political leadership of Hamas, has in recent years sent millions of dollars in aid to the Hamas-run Gaza Stripin cooperationwith the Israeli government “to try and keep the situation there from exploding … because of the restrictions and blockade”, Dekker reported. Israel imposed a blockade on the Gaza Strip in 2007, limiting and controlling the flow of people and goods into and out of the coastal territory. Responding to al-Ansari’s comments, Israel’s ultranationalist, far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich accused Qatar of supporting “terrorism”. “Qatar is a country that supports terrorism and finances terrorism. She [Qatar] is the patron of Hamas and is largely responsible for the massacre committed by Hamas of Israeli citizens,” Smotrich wrote on X. Members of Netanyahu’s far-right ruling coalition have been pushing for an escalation of the war on Gaza, and the prime minister this weekrejected a proposalby Hamas to end the conflict and release captives in exchange for withdrawing Israeli forces, releasing prisoners and accepting the armed group’s governance of Gaza. Palestinian officials say at least 25,700 people have been killed and more than 63,000 wounded in Israeli attacks on Gaza since October 7, when an attack by Hamas inside Israel killed some 1,140 people.

US drone attack: What is Tower 22 and why are US troops in Jordan?,"What is Tower 22, the Jordan-based US outpost targeted in a drone strike?",0.6396126143720926,2024-01-29,2024-01-29,"An Iran-backed militia group has said it was responsible for a drone strike at a US military base in Jordan that killed three American troops.At least 34 other service members were injured in the attack at the base, known as Tower 22. The White House blamed Iran and vowed a ""very consequential response"".But Iran called the accusation ""baseless"" and said it was ""not involved in the decision-making of resistance groups"".US officials have sought for weeks to prevent high tensions on several fronts in the region from boiling over into a wider war.But Sunday marked the first time US soldiers had been killed by enemy fire in the region since Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel.The attack targeted a US military base known as Tower 22 in north-eastern Jordan, near the Syrian border.A defence official told the BBC's US partner CBS News that the enemy drone came in ""very low and very slow"" at the same time that an American drone was returning to the base from a mission.The auto-response features of the base's air defence system were turned off so as not to shoot down the US drone, the official said.As a result, there was little to no warning for troops stationed at Tower 22, who were reportedly still in their sleeping quarters when the drone arrived.There are about 350 US forces stationed at the base, conducting key functions including supporting the coalition to defeat Islamic State, according to US Central Command (CentCom).Among those injured, eight service members were medically evacuated from Jordan to receive higher-level care, but they are in stable condition, CentCom said.The base which was hit in a deadly drone attack in a north-west corner of Jordan is one of more than a dozen where US military personnel operate across Iraq, Jordan and Syria.In recent months, these bases - ranging in size from a military outpost such as Tower 22, which was hit in Jordan, to al-Asad air base in western Iraq - have been attacked by militias trained, funded and equipped by Iran.There are about 3,000 US troops based in Jordan, a key US ally, and 2,500 in Iraq - there at the invitation of the Iraqi government as part of a US-led coalition to prevent a resurgence of the jihadist Islamic State group, which still has a presence there after being routed in 2017.There are also about 900 US personnel in Syria, officially there to support its anti-IS ally the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in Syria's semi-autonomous north-east region. The Syria government opposes the US presence in its country, calling it an occupation.The US also maintains many more bases further afield across the Middle East, including three major air bases in the Gulf and a port in Bahrain which serves as the headquarters of the US Naval Forces Central Command and the US Fifth Fleet.The Islamic Resistance in Iraq said it was responsible for the attack in a statement posted to Telegram on Sunday.It said it targeted three US bases in Syria and Jordan - Shaddadi, Rukban and Tanf - as well as an Israeli oil facility in the Mediterranean.The group emerged in late 2023, right after the beginning of Israel's bombardment in Gaza in response to Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October.It consists of several Iran-affiliated militias operating in Iraq and has claimed other attacks against US forces in recent weeks.""Islamic Resistance in Iraq"" is believed to be an umbrella term for various Shia militia groups such as Kataib Hezbollah, Nujaba and Kataib Sayyid al-Shuhada, that have a long history of targeting US bases in Iraq and Syria.Tehran refers to its networks of proxies and allied groups in the region as the ""Axis of Resistance"", a kind of forward defence against its enemies.The point of creating these ghost groups is to make it difficult for Washington to pin the attacks on a specific culprit.President Joe Biden said the ""despicable and wholly unjust"" attacks on Sunday had been carried out by ""radical Iran-backed militant groups"".He also vowed the US ""will hold all those responsible to account at a time and manner of our choosing"".All eyes are now on the White House, which is under pressure to respond forcefully to the attack, with some lawmakers and current and former officials calling for strikes against Iranian targets.Mr Biden's dilemma is how to retaliate, who to hit and where to hit. The big question is whether the US can deter attacks by hitting back hard or whether it will add fuel to a growing fire in the region.Mick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defence for the Middle East, told the BBC he believes that the US should respond with ""more force than we have used to date"".""It's been clear that the US does not want this war in Gaza to expand in the region. It's also been clear that Iran does want it to expand,"" he said. ""The only thing they understand is force. It's time to use it.""He added: ""I believe that even targets inside Iran are being included as options to the White House from the Pentagon.""UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has urged Iran to de-escalate tensions in the region.","The United States military announced on Sunday that three US soldiers were killed and at least 34 were wounded in adrone attacktargeting Tower 22, a remote logistics outpost near the Jordan-Syrian border. The attack has elicited a strong reaction from Washington with President Joe Biden pledging to hold the attackers to account. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group of Iran-backed armed groups in the region, claimed the attacks, saying it was in response to US support to Israel’s war on Gaza, which has killed more than 26,000 people. Here is what we know about the drone strike and the attack site: Tower 22, which houses a small US logistics outpost, is located in Jordan’s northeast close to the borders with Iraq and Syria. Public information about the outpost is limited. However, according to media reports, Tower 22 serves as a supply hub for the nearby US garrison ofal-Tanflocated across the border in Syria. At least 350 US Army and Air Force soldiers are also stationed there. It is unclear what type of weapons are kept at the outpost and the nature of air defences used. Since the beginning ofSyria’s war in 2011, Washington has spent hundreds of millions of dollars tohelp Ammanset up an elaborate surveillance system known as the Border Security Programme to stem infiltration by armed fighters from Syria and Iraq. Al-Tanf, located on the Baghdad-Damascus highway, had been key in the fight against the ISIL (ISIS) armed group and has assumed a role as part of a US strategy to contain Iran’s military build-up in eastern Syria. Currently about 2,500 US troops are stationed in Iraq while 900 deployed in north-east Syria. Jordan has a close security pact with the US and is one of the few regional allies who hold extensive exercises with American troops. Jordan’s army is one of the largest recipients of Washington’s foreign military financing.  The killing of three US service members in an overnight drone strike is the first since Israel launched its brutal military campaign in Gaza on October 7, which has killed more than 26,000 people and triggered responses from regional armed groups. The unmanned aerial strike targeted the living quarters in Tower 22 wounding 34 soldiers, some of whom sustained minor cuts or brain trauma, according to media reports. The US military said that at least eight of the wounded soldiers were flown out of Jordan for treatment. Experts have raised questions about why the outpost’s air defences failed to detect the drone. The identity of the soldiers killed in the attack has not been released yet. President Bidensaid he will hold those responsible to account. “While we are still gathering the facts of this attack, we know it was carried out by radical Iran-backed militant groups operating in Syria and Iraq,”Bidensaid in a statement. Iran has denied it was behind the attack. “Iran had no connection and had nothing to do with the attack on the US base,” Tehran’s mission to the United Nations said in astatement on Mondaypublished by the state news agency IRNA. “There is a conflict between US forces and resistance groups in the region, which reciprocate retaliatory attacks.” Jordan condemned the “terrorist attack” and said it was cooperating with ally Washington to secure its frontier and “fight terrorism” on Sunday. Former US PresidentDonald Trumpalso condemned the attack, blaming it on the Biden administration: “This brazen attack on the United States is yet another horrific and tragic consequence of Joe Biden’s weakness and surrender.” US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell, as well as Senator Roger Wicke, all attributed the attack to Iran. Democratic leaders including Chuck Schumer, Jacky Rosen and Hakeem Jeffries also voiced in favour of holding those responsible accountable. Heartbroken and outraged by the death of three U.S. service members and the wounding of many others during the horrific terrorist attack in the Middle East. Praying hard for all affected. Every single malignant actor responsible must be held accountable. — Hakeem Jeffries (@RepJeffries)January 28, 2024  Israel’s Foreign Affairs Minister Israel Katz said: “We stand united in our values and battle against a common enemy. Their sacrifice will always be remembered. Rest in peace. Wishing a speedy recovery to the injured.” Egypt’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs also released a statement, affirming the country’s “strong condemnation of any terrorist acts that threaten the security and stability of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, expressing full solidarity with Jordan in this delicate situation”. The latest attack comes amid anincreasing risk of spilloverof the Gaza war as tensions rise and spread in the region. The US-based, non-profit think tank, Institute for the Study of War,reportedthat Iran-backed militias have launched over 170 attacks targeting US bases in Iraq and Syria since Israel’s war on Gaza in the wake of the deadly Hamas attack on October 7. On January 21, the US Central Command said that Iranian-backed groups attacked theAin al-Assad airbasein Iraq. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq has claimed responsibility for dozens of attacks against bases housing US troops in Iraq and Syria. The group said on Sunday that it will continue its attacks as a response to “the massacres committed by the Zionist entity [Israel] against our people in Gaza” on the “strongholds of the enemies.” Israel has been dragged to the International Court of Justice by South Africa over the accusations of genocide committed in Gaza.

On Monday, the Houthis said they launched a rocket at US warship Lewis B Puller as it sailed through the Gulf of Aden a day earlier. Those attacks have disrupted one of the busiest shipping routes in the world. The groups – a part of the so-called “axis of resistance” – have targeted Washington for its military support to Israel in its war on Gaza. Reporting from Tehran, Al Jazeera’s Resul Serdar saidIran does not want a regional escalation. “The Iranian officials know a direct military confrontation with Israel also means a war with the US which could be a deadly one for Iran,” he said. While Washington has maintained its official stance that it is not at war in the region, it has been retaliating against the Iran-backed groups in Iraq and Syria and carrying out strikes against Yemen’s Houthi military capabilities. Colin Clarke, senior research fellow at the Soufan Group, told Al Jazeera that these attacks show that there was a “regional war”. “There is no denying that. US troops have been killed and the US will respond forcefully whether that is in Iran proper or against the Iranian proxies in the various countries where they operate,” he told Al Jazeera."
Netanyahu says Israel will have security control over Gaza after war,Netanyahu says Israel to manage Gaza’s security indefinitely after the war,0.6383247683230667,2023-11-07,2023-11-07,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will have ""overall security responsibility"" for the Gaza Strip ""for an indefinite period"". Mr Netanyahu's first comments on Israel's plan for Gaza after the war came in an interview with the ABC News network in the US.However, he did not elaborate on the kind of security mechanism such a plan would involve.Israel says it aims to destroy Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2007. Hundreds of Hamas gunmen burst through the border and attacked Israeli communities and a music festival on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people, Israeli authorities say, in the bloodiest such event in Israel's history. Hamas - proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel and many Western governments, including the UK - also took 242 people hostage, the Israeli military says. Israel declared war on Hamas the same day and has been attacking Gaza from land, sea and air since then.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more more than 10,000 people have been killed since Israel began its operation.When asked who should govern Gaza - home to 2.2 million Palestinians - after the war, Mr Netanyahu said only ""those who don't want to continue the way of Hamas"".But he also declared that Israel must have security control.""I think Israel will, for an indefinite period, have the overall security responsibility, because we have seen what happens when we don't have it. ""When we don't have that security responsibility, we have the eruption of Hamas terror on a scale that we couldn't imagine."" Before the war, Israel - along with Egypt, which also shares a border with Gaza - blockaded the territory to try to stop weapons reaching the militant Islamist group and prevent it from carrying out attacks. Israel also controlled its border with Gaza, as well as Gaza's air space and shoreline, implementing a strict security regime and allowing in only certain vetted goods, as well as food, fuel and medicine. Imports were often halted after attacks from the territory.Despite Israel's controls, Hamas and other armed groups have frequently carried out attacks against it, with Israel repeatedly hitting Gaza with air strikes in response.Although it is unclear what type of security control Mr Netanyahu envisages, any return to long-term occupation on the ground is likely to be opposed by the international community.One week after the war began, US President Joe Biden said a re-occupation by Israel of Gaza would be ""a big mistake"".Although Israel pulled its troops and settlers out of Gaza in 2005, the UN considers the territory as remaining under Israeli occupation.","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has suggested that his country will manage Gaza’s security long after the end of its war with Hamas. Asked in an interview on Monday who should govern Gaza after the war, Netanyahu said that he believed Israel would take responsibility for security for an “indefinite period”. “When we don’t have that security responsibility, what we have is the eruption of Hamas terror on a scale that we couldn’t imagine,” Netanyahu said in an interview with ABC News. Netanyahu’s comments came after United States President Joe Biden, his closest ally, last month warned Israel against a full-scale occupation of Gaza, saying that doing so would be “a big mistake”. While Biden has strongly backed Netanyahu’s war against Hamas, the two leaders have differed on tactics, including efforts to prevent civilian casualties and the need for pauses in fighting to allow the delivery of humanitarian aid. On Monday, Netanyahu reiterated that would not accept a ceasefire until Hamas releases its captives in Gaza, but signalled his openness to “tactical little pauses” to allow the movement of people and aid. “There’ll be no ceasefire, general ceasefire, in Gaza without the release of our hostages. As far as tactical little pauses, an hour here, an hour there – we’ve had them before,” Netanyahu said. “I suppose we’ll check the circumstances in order to enable goods, humanitarian goods to come in, or our hostages, individual hostages to leave. But I don’t think there’s going to be a general ceasefire.” Israel is coming under growing international pressure to halt its bombardment of Gaza, which was launched in response to Hamas’s October 7 attacks that Israeli officials say killed at least 1,405 people, mostly civilians. On Monday, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for an urgent ceasefire, warning that the enclave had become a “graveyard for children“. Biden has pressed Netanyahu to agree to “humanitarian pauses” to allow aid into the enclave but backed the Israeli leader’s opposition to a full ceasefire. On Monday, Israel’s military said it had “coordinated” with Jordan to airdrop urgent medical supplies and food to a Jordanian field hospital in the enclave. At least 10,022 Palestinians, including more than 4,100 children, have been killed in Gaza during the month-long war, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run enclave. Netanyahu said on Monday that the loss of any civilian life was a “tragedy” but disputed the reported death toll, saying it included “several thousand” Palestinian fighters. The Israeli leader also accused Hamas of using Gaza’s population as human shields. “It’s a very tough enemy but we can’t let them have immunity,” he said."
Three Israelis killed by Palestinian gunmen at Jerusalem bus stop,"Three killed, several injured in shooting at Jerusalem bus stop",0.6375493622460983,2023-11-30,2023-11-30,"Three Israelis were killed and several others injured when two Palestinian gunmen opened fire at a bus stop in West Jerusalem, Israeli police say.Video showed the gunmen getting out of a car on a highway and shooting at people - in an attack claimed by Hamas.Off-duty soldiers and a civilian at the scene killed the attackers, who police said were from occupied East Jerusalem.Local media said a fourth civilian who had mistaken for an attacker and shot by the troops died later died.In its statement saying that two assailants were its members, Hamas said Thursday morning's attack was a response to Israeli ""crimes"" in Gaza and elsewhere.Israel launched a major military campaign in Gaza after an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen almost eight weeks ago, in which 1,200 people were killed and about 240 taken hostage.Gaza's Hamas-run government says more than 15,000 people have been killed in the territory since the war began.A deal mediated by Qatar has led to a pause in the fighting in Gaza since last Friday. The Jerusalem attack came hours after the Palestinian armed group - which Israel, the UK, US and other Western powers class as a terrorist organisation - agreed with Israel to extend a truce in Gaza for a seventh day, and to allow another exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners.Eight hostages were released from Gaza on Thursday. Two women - Mia Schem and Amit Soussana - were initially released, followed by a group of six others.Qatar - a key mediator in the deal - said two Russian-Israeli women released on Wednesday had been included in the following day's tally, meaning the expected number of 10 was reached.It reiterated that a further 30 Palestinians were due to be released from Israeli jails in return. Talks have continued in an effort to further prolong the pause in the war. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is on his third trip to the Middle East since fighting broke out with Hamas's deadly attack on Israel on 7 October. In a press conference in Tel Aviv on Thursday evening, Mr Blinken called on Israel to put in place ""safe"" zones for Palestinian civilians in central and southern Gaza before resuming any military operations.The point, he said, was to ""minimise further casualties of innocent Palestinians"".Mr Blinken earlier commented on the attack in West Jerusalem, calling it a reminder ""of the threat from terrorism that Israel and Israelis face every single day"".Israeli President Isaac Herzog told his American visitor that the incident was another example of an ""endless war"" Israel was fighting in ""very complicated and challenging times"".In their account of the attack, Israeli police said they received reports of gunfire at Givat Shaul junction, on the main highway from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, at about 07:40 on Thursday (05:40 GMT).""A car approached with two armed terrorists - one with an M16 rifle and the other with a handgun,"" Jerusalem District Commander Doron Turgeman told reporters at the scene.""At a bus stop they opened fire at people who were waiting there,"" he said. ""The quick response of two soldiers and a civilian, who were close to the stop, neutralised the attackers.""  A large amount of ammunition was later found by officers who searched the gunmen's vehicle.Magen David Adom (MDA) ambulance service paramedic Moshe Hemed rushed to the scene.""I saw a number of casualties... Some were lying and some were walking. Along with large numbers of MDA teams we assessed and treated them,"" he said.""Unfortunately, we had to pronounce a 24-year-old female deceased, and evacuated a further eight casualties in varying conditions to hospitals across the city.""Later, police announced that two other victims of the attack had died and that three more were in a serious condition in hospital.Israel media identified the 24-year-old woman as Livia Dickman, and the two others killed as Rabbi Elimelech Wasserman, 73, and Hana Ifergan, who was in her 60s.Late on Thursday evening, reports said a fourth civilian had died - after being fired on by soldiers who mistook him for an attacker himself. Haaretz reported that the unnamed civilian, in his 40s, was seen in security footage telling soldiers not to shoot, before he was shot. Israeli officials have not yet commented.Police said the attackers were two brothers in their 30s from the Sur Baher area of East Jerusalem. The Shin Bet security service named them as Murad and Ibrahim Namer, and said they were affiliated to Hamas and had previously served prison sentences for involvement in terrorist activities - according to Israeli media.Visiting the site of the attack, far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said: ""Hamas is speaking with two voices here.""This event proves again how we must not show weakness, that we must speak to Hamas only through the [rifle] scopes, only through the war.""Mr Ben-Gvir also said the Israeli government would continue to ease regulations for issuing gun licences to citizens.Hamas later confirmed that two members of its military wing had carried out the attack, calling it a ""natural response to unprecedented crimes conducted by the (Israeli) occupation"". It cited the killing of Palestinians in the Gaza war and during Israeli raids in the occupied West Bank, as well as the treatment of Palestinian prisoners.During Qatar-mediated truce, Hamas has freed dozens of Israeli women and children among its hostages, while Israel has released 210 Palestinian women and youths from its jails. Twenty-three Thai hostages and one Filipino have also been released as part of a separate deal between Hamas and the Egyptian government.Before the truce, four Israeli hostages had been released - and Israeli forces in Gaza had rescued one hostage and recovered the bodies of two others.","Three people have been killed and several wounded after two gunmen opened fire at a bus stop on the outskirts of Jerusalem, Israeli police said. The attackers were also killed. Police said 16 people were injured in Thursday morning’s shooting. Emergency services evacuated eight of the more seriously wounded victims to nearby hospitals, the Israeli ambulance service said. Police in West Jerusalem said the gunmen “arrived at the scene in a vehicle armed with firearms”, including an M16 and a pistol, and opened fire towards a crowd of civilians at the bus station. The attackers were “subsequently neutralised by security forces and a nearby civilian”, police said. Ammunition and weapons were found inside their car, they added. Israeli media reported that the two attackers were brothers from occupied East Jerusalem, Murad Nimr, 38, and Ibrahim Nimr, 30. Hours after the attack, Hamas claimed the brothers as its members, saying in a statement that “the operation came as a natural response to unprecedented crimes conducted by the occupation”, referring to Israel’s military campaign in Gaza and the treatment of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. The statement also called for “an escalation of the resistance”. Security camera footage aired by Israel’s Channel 12 television on Thursday showed the moments of the attack. A white car is seen stopped beside a crowded bus stop. Two men then step out, guns drawn, and run at the crowd as people scatter. Shortly afterwards the attackers are gunned down. The Magen David Adom emergency service said one of the Israeli victims was a 24-year-old woman. A 73-year-old man, who was in a critical condition, was pronounced dead at Shaare Zedek Medical Center. A third person also died of his wounds, Israeli media reported. The ambulance service initially said that five of the wounded had serious injuries and two had moderate to light injuries. The incident took place just as Israel and Hamas agreed toextend the trucefor a seventh day, shortly before the agreement was set to expire. After the attack, the Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that Israeli soldiers raided the neighbourhood of Sur Baher in East Jerusalem where the attackers lived, broke into their house, and detained some of their family members for questioning. On Thursday, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his government will continue to distribute weapons to Israeli civilians. “The government headed by me will continue expanding the distribution of weapons to citizens. This is a measure that proves itself time and time again in the war against murderous terrorism,” he said on X. Meanwhile, Energy Minister Israel Katz demanded that the attackers’ family members lose their East Jerusalemidentity cards, saying they must also be denied any other “allowances and privileges”. “We must hit the supporters of terrorism everywhere,” he said on X.

"US approves plan to strike Iranian targets in Syria and Iraq, officials say","US approves plan for strikes on Iran-linked targets in Iraq, Syria: Report",0.6350526955302391,2024-02-02,2024-02-02,"The US has approved plans for a series of strikes on Iranian targets in Syria and Iraq, officials have told the BBC's US partner CBS News.The strikes will take place over a number of days, officials said, and weather conditions will likely dictate when they are launched.It comes after a drone attack killed three US soldiers in Jordan, close to the Syrian border, on Sunday.The US blamed an Iranian-backed militia group for that attack.That group, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, is believed to contain multiple militias that have been armed, funded and trained by Iran's Revolutionary Guards force. It has said it was responsible for Sunday's strike. Iran, meanwhile, has denied any role in the attack which injured 41 other US troops at the military base, known as Tower 22. US officials have said that US intelligence believes that the drone used to attack the facility was manufactured by Iran - and is similar to the drones Iran has been sending to Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. At a news conference on Thursday, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin defended the delayed military response, saying: ""We will respond where we choose, when we choose and how we choose.""""I think everyone recognises the challenge associated with making sure that we hold the right people accountable,"" he said, adding that there is no ""set formula for doing this"".""There are ways to manage this so it doesn't spiral out of control. And that's been our focus throughout,"" Mr Austin continued.The officials who spoke to CBS News did not give an exact timeline on the potential strikes. They said the US military could launch them in bad weather, but preferred to have better visibility to reduce the risk of inadvertently hitting civilians.President Joe Biden has been under mounting pressure from Republican lawmakers, including some of Washington's most hawkish voices on Iran, to strike targets on Iranian soil. But while the US has repeatedly pledged to respond to the drone attack, Mr Biden and other defence officials have said Washington is not seeking a wider war with Iran or an escalation of tensions in the region. ""That's not what I'm looking for,"" Mr Biden told reporters at the White House earlier this week.The reportedly approved plans appear to keep the targeting to Iranian targets Syria and Iraq, rather than inside Iran. Several Iran-backed groups have increased attacks on US and Israeli-linked entities since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war on 7 October. The Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen, for example, have attacked ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, prompting strikes from the US and its allies.A US defence official told CBS that a drone was shot down overnight in the Gulf of Aden, while an unmanned sea drone was struck and destroyed in the Red Sea. Citing unnamed sources, Reuters on Thursday reported that Iran had withdrawn senior officials from Syria following a series of Israeli airstrikes in a bid to avoid being directly drawn into a wider conflict in the region. US officials told CNN this week that there were signs that the Iranian government was becoming increasingly concerned about the actions of its proxy groups in the region, who have launched over 160 attacks on US forces since October. The bodies of the three US soldiers killed in the attack in Jordan are expected to be repatriated to a Delaware Air Force base on Friday. The White House has announced that President Biden will attend. The three soldiers have been named as William Jerome Rivers, 46, Kennedy Ladon Sanders, 24, and Breonna Alexsondria Moffett, 23. All three were part of an army reserve unit based in Fort Moore, Georgia. ","The United States has reportedlyapproved a planto attack Iran-linked targets in Iraq and Syria in retaliation for the killing of three soldiers five days ago. US broadcaster CBS News reported on Thursday that the White House has approved the targeting of Iranian personnel and facilities inside the two countries in response to thedrone attack on Sundayat theTower 22 basenear the border between Syria and Jordan. It did not provide any further details but said, quoting unnamed US officials, that weather will be a major factor in the timing of the strikes as Washington purportedly wants better visibility to avoid targeting civilians. On Friday, Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi said his country will “respond strongly” to anyone who bullies it. “We will not start any war but if anyone wants to bully us they will receive a strong response,” Raisi said. “Before, when they [the Americans] wanted to talk to us, they said the military option is ‘on the table’. Now they say they have no intention of a conflict with Iran.” Tehran’s military power has not and will not pose a threat to any country in the region, the president said in a televised speech, adding that Iran’s strength only creates security for the countries around it. Iran has denied involvement in the drone strike in Jordan. The attack on the US base was claimed by the umbrella group of US and Israel-opposed armed factions called the Islamic Resistance in Iraq. It marked the first time an American soldier was killed since the start ofIsrael’s war on Gaza. Iran-aligned groups have launched hundreds of attacks on US bases in Iraq and Syria in recent years, but their attacks have only intensified since the start of the war on Gaza and the unwavering US support for it despite international calls for a ceasefire. The Iraqi group is a member of the “axis of resistance” that is backed by Tehran across the region, but Iran maintains that members of the axisdecide and act independentlyand do not take orders from it.  US President Joe Biden has promised a response, which has yet to come five days after the attack. US officials have said their strikes could take place over several days, have multiple targets, and be “sustained over time”. Both Iran and the US have said they wish to avoid escalating the military fallout of Israel’s war, which has spread to include Israel’s border fighting with Lebanon’s Hezbollah andYemen’s Houthi attackson Red Sea shipping and US and United Kingdom vessels. But Hossein Salami, the commander-in-chief of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), has warned that Tehran would respond to any US strikes. Reports have also suggested that Tehran and Washington have exchanged messages since the Syria-Jordan border strike, with Iran seriously warning against any attacks on its soil. Hawkish Republican officials in the US have called fordirect strikes on Iran, something that is likely to spread the scope of the war. In January 2020, after the US assassinated Iran’s top general Qassem Soleimani in Iraq, Iran launched missiles at a US base in Iraq which injured dozens of soldiers but did not kill anyone. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq said Wednesday it would “suspend” military operations against US forces to prevent further embarrassment for the Iraqi government. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Washington would watch for actions rather than words. The pro-Iran al-Nujaba movement said on Friday it would press on with attacks on US forces in the Middle East until its demands are met for US troops to leave Iraq and for an end to Israel’s war on Gaza. A US air strike in early January had killed a senior commander of al-Nujaba. Biden is expected at the Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on Friday to oversee the transfer of the remains of the three soldiers.   "
Hamas deputy leader Saleh al-Arouri killed in Beirut blast,Senior Hamas official Saleh al-Arouri killed in Beirut suburb,0.6285428162191543,2024-01-03,2024-01-02,"Israel has insisted the assassination of a Hamas leader in Beirut was not an attack on Lebanon, as its enemies warned of ""punishment"" for his death.Israel has neither confirmed nor denied that it killed Saleh al-Arouri, but a spokesman called it a ""surgical strike against the Hamas leadership"".Hamas denounced it as a ""terrorist act"", while its ally Hezbollah said it was an assault on Lebanese sovereignty.Lebanon's PM accused Israel of trying to ""drag"" it into a regional war.Lebanese media report that Arouri, a deputy political leader of Hamas, was killed in a drone strike in southern Beirut on Tuesday along with six others - two Hamas military commanders and four other members.He was a key figure in the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas's armed wing, and a close ally of Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas leader. He had been in Lebanon acting as a connection between his group and Hezbollah.There have been near daily exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and Israeli forces since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, but so far the violence has been limited to the area along the Israel-Lebanon border.Hezbollah - which, like Hamas, is considered a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK and others - is the largest political and military force in Lebanon and has ministers in the country's government.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) refused to comment on the assassination of Saleh al-Arouri, but said its troops were ""highly prepared for any scenario"".""The IDF is in a very high state of readiness in all arenas, in defence and offence,"" spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari told a briefing.""The most important thing to say tonight is that we are focused and remain focused on fighting Hamas,"" he added.Israeli government adviser Mark Regev also stopped short of confirming Israel had carried out the attack, but he told MSNBC: ""Whoever did it, it must be clear that this was not an attack on the Lebanese state. ""It was not an attack even on Hezbollah, the terrorist organisation. ""Whoever did this did a surgical strike against the Hamas leadership. Whoever did this has a gripe with Hamas. That is very clear.""Arouri, 57, is the most senior Hamas figure to be killed since Israel went to war with the group after its 7 October attack.On that day, waves of Hamas gunmen invaded Israel and attacked communities around the border, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 240 to Gaza as hostages. Israel launched a military offensive in response, with the declared aim of destroying Hamas. Since then, more than 22,000 Palestinians - mostly women and children - have been killed in Israeli strikes on Gaza, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.Lebanon's state news agency said Arouri had been killed by an Israeli drone attack on a Hamas office in the southern Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh.A witness from Reuters news agency saw firefighters and paramedics gathered around a high-rise building where there was a large hole in what appeared to be the third floor.Video footage on social media showed a car in flames and extensive damage to buildings in what is a busy residential area.Dahiyeh is known as a stronghold of Hezbollah.Mr Haniyeh, the leader of Hamas's political bureau, called the attack a ""cowardly... terrorist act, a violation of Lebanon's sovereignty, and an expansion of its circle of aggression"".Hezbollah said that it considered Arouri's death ""to be a serious assault on Lebanon, its people, its security, sovereignty, and resistance, and the highly symbolic and significant political and security messages it contains"".It said the attack was ""a dangerous development in the course of the war... and we in Hezbollah affirm that this crime will never pass without response and punishment"". ""Its hand is on the trigger, and its resistors are in the highest levels of readiness and preparedness,"" it added.Iran, a major supporter of both groups, said Arouri's killing would ""undoubtedly ignite another surge in the veins of resistance"".An Israeli security cabinet meeting scheduled for Tuesday evening to discuss the post-war plan for Gaza was cancelled.The Lebanese Foreign Minister, Abdallah Bou Habib, told BBC Radio 4 his government was talking to Hezbollah to ""impress on them that they should not respond themselves"" but that: ""We don't tell them, we dialogue with them in this regard.""Over the next 24 hours it will become clear ""whether they respond or not"", he said, adding: ""We are very concerned, [the] Lebanese don't want to be dragged, even Hezbollah does not want to be dragged into a regional war."" And he called on the West to ""pressure Israel to stop also all its violence and all of its actions, not only on Lebanon, not only on Beirut, but also in Gaza"".Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously vowed to eliminate Hamas's leaders, wherever they are.Arouri was also considered the de facto leader of Hamas's military wing in the West Bank, overseeing attacks there, according to Israeli media reports.He is believed to have been involved in the kidnapping and killing of three Israeli teenagers in the occupied West Bank in 2014, reports say, and had served time in Israeli jails for other attacks.The Times of Israel says he was also one of the Hamas officials most closely connected to Iran and Hezbollah.","Senior Hamas official Saleh al-Arouri has been killed in an Israeli drone strike on Beirut’s southern suburb of Dahiyeh, the Palestinian group and Lebanese media outlets say. Al-Arouri was killed on Tuesday in a “treacherous Zionist strike”, Hamas said on its official channel. Hamas politburo member Izzat al-Sharq called it a “cowardly assassination”. Al-Arouri was a senior official in Hamas’s politburo and was known to be deeply involved in its military affairs. He had previously headed the group’s presence in the occupied West Bank. Samir Findi Abu Amer and Azzam Al-Aqraa Abu Ammar, leaders of Hamas’ armed wing – the Qassam Brigades – were also killed, Hamas said in a message on its Telegram channel. It named four other members of the group who were also killed. Earlier, Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said the blast killed at least six people and that it was carried out by an Israeli drone. Hamas said al-Arouri’s killing would not “undermine the continued brave resistance” in Gaza, where the Palestinian group’s fighters are battling Israeli ground forces. “It proves once more the utter failure of the enemy to achieve any of its aggressive goals in the Gaza Strip,” senior Hamas official Izzat al-Rishq said in a statement. The group’s top leader Ismail Haniyeh condemned the attack as a “terrorist act”, a violation of Lebanon’s sovereignty, and an expansion of Israel’s circle of hostility against Palestinians. Haniyeh said in televised remarks that Hamas “will never be defeated”. There was no immediate comment from Israel. Mark Regev, an adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told the United States news channel MSNBC that Israel had not taken responsibility for the attack but “whoever did it, it must be clear that this was not an attack on the Lebanese state”. “Whoever did this did a surgical strike against the Hamas leadership,” Regev said in an interview. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned the killing. His office said in a statement that the attack “aims to draw Lebanon into a new phase of confrontations” with Israel at a time when Hamas ally Hezbollah has been exchanging daily cross-border fire with Israeli forces in northern Israel, the statement said. Al Jazeera’s Zeina Khodr, reporting from Beirut, said there was “panic” in the Lebanese capital after the attack. “The targeted killing made many people here in the capital feel that this conflict could widen and could escalate, and all eyes are now on Hezbollah’s reaction,” Khodr said. Iran, which supports both Hamas and Hezbollah, said al-Arouri’s killing would create more resistance against Israel, its state media reported. “The martyr’s blood will undoubtedly ignite another surge in the veins of resistance and the motivation to fight against the Zionist occupiers not only in Palestine but also in the region and among all freedom seekers worldwide,” Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said. Kanaani also condemned the violation of Lebanon’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Netanyahu had threatened to kill al-Arouri long before Israel’s latest assault on the besieged Gaza Strip. Israeli political analyst Akiva Eldar told Al Jazeera the killing was a much needed success for Netanyahu.    Imad Harb, director of research at the Arab Center Washington DC, agreed, saying Israel carried out the attack in search for what has become an elusive win. “So far, the Israelis have not been able to call a victory in Gaza, so assassinating Hamas leaders is partly something that they wanted to do anyway,” he told Al Jazeera. “This is an achievement for the Israeli army and for the Israeli politicians.” Since Israeli forces and Hezbollah began exchanging fire across the Lebanese-Israeli border on October 8, the fighting has largely been concentrated a few kilometres inside each country. But on several occasions, Israel’s air force has hit what it said were Hezbollah positions deeper inside Lebanon. Harb said the killing of al-Arouri is a “dangerous escalation” because it took place in Hezbollah’s area of operations, far from the border. Harb predicted Hezbollah would likely step up attacks on Israel in response to the killing but would stop short of escalating the conflict into an all-out war. Meanwhile, at mosques in Arura, the hometown of the slain Hamas leader in the West Bank, Palestinians gathered to mourn al-Arouri’s death. Protests and gatherings also took place in Ramallah and several nearby towns, such as Deir Qaddis. A general strike in Ramallah has also been called for Wednesday."
UN: Thousands in Gaza break into warehouses in search of aid,"Palestinians break into Gaza UN aid warehouses as toll tops 8,000",0.6188130039620288,2023-10-29,2023-10-29,"Thousands of people in Gaza have broken into aid depots to take supplies in what the UN called a ""worrying sign of civil order starting to break down"".The UN relief agency for Palestinians (Unrwa) said warehouses holding basics like flour and soap were ransacked.The news comes as Israel intensifies military action against Hamas in Gaza.More than half of the Strip's 2.4 million inhabitants have been displaced and thousands of buildings have been destroyed, the UN says.Hamas gunmen launched unprecedented attacks on Israel from Gaza on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people and taking 230 hostages.Since then, Israel has been carrying out strikes and now ground operations in Gaza, where the Hamas-run Palestinian health ministry says more than 8,000 people have been killed.Unwra said its second largest depot - located in Deir al-Balah, in the central Gaza Strip - was targeted on Saturday as it holds most of the humanitarian aid delivered by the UN.People took flour, wheat and hygiene kits after storming this and several other storage facilities in the centre and south of Gaza, the agency said.A senior spokeswoman for the UN World Food Programme (WFP), Abeer Etefa, told the BBC that the raids on warehouses were ""expected"" because of the ""difficult conditions facing people"".""The bottom line is that people are desperate, they are hungry,"" she said. Some of the displaced Gazans who took items from the UN warehouses told AFP news agency they had ""no flour, no aid, no water, not even toilets"".  Gaza resident Abdulrahman al-Kilani said: ""Our houses were destroyed. No one cares about us. We appeal to the people of the world. All international powers are against us. We needed aid, and we wouldn't have done this if we weren't in need.""Very little aid, and no fuel, has been allowed to enter Gaza since the attack by Hamas. Israel says it is concerned that supplies will be used by Hamas to continue the conflict.But officials on Sunday indicated that Israel would allow more aid into the strip in the coming days.In a video statement posted on social media, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said humanitarian aid from Egypt and the US would be expanded into Gaza on Sunday, without elaborating further on the details.However spokesman for Egypt's foreign ministry, Ahmed Abu Zeid, accused Israel of ""obstructing"" aid deliveries by implementing cumbersome security checks.Meanwhile,  UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres said the situation in Gaza was growing more desperate by the hour.""More than two million people, with nowhere safe to go, are being denied the essentials for life - food, water, shelter and medical care - while being subjected to relentless bombardment. I urge all those with responsibility to step back from the brink,"" the UN chief said.","The United Nations relief agency says thousands of Palestinians, desperate due to three weeks of total siege and bombing, broke into several of its warehouses in the Gaza Strip, taking wheat, flour and other basic goods. “This is a worrying sign that civil order is starting to break down after three weeks of war and a tight siege,” said Thomas White, director of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) in Gaza. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Sunday repeated appeals to end the bloodshed and agree on a ceasefire to end the “nightmare”. “The situation in Gaza is growing more desperate by the hour. I regret that instead of a critically needed humanitarian pause, supported by the international community, Israel has intensified its military operations,” Guterres said. Israel imposed a total siege – no food, water, electricity – on the Palestinian enclave of 2.3 million people in the wake of the Hamas attack in Israel. Israel has allowed limited supplies of basic necessities and medicines. Efforts are under way to get more supply of food, water, fuel and medicine in the enclave that has been under intense bombing since October 7. Gaza’s Health Ministry said the death toll among Palestinians has crossed 8,000 – most of them women and minors – as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a “second stage” in the war after tanks and infantry pushed into Gaza over the weekend. The bombardment over the weekend – described by Gaza residents as the most intense of the war – knocked out communications in the territory late on Friday, largely cutting off the besieged enclave’s 2.3 million people from the world. Communications were restored to much of Gaza early on Sunday. The Israeli military said on Sunday it had struck more than 450 targets over the past 24 hours, including Hamas command centres, observation posts and antitank missile launching positions. It said more ground forces were sent into Gaza overnight.    UNRWA provides necessities in Gaza, and many of the displaced Palestinians are sheltering in UNRWA schools. Several hospitals have shut down and others are on the verge of closing down due to a lack of fuel. “Supplies on the market are running out while the humanitarian aid coming into the Gaza Strip on trucks from Egypt is insufficient,” UNRWA said. “The needs of the communities are immense, if only for basic survival, while the aid we receive is meagre and inconsistent.” Juliette Touma, a spokesperson for the agency, said the crowds broke into a total of four facilities on Saturday. She said the warehouses did not contain any fuel, which has been in critically short supply since Israel cut off all shipments after the start of the war. One of the warehouses pillaged is located in Deir el-Balah, where UNRWA stores supplies from the humanitarian convoys crossing into Gaza from Egypt. White, the UNRWA chief, said the massive displacement of people has placed enormous pressure on the host communities. “Some families,” he said, “received up to 50 relatives taking shelter in one household.”    “The current system of convoys is geared to fail. Very few trucks, slow processes, strict inspections, supplies that do not match the requirements of UNRWA and the other aid organisations, and mostly the ongoing ban on fuel, are all a recipe for a failed system,” he added. UNRWA has said its ability to help people in Gaza has been completely stretched by air raids that have killed more than 50 of its staff and restricted the movement of supplies. More than613,000of 1.4 million internally displaced people in Gaza are sheltering in 150 UNRWA facilities across the blockaded territory. But severe overcrowding, a lack of privacy and inadequate sanitation have put these schools at risk of a prolonged and severe public health crisis, adding pressure to the already overloaded healthcare system which doctors and the Ministry of Health describe as being in a state of total collapse. The UN agency said some shelters are currently hosting 10 to 12 times more people than their capacity."
Al-Shifa: What we know about Israel's raid on Gaza's main hospital,Israel’s raid on Gaza’s al-Shifa Hospital: Here’s what you need to know,0.6158183481851943,2023-11-15,2023-11-15,"The Israeli military has raided Gaza's main hospital in what it describes as a ""targeted operation against Hamas"".An eyewitness at Al-Shifa hospital told the BBC that troops moved in overnight and were interrogating people. On Wednesday, Israel said it found Hamas' ""operational centre"" at the hospital, sharing images of what it said were Hamas weapons and equipment.Hamas denies operating there and the BBC cannot independently verify claims by either side.UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said he was ""appalled"" by the Israeli raid, while the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was ""extremely worried"" for patients and staff, with whom it had lost contact.The BBC has been speaking to a journalist and a doctor inside the hospital to find out what is happening there, while the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has also been providing updates. Khader, a journalist inside Al-Shifa, told the BBC's Rushdi Abualouf that Israeli troops were in ""complete control"" of the hospital and no shooting was taking place.He said six tanks and about 100 commandos entered the complex during the night. The Israeli forces then went room to room, questioning staff and patients.The IDF reportedly asked all men aged 16-40 to leave the hospital buildings, except the surgical and emergency departments, and go to the hospital courtyard.Soldiers fired into the air to force those remaining inside to come out, Khader said.However Muhammad Zaqout, the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry's director of hospitals, told Al Jazeera that ""not a single bullet"" had been fired - because ""there are no resistors or detainees"" inside.Early on Wednesday, the IDF said its forces were in the midst of a ""precise and targeted operation against Hamas in a specified area"" in the hospital.It said the raid was ""based on intelligence information and an operational necessity"", calling for the surrender of ""all Hamas terrorists"" present there.As the soldiers entered the hospital complex, they engaged with a number Hamas members and killed them, the IDF said.On Wednesday evening, the IDF said troops found ""an operational command centre, weapons, and technological assets"" belonging to Hamas inside the MRI building.It said it was ""continuing to operate in the hospital complex"", sharing images and videos showing what it said were Hamas weapons.In a seven-minute video, IDF spokesperson Jonathan Conricus pointed to security cameras that he said had been covered over, and weapons that he said were AK47 rifles hidden behind MRI scanners.The BBC has not yet been able to verify the video or its location.But unless Israel has more to reveal, the military's controversial operation inside the hospital did not net a major arsenal of weapons, reports the BBC's Orla Guerin in Jerusalem.Hamas knew Israel was coming, and therefore, if they were operating beneath the hospital, they would have had weeks to clear out through Gaza's extensive tunnel network, our correspondent adds.Israel's Army Radio reported that troops had not yet found any sign of any of the 240 hostages taken by Hamas during the 7 October attack on Israel, when 1,200 other people were killed.The raid on Al-Shifa came shortly after the US publicly backed Israeli claims that Hamas had infrastructure underneath the hospital. However Dr Ahmed Mokhallalati, a plastic surgeon at Al-Shifa, told the BBC there were only civilians in the hospital.He said there were tunnels under every building in Gaza, including Al-Shifa hospital.According to international humanitarian law, hospitals are specially protected facilities.This means that parties to conflicts cannot attack hospitals, or prevent them performing their medical functions. They can lose their protection if they are used by a party to the conflict to commit an ""act harmful to the enemy"". The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) says this could be something like a hospital being used as a base from which to launch an attack, as a shelter for able-bodied fighters, or to shield a military objective from attack.The IDF said it had repeatedly warned Hamas its ""continued military use of Al-Shifa jeopardises its protected status"", calling for the evacuation of the hospital before the raid.The WHO had warned that evacuating patients would be a ""death sentence"", given that the medical system was collapsing.Dr Mokhallalati told the BBC on Wednesday the hospital was without power, oxygen and water. On Tuesday, surgeries had been carried out without proper anaesthesia, with patients ""screaming in pain"". Doctors were unable to help one patient with burns, and had to just ""let him die"".Dr Mokhallalati said  six premature babies had died in recent days.""Why can't they be evacuated,"" he said. ""In Afghanistan, they evacuated the cats and dogs.""The IDF said it was providing incubators, baby food and medical supplies.","Israeli forcesraidedGaza’sal-Shifa Hospital on Wednesdayafter laying siege of the enclave’s largest medical facility for days.

Egypt election: President Sisi wins third term,President el-Sisi declared victorious in Egypt election,0.6130699916033108,2023-12-18,2023-12-18,"Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has won a third six-year term with 89.6% of the vote, the electoral commission has announced.The former army chief beat three low-profile candidates, with the runner-up securing only 4.5%.Leading opposition candidate Ahmed Tantawy had pulled out months before last week's poll, claiming intimidation and violence against his campaign camp.Egypt's faltering economy and the war in Gaza were key electoral issues. Mr Sisi, who is 69, first became president in 2014, a year after he had led the military's overthrow of his Islamist predecessor Mohammed Morsi. Mr Sisi won again in 2018. The victory in the latest election means he will be in power until 2030, when he is barred by the constitution from running again.Under his leadership, huge sums of money have been spent on big infrastructure projects.Roads have been expanded and flyovers built, and a new capital costing billions of dollars has been constructed near Cairo but is barely inhabited.Critics say this has drained much of the country's economic resources and created unprecedented levels of debt that have crippled the economy. In the past nine months, the Egyptian pound has lost more than 50% of its value against the US dollar. With the Egyptian economy heavily dependent on imports, the prices of basic commodities have skyrocketed beyond the reach of many households and a black market for foreign currency has flourished.Official figures show that nearly 30% of Egypt's 100 million population lives below the poverty line. Egyptian opposition groups complain they cannot operate effectively due to a constant crackdown on dissent.Human rights campaigners are also complaining about tight security restrictions. They say it is increasingly difficult to document alleged abuses.Egyptian authorities deny the allegations.","Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has secured a third term as leader of the Middle East’s most populous nation, officials said, after the counting of votes in the election held between December 10 and 12 was finalised. Sisi won 89.6 percent of the vote, the National Elections Authority said on Monday. Turnout reached an “unprecedented” 66.8 percent of voters, said authority head Hazem Badawy. Over 39 million Egyptians cast their ballots for Sisi, a former army chief who has ruled the most populous Arab country for a decade. The vote, theresult of which was in little doubt, took place as Egypt dealt with various crises, including the Israel-Hamas war in neighbouring Gaza and the country’s worst-evereconomic crisis. Despite Egypt’s afflictions, a decade-long crackdown on dissent has eliminated any serious opposition to Sisi, the fifth president to emerge from within the ranks of the military since 1952. Sisi was running againstthree other candidates, none of whom were high profile. The most prominent potential candidate ended his run complaining that his campaign had been impeded and dozens of his supporters arrested. Runner-up Hazem Omar, who leads the Republican People’s Party, received 4.5 percent of the vote. Next came Farid Zahran, leader of the left-leaning Egyptian Social Democratic Party, and Abdel-Sanad Yamama from the Wafd, a century-old but relatively marginal party. Sisi is now set to serve his third – and, according to the constitution, final – term in office, starting in April. Sisi came to power after the 2013 overthrow of the country’s first popularly elected president, Mohamed Morsi. He was re-elected in 2018. In both previous elections he won with 97 percent of the vote. Sisi extended the presidential mandate from four to six years and amended the constitution to raise the limit on consecutive terms in office from two to three. Under his rule, Egypt has jailed thousands of political prisoners, and while a presidential pardons committee has freed about 1,000 in one year, rights groups say that three to four times that many were arrested over the same period. His supporters credit him with engineering a return to calm in the country after the chaos that followed the 2011 uprising that overthrew President Hosni Mubarak.   "
Jabalia: Israel air strike reportedly kills dozens at Gaza refugee camp,Dozens killed in Israeli air attack on Jabalia refugee camp: Gaza official,0.6082633998153704,2023-10-31,2023-10-31,"An Israeli air strike is reported to have killed dozens of people at Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said 50 people were killed and 150 wounded. But a nearby hospital said it received 400 casualties, including 120 dead.Pictures showed several large craters, surrounded by shattered buildings.The Israeli military said the strike killed a senior Hamas commander and ""underground terror infrastructure"" beneath buildings collapsed afterwards.It added that a ""large number of terrorists"" from Hamas's Central Jabalia Battalion who had been with the commander at the time were also killed.Israeli tanks and troops, meanwhile, continued to advance towards some of northern Gaza's most populated areas, including Jabalia. Israel has said it is the ""second phase"" of its war to eliminate Hamas, which began after an unprecedented cross-border attack by gunmen from Gaza on 7 October in which 1,400 people were killed and another 240 taken hostage. Gaza's health ministry says more than 8,500 people have been killed in the territory since then, while supplies of food, water, fuel and medicine for its 2.2 million residents are dangerously low because of a siege imposed by Israel.  Tuesday's air strike in Jabalia caused a huge explosion that destroyed several residential buildings in the centre of the refugee camp, where before the war 116,000 people were living in an area of just 1.4 sq km (0.5 sq miles).Jabalia resident Ragheb Aqal said it had felt like there was ""an earthquake"". ""I went and saw the destruction... homes buried under the rubble and body parts and martyrs and wounded in huge numbers,"" he told AFP news agency.Video footage and photos showed hundreds of people searching the wreckage afterwards. ""We're filling bags with children,"" cried one man, holding up a small white cloth bag covered in blood.AFP reported that its video footage from the scene showed at least 47 bodies being pulled from the rubble.A long line of body bags were laid outside the Indonesian Hospital, in nearby Beit Lahia. Its surgical director told the BBC's International editor Jeremy Bowen that it received 400 casualties, including 120 dead, and that the majority were children and women.Dr Mohamed el-Ron also said there were severely wounded people needing complex surgery who had to be transferred ""under fire"" to Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City.MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res quoted one of its nurses at Al-Shifa, Mohammed Hawajreh, as saying: ""Young children arrived at the hospital with deep wounds and severe burns. They came without their families. Many were screaming and asking for their parents.""Later, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had a carried out a ""wide-scale strike on terrorists and terror infrastructure belonging to the Central Jabaliya Battalion"" and killed its commander, Ibrahim Biari.""The strike damaged Hamas's command and control in the area, as well as its ability to direct military activity against IDF soldiers operating throughout the Gaza Strip,"" it added.""A large number of terrorists who were with Biari were killed. Underground terror infrastructure embedded beneath the buildings, used by the terrorists, also collapsed after the strike.""IDF spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari did not directly address the reported civilian casualties at a briefing, but he said: ""The Hamas terrorists continue to use civilian population as protective armour. This is intentional and devastatingly barbaric.""A Hamas spokesman was quoted by Al Arabiya TV as denying that a commander had been in Jabalia, accusing the IDF of ""false and unfounded talk"" intended to ""justify its heinous crime"".The IDF also said that its ground forces had killed about 50 Hamas fighters during an operation to secure a military stronghold in western Jabalia that served as a training centre for the 7 October attack and contained tunnels used as a passageway to the Mediterranean coast.Two Israeli soldiers were killed during the battle, according to Adm Hagari.Hamas's military wing said its fighters had hit four Israeli military vehicles within southern Gaza, fired at tanks and bulldozers in north-west Gaza, and ambushed an Israeli unit in the north-east.Hamas and other Palestinian groups also continued to fire rockets into Israel. Four people in the coastal city of Ashdod were wounded in two attacks.Following Tuesday's strike in Jabalia, Adm Hagari once again called on all civilians in the camp and elsewhere in northern Gaza to move to areas south of the Wadi Gaza river for their own safety.Hundreds of thousands of people have not heeded the order, which the IDF first issued on 13 October.The UN says about 117,000 displaced civilians are staying in 13 hospitals across the north, along with thousands of patients and medical staff. Many others are sheltering in UN facilities, schools and other public buildings.On Tuesday, the World Health Organization said it was extremely concerned by reports of air strikes in the vicinity of the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital over the last two days. The hospital, which is located south of Gaza City, is the main cancer centre in the Gaza Strip.The BBC verified a video circulated on social media on Monday in which smoke can be seen outside the hospital and an explosion can be heard. The Israeli military told the BBC that it had not stuck the hospital, but it did not deny that there may have been strikes in the area.Dr Richard Brennan, the WHO's regional emergency director, also warned that the wider health situation in Gaza was ""essentially catastrophic"", with 8,525 deaths from trauma reported by the health ministry, over a third of hospitals not functioning, and the rest overwhelmed by patients.""Anaesthetics and painkillers are running short, so doctors are doing procedures without the right medicine and equipment, and patients are suffering incredible because of that,"" he told the BBC.Dr Brennan also said the UN had already started to see infectious diseases such as diarrhoea and respiratory infections among the 1.4 million displaced people living in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions.The US said on Monday night that it was confident there would be an increase in humanitarian aid entering southern Gaza via Egypt's Rafah border crossing in the coming days. In recent days, there has been a small rise in the deliveries of food, water and medicine being allowed in, but UN agencies said the promised 100 lorryloads a day were a fraction of what was needed. Israel is not permitting deliveries of fuel - crucial to run hospitals and bakeries, and for purifying and pumping water - because it says it could be used by Hamas for military purposes.The BBC's Rushdi Abualouf said he saw hundreds of people queuing for a small bottle of clean drinking water from a UN tanker outside a hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis on Tuesday. A father who had to queue for six hours to get five Arabic flatbreads to feed his family told him: ""This is not enough."" ","Dozens of people have been killed in an Israeli air raid on the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, according to a medical official and Palestinian authorities in the besieged territory. “More than 50 people have been killed,” Dr Atef al-Kahlout, director of the Indonesian Hospital, told Al Jazeera. He said the hospital was not yet able to provide the total number of casualties as it was still counting the victims. The health ministry in Gaza said more than 50 people were killed and scores of others wounded in the Israeli bombardment. “More than 50 martyrs and around 150 wounded and dozens under the rubble, in a heinous Israeli massacre that targeted a large area of homes in Jabalia camp in the northern [Gaza] Strip,” a health ministry statement said. An Isaeli military official confirmed an attack on the Jabalia refugee camp. “There was a very senior Hamas commander in that area,” Israeli army spokesperson Richard Hecht told CNN. “We’re looking into it and we’ll be coming out with more data as we learn what happened there.” In footage of the scene after the strike on Jabalia, residents can be seen standing around large craters in the earth and piles of rubble as rescuers scramble to locate survivors under collapsed buildings. “I went and saw the destruction… homes buried under the rubble and body parts and martyrs and wounded in huge numbers,” 41-year-old Jabalia resident Ragheb Aqal told the news outlet AFP.    The attack comes as Israel continues to pummel the Gaza Strip in arelentless bombardment, which Palestinian authorities say has killed 8,525 people, including more than 3,500 children, since fighting began on October 7. Israel launched the assault after Hamas, the armed group that governs Gaza, carried out a devastating attack on southern Israel, killing at least 1,400 people, most of them civilians, according to Israeli authorities. Israel has also imposed a “complete siege” on Gaza, severely restricting access to water, electricity, food, and fuel for the strip’s more than 2.3 million residents.United Nationsofficials have said that more than half of Gaza’s population has been displaced by the fighting. Israel has expanded itsground operationsin Gaza in recent days, with tanks and infantry engaged in battles with Palestinian fighters around Gaza City in the northern section of the strip.   "
"Israeli strike in Syria kills Iranian commander, Iran says",Israeli air strike in Syria kills top Iranian military adviser,0.5978201350574099,2023-12-25,2023-12-25,"A senior Iranian commander was killed in a suspected Israeli strike in Syria. Iranian media say. Seyyed Razi Mousavi was ""an experienced military adviser"" to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, the semi-official Tasnim news agency said. It says he was killed in an air strike on the Sayyida Zeinab area south-east of Damascus.Israel has carried out military strikes in Syria for years, against what it says are Iran-linked targets.The strikes have increased in frequency over the past months following Hamas' attack on 7 October. Iranian forces have been present in Syria since the early stages of the Syrian civil war, where they helped support the regime of President Bashar al-Assad against widespread rebellion to his rule.Mousavi is said to have been an aide to IRGC commander Qassem Soleimani, who was killed by the US in 2020.  He was one of most senior IRGC operatives in Syria, according to Tasnim, and helped co-ordinate the relationship between Tehran and Damascus. Iran's Revolutionary Guards said that Israel would ""pay for this crime"". There has been no immediate comment from Israel's military, which rarely discusses cross-border strikes. Earlier this month, Iran accused Israel of killing two members of the Revolutionary Guards in Syria.","An Israeli air strike outside the Syrian capital of Damascus has killed a senior adviser in Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), according to reports from Iranian state media. Sayyed Razi Mousavi, one of the top IRGC commanders in Syria, was killed on Monday. He was responsible for coordinating the military alliance between Syria and Iran, an important part of Iran’s regional network of allies andproxiesknown as the “Axis of Resistance”. Mousavi “was killed during an attack by the Zionist regime a few hours ago in Zeinabiyah district in the suburbs of Damascus,” Iran’s official IRNA news agency reported, using a different name for Sayyida Zeinab south of the Syrian capital. In a statement read on state TV, the IRGC said that the “usurper and savage Zionist regime will pay for this crime”.    Iran’s state television interrupted its regular news broadcast to announce that Mousavi had been killed, describing him as one of the most experienced IRGC advisers in Syria. The strike comes amid fears that Israel’s war with the Palestinian armed group Hamas in Gaza could expand into a wider regional conflict, pulling in Iran-backed groups such asHezbollahin southern Lebanon. “Mousavi is one of the oldest IRGC commanders in Syria and Lebanon, he’s been functioning in this area since the 80s,” Al Jazeera correspondent Ali Hashem reported from southern Lebanon. “According to our sources, Mousavi was the target of several assassination attempts by Israel. However, this was the time when the assassination attempt succeeded. The Israelis accuse him of being an instrumental figure within the network of arms smuggling from Iran to Syria, to Iraq to Syria, and to end with Hezbollah in Lebanon, and also as very influential within what Iran calls the Axis of Resistance,” Hashem added. Reports from IRNA said that Mousavi was “among those accompanyingQassem Soleimani,” the head of the IRGC’s elite Quds Force, who was killed in a United States drone attack in Iraq in 2020. Soleimani had played a central role in the coordination of Iran’s regional activities. Iranian media reported that PresidentEbrahim Raisicalled the strike “a sign of the Zionist regime’s frustration and weakness in the region for which it will certainly pay the price”. There was no immediate comment from Israel’s military, but Barak Ravid, a reporter for US news site Axios, quotes an unnamed Israeli official who says that Israel is preparing for retaliation that could include rocket fire from Syria and Lebanon. The US and Israel have for years carried out attacks against what they describe asIran-linked targetsin Syria, where Tehran’s influence has grown since it backed PresidentBashar al-Assadin the war that erupted in Syria in 2011. Earlier this month, Iran said Israeli strikes had killed two IRGC members in Syria who had served as military advisers there."
Yemen strikes: Houthis hit US-owned ship after 'terror' designation,"Yemen’s Houthis hit US-owned ship in missile attack, US military says",0.5967694505218186,2024-01-17,2024-01-15,"Yemen's Houthis have targeted a US-owned vessel in the Gulf of Aden after Washington said it will re-designate the group as ""global terrorists"".The group said they hit the ""Genco Picardy"" bulk carrier with missiles which resulted in a ""direct hit"".The US military says the vessel was hit by a drone on Wednesday evening. Washington's new designation of the Houthis will require US financial institutions to freeze Houthi funds and its members will be banned from the US.The Houthi attacks in the Gulf of Aden and neighbouring Red Sea are a response to Israel's military operation in Gaza.Earlier this month, the UK and US launched air strikes on dozens of Houthi targets in Yemen in an attempt to stop the group from targeting vessels in the waters.On Wednesday evening, a Houthi spokesperson said the group had successfully targeted the Genco Picardy, and that the attack was a response to ""the American-British aggression against our country"".The US military said the ship was hit by a drone launched from Houthi controlled areas in Yemen. It said there was some damage but no injuries, and the vessel remained seaworthy. US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said the re-designation of the Houthis as ""global terrorists"" is in response to the Iran-backed group's attacks on commercial shipping in the region. The move to re-designate the Houthis reverses Secretary of State Antony Blinken's 2021 decision to remove the rebels from the US Specially Designated Global Terrorist List (SDGT).In a statement, Mr Sullivan said the recent Houthi attacks ""fit the textbook definition of terrorism"", as they have put US personnel in danger and jeopardized global trade operations.""If the Houthis cease their attacks in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, the United States will immediately re-evaluate this designation,"" Mr Sullivan added. In the waning days of the Trump administration officials imposed the SDGT and foreign terrorist organisation (FTO) labels on the Houthis.This action was taken despite warnings from the UN and aid groups that it could push war-torn Yemen into a large-scale famine.But in 2021, shortly after President Joe Biden's inauguration, that decision was reversed by Mr Blinken, the newly installed Secretary of State. He cited the dire humanitarian situation faced by the people of Yemen. Speaking to reporters ahead of Wednesday's announcement, senior administration officials defended the decision to reinstate the SDGT designation but not the FTO designation, which they said had been taken to ensure the continued flow of aid into Yemen. ""It was the correct step to revoke,"" one official said, arguing that it was a move taken in ""recognition of a very dire humanitarian situation"" in the country and to ensure that ""US policies weren't impeding"" civilians' access to urgent aid. But they accepted that the Houthis' campaign of attacks on commercial shipping, which has now seen dozens of missiles fired at vessels in the Red Sea, has become ""unacceptable"". The new SDGT designation will also bar people and companies in the US from offering any support to the Houthis. However, officials were keen to emphasise that a range of exemptions will be worked into the new designation to ensure humanitarian aid continues to flow into Yemen, a country devastated by almost a decade of civil war. ""We are rolling out unprecedented carve outs and licenses to help prevent adverse impacts on the Yemeni people,"" said Mr Sullivan in his statement. ""The people of Yemen should not pay the price for the actions of the Houthis.""The Houthis began attacking merchant vessels in November, saying they were responding to Israel's military operation in Gaza. Since then, the group has launched dozens of attacks on commercial tankers passing through the Red Sea, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes. In response, the US and UK launched a wave of air strikes against dozens of Houthi targets on 11 January. The strikes - supported by Australia, Bahrain, the Netherlands and Canada - began after Houthi forces ignored an ultimatum to cease their attacks in the region. Biden administration officials denied that the new terrorist designation was an acceptance that the air campaign may not deter further Houthi attacks. ""We see these sanctions as one piece of a broader effort to bring the Houthis back from the terror attacks they are currently committing,"" one official said. ""Our sanctions are best not seen in isolation but as part of a broader effort."" In the wake of last week's strikes, the Houthis said the US and UK would ""soon realise"" the action was ""the greatest folly in their history"".""America and Britain made a mistake in launching the war on Yemen because they did not benefit from their previous experiences,"" senior Houthi official Mohammed al-Bukhaiti wrote on social media. Yemen has been devastated by a civil war that escalated in 2015, when the Houthis seized control of large parts of the west of the country from the internationally recognised government and a Saudi-led coalition intervened in an effort to restore its rule.The fighting has reportedly left more than 160,000 people dead and triggered one of the world's worst humanitarian crises, with two thirds of the population - 21 million people - in need of some form of aid.","Houthi rebels in Yemen have struck a US-owned and operated container ship with an anti-ship ballistic missile off the coast of Yemen, the United States Central Command said. In a statement on Monday, the US military said that no injuries or significant damage were reported and that the Marshall Islands-flagged Gibraltar Eagle was continuing its journey after the incident in the Gulf of Aden. The Yemeni rebel group has claimed responsibility for the attack. “All American and British ships and warships involved in the aggression against our country are considered hostile targets,” military spokesperson Yahya Saree said. He said that no future US or British attack on Yemen would go “unpunished”. Earlier, the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) agency said that a vessel was hit from above by a missile 95 nautical miles southeast of Aden, without identifying the vessel. British Maritime Security firm Ambrey said three missiles were reportedly launched by the Houthis, with two not reaching the sea and the third striking the bulk carrier. It said that the impact reportedly caused a fire in a hold, but that the bulker remained seaworthy with no injuries on board. It assessed the vessel was not Israel-affiliated. The attack on the ship comes less than a day after the Houthis launched an anti-ship cruise missile toward a US destroyer in the Red Sea, US officials said. The Houthis control western Yemen, including the strategically critical Bab al-Mandeb Strait, which leads into the Red Sea and up to the Suez Canal. Since Israel’s war in Gaza began, they have been attacking ships in the area that they say are linked to Israel or bound for Israeli ports. They say they are attacking the vessels to pressure Israel to halt its assault on Gaza and ease restrictions on supplies of humanitarian aid for its Palestinian population. Israel has been at war with Hamas, the group that governs Gaza, for more than three months. US and British forcesrespondedto the Houthi attacks last week by carrying out dozens of air and sea strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. Abdel-Malik al-Houthi, the leader of the Houthis, has pledged revenge. On Thursday, hesaidthat “any attack on Yemen’s Houthis on the part of the United States will not go without a response.” Reporting from Washington, DC, Al Jazeera’s Mike Hanna said that US officials believe that after the strikes last week, the Houthis retained about three-quarters of their capacity to fire missiles and launch drones. “This recent attack on a US-owned freighter was launched, it would appear, from the city of Hodeidah, which was a target of US-UK strikes in recent days,” Hanna said. “So, the ante is rising in terms of what is happening … the situation is very dire and something that US intelligence is watching very closely.” Omar Rahman, a fellow with the Middle East Council on Global Affairs, said one-off strikes targeting Houthi installations would not reduce the group’s capability or deter them from attacking ships in the Red Sea. “What the US and UK are doing is not strategically justifiable. It’s only justifiable if you look at what the Houthis are doing in the Red Sea in isolation from what’s happening in Gaza and in the rest of the region,” he told Al Jazeera. “The US and UK are ignoring the source of the crisis, which is the genocide in Gaza, but they’re also enabling it,” Rahman said. “They’re trying to prevent a wider regional escalation by taking military action against the flashpoints that are occurring as a result of what’s happening in Gaza.”"
Israel says South Africa distorting the truth in ICJ genocide case,ICJ hears South Africa’s genocide case against Israel over Gaza war,0.5906144616821862,2024-01-12,2024-01-11,"Israel has said South Africa has distorted the truth in its case at the International Court of Justice, where it is accusing Israel of genocide.South Africa had presented ""a sweeping counter-factual description"" of the Israel-Palestinian conflict, Israeli lawyer Tal Becker told the ICJ.South Africa says Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in its war in Gaza.It is also asking the court to order Israel to halt its military activity.The ICJ is the United Nations' highest court. Its rulings are theoretically legally binding on parties to the ICJ - which include Israel and South Africa - but are not enforceable. Israel delivered its defence to the court a day after South Africa presented its case.Outside the legal battleground of the ICJ, police created cordons to ensure rival groups were kept far apart.  On one side, Palestinian flags were waved beneath a big screen streaming a live feed from the courtroom. Banners were unfurled showing images of Nelson Mandela, referencing parallels drawn by South Africa's legal team between the situation in Gaza and the former apartheid era in South Africa. A few hundred metres away, a symbolic Sabbath table had been laid. Photographs were attached to the back of empty chairs. These show some of the more than 130 Israelis who are still being held hostage by Hamas, which is banned as a terrorist group in the US, UK, EU and elsewhere.South Africa asserts that Israel is in violation of the 1948 Genocide Convention, to which both states are signatories, and which commits parties to prevent genocide from happening.Israel has been waging a war against Hamas, Gaza's ruling group, since 7 October, when hundreds of Hamas gunmen invaded Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking some 240 others back to Gaza as hostages. Members of the hostages' families were in the ICJ courtroom to hear Israel state its case.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 23,350 people - mostly women and children - have been killed by Israel in the war.In his opening remarks on Friday, Tal Becker told the court that while the civilian suffering was ""tragic"", Hamas sought ""to maximise civilian harm to both Israelis and Palestinians, even as Israel seeks to minimise it"".South Africa, he said, ""has regrettably put before the court a profoundly distorted factual and legal picture, [and] the entirety of its case hinges on a deliberately curated, decontextualised and manipulative description of the reality of current hostilities"".Mr Becker accused South Africa of making ""an attempt to weaponise the term genocide against Israel"".He said South Africa was also seeking ""to thwart Israel's inherent right to defend itself"" by trying to get the court to order Israel to stop its military operation against Hamas.On Thursday, the court's 17 judges heard advocate of the High Court of South Africa Tembeka Ngcukaitobi describe how Israel's ""genocidal intent"" was evident ""from the way in which [its] military attack is being conducted"". Israel had a plan to ""destroy"" Gaza, he said, which ""has been nurtured at the highest level of state"".Adila Hassim, also representing South Africa, told the court that ""every day there is mounting, irreparable loss of life, property, dignity and humanity for the Palestinian people"".""Nothing will stop the suffering, except an order from this court."" In its evidence submitted before the hearing, South Africa said Israel's actions were ""intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group"".The German government issued a statement on Friday, saying it ""expressly rejects the accusation of genocide"" against Israel, and that the accusation had ""no basis whatsoever"".""In view of Germany's history and the crime against humanity of the Shoah [Holocaust], the Federal Government sees itself as particularly committed to the Convention against Genocide... We firmly oppose [its] political instrumentalisation.""Government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said Germany would speak at the main hearing at the ICJ.A spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Mr Sunak believed South Africa's case was ""completely unjustified and wrong.""""The UK government stands by Israel's clear right to defend itself within the framework of international law,"" he said.What the ICJ will deliver on the genocide allegation will be only an opinion, although it is being closely watched.A final ruling on this could take years, although the court could rule more quickly on South Africa's request for Israel to suspend its military campaign.Correction 13th February: This article wrongly reported that about 1,300 people had been killed following the 7th October attack by Hamas. This was based on counting those who later died from their injuries in addition to the figure of more than 1,200. The article has been amended to now refer to about 1,200 deaths, a figure which includes those deaths and which Israel says is not final.","Israel faces accusations that it is subjecting Palestinians in Gaza to genocidal acts, as the International Court of Justice (ICJ) commenced ahearingon South Africa’s genocide case against it on Thursday. Amid Israel’s ongoing three-month war in Gaza, more than 23,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed, lawyers told the top United Nations court. Most of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million has been displaced, and an Israeli blockade severely limiting food, fuel and medicine has caused a humanitarian “catastrophe”, according to the UN. South Africa’s case in The Hague argues thatIsrael violatedthe 1948 genocide convention, established in the aftermath of the Holocaust, which mandates that all countries prevent the recurrence of such crimes. It filed an 84-page document with the court detailing acts it says amount to genocide in Gaza. Adila Hassim, a lawyer representing South Africa, told the ICJ that Israel had breached Article II of the Genocide Convention, which included the “mass killing” of Palestinians in Gaza. “Israel deployed 6,000 bombs per week … No one is spared. Not even newborns. UN chiefs have described it as a graveyard for children,” she said. “Nothing will stop the suffering, except an order from this court,” she added. South Africa has demanded that the ICJ order Israel to suspend its military campaign. Also called the World Court, the ICJ is the highest UN legal body that can adjudicate issues between member states. Alanna O’Malley, a professor of UN and international history, told Al Jazeera that South Africa’s case was a “historic” one. “We see from the invocation of the various articles of the Genocide Convention by the South African legal team the ways in which they are going to structurally present this case,” she said outside the court in The Hague, calling it “extremely compelling”. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said his nation was pursuing the case of what it called “the ongoing slaughter of the people of Gaza”. Israel will respond to the allegations made by South Africa on Friday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that hypocrisy and lies had been presented to the UN’s top court, adding that South Africa’s accusation against Israel of genocide in Gaza could only happen in a world turned upside-down. “We are fighting terrorists, we are fighting lies,” Netanyahu said. “Today we saw an upside-down world. Israel is accused of genocide while it is fighting against genocide.” “Israel is fighting murderous terrorists who carried out crimes against humanity: They slaughtered, they raped, they burned, they dismembered, they beheaded – children, women, elderly, young men and women,” he said. “The hypocrisy of South Africa screams to the heavens.” Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, another lawyer for South Africa, tackled the issue of Israel’s “genocidal intent” against the Palestinians in Gaza, usually the most difficult thing to prove in a case of this kind. “Israel’s political leaders, military commanders and persons holding official positions have systematically and in explicit terms declared their genocidal intent,” he said. “These statements are then repeated by soldiers on the ground in Gaza as they engage in the destruction of Palestinians and the physical infrastructure of Gaza.” Ngcukaitobi brought to the court’s attention Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s comments on October 28, 2023, urging ground troops preparing to enter Gaza to “remember what Amalek has done to you“.    “This refers to the Biblical command by God to Saul for the retaliatory destruction of an entire group of people,” the lawyer said. “The evidence of genocidal intent is not only chilling, it is also overwhelming and incontrovertible,” he added. Israel has rejected the accusations of genocide as baseless, with President Isaac Herzog calling the case “preposterous” and saying it constitutes a “blood libel”. On Thursday, Israel’s foreign ministry spokesman, Lior Haiat, called the case “hypocrisy” and accused South Africa of being the “legal arm” of Hamas. Gaza resident Aya Daloul said she hoped for a favourable decision and for the ICJ to help “stop the Israeli genocide against the Palestinians”. “The war must come to an end. We need to go back home and live in freedom and peace,” she told Al Jazeera. Outside the ICJ, a large number of demonstratorsgatheredto express solidarity with Palestinians and call for an end to Israel’s war, with people holding Palestinian flags and chanting occasionally: “Stop, stop genocide”, “We are all Palestinians” and “Boycott Israel”. “I’m here because we just can’t assist this genocide every day on social media and not do anything,” said Kim Wouters, a demonstrator who travelled from Brussels. Meanwhile, South Africans are feeling “a lot of pride” over the legal action taken by their country, said Al Jazeera’s Fahmida Miller, reporting from Pretoria. “What is happening in Gaza resonates very deeply with many South Africans because of their own history of apartheid, subjugation, oppression, institutionalised racism and the challenges South Africans have had to overcome,” she said. White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Thursday that the United States sees no basis for South Africa’s allegation of genocide against Israel over civilian deaths in Gaza.

Saleh al-Arouri: Thousands attend Hamas deputy leader's funeral in Beirut,"Who was Saleh al-Arouri, the Hamas leader killed in Beirut?",0.590095902985106,2024-01-04,2024-01-03,"Thousands of people have attended the funeral in Beirut of Saleh al-Arouri, the top Hamas leader assassinated in a suspected Israeli attack in the Lebanese capital two days ago. Crowds carried banners with his picture and waved Palestinian and Hamas flags through the streets amid the sound of music, prayers and heavy gunfire, while Hamas officials vowed to retaliate.The assassination of Arouri was a blow for Hamas - he was a deputy Hamas leader and a key figure in the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, the group's armed wing - and renewed fears of a wider war in the region. It also hit its Lebanese ally Hezbollah, the powerful Iranian-backed movement, as it struck Dahiyeh, a suburb of the city that is a stronghold for the group.In Lebanon, again, the focus is on what Hassan Nasrallah, the influential Hezbollah leader, will decide to do.Less than 24 hours after the attack, he addressed his followers, in a speech that had been scheduled to commemorate the Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani, killed in a US drone strike four years ago. He could not ignore what had just happened in his own backyard.As usual, Nasrallah spoke from an undisclosed location, and described Arouri's assassination as a ""flagrant Israeli aggression"" that would not go unpunished. ""If the enemy considers waging a war against Lebanon, our battle will be without boundaries or rules,"" he said.But, crucially, there was no open threat to attack Israel, which has neither confirmed or denied involvement in the killing, nor any indication of how Hezbollah might act. One of Hezbollah's aims is the destruction of Israel, which sees the group as a more formidable enemy than Hamas. Hezbollah has a vast arsenal of weapons including precision-guided missiles that can strike deep into Israeli territory, as well as tens of thousands of well-trained, battle-hardened fighters.Since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in October, Hezbollah has been attacking positions in northern Israel almost every day, describing the actions as its support for the Palestinian group. The Israeli military has retaliated, but so far, the violence has been largely contained to areas along the Lebanon-Israel border.Hezbollah has calculated its actions to prevent a full-scale war with Israel, and there is no indication this strategy is likely to change. Many here still remember the destruction caused by the month-long conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, and with Lebanon suffering a massive economic crisis, there is virtually no public support for any military confrontation. Israeli authorities have warned Hezbollah against escalating the conflict. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has in the past said Israel's military could do to Beirut what it had done to Gaza. On Thursday, as he met US envoy Amos Hochstein in Tel Aviv, Mr Gallant reaffirmed his country's determination to change the security situation in northern Israel, to allow the return of residents evacuated due to constant attacks. But, he said, there was a ""short window of time for diplomatic understandings, which we prefer"". Some senior Israeli officials, however, have supported further action against Hezbollah to eliminate the threat posed by the group.Nasrallah is expected to address his supporters again on Friday. His latest speech may be an indication that for whatever reason, he wants to avoid triggering a bigger conflict with Israel. However, he needs to be seen to be giving a response to the attack in Beirut. But any reaction is likely to be calibrated to avoid strong retaliation from Israel, and the possibility of another catastrophic conflict for Lebanon.","A drone strike in Beirut’s southern suburbs of Dahiyeh, a Hezbollah stronghold, killed senior Hamas official Saleh al-Arouri on Tuesday. The drone hit a Hamas office, leaving six people dead, Lebanon’s state news agency reported. Hamas confirmed the death of al-Arouri and called it a “cowardly assassination” by Israel, adding that attacks on Palestinians “inside and outside Palestine will not succeed in breaking the will and steadfastness of our people, or undermining the continuation of their valiant resistance”. “It proves once again the abject failure of this enemy to achieve any of its aggressive goals in the Gaza Strip,” the group said. Following the news of the death of al-Arouri, mosques in Arura, the occupied West Bank town of north Ramallah, are mourning his death and a general strike has been called in Ramallah for Wednesday. Here is what to know about the Hamas official killed in Lebanon. Al-Arouri, 57, was the deputy chief of Hamas’s political bureau and one of the founders of the group’s armed wing, the Qassam Brigades. He had been living in exile in Lebanon after spending 15 years in an Israeli jail. Before the war began on October 7, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had threatened to kill him. In recent weeks, al-Arouri took on the role of spokesperson for the group and told Al Jazeera last month that Hamas would not discuss an exchange deal for the captives the group is holding before the war ends in Gaza. The United States labelled al-Arouri as a “global terrorist” in 2015 and issued a $5m reward for any information on him. While there has been no official response from Israel about the death of the Hamas official, Mark Regev, an adviser to Netanyahu, told the US outlet MSNBC that Israel does not take responsibility for this attack. But, added, “Whoever did it, it must be clear: this was not an attack on the Lebanese state.” “Whoever did this did a surgical strike against the Hamas leadership,” he said. However, Danny Danon, a former Israeli envoy to the United Nations, hailed the attack and congratulated the Israeli army, Shin Bet, the security service and Mossad, Israel’s intelligence agency, for killing al-Arouri. “Anyone who was involved in the 7/10 massacre should know that we will reach out to them and close an account with them,” he said on X in Hebrew, referring to the October 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel that killed nearly 1,200 people. Israel’s relentless bombing and artillery shelling of Gaza since then has killed more than 22,000 Palestinians, including more than 8,000 children. According to Israeli media, the government has ordered cabinet ministers not to give any interviews about al-Arouri’s death after Danon’s tweet. Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned the attack on the Beruit suburb and said it was a “new Israeli crime” as well as an attempt to pull Lebanon into the war. Mikati also warned against the “Israeli political upper echelon resorting to exporting its failures in Gaza to the southern border to impose new facts on the ground and change the rules of engagement”. Hezbollah said that the attack on Lebanon’s capital “will not pass without punishment”."
Samer Abudaqa: Al Jazeera cameraman killed in Gaza drone strike,Al Jazeera to refer journalist Samer Abudaqa’s killing to ICC,0.5879374725999109,2023-12-16,2023-12-16,"The funeral has been held of an Al Jazeera cameraman who was killed by an Israeli drone strike on Gaza.Samer Abudaqa was wounded in the strike on a school in Khan Younis on Friday along with his colleague, Wael Al-Dahdouh.Al Jazeera said Abudaqa bled to death because a heavy bombardment prevented paramedics from reaching him.The Qatar-based network said it had referred the case to the International Criminal Court (ICC).Posting on X, formerly known as Twitter, Al Jazeera referred to Abudaqa's death as an ""assassination"", and said that its legal filing to the ICC would include repeated attacks on network crews working in the Palestinian territories.The network said Abudaqa was its 13th journalist to die on duty since it was created in 1996.Dahdouh, who lost several family members in an earlier Israeli bombing, survived the attack.During his eulogy at this colleague's funeral, Dahdouh said journalists in Gaza would ""continue to do our duty with professionalism and transparency"".He said that journalists in Gaza were carrying a ""human and noble message"" for the world amid the ongoing war and would continue to work despite Israeli attacks.According to Al Jazeera, Dahdouh was hit by shrapnel on his upper arm and managed to walk to Nasser hospital for treatment.Abudaqa also suffered shrapnel injuries, but paramedics struggled reach him as the area was under heavy bombardment from Israeli forces.Al Jazeera said the cameraman was ""left to bleed to death for over five hours,"" adding it held Israel accountable for targeting its journalists and their families.Abudaqa joined Al Jazeera in June 2004, working as a cameraman and editor. He had three sons and a daughter, and lived in the town of Abasan al-Kabira near Khan Younis.Al Jazeera's managing editor, Mohamed Moawad, described Abudaqa as ""a skilled professional but a compassionate soul who understood the power of visual storytelling"". ""His unwavering commitment to truth and storytelling has left an indelible mark on our team,"" he said on X.According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), at least 64 journalists - mostly Palestinians - have been killed since the Israel-Gaza conflict began on 7 October.The Foreign Press Association (FPA), which represents several hundred journalists working for international news organisations, said it grieved the cameraman's death. saying he was the first FPA member to be killed in the Israel-Gaza conflict.""We consider this a grave blow to the already limited freedom of the press in Gaza and call on the army for a prompt investigation and explanation.""","The Al Jazeera Media Network says it will refer the killing of its cameraman Samer Abudaqa in Gaza to the International Criminal Court (ICC). In a statement on Saturday, the Qatar-based network said it has instructed its legal team to “urgently” refer the case of what it called “the assassination” of Al Jazeera Arabic cameraman Samer Abudaqa to the court in The Hague. Abudaqa waskilled by a drone attackon Friday while reporting on an earlier bombing of a school used as a shelter for displaced people in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip. “Al Jazeera Media Network reiterates its denunciation and condemnation of the assassination crime of its colleague, Samer Abudaqa, who devoted 19 years with the Network to covering the ongoing conflict in the occupied Palestinian territories,” said the network’s statement. “In addition to the assassination of Abudaqa by the Israeli occupation forces in the Gaza Strip, the legal file will also encompass recurrent attacks on the Network’s crews working and operating in the occupied Palestinian territories and instances of incitement against them.” Targeting journalists is a war crime under Article 8 of the Rome Statute. The media network said it has set up a working group comprising its international legal team and international legal experts to submit a file to the court’s prosecutor.  Al Jazeera Arabic correspondent Wael Dahdouh – who lost his wife, son, daughter and grandson in aprevious Israeli bombing– was wounded in the same attack on Friday. He was hit by shrapnel on his upper arm and managed to reach the Nasser Hospital where he was treated for minor injuries. But rescue teams were unable to immediately reach Abudaqa and others at the site as they needed approval from Israeli forces to bulldoze through the debris to get to the location. By the time rescuers arrived five hours after the attack, Abudaqa had bled to death.    The 45-year-old was laid to rest in southern Gaza on Saturday, with dozens of mourners, including journalists, paying their respects. “We are carrying this human message, we are carrying this noble message,” Dahdouh said in his eulogy asmourners around him wept. “We will continue to do our duty with professionalism and transparency.” Al Jazeera had previously submitted aformal requestto the ICC to investigate and prosecute those responsible for shooting a veteran television reporterShireen Abu Aklehin May 2022 while covering an Israeli military raid on the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank. Evidence provided in the request, filed in December 2022, includes a comprehensive six-month investigation by the network, gathering witness accounts and video footage, among other material. The ICC has acknowledged its receipt, yet no further steps have been taken. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) says the ongoing conflict in Gaza is the deadliest for journalists ever recorded, with at least 64 reporters and media workers killed in 10 weeks of the enclave’s bombing. The CPJ has also called on the international authorities to “conduct an independent investigation into the attack to hold the perpetrators to account”.   "
Israel-Gaza war: US backs UN Security Council vote on Gaza aid boost,"Gaza death toll surpasses 20,000 as UN Security Council delays vote on aid",0.5867415247906571,2023-12-22,2023-12-20,"The UN Security Council is moving closer to a vote on humanitarian aid for Gaza after the US expressed support for the latest draft resolution. The vote, now delayed until Friday, had been in limbo after the US voiced ""widespread concerns"" with a draft. Washington had said it was concerned the resolution, put forward by the United Arab Emirates, could ""actually slow down"" aid into Gaza.The latest announcement from the US comes after some two weeks of talks.All week, the Security Council has repeatedly postponed the draft resolution aimed at bringing in some form of ceasefire, as wrangling continued over the language.The original draft called for a sustainable cessation of hostilities, but the final version calls for creating the conditions for one.It no longer calls for the use of all land, sea and air routes for deliveries - just all available routes. It still creates a mechanism to accelerate aid - but makes clear that's in consultation with relevant parties such as Israel. Emerging from a closed-door session on Thursday night, US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield rejected claims the latest draft had been watered down, arguing it is ""a very strong resolution"". She called it ""a resolution that we can support"", but declined to say if the US would vote 'yes' or abstain. The key sticking point on Thursday appeared to be over the text's proposal to have a UN mechanism to monitor aid into Gaza - something the Arab group of nations insisted must be part of any meaningful resolution.But the US said that could take away Israel's control of the screening process - and it asked for another delay to allow time for discussions with Egypt on how such a monitoring mechanism could work for all parties.Currently, Israel monitors all aid and fuel deliveries to Gaza.Earlier this month, the majority of the Security Council - 13 of 15 members - supported a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, but the US vetoed it and the UK abstained. The US, like Israel, has objected that a ceasefire would benefit Hamas - and instead the US supports proposed pauses in fighting.But since then, pressure has been growing for fighting to be paused. Earlier this week, Hamas said the number of people killed in Gaza in 10 weeks of fighting had passed 20,000.On Thursday, the UN's World Food Programme warned that Gaza was at risk of famine if the war continued.WFP spokesperson Shaza Moghraby said: ""We cannot wait for famine to be declared before we act. ""We need an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, the opening of all border crossings and the resumption of commercial cargo to provide relief, put an end to the suffering and avert the very serious threat of famine.""Talks had been taking place in Egypt to reach a new truce - similar to the week-long pause in fighting last month that saw hostages released.But on Thursday they suffered a setback when Hamas said it would not agree to a release of some hostages in exchange for a partial ceasefire.It said Palestinian groups had rejected the prospect of more hostages being released until Israel agrees to end the war. Israel has repeatedly rejected a permanent ceasefire with Hamas.More than 240 Israeli hostages were captured on 7 October when Hamas broke through the heavily guarded perimeter with Israel, killing 1,200 people. A total of 110 hostages were released in the truce last month.","At least 20,000 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip since Israel began bombarding the enclave more than 10 weeks ago, according to Palestinian officials. At least 8,000 children and 6,200 women are among those killed, Gaza’s Government Media Office said on Wednesday. The grim milestone was passed as the United Nations Security Council postponed a key vote on a bid to boost humanitarian aid for Gaza for the third time to avoid a veto from the United States, which traditionally shields its ally Israel from UN action. Since a seven-day truce collapsed on December 1, the war has entered a more intensive phase with ground combat previously confined to the northern half of the territory now spread across its length. When asked about the ever-growing casualty count, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said it is “clear that the conflict will move and needs to move to a lower intensity phase”. “We expect to see and want to see a shift to more targeted [Israeli] operations with a smaller number of forces that’s really focused in on dealing with the leadership of Hamas, the tunnel network and a few other critical things,” he said. “And as that happens, I think you’ll see as well the harm done to civilians also decrease significantly.” Air strikes continued across Gaza on Wednesday with at least 46 people killed and dozens wounded in Israeli attacks on the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, according to the enclave’s Ministry of Health. In Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, where hundreds of thousand of people have been pushed since early December by Israel’s continued onslaught, air strikes hit a building near a hospital close to an Al Jazeera crew reporting live on air, killing at least 10 people. “More air strikes are conducted, more victims fall due to the expansion of the Israeli military operations in the areas that are supposed to be safe zones where the majority of Gazans have been urged to flee,” Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum said in reporting from Rafah. “The air strike took place in an area considered to be very densely populated, and it’s a miracle that no more than this number of people were killed,” he added. The UN Security Council vote on a bid to boost aid to the Gaza Strip and ask the UN to monitor humanitarian aid deliveries there has been delayed at the request of the US, diplomats said. According to the United Arab Emirates envoy to the UN, Lana Nusseibeh, the vote will take place on Thursday. “Everyone wants to see a resolution that has impact and is implementable on the ground, and there are some discussions going on on how to make that possible,” Nusseibeh, whose country drafted the resolution, told reporters in New York. The text aims to dilute Israel’s control over all humanitarian aid deliveries to the 2.3 million people of Gaza. The initial text has been reportedly modified to soften calls to end the fighting in Gaza to avoid yet another veto from the US. “We want to make sure that the resolution … doesn’t do anything that could actually hurt the delivery of humanitarian assistance, make it more complicated. That’s what we’re focused on,” Blinken told reporters on Wednesday. “I hope we can get to a good place.” Currently, Israel monitors the limited humanitarian aid and fuel deliveries to Gaza via the Rafah crossing from Egypt and the Israel-controlled Karem Abu Salem crossing, known as Kerem Shalom in Hebrew. On Wednesday, the first aid convoy entered Gaza directly from Jordan with 750 metric tonnes of food. The World Food Programme said half of Gaza’s population is starving and only 10 percent of the food required has entered Gaza since the war began on October 7. The US and Israel oppose a ceasefire, believing it would benefit only Hamas. Washington instead supports pauses in fighting to protect civilians and allow the release of captives taken by Hamas. Separately on Wednesday, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyehpaid his first visit to Egyptfor more than a month in a rare personal intervention in diplomacy amid hopes that the Palestinian group and Israel could agree terms for another truce. Haniyeh arrived in the Egyptian capital to meet with Cairo’s spy chief and other Egyptian officials who are acting as key mediators. Meanwhile, Israeli officials have indicated in talks with US and Qatari representatives that they could be open to a truce. The Hamas leader last travelled to Egypt in early November before the announcement of the only pause in the fighting so far, a weeklong truce that saw the release of about 110 of 240 captives taken by Hamas into Gaza on October 7. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a smaller armed group that is also holding captives in Gaza, said its leader would also visit Egypt in the coming days to discuss a possible end to the war. A source briefed on the negotiations said envoys were discussing which of the captives still held by Palestinian groups could be freed in a new truce and what prisoners Israel might release in return, the Reuters news agency reported. But there remains a huge gulf between the two sides’ publicly stated positions on any halt to the fighting. Hamas rejects any further temporary pause and says it will discuss only a permanent ceasefire. Israel has ruled that out and says it will agree only limited humanitarian pauses until Hamas is defeated. US President Joe Biden said he did not expect an Israel-Hamas deal for the release of captives held in Gaza to be struck soon. “We’re pushing,” Biden told reporters during a trip to Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

"Daily toll on Gazan civilians, especially children, 'far too high' - Blinken",Blinken says civilian death toll in Gaza ‘far too high’,0.5827969568871474,2024-01-09,2024-01-09,,"United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said the civilian death toll in Gaza is “far too high”, especially among children, and called for aid to reach the besieged strip more effectively. Speaking at a news conference in Jerusalem on Tuesday, Blinken said the US continued to stand with Israel in its mission to “ensure that October 7 never happens again”, but also sought to avoid further civilian losses in Gaza and prevent the conflict from spreading to the wider region. The US diplomat, who is on hisfourth visit to the Middle Eastsince the conflict began, said Israel had taken steps to ensure that aid reached the population of Gaza, including opening Karem Abu Salem, also known as Kerem Shalom, border crossing with Gaza. Blinken travelled to Turkey, Greece, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates before Israel, and was in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday for talks with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah. Blinken’s visit to Ramallah and Israel showed there was no fundamental change in Washington’s stance, said Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri. “The aim of the visit was to support the security of the occupation,” he told the Reuters news agency. The Palestinian armed group said in a statement that Blinken’s position “reflects the extent of US involvement in these crimes and the widespread violations of all international laws committed by the Israeli army in the Gaza Strip”. Speaking in Israel earlier of plans for post-war Gaza, Blinken said countries in the region had expressed their readiness to work towards an “integrated region”, but that any agreement must include the fulfilment of Palestinian political ambitions. “Many countries in the region are prepared to invest when the conflict is over in [Gaza’s] reconstruction and security,” Blinken said. “But it is essential to them that there also be a clear pathway to the realisation of aPalestinian political state.” He added that the present moment presented a “powerful opportunity” but that all parties must work together towards this goal. “Israel must stop taking steps that undercut Palestinians’ ability to govern themselves effectively,” he said, including “settler violence carried out with impunity, settlement expansion, demolitions and evictions. “All make it harder – not easier – for Israel to achieve lasting peace,” he said. The top US official also reiterated that Washington rejects any plans for the permanent displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip. “As soon as conditions allow, we want to see people move back home and we’ve been very clear about that,” he said, adding that a UN assessment mission had been agreed upon to determine the presence of suitable conditions for residents to move back to northern Gaza.  Blinken deflected a reporter’s question on whether the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government would accept a two-state solution and agree to a diplomatic solution, saying he could not speak for Tel Aviv. Al Jazeera’s diplomatic editor Marwan Bishara said Blinken spoke for Arab leaders, but refused to relay Israel’s position “because Netanyahu disagrees”. “He doesn’t want a two-state solution, he does not want to leave Gaza or the West Bank, he wants to continue to settle illegally,” Bishara added. Israel stands accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), based in The Hague, afterSouth Africafiled the lawsuit at the end of December. Blinken rejected the accusation as “meritless”, saying the lawsuit “distracts the war” and downplays the threats against Israelis and Jews. The conflict broke out on October 7, when Hamas launched an attack on southern Israel that killed 1,139 people, according to Israeli authorities. Israel responded with a devastating bombardment and a ground invasion of Gaza that has destroyed much of the territory and killed more than 23,200 people, mostly women and children, according to Palestinian officials. Blinken said the war could “have ended on October 8” if Hamas had given up its weapons and released the hostages. Israel said that of about 240 people seized by Palestinian armed groups on October 7, 132 are still being held in Gaza and 25 have died in captivity. “This [war] could end tomorrow if Hamas makes those decisions,” he added. In his meeting with Netanyahu, Blinken “stressed the importance of avoiding further civilian harm and protecting civilian infrastructure in Gaza”, according to the US Department of State. The secretary of state voiced hope that, after the war, Israel could push on with its efforts towards regional integration following its US-brokered normalisation deals with the UAE and other states. Several dozen protesters gathered outside the hotel where Blinken was holding the meetings and called for a ceasefire to secure the release of the captives. Israel’s Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told Blinken that increasing pressure on Iran was “critical” as it could prevent a regional escalation. “An increase in the pressure placed on Iran is critical and may prevent regional escalation in additional arenas,” Gallant was quoted as saying in a government statement. Tensions mounted on the Israel-Lebanon border on Tuesday as the Israeli army and the Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollahtraded fire. In Jordan on Friday, Blinken noted “real concern” over the situation along the Lebanese border, which is stoking fears of a wider regional conflagration.   "
Al-Shifa: WHO says Gaza hospital unable to bury dead bodies,Gaza’s al-Shifa Hospital forced to bury dead patients in ‘mass grave’,0.5777228844061596,2023-11-13,2023-11-14,"This story contains some upsetting detailsThousands could be trapped inside Gaza's largest hospital due to nearby fighting, while officials have warned of rotting bodies piling up there.Al-Shifa Hospital, which is also tackling power cuts and a lack of fuel, is ""nearly a cemetery"", the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned.The hospital's manager said it was under a ""blockade"", and that dogs had started eating corpses. The area around the hospital has seen intense fighting in recent days.US President Joe Biden said he hoped to see ""less intrusive action"" at the hospital, which he said ""must be protected"". Gaza City has seen an intensification of fighting between Israeli and Hamas forces in recent days, much of which has been taking place in streets close to the hospital. There have been reports of tanks and armoured vehicles being within metres of the hospital gate. Israel accuses Hamas of operating a command-and-control centre in tunnels underneath the hospital, which Hamas and the hospital deny. It also accuses Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip, of ""preventing humanitarian solutions"". Israel's army has also said that while there are clashes close to Al-Shifa, there is no shooting at the hospital itself nor a siege, and that anyone wanting to leave can do so. Christian Lindmeier, a spokesman for the WHO, said about 600 people remained in the hospital, with others sheltering in hallways. ""Around the hospital there are dead bodies which cannot be taken care of or not even be buried or taken away to any sort of morgue,"" he said. ""The hospital is not working at all any more as it should. It's nearly a cemetery.""The Hamas-run health ministry has said there are at least 2,300 people still inside the hospital - up to 650 patients, 200 to 500 staff and around 1,500 people seeking shelter. Doctors have also spoken of bodies piling up and rotting at the hospital, and Dr Mohamed Abu Selmia, Al-Shifa's manager, said there were about 150 bodies decomposing, ""leaving unpleasant odours"". He told the BBC the Israeli authorities had still not granted permission for those bodies to leave the hospital to be buried, and that dogs had now entered the hospital grounds and started eating the bodies. There are also concerns about the fate of dozens of premature babies that are no longer able to stay in their incubators due to the power cuts. Dr Selmia said three babies were among several patients who have died due to a lack of oxygen. He said negotiations had been conducted with Israeli authorities to try to evacuate the babies, but that no agreement had been reached. Mark Regev, a senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said Israel was offering ""practical solutions"" to evacuate the babies, but accused Hamas of not accepting proposals. ""They don't take the fuel that was offered for their generators. They don't support the movement of babies out in ambulances, so of course they're stuck there because [Hamas] want those terrible photographs,"" he said. He also accused Hamas of turning the hospital ""into a war zone"" by building tunnels underneath it. Hamas denies using the hospital for its operations, while doctors inside insist there is no Hamas presence there. As well as Al-Shifa, other hospitals across the Gaza Strip have reported widespread issues, including a lack of supplies and power due to the fighting and the blockade Israel has enforced on the territory since Hamas launched its attacks on Israel on 7 October. ","Staff at Gaza City’sal-Shifa Hospitalhave buried dozens of patients in a mass grave, hospital officials say, as thousands of Palestinians remain trapped in the facility surrounded by Israeli forces. “There are bodies littered in the hospital complex, and there is no longer electricity at the morgues,” al-Shifa Hospital Director Mohammad Abu Salmiya told the AFP news agency on Tuesday. “We were forced to bury them in a mass grave.” He said 179 bodies had been interred so far in the courtyard and seven babies and 29 intensive care patients were among those who have died since fuel for the hospital’s generator ran out on Saturday. Israeli forces have surrounded theGaza Strip’s largest hospital, whichIsrael sayssits atop a complex of tunnels and a command centre used by fighters from the armed wing of the Palestinian group Hamas, which governs Gaza. Hamas has denied fighters are present and said 650 patients and 5,000 to 7,000 displaced civilians are trapped inside the hospital grounds and under constant fire from snipers and drones. The United States said it “has information that Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad use some hospitals in the Gaza Strip, including al-Shifa, and tunnels underneath them to conceal and support their military operations and to hold hostages,” according to National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby. He said members of the two Palestinian groups “operate a command and control node from al-Shifa in Gaza City” and store weapons there. Kirby presented no evidence to back up the claims, which echo allegations made, also without evidence, by Israel. “To be clear, we do not support striking a hospital from the air. We do not want to see a firefight in a hospital where innocent people, helpless people, sick people are simply trying to get the medical care they deserve,” Kirby said. The United Nations estimated that at least 2,300 people – patients, staff and displaced civilians – are inside and may be unable to escape amid fierce fighting.    The deteriorating conditions at hospitals in Gaza has been a source of tension between Israel and its allies during Israel’s assault and siege on Gaza, which has cut off access tofuel. On Monday, US PresidentJoe Bidensaid he hoped to see “less intrusive action relative to hospitals”. The United Nations said 22 of 36hospitals in Gazaare not functional due to lack of generator fuel, damage and combat. “The 14 hospitals remaining open have barely enough supplies to sustain critical and lifesaving surgeries and provide inpatient care, including intensive care,” said the World Health Organization (WHO) in the Palestinian Territories. Gaza Ministry of Health spokesperson Ashraf al-Qudra said on Tuesday that an Israeli offer to move babies out of al-Shifa Hospital with portable incubators has not resulted in a concrete plan. Speaking to reporters in Geneva on Tuesday, WHO spokesperson Margaret Harris said moving sick and vulnerable patients out of the hospital was an “impossible task”. “And again, why would you need to move them?” she asked. “A hospital should never be under attack. A hospital is a place of safe haven. This is agreed under international humanitarian law.”    Israel has denied that the hospital is under siege and said it is giving people inside the hospital routes to escape. Medical workers and health officials in the hospital have rejected the claim and said Israeli fire has brought additional danger to the performance of their medical duties. “The occupation is still besieging the hospital, and they are firing into the yards from time to time,” al-Qudra said. “We still can’t move around, but sometimes doctors are taking the risk when they need to attend to patients.” Israel has bombarded Gaza and launched a ground offensive after Hamas fighters from the territory carried out an attack on southern Israel last month, killing more than 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials. The Israeli assault has killed more than 11,200 people, including more than 4,600 children, according to Palestinian officials."
Israel-Gaza war: Blinken says cost of conflict on children far too high,Blinken says civilian death toll in Gaza ‘far too high’,0.5695795082090868,2024-01-09,2024-01-09,"The cost of war on Gaza's civilians is ""far too high"", US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said. Mr Blinken said Israel needed to remove barriers so more essential aid could be allowed into Gaza.But he said Israel faced a huge challenge in fighting an enemy in Hamas which had embedded itself within the civilian population.Mr Blinken was speaking after meeting Israeli leaders on his fourth trip to the country since the conflict began.America's top diplomat told a news conference in Tel Aviv that leaders in the region shared US concerns about the ""dire humanitarian situation"" on the ground. But he said he had heard a new and powerful message from Israel's neighbours over the last three days. They are willing not only to live with Israel but to integrate the region in a way that makes everyone secure, including Israel, Mr Blinken said. In other words, talk of diplomatic normalisation with Israel - which had appeared to be derailed by the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel - is on the table.That, he said, would require some hard decisions and hard choices - which include Israel agreeing to a ""clear pathway to the realisation of Palestinian political rights and a Palestinian state"" which he said was vital for long-term peace. Mr Blinken would not be drawn on whether this was something Israel would consider. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously voiced his staunch opposition to such a state, citing security concerns. Israel launched its offensive in Gaza in response to a cross-border assault by Hamas - designated a terrorist organisation by Israel and many western nations including the US. About 1,200 people were killed in the attacks.Since then, more than 23,200 people - mostly women and children - have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.When asked about whether there was any evidence that Israel was de-escalating its military campaign in Gaza, Mr Blinken answered that no one in the region - including the Israelis - wanted the conflict to escalate. That may be reassuring for many worried about the conflict spreading, but he gave no indication that Israel told him it was winding down its military operations anytime soon. In recent weeks, Hezbollah, a Lebanon-based organisation designated a terrorist group by the US, has increased rocket fire into northern Israel.Yemeni Houthi rebels have also attacked commercial shipping in the Red Sea - one of the world's most important trading routes. The Houthis, Hezbollah and Hamas are backed by Iran. Mr Blinken's meetings in Israel on Tuesday were not entirely without tangible results. He announced that the US and Israel agreed on a plan for the UN to conduct an ""assessment mission"" that would be the first step toward allowing Palestinians to return to the areas of northern Gaza that have been devastated by the Israeli offensive.Even here, however, Mr Blinken warned that their return would not happen ""overnight"". Too much has to be done to clear the area of unexploded ordinance and booby traps, as well as to ensure supporting infrastructure is in place.Mr Blinken also told the press conference that South African claims that Israel was committing genocide, filed at the International Court of Justice, were ""meritless"".But he said: ""The daily toll on civilians in Gaza, particularly on children, is far too high.""He cited UN figures that 90% of the population continued to face severe food insecurity, adding: ""For children, the effects of long periods without sufficient food can have lifelong consequences."" ""More food, more water, more medicine, other essential goods need to get into Gaza. And then once they're in Gaza, they need to get more effectively to the people who need them.""Correction 13th February: This article wrongly reported that about 1,300 people had been killed following the 7th October attack by Hamas. This was based on counting those who later died from their injuries in addition to the figure of more than 1,200. The article has been amended to now refer to about 1,200 deaths, a figure which includes those deaths and which Israel says is not final.","United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said the civilian death toll in Gaza is “far too high”, especially among children, and called for aid to reach the besieged strip more effectively. Speaking at a news conference in Jerusalem on Tuesday, Blinken said the US continued to stand with Israel in its mission to “ensure that October 7 never happens again”, but also sought to avoid further civilian losses in Gaza and prevent the conflict from spreading to the wider region. The US diplomat, who is on hisfourth visit to the Middle Eastsince the conflict began, said Israel had taken steps to ensure that aid reached the population of Gaza, including opening Karem Abu Salem, also known as Kerem Shalom, border crossing with Gaza. Blinken travelled to Turkey, Greece, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates before Israel, and was in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday for talks with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah. Blinken’s visit to Ramallah and Israel showed there was no fundamental change in Washington’s stance, said Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri. “The aim of the visit was to support the security of the occupation,” he told the Reuters news agency. The Palestinian armed group said in a statement that Blinken’s position “reflects the extent of US involvement in these crimes and the widespread violations of all international laws committed by the Israeli army in the Gaza Strip”. Speaking in Israel earlier of plans for post-war Gaza, Blinken said countries in the region had expressed their readiness to work towards an “integrated region”, but that any agreement must include the fulfilment of Palestinian political ambitions. “Many countries in the region are prepared to invest when the conflict is over in [Gaza’s] reconstruction and security,” Blinken said. “But it is essential to them that there also be a clear pathway to the realisation of aPalestinian political state.” He added that the present moment presented a “powerful opportunity” but that all parties must work together towards this goal. “Israel must stop taking steps that undercut Palestinians’ ability to govern themselves effectively,” he said, including “settler violence carried out with impunity, settlement expansion, demolitions and evictions. “All make it harder – not easier – for Israel to achieve lasting peace,” he said. The top US official also reiterated that Washington rejects any plans for the permanent displacement of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip. “As soon as conditions allow, we want to see people move back home and we’ve been very clear about that,” he said, adding that a UN assessment mission had been agreed upon to determine the presence of suitable conditions for residents to move back to northern Gaza.  Blinken deflected a reporter’s question on whether the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government would accept a two-state solution and agree to a diplomatic solution, saying he could not speak for Tel Aviv. Al Jazeera’s diplomatic editor Marwan Bishara said Blinken spoke for Arab leaders, but refused to relay Israel’s position “because Netanyahu disagrees”. “He doesn’t want a two-state solution, he does not want to leave Gaza or the West Bank, he wants to continue to settle illegally,” Bishara added. Israel stands accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), based in The Hague, afterSouth Africafiled the lawsuit at the end of December. Blinken rejected the accusation as “meritless”, saying the lawsuit “distracts the war” and downplays the threats against Israelis and Jews. The conflict broke out on October 7, when Hamas launched an attack on southern Israel that killed 1,139 people, according to Israeli authorities. Israel responded with a devastating bombardment and a ground invasion of Gaza that has destroyed much of the territory and killed more than 23,200 people, mostly women and children, according to Palestinian officials. Blinken said the war could “have ended on October 8” if Hamas had given up its weapons and released the hostages. Israel said that of about 240 people seized by Palestinian armed groups on October 7, 132 are still being held in Gaza and 25 have died in captivity. “This [war] could end tomorrow if Hamas makes those decisions,” he added. In his meeting with Netanyahu, Blinken “stressed the importance of avoiding further civilian harm and protecting civilian infrastructure in Gaza”, according to the US Department of State. The secretary of state voiced hope that, after the war, Israel could push on with its efforts towards regional integration following its US-brokered normalisation deals with the UAE and other states. Several dozen protesters gathered outside the hotel where Blinken was holding the meetings and called for a ceasefire to secure the release of the captives. Israel’s Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told Blinken that increasing pressure on Iran was “critical” as it could prevent a regional escalation. “An increase in the pressure placed on Iran is critical and may prevent regional escalation in additional arenas,” Gallant was quoted as saying in a government statement. Tensions mounted on the Israel-Lebanon border on Tuesday as the Israeli army and the Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollahtraded fire. In Jordan on Friday, Blinken noted “real concern” over the situation along the Lebanese border, which is stoking fears of a wider regional conflagration.   "
US says strikes on Iran-linked targets in Iraq and Syria just 'the beginning' - live updates,"US approves plan for strikes on Iran-linked targets in Iraq, Syria: Report",0.5680219883009887,2024-02-04,2024-02-02,,"The United States has reportedlyapproved a planto attack Iran-linked targets in Iraq and Syria in retaliation for the killing of three soldiers five days ago. US broadcaster CBS News reported on Thursday that the White House has approved the targeting of Iranian personnel and facilities inside the two countries in response to thedrone attack on Sundayat theTower 22 basenear the border between Syria and Jordan. It did not provide any further details but said, quoting unnamed US officials, that weather will be a major factor in the timing of the strikes as Washington purportedly wants better visibility to avoid targeting civilians. On Friday, Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi said his country will “respond strongly” to anyone who bullies it. “We will not start any war but if anyone wants to bully us they will receive a strong response,” Raisi said. “Before, when they [the Americans] wanted to talk to us, they said the military option is ‘on the table’. Now they say they have no intention of a conflict with Iran.” Tehran’s military power has not and will not pose a threat to any country in the region, the president said in a televised speech, adding that Iran’s strength only creates security for the countries around it. Iran has denied involvement in the drone strike in Jordan. The attack on the US base was claimed by the umbrella group of US and Israel-opposed armed factions called the Islamic Resistance in Iraq. It marked the first time an American soldier was killed since the start ofIsrael’s war on Gaza. Iran-aligned groups have launched hundreds of attacks on US bases in Iraq and Syria in recent years, but their attacks have only intensified since the start of the war on Gaza and the unwavering US support for it despite international calls for a ceasefire. The Iraqi group is a member of the “axis of resistance” that is backed by Tehran across the region, but Iran maintains that members of the axisdecide and act independentlyand do not take orders from it.  US President Joe Biden has promised a response, which has yet to come five days after the attack. US officials have said their strikes could take place over several days, have multiple targets, and be “sustained over time”. Both Iran and the US have said they wish to avoid escalating the military fallout of Israel’s war, which has spread to include Israel’s border fighting with Lebanon’s Hezbollah andYemen’s Houthi attackson Red Sea shipping and US and United Kingdom vessels. But Hossein Salami, the commander-in-chief of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), has warned that Tehran would respond to any US strikes. Reports have also suggested that Tehran and Washington have exchanged messages since the Syria-Jordan border strike, with Iran seriously warning against any attacks on its soil. Hawkish Republican officials in the US have called fordirect strikes on Iran, something that is likely to spread the scope of the war. In January 2020, after the US assassinated Iran’s top general Qassem Soleimani in Iraq, Iran launched missiles at a US base in Iraq which injured dozens of soldiers but did not kill anyone. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq said Wednesday it would “suspend” military operations against US forces to prevent further embarrassment for the Iraqi government. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Washington would watch for actions rather than words. The pro-Iran al-Nujaba movement said on Friday it would press on with attacks on US forces in the Middle East until its demands are met for US troops to leave Iraq and for an end to Israel’s war on Gaza. A US air strike in early January had killed a senior commander of al-Nujaba. Biden is expected at the Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on Friday to oversee the transfer of the remains of the three soldiers.   "
MK Strinda: Yemen's rebel Houthis hit Norwegian tanker with missile,Yemen’s Houthis claim missile attack on Norwegian ship Strinda,0.5668504702923302,2023-12-12,2023-12-12,"Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels have hit a Norwegian tanker with at least one missile, causing a fire.There were no casualties in the attack.A Houthi spokesman said the MT Strinda was delivering oil to Israel, but the ship's owners said it was headed to Italy with feedstock for biofuel.The group has vowed to block ships of any nation heading to Israel until Israel stops its offensive on Gaza, in what the Houthis say is a show of support for the Palestinians.The United States has said it will consider ""appropriate responses"" to any such attacks, which it describes as ""fully enabled by Iran"".Houthi military spokesman Yahya Saree said in a televised statement that the ship was targeted on Monday after its crew refused to respond to warnings.He said the group had prevented several ships from passing through Yemeni waters in recent days.The MT Strinda was attacked in the Bab El Mandeb strait at the entrance to the Red Sea.The missile caused a fire on board the ship but it was extinguished and the ship was able to make its way on to a safe port, ship owners J Ludwig Mowinckels Rederi said in a statement.They added that the 30-member crew, who are all Indian citizens, were unharmed.A US Navy destroyer provided assistance to the MT Strinda after receiving a mayday call, US officials said.The Bab El Mandeb Strait is a 20-mile wide channel that separates Eritrea and Djibouti on the African side from Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula.About 17,000 ships and 10% of global trade pass through it every year. Any ship passing through the Suez Canal to or from the Indian Ocean has to come this way.The Houthis - who are fighting Yemen's Saudi-backed government - have declared themselves part of an ""axis of resistance"" of Iran-affiliated groups opposing Israel, the US, and the wider West.They have already attacked several commercial ships this month, prompting a US destroyer to intervene, and in November they seized the cargo ship Galaxy Leader.","Yemen’s Houthi rebels say they hit a Norwegian tanker in the Iran-aligned group’s latest military operation amid Israel’s war on Gaza. The Norwegian-owned-and-operated ship, Strinda, was struck on Monday night as it passed through the strategic Bab al-Mandeb Strait separating East Africa from the Arabian Peninsula. On Tuesday, Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree said the group targeted the ship because it was “loaded with oil” bound for Israel. The crew refused to respond to all warnings, he said in a televised statement, adding the Houthis would continue blocking ships heading to Israeli ports until Israel allows the entry of food and medical aid into the Gaza Strip. French frigate FREMM Languedoc intercepted and destroyed a drone that was threatening the Strinda in a complex aerial attack originating from Yemen, the French defence ministry said in a statement. It said the attack had caused a fire on board the tanker, which was sailing under the Norwegian flag. The Strinda, an oil and chemical tanker, was on its way to Italy, according to ship-tracking data. The vessel is part of the fleet of Bergen-based shipping firm Mowinckels Rederi, according to its website. The company’s chief executive Geir Belsnes confirmed the ship had been “hit by a missile” and caught fire. “Fortunately, there were no injuries to any member of the crew, who managed to extinguish the fire,” Belsnes told Al Jazeera in an email. “Our focus has been, and remains, the safety and well-being of the seafarers onboard.” He added that the ship was now “proceeding to a safe port”. The United States Central Command (CENTCOM) said the attack happened around midnight local time (21:00 GMT) by “what is assessed to have been an Anti-Ship Cruise Missile (ASCM) launched from a Houthi-controlled area of Yemen”. The attack comes as threats on commercial shipping in the area amidIsrael’s war on Gazaescalate. Houthis have carried out a series ofattacks on vesselsin the Red Sea and launched drones and missiles targeting Israel. In recent days, they havethreatened to targetany vessel they believe is either going to or coming from Israel. CENTCOM said the USS Mason had responded to Strinda’s mayday call and provided assistance. The US and France have stopped short of saying their ships have been targeted but have admitted that Houthi drones have headed towards their ships and been shot down in self-defence. Washington has so far declined to directlyrespond to the attacks, as has Israel, whose military continues to describe the ships as not having links to their country. In November, the Houthis seized a vehicle transport ship linked to Israel in the Red Sea off Yemen. The rebels still hold the vessel near the port city of Hodeidah. Separately, a container ship owned by an Israeli billionaire came under attack by a suspected Iranian drone in the Indian Ocean. A tentative ceasefire between the Houthis and a Saudi-led coalition fighting on behalf of Yemen’s exiled government has been holding after years of fighting that has created one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises."
Israel finds second hostage body near Al-Shifa hospital,Israel raids Gaza’s al-Shifa Hospital for second day,0.565871264477538,2023-11-17,2023-11-16,"Israel has confirmed that it has found the body of a second woman who was taken into Gaza by Hamas in its attack last month.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said 19-year-old Cpl Noa Marciano was discovered in a building next to the Al-Shifa Hospital.On Thursday, the IDF said they found the body of a 65-year-old hostage in a house near the same hospital.Troops are continuing their search in and around Gaza's biggest hospital.A spokesman for the IDF, Daniel Hagari, wrote on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter, that Israeli intelligence led soldiers to the exact location of her body.The IDF did not give further details on how Cpl Marciano died.Hamas's military wing claimed she was killed in an Israeli air strike on 9 November, though this could not be independently verified.Cpl Marciano was serving as a lookout at the Nahal Oz kibbutz when it was stormed by part of a wave of gunmen who had burst through the nearby Israel-Gaza border, attacking dozens of Israeli communities, several military bases and hundreds of young people attending a music festival.According to Haaretz, Cpl Marciano's mother, Adi Marciano, said in an interview that she last spoke to her daughter on the morning of the attack.""She told me she was in a protected space and that there had been an infiltration... She said that she had to end the call. I didn't hear shots or screams. Half an hour later, I sent her a message, but she didn't reply.""She had appeared in a video released by Hamas on Monday. The IDF called it ""psychological terrorism"".So far, only four of the 240 hostages who were abducted by Hamas last month have been freed.Israeli officials say that at least 1,200 people were killed in Hamas's cross-border attack.Since Israel started its counter-attack, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry has said 11,400 people have been killed in the territory.Al-Shifa, Gaza City's largest hospital, became the focus of fighting at the start of the week and was raided by the Israeli military on Wednesday morning.The IDF says Hamas has been using the hospital as a command centre and has spent two days searching the complex for evidence of this. Hamas denies operating there and the BBC cannot independently verify claims by either side.","Israeli forces have raided Gaza’s al-Shifa Hospital for a second day, entering the medical complex from the southern part. “The situation at al-Shifa Hospital is indeed very dire,” said Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from Khan Younis in southern Gaza on Thursday morning. The facility houses thousands of patients, medical staff and displaced Palestinians who witnesses said are not being allowed to leave. “Israeli bulldozers and tanks have reportedly advanced inside the hospital complex, damaging the wall of the facility. Doctors and other medical workers were also being reportedly interrogated,” Abu Azzoum said. Israeli tanks and troops first entered the al-Shifa compound onWednesdaymorning in what they called a “targeted” operation, after encircling and bombarding the facility for days. Israel claims al-Shifa is being used as a command centre of Hamas, the group that rules Gaza, but has not produced evidence to support these assertions. Hamas rejects the accusations and has invited the United Nations to send investigators to verify the truth. “It is a civilian hospital. There is no member of Hamas in al-Shifa Hospital,” Mohammed Zaqout, the director-general of hospitals in the Gaza Strip, told Al Jazeera. “There is no military activity in al-Shifa. All that happened is around the hospital but inside the hospital, all of the people are civilians.”  Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Khan Younis, said more than 24 hours after Israeli troops first raided the compound, they have “failed to produce any evidence” that links the hospital to Hamas. “Unfortunately, this failure in confirming just resulted in causing massive destruction in the hospital and renewed attacks on its building and redeploying troops at the gates of the hospital from all sides,” he added. The specialised surgeries building was damaged from the inside, Israeli soldiers blew up a warehouse for medicine and medical equipment inside the hospital, and witnesses reported “about 200 people being blindfolded and interrogated and taken to unknown areas”, Mahmoud reported. “All of this is happening under heavy cover of air strikes and tank shells around al-Shifa hospital and Gaza centre.” Mustafa Barghouti, the general secretary of the Palestinian National Initiative, described the Israeli invasion of al-Shifa as “the mother of all scandals” and questioned why the Israeli army has said it needs to occupy the hospitals “for days” to find evidence. “In the process, they’ve endangered the lives of hospital patients [and] hospital staff,” Barghouti told Al Jazeera from Ramallah.    The United States has continued to push the Israeli narrative that al-Shifa is used as a “military headquarters” by Hamas, but itdeniedgiving Israel a green light for a raid. President Joe Biden also asked Israel to be “incredibly careful” in its operation in al-Shifa. Meanwhile, the UN Security Council passed a resolution calling for“humanitarian pauses”in Gaza on Wednesday evening, but Israel rejected it. Gilad Erdan, Israel’s ambassador to the UN, said the resolution would have “no meaning”, calling it “disconnected from reality”. On Thursday, Israel’s army said it carried out an air strike on the house of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Gaza, as it “often served as a meeting point for Hamas’s senior leaders to direct terror attacks against Israeli civilians” and Israeli soldiers. Deaths were reported across the Strip overnight as Israeli forces struck other locations in north and central Gaza, including two residential buildings in Nuseirat refugee camp. The UN has said there is only one hospital left in northern Gaza with the capacity to accept patients. Israel’s attacks on Gaza are continuing for the 41st consecutive day, after Hamas fighters entered Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people. Since then, Israel has killed more than 11,300 Palestinians in Gaza.   "
Gaza strikes: Hamas-run health ministry says 700 killed in 24 hours,Gaza hospital generators to run out of fuel in 48 hours: Health Ministry,0.565269379557303,2023-10-24,2023-10-24,"More than 700 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli air strikes in the Gaza Strip over the past 24 hours, the Hamas-run health ministry says.Israel's military said it struck 400 ""terror targets"" and killed several Hamas commanders over the same period.It also declared that it would not reduce its attacks despite Hamas's release of another two hostages.UN aid agencies meanwhile pleaded for sustained and safe humanitarian access, warning they were ""on their knees"".A third of hospitals in Gaza are no longer functioning due to shortages of electricity, medicine and staff, and the shortage of clean water is now critical.Israel launched its bombing campaign against Hamas - which Israel, the UK, US and other powers class as a terrorist organisation - in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October in which at least 1,400 people were killed and 222 others were taken hostage.Nearly 5,800 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the health ministry. Intense Israeli air strikes overnight hit hundreds of locations across Gaza.Some of those killed in the southern cities of Khan Younis and Rafah were displaced people who had fled the north in response to an Israeli military order to evacuate the area for their own safety, local officials said.They included 13 members of one family from Gaza City, who had been staying in a residential building in Qarara, on the north-eastern outskirts of Khan Younis, where the population has swelled from 400,000 to 1.2 million.A relative who survived said: ""We were sleeping and suddenly a big explosion happened. All of my family are dead."" The BBC's Rushdi Abu Alouf says there was grief, shock and anger at the city's hospital on Tuesday morning, as bodies were brought out of the mortuary and taken away for burial. Mourners said there was ""no safe place"" in Gaza.Later, about 20 people were reportedly killed in a strike on a residential building in the heavily-populated Amal area of Khan Younis.The Hamas-run health ministry said it had been the deadliest 24 hours of the war so far, with 704 people reported killed, including 305 children, 173 women and 78 elderly people. That brought the overall death toll in Gaza to 5,791, it added.The Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, said on Tuesday morning that its jets struck ""dozens of terror infrastructure and Hamas staging grounds"" in several northern areas in and around Gaza City, as well as a ""Hamas operational tunnel shaft"" near the Mediterranean coastline.It added that aircraft also targeted Hamas command centres and staging grounds located in mosques, killing the deputy commanders of three battalions of Hamas's military wing, and also struck dozens of Hamas gunmen setting up to fire rockets towards Israel.""We want to bring Hamas to a state of full dismantling - its leaders, its military branch, and its working mechanisms,"" IDF Chief of Staff Lt Gen Herzi Halevi told commanders on Monday. ""The path is a path of unrelenting attacks, damaging Hamas everywhere and in every way.""He also said that Israeli troops massing near the Gaza perimeter fence were ""well prepared for the ground operations"" - a reference to the invasion expected soon. The general spoke before Hamas released two elderly Israeli women - Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, and Nurit Cooper, 79 - who were taken as hostages from the Nir Oz kibbutz close to Gaza on 7 October. Others living there were killed and the women's husbands remain among those being held.Meanwhile, the humanitarian situation in Gaza is growing more and more desperate, with shortages of food, water and shelter for the 1.4 million people who have fled their homes. The health ministry warned the territory's healthcare system could collapse and 12 of the 32 hospitals in Gaza were out of service. The others were running out of fuel and only running the most essential services. A spokeswoman the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, which runs the largest humanitarian operation in Gaza, warned that it had also almost exhausted its fuel stocks.""If we do not get fuel urgently, we will be forced to halt our operations in the Gaza Strip as of Wednesday night,"" Juliette Touma told the BBC.At a briefing in Geneva, UNRWA said just 54 lorries of aid had been allowed to cross through the Egyptian-controlled Rafah crossing since 21 October. Before that, Gaza had been receiving around 500 lorries a day. Access once the limited supplies are allowed in is also challenging. The UN has not received the necessary security guarantees to allow aid to be delivered across Gaza, including to the north, where thousands of people, some of them severely injured, remain despite Israel's evacuation order.The World Health Organization warned that while some medical supplies had been allowed in they were not enough to meet the needs. Medical personnel standing by in Egypt have also not been allowed to accompany the supplies. The WHO stressed that fuel, which has so far not been allowed in, was essential for desalination plants, bakeries and hospitals. The shortage of clean water is now critical, as people only have access to between 1 and 3 litres (34-101 fl oz) of water per day. The basic minimum is 15 litres per day, according to the WHO.The World Food Programme said it had reduced food rations in an effort to ensure it was reaching as many people as possible. Emad Abuaassi, who moved from Blackpool in England to northern Gaza with his wife and four children 10 months ago, told the BBC in a voice note that they were now living in a two-bedroom flat in Khan Younis with about 50 other people.""We're struggling for everything. We've just managed to have half a sandwich - me and my kids this morning,"" he said. ""The queue is half a mile for a bag of bread.""""I don't know what's going to happen in the next two or three days.""Israel has agreed to limited deliveries of aid other than fuel, saying that could be stolen and exploited by Hamas for military purposes. An IDF spokesman posted a satellite photo showing 12 fuel tanks near Rafah which he said contained hundreds of thousands of litres of diesel belonging to Hamas. He alleged that the group ""steals the diesel from the civilians and transfers it to tunnels, [rocket] launchers and senior officials"".Writing on X (formerly known as Twitter) the Israeli military told UNRWA: ""Ask Hamas if you can have some.""Additional reporting by Imogen Foulkes in Geneva","The Ministry of Health in the Gaza Strip has warned that the electric generators in hospitals will cease functioning within the next 48 hours due to a fuel shortage, amidintensified air raidsby Israel on the besieged enclave. Ministry spokesperson Ashraf al-Qudra said in a brief statement on Telegram early on Tuesday that the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza is “slow and cannot change the reality” on the ground. “The healthcare system has reached its worst stage in its history,” he added. On Monday, the ministry said 32 health centres were out of service after Israel cut off access to essential supplies, including fuel, as itcarries out a bombing campaignthat has destroyed entire neighbourhoods and brought humanitarian conditions to a breaking point. It added that the immediate needs of hospitals must be prioritised in terms of aid distribution, urging the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross to push for the delivery of supplies of fuel and blood units into the enclave. The Indonesian Hospital, in northern Gaza’s Beit Lahia area, was shut down as it could not carry out vital facilities after running out of power on Monday. Footage verified by Al Jazeera showed the facility under darkness. Videos showed medical teams at the hospital receiving patients carried by ambulance workers while using portable flashlights. It was later reported that power was restored, but it was unclear for how long it would last.    Meanwhile, a convoy of humanitarian aid trucks delivered water, food and medicine to the Gaza Strip on Monday, the third since limited aid began flowing in on Saturday. The UN says fuel was not included and reserves will run out within two days. Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Khan Younis in southern Gaza, said residents were hoping that more aid trucks would be allowed into the besieged enclave. He added that Palestinians living in the narrow strip of land were desperate for the bombardments to stop. Israel started its intenseair attackson Gaza after an assault by Hamas, the group running the enclave, inside southern Israel on October 7 that killed more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians. More than 5,000 Palestinians have beenkilledin Israel’s attacks, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which says about 40 percent of the victims arechildren. "

Sgt William Jerome Rivers, 46, Specialist Kennedy Ladon Sanders, 24, and Specialist Breonna Alexsondria Moffett, 23, were killed when a drone hit their housing unit.The US has blamed Iranian-backed groups and the Pentagon said it carried the ""footprints"" of Kataib Hezbollah.The Pentagon also reiterated the US does not want a war with Iran.""We don't seek war, but we will take action, and respond to attacks on our forces,"" said Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh. CBS News, the BBC's US partner, said it was told by a US official that the drone used in the attack appeared to be Iranian-made. The official indicated it was a ""type of Shahed drone,"" which is a one-way attack drone Iran has been providing to Russia.Iran has denied US and British accusations that it supported militant groups blamed for the strike.The Pentagon said the three soldiers killed on Sunday morning came from an army reserve unit based in Fort Moore, in the state of Georgia.Lt Gen Jody Daniels, Chief of Army Reserve and Commanding General US Army Reserve Command, paid tribute to the fallen soldiers. ""On behalf of the Army Reserve, I share in the sorrow felt by their friends, family, and loved ones. Their service and sacrifice will not be forgotten, and we are committed to supporting those left behind in the wake of this tragedy"", said Gen Daniels.The drone attack took place in Rukban, north-eastern Jordan, near the Syrian border. The base was later named by US officials as Tower 22. More than 40 military personnel were injured when the unmanned aerial system hit the container housing unit they were in on Sunday morning. Features of an air defence system were turned off at Tower 22 at the time of the attack, US officials told CBS News, because the enemy drone arrived at the same time as a returning US drone.They added that troops at the air base were still in their sleeping quarters when the drone struck - with little to no warning.Iran has denied playing a part in supporting groups suspected of being responsible for the strike.Nasser Kanaani, Iran's foreign ministry spokesman, said it was ""not involved in the decision making of resistance groups"" in how they chose to ""defend Palestinians or their own countries"".Iran's Intelligence Minister Esmail Khatib said that regional armed groups aligned with Iran respond to ""American aggressors"" at their own discretion.US President Joe Biden said the US ""will hold all those responsible to account at a time and in a manner of our choosing"".The US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said he and Mr Biden would take ""all necessary actions"" following the attack on American forces. Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said the attack was carried out by an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-backed militia and had the ""footprints"" of Iraq-based militant group Kataib Hezbollah. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq has claimed it was behind the attack.The umbrella group emerged in late 2023 and is comprised of several Iran-affiliated militias operating in Iraq. It has claimed other attacks against US forces in recent weeks.In a statement, the group said it had targeted three US bases in Syria - identifying them as Shaddadi, Tanf and Rukban. However, Rukban is on the Jordanian side of the border with Syria. The group also said it targeted an Israeli oil facility in the Mediterranean.It is the first time that a strike has killed US troops in the region since the start of the war in Gaza, triggered by Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel.There have been other attacks on US bases in the region, but before Sunday there were no fatalities, according to the US military.Officials said that US sites in Iraq and Syria had been attacked at least 165 times since 17 October. Last month, the US carried out airstrikes against Iran-affiliated groups after three US servicemembers were injured, one critically, in a drone attack on a base in northern Iraq.Earlier in January, one retaliatory US strike in Baghdad killed a militia leader accused of being behind attacks on US personnel. ","Three US service members have been killed and at least 34 others wounded in a drone attack in northeast Jordan near the Syrian border, the United States military has said. “While we are still gathering the facts of this attack, we know it was carried out by radical Iran-backed militant groups operating in Syria and Iraq,” President Joe Biden said in a statement on Sunday. He said the US “will hold all those responsible to account at a time and in a manner [of] our choosing”.  The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group of Iran-backed armed groups, claimed attacks targeting three bases, including one on the Jordan-Syria border. Jordan condemned on Sunday the “terrorist attack” on a military advance post just inside its border with Syria and said it was cooperating with Washington to secure its frontier. In the first official statement on the attack, US ally Jordan said it was working with Washington to “fight terrorism”. Earlier, Jordanian state television quoted Muhannad Mubaidin, a spokesperson for Jordan’s government, as saying the attack happened outside of the kingdom across the border in Syria. The deaths are the first for US troops in the Middle East since Israel’s war on Gaza began on October 7. The attack comes amid soaring tensions in the region, where Israel continues its war on Gaza in response to an attack by the Palestinian group Hamas in southern Israel that killed at least 1,139 people, according to Israeli authorities. Israel’s subsequent assault on Gaza has killed more than 26,400 people, according to Palestinian officials in the besieged territory. Fears have grown about the possibility of a regional conflagration amidattacks from Yemen’s Houthi rebelson Red Sea shipping and near-daily rounds ofcross-border fire between Israeland the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah. In recent weeks, Iran-backed armed groups haveintensified their attackson US military bases in Iraq and neighbouring Syria in response to the Israeli military campaign in the Gaza Strip. The Iran-backed groups have called their strikes as retaliation for Washington’s support for the Israeli war on Gaza and say they aim to push US forces out of the region. The US in recent months has struck targets in Iraq, Syria and Yemen to respond to attacks on American forces in the region and to deter Iranian-backed Houthi rebels from continuing to threaten commercial shipping in the Red Sea.    Reporting from Tehran, Al Jazeera’s Resul Serdar said there have been more than 100 attacks on US military installations in the Middle East since Israel launched its assault on Gaza. “Iran’s position so far … has been quite clear. They say that these attacks are not conducted and planned by Iran. They say that Iran has allies across the region. However, these allies also make decisions based on their own decisions,” he said. “Iranians do not want a regional escalation. The Iranian officials know a direct military confrontation with Israel also means a war with the US which could be a deadly one for Iran.” Colin Clarke, senior research fellow at the Soufan Group, told Al Jazeera that these attacks show that there was a “regional war”. “There is no denying that. US troops have been killed and the US will respond forcefully whether that is in Iran proper or against the Iranian proxies in the various countries where they operate,” he said. “Iran can choose to distance itself as much as it wants, but it funds, trains and equips these groups … The Biden administration will be under immense pressure to show the US is not going to sit back and watch its troops being killed by these Iranian-backed groups.” “The question now becomes what shape this response will take,” Clarke said."
Video shows stripped Palestinian men detained in Gaza,"Palestinians detained by Israel in Gaza blindfolded, stripped to underwear",0.5476710781117468,2023-12-08,2023-12-08,"With fighting raging around Khan Younis and in the north of Gaza, a video has emerged on social media showing dozens of Palestinian men detained by Israel.The footage, verified by the BBC, shows them stripped to their underwear, kneeling on the ground and being guarded by Israeli soldiers.The men are thought to have been arrested in Beit Lahia, in the far north of the Gaza strip.The BBC has been told some of the men have since been released.One of the men identified as having been detained is a well-known Palestinian journalist, leading his employers to accuse Israel of carrying out ""invasive searches and humiliating treatment"" of civilians. Asked about the video, a spokesman for the Israeli government told the BBC the men detained were all of military age and had been ""discovered in areas that civilians were supposed to have evacuated weeks ago"".In the video, dozens of men are lined up on a pavement and appear to have been told to remove their shoes, which are scattered across the road. Israeli soldiers and armoured vehicles are standing guard over them. Other images show them being transported in military trucks. In the Israeli media, the captives are being described as Hamas fighters who have surrendered.Another image -  which has not yet been verified by the BBC - shows men blindfolded, kneeling in what appears to be a large pit of bulldozed sand.The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) has not directly commented on the images, but spokesman Daniel Hagari said on Thursday that ""IDF fighters and Shin Bet officers detained and interrogated hundreds of terror suspects"". ""Many of them also turned themselves in to our forces during the past 24 hours. The intelligence coming out of their interrogations is utilised to continue the fighting.""On Friday, Israeli government spokesman Eylon Levy told the BBC the men had been detained in Jabalia and Shejaiya in northern Gaza, which he described as ""Hamas strongholds and centres of gravity"".""We're talking about military age men who were discovered in areas that civilians were supposed to have evacuated weeks ago,"" he said.Mr Levy added that they would be questioned to ""work out who indeed was a Hamas terrorist and who is not"". He emphasised the detained men had been found in areas where Israeli forces had engaged in ""close-quarter combat"" with Hamas. They had been ""deliberately disguising themselves as civilians"" and operating from civilian buildings.  The BBC has spoken to a man who says 10 of his cousins were part of the group detained by the Israeli army on Thursday in Beit Lahia. The man - who wishes to remain anonymous over safety concerns - told BBC Arabic's Ethar Shalaby that IDF soldiers entered the area and used megaphones to order the men from their homes and UN relief agency (UNRWA) schools. The IDF ordered women in the area to go to a nearby hospital and later threated to shoot them if the men did not come out of their homes, he said. The man said seven of his cousins have since been released and have returned home, but added he does not know about the fate of the three who remain in Israeli detention.In a post on social media, the Palestinian ambassador to the UK described the footage as ""savage images of Israeli occupation forces detaining and stripping civilians taken from a UN shelter"".""This evokes some of humanity's darkest passages of history,"" Husam Zomlot said.Palestinian journalist, Diaa al-Kahlout, a correspondent for al-Araby al-Jadeed, has been identified among those who were in the video of the detainees.The Arabic language news outlet, which also publishes in English under the name the New Arab, said Mr al-Kahlout had been arrested along with his brothers, relatives and ""other civilians"" by Israeli forces in Beit Lahia.Al-Araby al-Jadeed has condemned what it describes as the ""humiliating"" detention of Mr al-Kahlout on Thursday.It added that soldiers forced the men to remove their clothes and ""subjected them to invasive searches and humiliating treatment upon their arrest, prior to transporting them to undisclosed locations"".The outlet ""urges the international community, journalists' rights defenders and watchdogs, and human rights bodies to denounce this ongoing assault"" by Israel on journalists in the territory.A colleague of Mr al-Kahlout, Palestinian journalist Lamis Andoni, told Radio 4's PM programme on Friday that a number of prisoner had been released - but not Mr al-Kahlout.Ms Andoni said those freed told Mr Kahlout's family that he had been transferred to Zikim military base in Israel. The BBC has not verified this claim.""We have no idea about his fate. The photos and videos of these men is horrifying. I'm shocked,"" she said, adding that her media outlet was liaising with Israeli forces via the UN.Additional reporting by Paul Brown, Peter Mwai and Alex Murray","At least 100 Palestinian men detained by Israeli forces have been stripped to their underwear, blindfolded and made to kneel on a street in northern Gaza, according to images and videos widely circulated on social media and confirmed by the Israeli army. The men were shown with their heads bowed as they were guarded by Israeli troops in the undated video that first surfaced on Thursday, which has drawn condemnation. Al Jazeera’s Alan Fisher, reporting from occupied East Jerusalem, said on Friday that the images echoed the history of the region, where stripped men are taken to unknown locations. Many of the detainees were recognised by members of the community and family. “Some say one was a student, one ran the local store and another one had no connection with ‘terrorism’ as he lived in an apartment block. … A number of people identified a well-known local journalist among those who were arrested,” according to Fisher, who added that one man was with his two children and all three of them were rounded up. Shawan Jabarin, director of the Al-Haq human rights organisation, said he was “shocked” to see images that reminded him of the treatment of detainees and prisoners of war during World War II. “This [is] inhuman, it amounts to torture and more than that, it’s a war crime and a crime against humanity,” he told Al Jazeera. Israeli media reported that some of the images appeared to show suspected Hamas fighters who had surrendered to Israeli forces. Al Jazeera’s Imran Khan, reporting from Tel Aviv, said later on Friday that some of the Palestinians detained in the incident were released. According to family members, one of the released detainees was a shopkeeper with no ties to Hamas, he said. About the Israeli response on the images, Khan said that the army statement was unapologetic. “This is simply a tactic that they are going to use. They don’t care about the criticism from the international community or the human rights groups,” he added.    Daniel Hagari, the Israeli army spokesperson, said earlier: “During this fighting, those who stay in the area, come out of tunnels and some out of houses, we investigate and check who is linked to Hamas and who is not, we detain and interrogate all of them.” He did not speak directly about the images but said that hundreds of suspects have been interrogated so far and that many have surrendered in the past 24 hours. The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor said the men were “arbitrarily arrested” in the northern Gaza Strip after Israeli forces surrounded two shelters in the town of Beit Lahiya for days. They were taken from the Khalifa bin Zayed and New Aleppo schools, both of which are affiliated with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), the rights group said in a statement. Ahmed Bedier, president of the United Voices for America civic engagement group, called the images “horrific”. “This is a way to humiliate, this is a psychological warfare, designed to break the Palestinian people and tell them no place is safe, including shelters,” he told Al Jazeera. The Al-Araby Al-Jadeed news outlet, also known as The New Arab, said its correspondent Diaa al-Kahlout was among those detained and had been taken to an unknown location. He, his brothers and other relatives were among dozens of men arrested, The New Arab said in a statement on its website, adding that the detainees were forced to strip and were searched before being taken to an unknown destination. The outlet called on “the international community, journalists’ rights defenders and watchdogs, and human rights bodies to denounce this ongoing assault committed by the Israeli occupation army against journalists since [October 7] and exert efforts to ensure they are released from detention and protected”. On Friday, the Palestinian armed group Hamas condemned the stripping of the men and called on international human rights groups to investigate the incident. “Stripping them of their clothes in a humiliating manner is a blatant Zionist crime to take revenge on our defenceless civilians as a result of the blows suffered by its soldiers and officers at the hands of Palestinian resistance men,” Izzat al-Risheq, a Hamas official, said in a statement. “We hold the occupation responsible for their lives and safety, and we call on all human rights and humanitarian institutions and organizations to intervene,” the statement read. Fisher said: “Of course, it would be a violation of international law for prisoners of war to be treated this way and for pictures to be taken of them and then published.” He added that more concerning for international aid groups and human rights organisations was that “it is entirely unclear where these men have been taken or what may actually happen to them”. The images and videos were taken from the vantage point of Israeli troops, and one clip shows dozens of men sitting cross-legged in rows of three and four with their heads bowed in the middle of a wide street. One photo shows soldiers with assault rifles guarding dozens of men kneeling in a line alongside the wall of a building. Another photo shows detainees being lined up in an empty field. The last video appears to show detainees packed into the back of moving army trucks. Israel said it hasdetainedand interrogated hundreds of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the occupied West Bank since Hamas’s October 7 attacks in southern Israel. Following those attacks, Israel started a massiveair and ground offensiveon the enclave. More than 17,100 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since October 7, according to the authorities in the enclave. Israel said its death toll stands at about 1,150."
Dozens reported killed in Gaza refugee camp blast,Dozens killed in Israeli air attack on Jabalia refugee camp: Gaza official,0.5466659054888086,2023-10-31,2023-10-31,,"Dozens of people have been killed in an Israeli air raid on the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, according to a medical official and Palestinian authorities in the besieged territory. “More than 50 people have been killed,” Dr Atef al-Kahlout, director of the Indonesian Hospital, told Al Jazeera. He said the hospital was not yet able to provide the total number of casualties as it was still counting the victims. The health ministry in Gaza said more than 50 people were killed and scores of others wounded in the Israeli bombardment. “More than 50 martyrs and around 150 wounded and dozens under the rubble, in a heinous Israeli massacre that targeted a large area of homes in Jabalia camp in the northern [Gaza] Strip,” a health ministry statement said. An Isaeli military official confirmed an attack on the Jabalia refugee camp. “There was a very senior Hamas commander in that area,” Israeli army spokesperson Richard Hecht told CNN. “We’re looking into it and we’ll be coming out with more data as we learn what happened there.” In footage of the scene after the strike on Jabalia, residents can be seen standing around large craters in the earth and piles of rubble as rescuers scramble to locate survivors under collapsed buildings. “I went and saw the destruction… homes buried under the rubble and body parts and martyrs and wounded in huge numbers,” 41-year-old Jabalia resident Ragheb Aqal told the news outlet AFP.    The attack comes as Israel continues to pummel the Gaza Strip in arelentless bombardment, which Palestinian authorities say has killed 8,525 people, including more than 3,500 children, since fighting began on October 7. Israel launched the assault after Hamas, the armed group that governs Gaza, carried out a devastating attack on southern Israel, killing at least 1,400 people, most of them civilians, according to Israeli authorities. Israel has also imposed a “complete siege” on Gaza, severely restricting access to water, electricity, food, and fuel for the strip’s more than 2.3 million residents.United Nationsofficials have said that more than half of Gaza’s population has been displaced by the fighting. Israel has expanded itsground operationsin Gaza in recent days, with tanks and infantry engaged in battles with Palestinian fighters around Gaza City in the northern section of the strip.   "
South Africa's genocide case against Israel: Both sides play heavy on emotion in ICJ hearing,ICJ hears South Africa’s genocide case against Israel over Gaza war,0.540618964525497,2024-01-12,2024-01-11,"The UN's top legal body has now heard two days of powerful legal argument on the ""crime of all crimes"": genocide.It is now for the judges at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to decide whether Israel, in its war in Gaza, is guilty of an attempt to ""destroy a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, in whole or in part,"" as defined by the 1948 Convention on Genocide.There could hardly be a more weighty matter.Both sides have played heavily on the strong emotions swirling around the conflict that erupted on 7 October last year.Around 1,200 people - most of them civilians - were killed and about 240 others were taken hostage during the Hamas attack on southern Israel.More than 23,350 people have been killed - mostly children and women - during Israeli retaliatory attacks on Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.The case, brought to the ICJ by South Africa, included a litany of alleged Israeli offences, from the indiscriminate killing of Palestinian civilians to the wholesale destruction of Gaza's infrastructure.""This killing is nothing short of destruction of Palestinian life,"" said one of South Africa's lawyers, Adila Hassin.Israel's war in Gaza could not be allowed to continue, the South African team argued.""Entire multi-generational families will be obliterated,"" Irish barrister Blinne NÃ­ GhrÃ¡laigh warned, ""and yet more Palestinian children will become WCNSF - Wounded Child No Surviving Family - the terrible new acronym borne out of Israel's genocidal assault.""But on Friday morning Israel hit back, with a mixture of its own emotion and a forensic assault on the South African case.Images of 132 missing Israelis - most of them still being held hostage in Gaza - were shown to the court.""Is there a reason these people on your screen are unworthy of protection,"" Tal Becker, a hugely experienced legal adviser at Israel's Foreign Ministry, asked the court.Mr Becker and his colleagues were scathing about South Africa's submission, arguing that if anyone was guilty of genocide, it was Hamas.""Under the guise of the allegation against Israel of genocide,"" Mr Becker said, ""this court is asked to call for an end to operations against the ongoing attacks of an organisation that pursues an actual genocidal agenda"".South Africa, the Israelis said, is guilty of supporting Hamas, a group designated as a terrorist organisation by 41 countries, including the US, EU and UK.During his speech, Professor Malcolm Shaw briefly seemed to imply that the very country bringing this case against Israel was itself complicit.""South Africa has given succour and support to Hamas, at least,"" he said.It will probably take the ICJ several years to reach its verdict on the charge of genocide.The South Africans must know there's a legal mountain to climb to prove their case.Genocide is notoriously difficult to prove. There needs to be compelling evidence of intent by those actually in charge of Israel's military campaign in Gaza, as well as a pattern of behaviour by the Israel Defense Forces that cannot reasonably be explained as anything other than genocidal.Remember: this is only about genocide, not whether war crimes have been committed in Gaza, or even whether Israel is engaged in ethnic cleansing, as some allege.It's one thing to be horrified, even enraged, by countless images of the suffering inflicted on the Palestinians.It's quite another to conclude that the killing of 1% of the Gazan population, sobering though that number is, represents an Israeli effort to destroy the Palestinian people, ""in whole or in part"".But for Israel, which may feel it's on safe ground when it comes to the ""crime of all crimes"", there's a more immediate concern.South Africa has appealed to the ICJ to issue nine ""provisional measures"", designed, in the words of South Africa's 84-page submission, ""to protect against further, severe and irreparable harm to the rights of the Palestinian people"".The first of these calls on Israel to ""immediately suspend its military operation in and against Gaza"".If obeyed, it would have the effect of bringing Israel's military campaign to a halt.This could happen within weeks, long before Israel feels it has achieved its military objective of utterly destroying Hamas as a political and military force in Gaza.For this reason, its lawyers attempted to demolish South Africa's case for ""provisional measures"", arguing that they had no legal basis and would tie Israel's hands but leave Hamas free to act.Israel doesn't like the ICJ, and feels that the UN as a whole is inherently biased against the Jewish state.But at a time when international pressure is mounting on Israel to put an end to the huge level of violence in Gaza, it knows that if the court agrees to issue provisional measures, that pressure will only increase.It's prepared to ignore the court if it feels it has to (and the ICJ has no powers of enforcement), but it would much prefer to win the legal argument.Correction 13th February: This article wrongly reported that about 1,300 people had been killed following the 7th October attack by Hamas. This was based on counting those who later died from their injuries in addition to the figure of more than 1,200. The article has been amended to now refer to about 1,200 deaths, a figure which includes those deaths and which Israel says is not final.","Israel faces accusations that it is subjecting Palestinians in Gaza to genocidal acts, as the International Court of Justice (ICJ) commenced ahearingon South Africa’s genocide case against it on Thursday. Amid Israel’s ongoing three-month war in Gaza, more than 23,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed, lawyers told the top United Nations court. Most of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million has been displaced, and an Israeli blockade severely limiting food, fuel and medicine has caused a humanitarian “catastrophe”, according to the UN. South Africa’s case in The Hague argues thatIsrael violatedthe 1948 genocide convention, established in the aftermath of the Holocaust, which mandates that all countries prevent the recurrence of such crimes. It filed an 84-page document with the court detailing acts it says amount to genocide in Gaza. Adila Hassim, a lawyer representing South Africa, told the ICJ that Israel had breached Article II of the Genocide Convention, which included the “mass killing” of Palestinians in Gaza. “Israel deployed 6,000 bombs per week … No one is spared. Not even newborns. UN chiefs have described it as a graveyard for children,” she said. “Nothing will stop the suffering, except an order from this court,” she added. South Africa has demanded that the ICJ order Israel to suspend its military campaign. Also called the World Court, the ICJ is the highest UN legal body that can adjudicate issues between member states. Alanna O’Malley, a professor of UN and international history, told Al Jazeera that South Africa’s case was a “historic” one. “We see from the invocation of the various articles of the Genocide Convention by the South African legal team the ways in which they are going to structurally present this case,” she said outside the court in The Hague, calling it “extremely compelling”. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said his nation was pursuing the case of what it called “the ongoing slaughter of the people of Gaza”. Israel will respond to the allegations made by South Africa on Friday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that hypocrisy and lies had been presented to the UN’s top court, adding that South Africa’s accusation against Israel of genocide in Gaza could only happen in a world turned upside-down. “We are fighting terrorists, we are fighting lies,” Netanyahu said. “Today we saw an upside-down world. Israel is accused of genocide while it is fighting against genocide.” “Israel is fighting murderous terrorists who carried out crimes against humanity: They slaughtered, they raped, they burned, they dismembered, they beheaded – children, women, elderly, young men and women,” he said. “The hypocrisy of South Africa screams to the heavens.” Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, another lawyer for South Africa, tackled the issue of Israel’s “genocidal intent” against the Palestinians in Gaza, usually the most difficult thing to prove in a case of this kind. “Israel’s political leaders, military commanders and persons holding official positions have systematically and in explicit terms declared their genocidal intent,” he said. “These statements are then repeated by soldiers on the ground in Gaza as they engage in the destruction of Palestinians and the physical infrastructure of Gaza.” Ngcukaitobi brought to the court’s attention Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s comments on October 28, 2023, urging ground troops preparing to enter Gaza to “remember what Amalek has done to you“.    “This refers to the Biblical command by God to Saul for the retaliatory destruction of an entire group of people,” the lawyer said. “The evidence of genocidal intent is not only chilling, it is also overwhelming and incontrovertible,” he added. Israel has rejected the accusations of genocide as baseless, with President Isaac Herzog calling the case “preposterous” and saying it constitutes a “blood libel”. On Thursday, Israel’s foreign ministry spokesman, Lior Haiat, called the case “hypocrisy” and accused South Africa of being the “legal arm” of Hamas. Gaza resident Aya Daloul said she hoped for a favourable decision and for the ICJ to help “stop the Israeli genocide against the Palestinians”. “The war must come to an end. We need to go back home and live in freedom and peace,” she told Al Jazeera. Outside the ICJ, a large number of demonstratorsgatheredto express solidarity with Palestinians and call for an end to Israel’s war, with people holding Palestinian flags and chanting occasionally: “Stop, stop genocide”, “We are all Palestinians” and “Boycott Israel”. “I’m here because we just can’t assist this genocide every day on social media and not do anything,” said Kim Wouters, a demonstrator who travelled from Brussels. Meanwhile, South Africans are feeling “a lot of pride” over the legal action taken by their country, said Al Jazeera’s Fahmida Miller, reporting from Pretoria. “What is happening in Gaza resonates very deeply with many South Africans because of their own history of apartheid, subjugation, oppression, institutionalised racism and the challenges South Africans have had to overcome,” she said. White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Thursday that the United States sees no basis for South Africa’s allegation of genocide against Israel over civilian deaths in Gaza.

"Tanker hit off India coast by drone from Iran, says US",Iran dismisses US accusations of tanker attack off India,0.5377297416099509,2023-12-24,2023-12-25,"A chemical tanker in the Indian Ocean was hit by a drone launched from Iran on Saturday, the US military says.A fire on board the Chem Pluto was extinguished. There were no casualties.Iran has not commented. Houthi rebels in Yemen - who are backed by Iran and support Hamas in its war with Israel - have recently used drones and rockets to target vessels in the Red Sea.But this event is the first of its kind so far away from there, according to maritime security firm Ambrey. The same company also said the vessel was heading from Saudi Arabia to India, and was linked to Israel. The Houthis have claimed to be targeting Israel-linked vessels over the conflict in Gaza.The US said the Chem Pluto was hit by ""a one-way attack drone fired from Iran"". It is believed to be the first time the US has publicly accused Iran of targeting a ship directly. It has previously accused Iran of being ""deeply involved"" in planning operations against commercial vessels in the Red Sea - a charge Tehran has denied. However, Iran's Revolutionary Guards have warned they could force the closure of waterways other than the Red Sea if ""America and its allies continue committing crimes"" in Gaza.The Pentagon statement said the Chem Pluto, ""a Liberia-flagged, Japanese-owned, and Netherlands-operated chemical tanker"", was struck on Saturday at 10:00 local time (06:00 GMT). The hit caused structural damage.The incident took place 200 nautical miles (370km) south-west of the city of Veraval in India's Gujarat state, according to United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO).Ambrey said the event fell within an area considered a ""heightened threat area"" for Iranian drones.The Indian navy sent an aircraft and warships to offer assistance. The BBC was not able to independently verify the incident.In a separate development, the US Central Command (Centcom) said that on Saturday ""two Houthi anti-ship ballistic missiles were fired into international shipping lanes in the Southern Red Sea from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen. No ships reported being impacted"".It also said the USS Laboon warship patrolling the area ""shot down four unmanned aerial drones originating from Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen that were inbound"" to the American vessel.Later that day, a crude oil tanker reported being hit by a Houthi drone in the southern Red Sea, while another tanker saw a near miss.Many global shipping groups have suspended operations in the Red Sea due to the increased risk of attacks. The UK government has vowed to ensure the route's safety. Defence Secretary Grant Shapps told the Sunday Times newspaper that the UK was committed to repelling attacks on vessels - and would not allow the Red Sea to become a ""no-go area"".Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary David Cameron described Iran as a ""thoroughly malign influence in the region and in the world"".He said the Iranian leadership and its proxies needed to be sent an ""incredibly clear message that this escalation will not be tolerated"".Chris Farrell from Neptune P2P Group, a UK maritime security company, described nervousness in the region and observed that container ships were proving more likely to reroute than larger vessels.""Nobody really knows the situation out there,"" he told the BBC World Service's Weekend programme. ""Because of the lack of stability, that's creating the uncertainty with the clients and the shipping companies which are putting their assets within that region.""","Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has dismissed accusations of the United States that Tehran struck a chemical tanker in the Indian Ocean, as tension rises globally over threats to maritime shipping. A spokesperson for the ministry dismissed the accusation out of hand at a news conference on Monday. He asserted that the US claim that an Iran-launched drone had hit a Japanese-owned tanker as it sailed near India was false. Global trade has been hit hard as Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have launched a flurry of attacks on ships in the Red Sea. The Houthis say the campaign, targeting what they say are Israeli-linked vessels, is intended to force Israel to halt its bombardment of Gaza. “We declare these claims as completely rejected and worthless,” said Nasser Kanaani when asked about the US accusation. “Such claims are aimed at projecting, distracting public attention, and covering up for the full support of the American government for the crimes of the Zionist regime [Israel] in Gaza,” he added. The attack on Saturday hit the MV Chem Pluto, a Japanese-owned tanker travelling 200 nautical miles (370km) off the coast of India, according to the US Pentagon. The tanker was “Israel-affiliated” and had been on its way from Saudi Arabia to India, reported maritime security firm Ambrey. Amid the recent spate of maritime assaults, it is the first that the US has sought to directly pin on Iran. It is also the first on a vessel outside the Red Sea.    The US, which is leading a global task force to counter the Houthi threat, has repeatedlyaccusedIran of being “deeply involved”. However, Iran insists that it is not coordinating with the Houthis and plays no role in the attacks. “The resistance [Houthis] has its own tools … and acts in accordance with its own decisions and capabilities,” Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Ali Bagheritoldthe Mehr news agency on Saturday. “The fact that certain powers, such as the Americans and the Israelis, suffer strikes from the resistance movement … should in no way call into question the reality of the strength of the resistance in the region,” he added. Amid the tension, Iran’s navy has taken delivery of long-range cruise missiles as well as reconnaissance helicopters, according to the country’s state media."
Israeli minister outlines plans for Gaza after war,Israeli defence minister outlines new phase in Gaza war,0.5374711435939898,2024-01-05,2024-01-04,"Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has outlined proposals for the future governance of Gaza once the war between Israel and Hamas is over. There would, he said, be limited Palestinian rule in the territory.Hamas would no longer control Gaza and Israel would retain overall security control, he added.Fighting in Gaza continued alongside the plan's publication, with dozens of people killed in the previous 24 hours, the Hamas-run health ministry said.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is due back in the region this week. He is expected to hold talks with Palestinian officials in the occupied West Bank and Israeli leaders.His visit comes amid heightened tensions in the region following the assassination of top Hamas leader Saleh al-Arouri on Tuesday in Lebanon's capital Beirut. His killing has widely been blamed on Israel. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied involvement.Under Mr Gallant's now ""four corner"" plan, Israel would retain overall security control of Gaza.A multi-national force would take charge of rebuilding the territory after the widespread destruction caused by Israeli bombing. Neighbouring Egypt would also have an unspecified role to play under the plan. But the document adds that Palestinians would be responsible for running the territory. ""Gaza residents are Palestinian, therefore Palestinian bodies will be in charge, with the condition that there will be no hostile actions or threats against the State of Israel,"" Mr Gallant said.The plan was not discussed in any detail in the cabinet meeting and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not publicly commented on it. The meeting is reported to have broken up amid acrimony with some ministers angrily objecting to names put forward for an investigation into the events surrounding the 7 October attack by Hamas.Talk of the ""day after"" in Gaza has led to deep disagreement in Israel. Some far right-wing members of Mr Netanyahu's government have said that Palestinian citizens should be encouraged to leave Gaza for exile, with the reestablishment of Jewish settlements in the territory - controversial proposals that have been rejected as ""extremist"" and ""unworkable"" by other countries in the region and by some of Israel's allies.While Mr Gallant's proposals may be regarded as more practical than those suggested by some of his cabinet colleagues, they are likely to be rejected by Palestinian leaders who say that Gazans themselves must be allowed to take full control of running the territory once this devastating war is over.Mr Netanyahu has not publicly talked in any detail about how he thinks Gaza should be governed.He has suggested that the war in Gaza may yet last several months, with the avowed goal being to completely crush Hamas.Mr Gallant's plan also outlined how the Israeli military aims to proceed in the next phase of the war in Gaza.He said the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) would take a more targeted approach in the north of the Gaza Strip, where operations will include raids, demolishing tunnels and air and ground strikes.In the south, the Israeli military would continue to try to track down Hamas leaders and rescue Israeli hostages, he said.On Thursday, the IDF said it had hit areas in Gaza's north and south, including Gaza City and Khan Younis.It said it had conducted strikes on ""terrorist infrastructure"" and had killed people who it described as militants, who it said had tried to detonate an explosive next to soldiers.It also announced that it had killed a senior Palestinian Islamic Jihad operative, Mamdouh Lolo, in an air strike. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said 125 people had been killed in the past 24 hours across the Strip.A health ministry official said 14 people - including nine children - were killed by Israeli air strikes in al-Mawasi, to the west of Khan Younis.The small town has been designated a ""safe space"" by Israeli forces for displaced Palestinians. The IDF has not commented on the claims made by Hamas.""We were sleeping at midnight when a strike hit the camp on the tents, 4x2 tents where people were sleeping, most of them children,"" eyewitness Jamal Hamad Salah told Reuters news agency. ""We found one body there that flew 40 metres away.""A resident in central Gaza meanwhile has told the BBC News Channel that ""nowhere is safe"".""Children are crying out in the streets, mothers are crying for their children, we cannot find food, we cannot find water, the situation is getting worse and worse every day,"" the resident said. ""People cannot bear another second of this war... if this continues we'll just simply die slowly.""The total number of people killed in Gaza since the start of Israel's retaliatory campaign had reached more than 22,400 by Thursday - comprising almost 1% of the enclave's 2.3 million population, the Hamas-run health ministry said.Israel's offensive started after Hamas gunmen launched a surprise attack on southern Israel on 7 October, killing 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and taking about 240 people hostage.","Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has outlined Israel’s plans for the next phase of its assault on the besieged Gaza Strip and future scenarios for the day after the war ends. “In the northern region of the Gaza strip, we will transition to a new combat approach in accordance with military achievements on the ground,” Gallant’s office said in a statement it said outlined the guiding principles reflecting Gallant’s vision for the next phases of the war on Thursday. He said operations would include raids, demolishing tunnels, air and ground strikes, and special forces operations. In the south of the besieged enclave – where most of Gaza’s 2.3 million population is now living, many in tents and other temporary shelters – the operation would continue to try to eliminate Hamas leaders and rescue Israeli hostages. “It will continue for as long as is deemed necessary,” the statement said. Israel launched its offensive in Gaza following the October 7 attack by Hamas gunmen who killed some 1,140 people in communities near Gaza and took around 240 into captivity as hostages, according to Israeli estimates. Israel’s war on Gaza has killed more than 22,400 people, according to Palestinian health authorities, and has forced most of the population out of their homes and reduced much of Gaza to rubble. Gallant also outlined Israel’s plans for Gaza after the war. He said Hamas would no longer control Gaza and Israel would reserve its operational freedom of action. But he said there would be no Israeli civilian presence and Palestinian bodies would be in charge of the enclave. “Gaza residents are Palestinian, therefore Palestinian bodies will be in charge, with the condition that there will be no hostile actions or threats against the State of Israel,” Gallant’s office said in a statement on Thursday. Al Jazeera’s Sara Khairat, reporting from Tel Aviv, said Gallant made it clear that Israeli officials want a “Palestinian entity” to be in charge of running civilian affairs in the Gaza Strip, but with “very specific conditions”. “Those conditions are that they won’t act hostile towards Israel, and they won’t act against it in any way, shape, or form,” Khairat said.    Israel has repeatedly said that there is “no place” for Hamas in the post-war civilian structures of Gaza. Several Israeli officials, including far-right finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, have also said Israel will permanently control the Gaza Strip and possibly resettle Israelis there. Gallant also said that Israel will have “complete freedom to military operations in Gaza”, Khairat said. “This is something we’ve been seeing in the occupied West Bank” she noted. As part of a so-called restructuring, Israel also intends to establish a “multi-national task force that comprises … Western and Arab nations”, Gallant told reporters. The force, Khairat said, will look to govern the border area. Israel wants to lead the force, and wants it to be in charge of the restructuring and redeveloping of the Gaza Strip, she said. “Egypt, Israel, and the US are working together to guarantee tight supervision of that border,” Khairat added. Gallant said this is one of many potential plans that officials will be discussing in upcoming meetings. Meanwhile, Hamas is gaining popularity across the occupied Palestinian territories. It governs Gaza and has the backing of several other Palestinian factions. The group has repeatedly said it will remain steadfast and voiced its refusal to leave the territory.    Hamas fighters continue to battle Israeli ground troops in central Gaza and parts of southern Gaza. Military operations in the south continued on Thursday, despite the area previously being declared by the Israeli army as “safe” after it forced thousands of Palestinian families to flee their homes in the north, east, and central Gaza. Many of the displaced are now crammed inside the Rafah governorate in southern Gaza. The health ministry has warned that disease there is spreading amid a lack of supplies, medicine, clean water and much-needed fuel. The United Nations says nearly 1.9 million people have now been displaced – more than 80 percent of the Gaza Strip’s pre-war population."
"Untreated diseases could kill more than bombings in Gaza, WHO warns","Disease could kill more in Gaza than bombs, WHO says amid Israeli siege",0.5359352253487623,2023-11-28,2023-11-28,"Untreated diseases could eventually kill more people in Gaza than bombings if the health system is not restored, the World Health Organization says.Diarrhoea and respiratory infections are widespread among children in overcrowded UN facilities where almost 1.1 million people are sheltering.Patients with chronic illnesses like cancer are also receiving no treatment.The warning comes as a truce between Israel and Hamas entered a fifth day, after a 48-hour extension was agreed.The deal mediated by Qatar, Egypt and the United States should see an additional 20 Israeli women and children held hostage in Gaza being released in exchange for 60 Palestinian women and teenagers in Israeli prisons.On Monday, 11 hostages and 33 prisoners were freed on the fourth and final day of the initial agreement, bringing the totals to 50 hostages and 150 prisoners released. Nineteen foreign nationals, one of whom has Israeli citizenship, have also been handed over by Hamas under separate agreements.Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza and imposed a siege in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and about 240 others taken hostage. Gaza's Hamas-run government says more than 14,800 people have been killed in the territory since the war began.The UN estimates that more than 1.8 million people in Gaza have fled their homes over the past seven weeks. About 60% of them are sheltering in 156 facilities belonging to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa.WHO spokeswoman Dr Margaret Harris told a news conference in Geneva that an assessment of those shelters had found outbreaks of infectious diseases, with cases of diarrhoea among children aged five and older more than 100 times normal levels by early November. No treatment is available for them, she said, without which infants in particular can deteriorate and die very quickly.According to the UN, only five hospitals are partially operational in the north of Gaza, the area that has been the focus of the Israeli ground offensive. Eight of the 11 hospitals are functional in the south, where the Israeli military has ordered civilians to flee. Only one of those hospitals has the capacity to treat critical trauma cases or perform complex surgery.""Eventually, we will see more people dying from disease than we are even seeing from the bombardment if we are not able to put back [together] this health system,"" Dr Harris warned.Addressing journalists via video link from Gaza, Unicef spokesman James Elder reported seeing hospitals full of children with horrendous war wounds.He described seeing one child missing part of his leg lying untreated on a hospital floor for several hours because of a lack of medical staff. Other injured children were lying in car parks and gardens outside, he said. Displaced children and their families are also suffering because of a lack of proper shelter and clothing to protect them from the rainy and cold weather currently in Gaza. Over the first four days of the truce, 800 aid lorries entered Gaza, with some reaching the north, according to US officials. That is an increase in comparison to the preceding few days, but it is still just a fraction of the usual number.The UN agencies say that in such conditions, a resumption in fighting should be unthinkable, they are calling again for a permanent ceasefire.Israel's prime minister has promised that its military will ""go to realising our goals with full force"" when the pause ends. However, Qatar's foreign ministry said on Tuesday that it would use the extension to seek a ""sustainable truce that would lead to further negotiations and eventually an end... to this war"".""We are working with what we have. And what we have right now is the provision to the agreement that allows us to extend days as long as Hamas is able to guarantee the release of at least 10 hostages,"" spokesman Majed al-Ansari told reporters in Doha.He added that mediators hoped to receive information from Hamas about the more than 150 Israelis and foreign nationals still being held hostage, who include children as young as 10 months old as well as a number of soldiers.A senior Hamas source in Qatar told the BBC that not all of the civilian hostages were in its hands. Some were with smaller armed groups like Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which like Hamas is classed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK and other Western powers.According to the source, Hamas needs more time to collect information and contact people. Communication is very difficult because of the damage to the telecoms network and the shortage of fuel to power it.Mr Ansari also said only ""minimal breaches"" of the truce had been reported. But two hours after he spoke the Israeli military said three explosive devices had been detonated near its troops in two different locations in northern Gaza in violation of the agreement. ""In one of the locations, terrorists also opened fire at the troops, who responded with fire. A number of soldiers were lightly injured during the incidents,"" it added.Hamas's military wing said there had been ""friction"" in the north and that its fighters had dealt with an ""clear breach"" of the truce deal by Israeli troops. Gunfire and explosions were earlier reported in north-western Gaza City.A local journalist told the BBC that dozens of displaced people were trying to return to their houses in the Sheikh Radwan area when they approached Israeli army positions, and that an Israeli tank and troops fired warning shots. One person was wounded and a building was hit by a shell, they said.","More people could die from disease than from bombings in the Gaza Strip if the health and sanitation systems are not repaired, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said. Critical infrastructure in the besieged territory has been crippled byfuelandsupply shortagesand targeted attacks on hospitals and United Nationsfacilitiessince Israel launched strikes on Gaza on October 7. “Eventually we will see more people dying from disease than from bombardment if we are not able to put back together this health system,” said Margaret Harris, a spokesperson for the WHO, speaking at a briefing in Geneva on Tuesday. She described the collapse ofal-Shifa Hospitalin northern Gaza as a “tragedy” and voiced concern about the detention of some of its medical staff by Israeli forces who took over the complex earlier this month. She also repeated concerns about a rise in outbreaks of infectious diseases in Gaza, particularly diarrhoeal diseases. Citing a United Nations report on the living conditions of displaced residents in northern Gaza, she said: “[There are] no medicines, no vaccination activities, no access to safe water and hygiene and no food.” All keysanitation serviceshave ceased operating in Gaza, which raises the prospect of an enormous surge of gastrointestinal and infectious diseases among the local populations –including cholera. For Gaza’s 2.3 million residents, half of whom are children, finding drinkable water has become close to impossible. The WHO has recorded more than 44,000 cases of diarrhoea and 70,000 acute respiratory infections, but real numbers may be significantly higher. The UN health agency said it was extremely concerned that rains and floods during the approaching winter season will make an already dire situation even worse. James Elder, a spokesperson from the UN children’s agency in Gaza, told reporters by video link that hospitals were full of children with war wounds and gastroenteritis from drinking dirty water. “They don’t have access to safe water and it’s crippling them,” he said. If nothing changes, “there will be more and more people falling sick and the risk of major outbreaks will increase dramatically”, Richard Brennan, the regional emergency director for the Eastern Mediterranean region at WHO,told Al Jazeeraearlier this month. Despite the temporarytruce agreementbetween Israel and Hamas, which was extended by two days just as it was set to expire on Tuesday morning, the Hamas-run Ministry of Health said no fuel had arrived for generators at hospitals in the territory’s north. UN official Tor Wennesland warned the humanitarian situation “remains catastrophic”. It “requires the urgent entry of additional aid and supplies in a smooth, predictable, and continuous manner to alleviate the unbearable suffering of Palestinians in Gaza,” the UN special coordinator for the Middle East peace process said. Gaza City Mayor Yahya al-Siraj said that without fuel, the territory could not pump clean water or clear waste accumulating in the streets, warning of a potential public health “catastrophe”. Clean-up was under way at al-Shifa, which is Gaza’s largest hospital. “We hope it can soon resume its activities,” said Gaza health ministry spokesman Mahmud Hammad. Israeli bombardment has killed more than 14,800 Palestinians, including 6,150 children and more than 4,000 women, according to health authorities in the enclave.   "
Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah makes first speech on Israel-Gaza war,‘All scenarios open’: Hezbollah chief in first speech since Israel-Gaza war,0.5356719373348104,2023-11-03,2023-11-03,"Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the Lebanese Shia Islamist group Hezbollah, is addressing his followers in his first public comments since the Israel-Hamas war broke out.The speech is likely to indicate the group's next moves, as its fighters and the Israeli army are engaged in intense attacks on the Lebanon-Israel border.This has raised fears the area could become another front in the conflict.So far, however, the violence has largely been contained.Since Hamas carried out the 7 October attacks on Israel, killing more than 1,400 people, Lebanon has been on edge, closely watching Hezbollah. The group has intensified its attacks on Israel, which is retaliating. But both sides have apparently taken steps to avoid a dangerous escalation, and most strikes have been limited to the border area.This, however, could change. Israel is pushing ahead with its ground invasion of Gaza, with the goal of eliminating Hamas, while the number of Palestinians killed in the territory has passed 9,000, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Hamas, meanwhile, has repeatedly urged its allies to join the fight, and many wonder whether Hezbollah will answer those calls.Hezbollah - which, like Hamas, is considered a terrorist organisation by the UK, the US and others - is the largest political and military force in Lebanon. This means the group's decisions reverberate far beyond its support base, and many here and elsewhere are anxiously waiting for Nasrallah's speech - followers and foes.Nasrallah's whereabouts, as ever, remain a mystery. His address will be broadcast in public screenings organised by the group across the country, and is being framed by Hezbollah as a significant moment. They took the unusual step of announcing it five days in advance and, earlier this week, released dramatic short videos featuring Nasrallah, fuelling the expectation of a major announcement.Many in Lebanon still remember the devastating month-long war Hezbollah fought against Israel in 2006, and worry that the group may drag the country into another conflict. One of Hezbollah's aims is the destruction of Israel, which sees the group as a more formidable enemy than Hamas. Hezbollah has a vast arsenal of weapons that includes precision-guided missiles that can strike deep into Israeli territory, and tens of thousands of well-trained, battle-hardened fighters.The Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has promised a response of ""unimaginable"" magnitude if Hezbollah opens a second front in the conflict. And the US, which reportedly urged Israel to not launch a large-scale attack on the group, has sent two aircraft carriers to the eastern Mediterranean to prevent the spread of the conflict.A full-scale war would be disastrous for Lebanon, and there is little public support for it outside Hezbollah's followers. The country is suffering from years of economic crisis, and political impasse has left it without a properly functioning government. Another scenario - perhaps the most likely, some observers say - is an increase of the group's attacks, signalling a response to Hamas's calls, while keeping the fighting limited to northern Israel.The Biden administration is also, in public and through back-channels, warning Iran against escalating the situation. Iran supports the so-called Axis of Resistance, an alliance that includes Hezbollah - its most important force - as well as militias in Iraq, Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, the Houthis in Yemen, and Hamas.It is not clear how much direct influence Tehran has over the groups, but it is unlikely that they take any major decisions without Iran's blessing. On Sunday, the Iranian President, Ebrahim Raisi, said Israel's ""crimes had crossed the red lines, which may force everyone to take action"". Washington, he added, ""asks us to not do anything, but they keep giving widespread support to Israel"". A source close to Hezbollah told me, on condition of anonymity, last week, that Nasrallah - who is known for his angry anti-Israeli and anti-American speeches - was closely monitoring the situation and remained in constant contact with the group's military leadership, despite his public silence.""Hezbollah is following all details,"" the source said. ""They make calculations all the time.""

Tens of thousands of people watched the widely anticipated televised address on Friday from rallies called by the Lebanese group to honour fallen fighters. In his lengthy remarks, Nasrallah said that “all scenarios are open on our Lebanese southern front” and that “what happens on the Lebanese front will depend on what happens in Gaza”, calling on Israel to stop its attacks on the besieged strip to avoid a regional conflagration. Nasrallah said Hamas’s October 7 attack on southern Israel was “100 percent Palestinian” and expressed support for the Palestinian group, but stopped short of declaring all-out war against Israel, as many had feared. The Hezbollah leader praised the Hamas attack four weeks ago, which targeted villages and military posts in southern Israel. More than 1,400 people were killed in Israel in that attack, mostly civilians according to Israeli authorities. Since then, more than 9,000 Palestinians have been killed in an air and ground assault by the Israeli military on Gaza, most of them women and children. “This great, large-scale operation was purely the result of Palestinian planning and implementation,” Nasrallah said, suggesting Hezbollah had no part in the attack. “The great secrecy made this operation greatly successful.” US ‘responsible’ for the war Nasrallah said that one of the biggest mistakes Israel was making now in its war against Hamas in Gaza was pursuing goals that it cannot achieve. “For a whole month, Israel could not offer a single military achievement,” he said, adding that Israel can only get back hostages through negotiation. Nasrallah blamed the conflict and high Palestinian civilian death toll on the United States, as US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken was meeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv. Netanyahu told Blinken that he rejected any temporary halt to the fighting that did not include the release of the more than 200 Israeli hostages. “We won’t stop until victory,” Netanyahu said, adding that this means “to destroy Hamas, [and attain the] return of the hostages and the restoration of security for our citizens and children”. “The United States is totally responsible for the war raging in Gaza,” Nasrallah said. Blinken acknowledged that more needed to be done to “protect Palestinian civilians” in Gaza and that, without that, there will be “no partners for peace”. Speaking to reporters in Tel Aviv on Friday, Blinken also said, “We need to substantially and immediately increase the sustainable humanitarian assistance” into Gaza. Nasrallah said the two objectives of the group now were to end the war and “enable the resistance to triumph”. He said “the victory of Gaza means the victory of the Palestinian people,” and that that would be in the interest of Egypt, Jordan, Syria, as well as Lebanon. He called on the Arab world to recall their ambassadors and cut off oil and gas and food supplies to Israel. Since the beginning of the war, Hezbollah, an ally of the armed Palestinian group Hamas, had taken calculated steps to keep Israel’s military busy on its border with Lebanon, but not to the extent of igniting an all-out war. Nasrallah insisted that Hezbollah has “been in this battle since October 8”, pointing out that what’s happening on the border is “unprecedented since 1948”, when Israel was created and hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were displaced during the Nakba, or “catastrophe”. Celebratory gunshots rang out over Lebanon’s capital Beirut as thousands packed into a square in the southern suburbs to watch the speech, which many people in Lebanon were anxiously awaiting, rattled for weeks by fears the conflict could spread to the rest of the region. His address was also keenly watched outside Lebanon, as Nasrallah is a leading voice in the informal alliance known as the “Axis of Resistance”, led by Iran to counter the influence of the United States and Israel. The coalition includes Shia Muslim Iraqi militias, which have been firing at US forces in Syria and Iraq, and Yemen’s Houthis, who havewaded into the conflictby firing drones at Israel. The speech came a day after the most significant escalation in clashes between Hezbollah and Israeli forces on the border since the war started.   "
"Israel-Hamas truce in Gaza extended for two days, Qatar says","CIA, Mossad chiefs meet in Qatar as Israel-Hamas truce is extended",0.534063513624274,2023-11-27,2023-11-28,"Israel and Hamas have agreed to extend the four-day truce in Gaza for another two days, mediator Qatar says.Hamas said the extension was ""under the same conditions"", which were for 50 Israeli hostages to be released in exchange for 150 Palestinian prisoners.Israel has yet to comment, but it had offered a day's pause in the fighting for every 10 Israeli hostages freed.It came as 11 hostages were released in the final exchange under the original deal that took effect on Friday.Israeli officials said three-year-old twins and their mother were among them, along with six more children, an 18-year-old and her mother. The Israeli military said they had crossed into Israeli territory. However all of the released children's fathers remained in Gaza.Those freed included people who also held French, German and Argentine nationality, Qatar said.Thirty-three Palestinian women and teenagers in Israeli jails were due to be released under the truce deal.Hamas - which is regarded as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK and other Western powers - has freed 39 Israelis over the previous three days. In exchange, Israel has freed 117 Palestinian prisoners.Nineteen foreign nationals, one of whom has Israeli citizenship, have also been handed over by Hamas under separate agreements.The pause in the fighting is also allowing a big increase in deliveries of aid to Gaza, where there is a deepening humanitarian crisis.Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza and imposed a siege in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and about 240 others taken hostage.Gaza's Hamas-run government says more than 14,800 people have been killed in the territory since the war began.Qatari foreign ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari announced on Monday afternoon on X, formerly known as Twitter, that ""as part of the ongoing mediation, an agreement has been reached to extend the humanitarian pause for an additional two days in the Gaza Strip"".White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters the US welcomed the extension.""This humanitarian pause has already brought a halt to the fighting together with a surge of humanitarian assistance. Now, in order to extend the pause Hamas has committed to releasing another 20 women and children over the next two days,"" he said.""We would of course hope to see the pause extended further and that will depend upon Hamas continuing to release hostages.""Before the start of Monday's exchange, an Israeli official said that 184 people remained in captivity in Gaza, including 14 foreign nationals and 80 Israelis with dual citizenship.On Sunday, a Palestinian official told the BBC that Hamas was prepared to release up to 40 additional hostages, which would mean a four-day extension under the terms offered by Israel.Israel was reported to be leaning towards a more gradual, day-by-day approach. And it has made it clear that it is preparing to resume the war in Gaza at the end of the process.""At the end of the outline, we will go to realising our goals with full force: eliminating Hamas, ensuring that Gaza will not go back to being what it was and, of course, releasing all of our hostages,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video statement on Sunday evening.Earlier, Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdul Rahman Al Thani told the BBC's US partner CBS News that the agreement would be extended if Hamas was ""able to prove, to locate, and secure some of the hostages that are within the criteria of the first group, which is women and children"".But he warned that Hamas's ""very complicated structure"" presented a challenge for Qatari mediators, with the group's political leaders in Doha having to relay information to and from military commanders in Gaza.","The heads of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Israel’s Mossad have met in Qatar to discuss theextension of a trucebetween Israel and Hamas as well as the captives being held by the Palestinian group in Gaza. CIA Director William Burns and David Barnea, head of the Mossad intelligence service, held talks with Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani on Tuesday, a day after Doha announced atwo-day extensionof an originalfour-day humanitarian pausein Gaza that had been due to expire. “We have to read a little bit between the lines here: [The intelligence chiefs were] important in the last meeting, which was on November 9. We believe that was one of the stepping stones getting us to the initial four-day deal,” Al Jazeera’s diplomatic editor James Bays said. “The fact that we’ve got intelligence chiefs sitting here with the Qatari prime minister, who is also the foreign minister, is interesting because they’ve got the intelligence picture. But also I think it’s interesting partly because of who the US has got leading this effort,” he said, adding that Burns is “more experienced a negotiator than Antony Blinken”, the US secretary of state.    Israel and Hamas have accused each other of violating the original truce. But they have continued to swap captives for prisoners. Hamas has released captives in its custody, with another 12 freed on Tuesday. Our teams have successfully facilitated the release and transfer of 12 hostages held in Gaza. We have been able to carry out this operation thanks to our neutral intermediary role. — ICRC in Israel & OT (@ICRC_ilot)November 28, 2023  Majed al-Ansari, a spokesperson for Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in a post on X that 30 Palestinian prisoners are set to be released. On Monday, mediator Qatar said a humanitarian pause in fighting between Israel and Hamas would be extended by two days, hours before the initial four-day truce in Gaza was set to expire. Qatar, the US and Egypt have engaged in intensenegotiations to establish and prolong the trucein Gaza. Over the course of the initial pause, Hamas released 69 captives – 51 Israelis and 18 people of other nationalities. In exchange, 150Palestinian prisoners– 117 children and 33 women – held in Israeli prisons were released and more humanitarian aid was allowed into Gaza. The talks between the US and Israeli intelligence chiefs and Qatar were also attended by Egyptian officials. “Is there a way that they can try and deal with the central problem here of keeping this [current truce] going while Israel at the same time wants to remove Hamas?” Bays asked. “We don’t know anything from the information on the ground, but one possibility that some are suggesting is perhaps a deal could be done for the Hamas military leadership to be persuaded to go into exile in another country,” he said. “That’s certainly not what we’re hearing from Israeli media sources; the latest we’re hearing from them is that the Israeli government does not want an extension beyond 10 days in total, taking us until the end of Sunday,” according to Bays. Meanwhile, far-right Israeli Minister for National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to allow soldiers to return to fighting in Gaza to “crush Hamas” as he reacted to an army statement that three explosive devices were detonated in two locations near troops in northern Gaza. “We must not wait until our fighters are killed. We must once again act in accordance with the goal of the war: the total destruction of Hamas,” the minister posted on X.   "
Oil prices rise after Iran seizes tanker,Iran seizes oil tanker off Oman in dispute with US,0.5336529397978444,2024-01-11,2024-01-11,"Oil prices have risen after Iran seized a tanker off the coast of Oman, raising concerns fuel prices could increase.The oil tanker was heading for Turkey on Thursday when armed men ordered it to sail to an Iranian port.The price of Brent crude oil jumped by more than 2%, to $78.40 a barrel following the incident. Meanwhile, the UK government has modelled scenarios suggesting the disruption in the Red Sea could further shrink the British economy.The BBC understands the Treasury has considered a rise of at least $10 (around Â£7.83) per barrel in the international price of crude oil and a 25% increase in the price of natural gas.Europe, in particular, is now more dependent on exports of gas coming through the Gulf and the Straits of Hormuz. The seizure of the oil tanker by Iran, reported by local state media as retaliation for the hijacking last year of the same vessel by the US, raises prospects of growing conflict in the Middle East, which could have a knock-on effect on UK fuel prices.A rise in oil prices can lead to higher prices at the pumps and also drive higher inflation. Inflation, which measures the pace of price rises, has been falling in the UK and is currently 3.9%.The average price of a litre fell below Â£1.40 on Thursday for the first time since October 2021, according to motoring group, the AA. Diesel now averages 147.83p a litre across the country, down to a level last seen in early August.This time last year, petrol and diesel averaged 149.47p and 171.93p a litre respectively.""Drivers should be ready for pump price volatility, perhaps even a shock, but current pump prices are a huge relief for consumers and inflationary pressures,"" the AA's Luke Jones added. This most recent incident appears to be separate from attacks carried out by Houthi rebels from Yemen in the Red Sea, on the opposite side of the Arabian peninsula.But as Caroline Bain, chief commodities economist at Capital Economics points out, the reaction in the oil market has been fairly muted to these attacks and the Israel-Hamas war.""Initially, when the war broke out, there were fears that some of the major oil producers in the region - particularly Iran, but also Saudi Arabia - would become actively involved,"" she said.However, this no longer appears as likely and the risk of disruption to oil supply has been reduced. Demand for oil has dropped, following the slowdown in the EU and US economies and lack of growth in China, so there is less fear of supply shortfalls. Conversely, there has been a ""surprisingly strong growth in US oil production in 2023 and in some other non-OPEC producers such as Brazil and Guyana,"" Ms Bain said, which has ""allayed fears of disruption to Middle East supply.""  ""If there were a further escalation in tensions in the Middle East/Red Sea, I think prices would rise more markedly,"" she added. ","Iran has seized a tanker with Iraqi crude destined for Turkey in retaliation for the confiscation last year of the same vessel and its oil by the United States, Iranian state media reported, a move likely to stoke regional tensions. “The Navy of the Islamic Republic of Iran seized an American oil tanker in the waters of the Gulf of Oman in accordance with a court order,” the state-run IRNA news agency said. “After the theft ofIranian oilby the United States last year, St Nikolas tanker was seized by Iran’s Navy”, the navy said, as cited by the Iranian news agency Fars. The US condemned what it called an “unlawful seizure” and demanded Iran “immediately release the ship and its crew”. The seizure comes after weeks of attacks by Yemen’s Iranian-alignedHouthison vessels in the Red Sea. The Houthi rebels say they are carrying out the attacks in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza amid Israel’s assault on the territory. The group’s attacks have raised the risk of possible retaliatory strikes from US-led forces patrolling the busy waterway, especially after aUnited Nations Security Council voteon Wednesday condemning the Houthis. But while the Houthis have been concentrated on theBab al-Mandab Strait, to the southwest of the Arabian Peninsula, Thursday’s incident was located closer to the Strait of Hormuz, between Oman and Iran. The British maritime security firm Ambrey said the incident began at about 7:30am (03:30 GMT) when several armed men boarded the Marshall Islands-flagged St Nikolas, around 50 nautical miles east of Sohar in Oman, and then headed towards Bandar-e-Jask in Iran. TankerTrackers.com, which tracks and reports global shipments of crude oil, said the tanker was carrying “Iraqi oil” and previously went by the name Suez Rajan. Ambrey said the recently renamed tanker was previously prosecuted and fined for carrying sanctioned Iranian oil, which was confiscated by US authorities. The yearlong dispute ended with the US Department of Justice seizing one million barrels of Iranian crude. United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO), which is linked to the British military and provides warnings to sailors in the Middle East, said the incident began in waters between Oman and Iran, and it had received a report from the ship’s security manager of hearing “unknown voices over the phone” alongside the ship’s captain. Ambrey said that the men covered surveillance cameras as they boarded the vessel. As the tanker appeared to veer towards Bandar-e-Jask, its tracker was turned off, it added.    The St Nikolas was sailing from the Iraqi port of Basra to Turkey, according to MarineTraffic.com, a tracking website. The vessel was manned by a crew of 19, including 18 Filipino nationals and one Greek national, the operator said, adding that Turkish oil refiner Tupras chartered it. The Gulf of Oman, a key route for the oil industry that separates Oman and Iran, has witnessed a series of hijackings and attacks over the years, often involving Iran. Since the collapse of Iran’s nuclear deal, Iran and theUS Navy’s Fifth Fleet, which patrols the Middle East, also have had a series of tense encounters in the waterway. The US and its allies have also been seizing Iranian oil cargoes since 2019, which has led to a series of attacks in the Middle East attributed to Iran, as well as ship seizures by its military and paramilitary forces, threatening global shipping."
Houthis claim new attacks on Red Sea shipping,"Defiant Houthis claim fresh Red Sea attacks on US, UK ships",0.531281071743038,2024-02-06,2024-02-06,"The Houthi movement in Yemen says it has fired missiles at two ships in the Red Sea, apparently undeterred by US and UK strikes on the group.The group's leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi warned that his group would ""further escalate"" if the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza did not end.The Houthis targeted the Star Nasia and Morning Tide ships.The Greek-owned Star Nasia was damaged but its crew were unhurt, a Greek official told Reuters.Furadino Shipping Ltd, the British owner of the Morning Tide, said there was an explosion near the ship but that it was undamaged and nobody was hurt and the vessel was able to continue on its route.The latest attacks by the group come after a wave of air strikes by the US and UK in recent days, including a strike on Monday that the US Central Command said hit two uncrewed explosive surface vehicles.Previous strikes over the weekend hit Houthi missiles, the US said. More than 30 targets were struck in the third wave of joint UK and US attacks on Saturday. The US has also carried out several rounds of strikes without the UK's involvement. The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) agency on Tuesday confirmed it had received reports of an attack on a ship just after midnight GMT in the Red Sea, west of the Yemeni city of Hodeidah.British maritime security firm Ambrey, meanwhile, said a general cargo ship owned by a British company and sailing under a Barbados flag had suffered damage in an attack while sailing through the sea. The commander of HMS Diamond, a UK warship that has been part of efforts to protect merchant ships from Houthi attacks in the Red Sea in recent months, described the situation in the region on Tuesday as ""fraught"". ""Ships in the force are firing on a daily basis,"" Peter Evans said on Tuesday. Royal Navy warship HMS Richmond is now taking over Red Sea patrols from HMS Diamond.The Houthis - a Hamas ally - regard all Israeli, US and British ships as legitimate targets following Israel's war on Hamas in Gaza. They claim they are only targeting vessels with links to these countries. Since November, the group - which controls a significant part of Yemen - has launched dozens of attacks on commercial vessels travelling through the Red Sea, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes.These attacks have slowed down international trade, raising fears of supply bottlenecks.","Yemen’sHouthissay they have fired missiles at two civilian ships in the Red Sea. The attacks claimed by the Houthis on Tuesday, one on a British vessel and one on an American ship, are the latest in a campaign that they said is motivated byIsrael’s war on Gaza. The Iran-aligned armed group has stated itsdetermination to continuethe attacks despite several air strikes by the US and its allies patrolling the Red Sea. The ongoing campaign is helping to stokesimmering tensionsacross the Middle East. It is also disrupting world trade because the Red Sea is a major route for container ships. The Houthi’s military spokesman, Brigadier General Yahya Saree, confirmed the attacks on the two ships and repeated the threat to carry out more “self-defence” operations against “hostile” American and British targets. The attacks took place west of the Yemeni port of Hodeidah. Saree said naval missiles hit the Morning Tide, a Barbados-flagged, British-owned cargo ship, and the Star Nasia, a Marshall Islands-flagged American ship. The owner of the Morning Tide, British firm Furadino Shipping, told the Reuters news agency the ship was currently sailing without problems but gave no further information. British maritime security firm Ambrey said the British ship had performed evasive manoeuvres and continued its journey. No injuries were reported. The Houthis have launched dozens of missile, drone and boat attacks on commercial ships linked with Israel in addition to US and UK military warships since November 19. Thecampaignhas caused major headaches for global shipping firms, forcing them to suspend transits through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden and reroute over longer, more expensive journeys around Southern Africa. Operations will continue “against Israeli shipping or those heading to the ports of occupied Palestine until the siege is lifted and the aggression against the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip is stopped”, Saree said. Last month, the US and Britain began striking Houthi targets in Yemen in retaliation. The US military confirmed its latest attack, conducted on Monday, against two explosive Houthi naval drones that it said presented an imminent threat to navy ships and merchant vessels. The US government has now designated the Yemeni group as“global terrorists”. Amid the threat of extended shipping disruptions, the European Union is planning to launch its own Red Sea naval mission by the middle of February."
Three US soldiers killed in Jordan attack named,Iran denies involvement in drone attack that killed 3 US soldiers in Jordan,0.5286243805199179,2024-01-29,2024-01-29,"The US government has released the names of three troops killed by an enemy drone attack in Jordan on Sunday. Sgt William Jerome Rivers, 46, Specialist Kennedy Ladon Sanders, 24, and Specialist Breonna Alexsondria Moffett, 23, were killed when a drone hit their housing unit.The US has blamed Iranian-backed groups and the Pentagon said it carried the ""footprints"" of Kataib Hezbollah.The Pentagon also reiterated the US does not want a war with Iran.""We don't seek war, but we will take action, and respond to attacks on our forces,"" said Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh. CBS News, the BBC's US partner, said it was told by a US official that the drone used in the attack appeared to be Iranian-made. The official indicated it was a ""type of Shahed drone,"" which is a one-way attack drone Iran has been providing to Russia.Iran has denied US and British accusations that it supported militant groups blamed for the strike.The Pentagon said the three soldiers killed on Sunday morning came from an army reserve unit based in Fort Moore, in the state of Georgia.Lt Gen Jody Daniels, Chief of Army Reserve and Commanding General US Army Reserve Command, paid tribute to the fallen soldiers. ""On behalf of the Army Reserve, I share in the sorrow felt by their friends, family, and loved ones. Their service and sacrifice will not be forgotten, and we are committed to supporting those left behind in the wake of this tragedy"", said Gen Daniels.The drone attack took place in Rukban, north-eastern Jordan, near the Syrian border. The base was later named by US officials as Tower 22. More than 40 military personnel were injured when the unmanned aerial system hit the container housing unit they were in on Sunday morning. Features of an air defence system were turned off at Tower 22 at the time of the attack, US officials told CBS News, because the enemy drone arrived at the same time as a returning US drone.They added that troops at the air base were still in their sleeping quarters when the drone struck - with little to no warning.Iran has denied playing a part in supporting groups suspected of being responsible for the strike.Nasser Kanaani, Iran's foreign ministry spokesman, said it was ""not involved in the decision making of resistance groups"" in how they chose to ""defend Palestinians or their own countries"".Iran's Intelligence Minister Esmail Khatib said that regional armed groups aligned with Iran respond to ""American aggressors"" at their own discretion.US President Joe Biden said the US ""will hold all those responsible to account at a time and in a manner of our choosing"".The US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said he and Mr Biden would take ""all necessary actions"" following the attack on American forces. Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said the attack was carried out by an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-backed militia and had the ""footprints"" of Iraq-based militant group Kataib Hezbollah. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq has claimed it was behind the attack.The umbrella group emerged in late 2023 and is comprised of several Iran-affiliated militias operating in Iraq. It has claimed other attacks against US forces in recent weeks.In a statement, the group said it had targeted three US bases in Syria - identifying them as Shaddadi, Tanf and Rukban. However, Rukban is on the Jordanian side of the border with Syria. The group also said it targeted an Israeli oil facility in the Mediterranean.It is the first time that a strike has killed US troops in the region since the start of the war in Gaza, triggered by Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel.There have been other attacks on US bases in the region, but before Sunday there were no fatalities, according to the US military.Officials said that US sites in Iraq and Syria had been attacked at least 165 times since 17 October. Last month, the US carried out airstrikes against Iran-affiliated groups after three US servicemembers were injured, one critically, in a drone attack on a base in northern Iraq.Earlier in January, one retaliatory US strike in Baghdad killed a militia leader accused of being behind attacks on US personnel. ","Iran has denied involvement in adrone attack in Jordanthat killed three US military personnel and injured dozens of others, state media has reported. US President Joe Biden and UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron have blamed Iran-backed groups for Sunday’s attack near the border with Syria. “As we have clearly stated before, the resistance groups in the region are responding [to] the war crimes and genocide of the child-killing Zionist regime and… they do not take orders from the Islamic Republic of Iran,” Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Nasser Kanaani was quoted saying by IRNA on Monday. “These groups decide and act based on their own principles and priorities as well as the interests of their country and people.” Kanaani said claims of Iranian involvement were motivated by “specific political goals to reverse the realities of the region” and were “influenced by third parties, including the child-killing Zionist regime”. Iran’s mission to the United Nations also said in a statement carried by IRNA that Tehran had “no connection and had nothing to do” with the attack, which it blamed on “conflict between US forces and resistance groups in the region”. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella organisation of Iran-backed armed groups, has claimed responsibility for the attack. The drone strike on Tower 22, a logistics support base, marked the first loss of American life by enemy fire since the start of the war in Gaza. Biden, who has staunchly backed Israel’s war in Gaza, condemned the “despicable and wholly unjust attack” and has vowed to hold all those responsible “to account at a time and in a manner [of] our choosing”. Washington has accused Iranian-backed groups of carrying out dozens of attacks on US military installations in Iraq and Syria since the start of the war."
BBC goes inside Al-Shifa hospital with the Israeli army,Why is Gaza’s al-Shifa Hospital so important for the Israeli army?,0.5254000875224851,2023-11-16,2023-11-15,"We clamber into the Al-Shifa hospital complex in darkness over a caved-in wall in the perimeter - knocked through with an armoured bulldozer on Tuesday to allow safer access for Israeli forces.The BBC and one other television crew were the first journalists invited by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to view what Israel says it has found at the site. Any extra light here is risky so we grope our way through the compound, following the heavily armed troops sent to escort us - stepping around makeshift tents, debris and sleeping people. Doctors at the hospital say they have been working without power, food or water for days now - and that critically ill patients have died as a result, including newborn babies. People displaced by the fighting in Gaza have been sheltering in the hospital complex.But Israel says Hamas also runs a network of underground tunnels, including under Al-Shifa hospital.The masked special forces leading us into the building over debris and broken glass are a sign of how tense the situation still is here. Our presence, just a day after Israel took control of the hospital, speaks volumes about Israel's motivation to show the world why they are here. In the brightly lit corridors of the MRI unit, Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus shows us three small stashes of Kalashnikovs, ammunition and bullet-proof vests - he says they have found around 15 guns in all, along with some grenades. Lt Col Conricus also shows us some military booklets and pamphlets, and a map that he says is marked with potential entry and exit routes from the hospital.What it tells us, he says, is that Hamas uses hospitals for military purposes. ""[And] we uncovered a lot of computers and other equipment which could really shed light on the current situation, hopefully regarding hostages as well.""The laptops, he says, contain photos and videos of hostages, taken after their kidnap to Gaza. There is also recently released footage, shared by Israeli police, of their interrogations of Hamas fighters arrested after the October attacks. The BBC was not shown what was on the laptops.This, Lt Col Conricus said, suggested Hamas were here ""within the last few days"".""At the end of the day, this is just the tip of the iceberg,"" he said. ""Hamas aren't here because they saw we were coming. This is probably what they were forced to leave behind. Our assessment is that there's much more.""Israel's army has spent weeks fighting its way to the gates of the hospital. The streets around have seen some of the fiercest fighting in Gaza in the past few days. Our visit was tightly controlled; we had very limited time on the ground and were not able to speak to doctors or patients there. Our journey in to Gaza, in an armoured personnel carrier sealed tight from the darkness outside, traced the path of Israel's first major ground incursions into Gaza weeks ago.On the screens inside the military vehicle, the agricultural land morphed slowly into distorted streets strewn with large pieces of debris, and the blurred outlines of shattered buildings.Just south of Gaza City, we stopped to change vehicles, clambering out on to undulating mounds of twisted metal and large chunks of rubble and concrete.  Small groups of soldiers crouched over tiny campfires, cooking a makeshift dinner beside the rows of tanks. ""It's a secret recipe,"" one winked.  Above them, buildings had collapsed in strange shapes. The rolling metal door of a shopfront hung cramped, halfway open.  A Star of David was scrawled on a wall in red spray-paint; inside it someone had written ""IDF"", and above it, the words: ""Never Again"".The attacks of 7 October changed the calculation for Israel in its conflict with Hamas. It has vowed to end years of uneasy standoff, by destroying both the military and political power of Hamas, designated a terrorist organisation by the UK, US and others.That means going into the heart of Gaza City, including inside Al-Shifa. Israeli forces are still searching for the tunnels beneath the hospital that they believe Hamas fighters may have withdrawn to, perhaps with some of the hostages.This building has become a central focus of Israel's war, described as a key command centre, even potentially the ""beating heart"" of Hamas operations. And in the brutal information war that tails this conflict, this is Israel's moment of truth.After almost 24 hours securing and searching the hospital, Israel says it has found weapons and other equipment that could help provide information on both Hamas fighters and the hostages. But it has its hands on neither. We leave the hospital, and rumble down the wide avenue that leads to Gaza's coastal road. Gaza City is now ruled by tanks. The ghostly avenues look in places like an earthquake zone, the destruction is so severe.It is clear what it took for Israel to get control of these streets.Additional reporting by Scarlett Barter and Dave Bull, BBC News. ","Ever since the Israeli army’s strikes on the Gaza Strip began after the October 7 Hamas attack, the al-Shifa Hospital in the northern part of the besieged enclave has been prominently featured in the news. For the past five days, it has been at the centre of everything as Gaza’s death toll has risen, with more than 11,500 Palestinians, nearly half of them children, killed by Israeli forces. Brutal scenes are unfolding at the hospital as snipers have spent days shooting at anyone trying to move from one medical building to the other, prompting international outcries. But the Israeli army appears unfazed. The significance of al-Shifa Hospital is beyond the medical. The storied medical complex, whose name translates into “House of Healing”, has been described as the beating heart of Gaza. It hasbeen there since the time of the British ruleover Palestine and became a hospital in 1946 after originally housing British army barracks. It has survived several wars and many years of Israeli occupation. Since last month, it has been denied urgently needed supplies of medicine and fuel – and that was before Israeli troops broke in and blew up its dwindling stores of medicine. Hospital staff had to bury dozens of people in a mass grave on the grounds as they were out of options. Dead bodies lie around its courtyard still. Beyond that, al-Shifa is seen as a nerve centre for the Gaza government’s administrative bodies. Health ministry officials have held press conferences amid the corpses there, and the government’s media ministry has operated out of the hospital. Al-Shifa kept its internet connectivity at timeswhen the rest of Gaza was cut off by Israel, so it has also been a hot spot for journalists, some of whom are trapped there now. The hospital’s director and its doctors and staff have been providing constant updates whenever possible, often rejecting Israeli claims – like one on Wednesday that it had allowed aid into the hospital. For some Palestinians, the hospital has become a symbol of strength and standing up to a militarily stronger force that shows little restraint. Images of dead babies and maimed children that have been broadcast from inside the hospital to the world have inspired many millions to take to the streets in support of Palestinians. Israel has said it wants to take charge of Gaza’s security in the future. It has contradicted its main ally, the United States, on that point since Washington wants the Palestinian Authority to take over. But they seem to be on the same page on “destroying” Hamas, so the ground operation would need to expand for that to happen. Taking over the main hospital in town would be essential in that scenario. But just as al-Shifa has found new meaning among Palestinians and those watching from around the globe, what happens at the hospital has become paramount for Israel. Israel wants to dismantle the hub that al-Shifa has become and take over what it has said it sees as the stronghold of Hamas’s military and administrative capabilities. What happens to the hospital could also have an impact on the future of negotiations on releasing captives andallowing desperately needed humanitarian aid and fuelinto Gaza. A doctor at the hospital, Munir al-Bursh, told Israeli forces how their presence is creating a “state of fear and hysteria”, according to a recording obtained by Al Jazeera on Wednesday. The Geneva-based Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor has said “the army might be creating the scene that might be released later” as it is the sole party controlling the atmosphere inside the hospital. Israel’s targeting of hospitals has been deeply controversial. Nearly a month ago, it was accused of adeadly attack on the al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza, but Israel and the West blamed it on Palestinian fighters firing a faulty rocket from within the Gaza Strip. The Israeli army has spent the past several days gradually tightening its noose around the hospital. As part of its ground offensive into northern Gaza, it came in and surrounded the largest hospital in the Strip with soldiers, tanks, armoured vehicles, and attack drones supported by snipers. The Israeli troops have now made their way into the hospital and raided several departments. They set up electronic checkpoints at multiple doors of the main buildings. Their tanks are in the courtyard. This is whilethousands of people are still trapped in the hospital. These include many displaced Palestinians taking shelter there, critically ill patients with nowhere to go, and exhausted medical staff and personnel. According to first-hand accounts, Israeli troops targeted generators and communications units before storming in, and they also interrogated dozens of stripped and blindfolded people who already had their access to water and basic hygiene cut off. Israel’s main supporting claim for laying siege to the most important hospital in Gaza is that Hamas has a main command centre operating from within and under the hospital. This is a claim that has also been backed by the US, promptingHamas to hold Washington “wholly responsible”for effectively giving the green light to attack a hospital filled with civilians. Neither Tel Aviv nor the White House have released any independently verified evidence to back this claim, which has been refuted by a number of the doctors and staff at the hospital. And there has been no clear evidence that a number of the captives taken by Hamas during its October 7 attack are being held within the confines of the hospital. Israel has also failed to allow any independent third parties into the area in order to verify claims by each side. Such heavily disputed claims have historically ended up unproven."
Israel says South Africa distorting the truth in ICJ genocide case,Namibia condemns Germany for defending Israel in ICJ genocide case,0.5244610971096052,2024-01-12,2024-01-14,"Israel has said South Africa has distorted the truth in its case at the International Court of Justice, where it is accusing Israel of genocide.South Africa had presented ""a sweeping counter-factual description"" of the Israel-Palestinian conflict, Israeli lawyer Tal Becker told the ICJ.South Africa says Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in its war in Gaza.It is also asking the court to order Israel to halt its military activity.The ICJ is the United Nations' highest court. Its rulings are theoretically legally binding on parties to the ICJ - which include Israel and South Africa - but are not enforceable. Israel delivered its defence to the court a day after South Africa presented its case.Outside the legal battleground of the ICJ, police created cordons to ensure rival groups were kept far apart.  On one side, Palestinian flags were waved beneath a big screen streaming a live feed from the courtroom. Banners were unfurled showing images of Nelson Mandela, referencing parallels drawn by South Africa's legal team between the situation in Gaza and the former apartheid era in South Africa. A few hundred metres away, a symbolic Sabbath table had been laid. Photographs were attached to the back of empty chairs. These show some of the more than 130 Israelis who are still being held hostage by Hamas, which is banned as a terrorist group in the US, UK, EU and elsewhere.South Africa asserts that Israel is in violation of the 1948 Genocide Convention, to which both states are signatories, and which commits parties to prevent genocide from happening.Israel has been waging a war against Hamas, Gaza's ruling group, since 7 October, when hundreds of Hamas gunmen invaded Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking some 240 others back to Gaza as hostages. Members of the hostages' families were in the ICJ courtroom to hear Israel state its case.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 23,350 people - mostly women and children - have been killed by Israel in the war.In his opening remarks on Friday, Tal Becker told the court that while the civilian suffering was ""tragic"", Hamas sought ""to maximise civilian harm to both Israelis and Palestinians, even as Israel seeks to minimise it"".South Africa, he said, ""has regrettably put before the court a profoundly distorted factual and legal picture, [and] the entirety of its case hinges on a deliberately curated, decontextualised and manipulative description of the reality of current hostilities"".Mr Becker accused South Africa of making ""an attempt to weaponise the term genocide against Israel"".He said South Africa was also seeking ""to thwart Israel's inherent right to defend itself"" by trying to get the court to order Israel to stop its military operation against Hamas.On Thursday, the court's 17 judges heard advocate of the High Court of South Africa Tembeka Ngcukaitobi describe how Israel's ""genocidal intent"" was evident ""from the way in which [its] military attack is being conducted"". Israel had a plan to ""destroy"" Gaza, he said, which ""has been nurtured at the highest level of state"".Adila Hassim, also representing South Africa, told the court that ""every day there is mounting, irreparable loss of life, property, dignity and humanity for the Palestinian people"".""Nothing will stop the suffering, except an order from this court."" In its evidence submitted before the hearing, South Africa said Israel's actions were ""intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group"".The German government issued a statement on Friday, saying it ""expressly rejects the accusation of genocide"" against Israel, and that the accusation had ""no basis whatsoever"".""In view of Germany's history and the crime against humanity of the Shoah [Holocaust], the Federal Government sees itself as particularly committed to the Convention against Genocide... We firmly oppose [its] political instrumentalisation.""Government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said Germany would speak at the main hearing at the ICJ.A spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Mr Sunak believed South Africa's case was ""completely unjustified and wrong.""""The UK government stands by Israel's clear right to defend itself within the framework of international law,"" he said.What the ICJ will deliver on the genocide allegation will be only an opinion, although it is being closely watched.A final ruling on this could take years, although the court could rule more quickly on South Africa's request for Israel to suspend its military campaign.Correction 13th February: This article wrongly reported that about 1,300 people had been killed following the 7th October attack by Hamas. This was based on counting those who later died from their injuries in addition to the figure of more than 1,200. The article has been amended to now refer to about 1,200 deaths, a figure which includes those deaths and which Israel says is not final.","Namibia has criticised Germany’s “shocking decision” to support Israel in the genocide case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) brought by South Africa, as Israel’s war on Gaza entered its 100th day. “Germany has chosen to defend in the ICJ the genocidal and gruesome acts of the Israeli government against innocent civilians in Gaza and the occupied Palestinian Territories,” the president of Namibia, Hage Geingob, said in a statement on X on Saturday. A two-day public hearing in the case at the World Court – the highest legal body of the United Nations – took place on Thursday and Friday during which South Africa and Israel presented their arguments. South Africatold the courton Thursday that Israel’s aerial and ground offensive – which has laid waste to much of the enclave and killed almost 24,000 people, according to Gaza health authorities – aimed to bring about “the destruction of the population” of Gaza. IsraelaccusedSouth Africa of presenting a “distorted” view of the hostilities, denying that its military operation in Gaza is a state-led genocide campaign against Palestinians. The statement by the Namibian presidency added that Berlin was ignoring Israel’s killing of more than 23,000 Palestinians in Gaza and various United Nations reports disturbingly highlighting the internal displacement of 85 percent of the besieged enclave’s 2.3 million people amid acute shortages of food and essential services. The Namibian president expressed “deep concern” over “the shocking decision” communicated by the government of Germany on Friday, in which “it rejected the morally upright indictment” brought forward by South Africa. “No peace-loving human being can ignore the carnage waged against Palestinians in Gaza,” it said. The statement claimed that Germany committed the first genocide of the 20th century in Namibia between 1904 and 1908, in which tens of thousands of innocent Namibians died in the most inhumane and brutal conditions. “Germany cannot morally express commitment to the United Nations Convention against genocide, including atonement for the genocide in Namibia, whilst supporting the equivalent of a holocaust and genocide in Gaza,” the presidency said. “President Geingob appeals to the German government to reconsider its untimely decision to intervene as a third-party in defence and support of the genocidal acts of Israel before the ICJ.”    German colonial forces carried out atrocities in Namibia against the Indigenous Herero and Nama peoples between 1904 and 1908. The killings were part of a German campaign of collective punishment between 1904 and 1908 that is today recognised as the 20th century’sfirst genocide. Henning Melber from Nordic Africa Institute in Sweden said that the statement issued by President Geingob was an unexpected turning point in the already fragile German-Namibian relations. “Germany publicly took side in the ICJ case with Israel on January 12, which marks 120 years of the beginning of what many Namibians call the German-Namibian war, which then resulted in the first genocide of the 20th century,” he said. “While Germany scored a lot of good points internationally in the way it engaged with the mass destruction of the Holocaust, it was in denial of the genocide committee [with Namibia] until 2015,” Melber said. He added that the German and Namibian governments have been in negotiations on the Namibian genocide for the past eight years. He said Germany still falls short of recognising the incidents in Namibia as a genocide in legal terms, which means it refuses the obligations to pay reparations. The ICJ is likely to present a provisional measure in the coming days but a final verdict will take years. South Africa has urged the court to order an immediate halt to Israel’s devastating military offensive in Gaza. The 1948 Genocide Convention, enacted in the wake of the mass murder of Jews in the Nazi Holocaust, definesgenocideas “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”. South Africa filed theICJ caseon December 19, accusing Israel of genocidal acts in Gaza. Several countries and international organisations have backed South Africa in its case, while Israel has received the backing of the United States, its main weapons supplier and close ally. Several global entities, including Human Rights Watch, have determined that Israel is engaging in war crimes in Gaza."
Drone attack kills six Kurdish-led fighters at US base in east Syria,Attack on Syrian US base kills Kurdish fighters as regional tension simmers,0.5232340935570198,2024-02-05,2024-02-05,"A drone attack on the largest US military base in Syria has killed at least six allied Kurdish-led fighters.The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said its commando academy at the al-Omar oil field in the eastern province of Deir al-Zour was hit in the early hours of Monday.It accused Iran-backed militias of launching the drone from a nearby area controlled by Syrian government forces.An Iran-backed militia umbrella group claimed it attacked the base on Sunday.There was no comment or reports of casualties from the US military, which has about 800 troops in Syria to combat the Islamic State (IS) group.It was the second incident since the US conducted strikes against Iran-backed groups in Iraq and Syria over the weekend in response to a deadly drone attack on a base in Jordan. The Pentagon confirmed to the BBC that there had been a rocket attack at its Mission Support Site Euphrates in Syria on Saturday, but there were no casualties or damages in the incident.The SDF - which has controlled much of north-eastern Syria since defeating IS there in 2019, with the support of a US-led global coalition - said in a statement that six of its ""commando fighters"" were killed when a one-way attack drone targeted their training academy around midnight on Monday.""Iranian-backed militias used the Syrian regime-controlled areas in Deir al-Zour as a staging ground for the terrorist attack,"" it alleged.The SDF condemned the attack and asserted its ""right to respond appropriately to the source"".The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, reported that seven SDF commandos were killed and 18 injured in what it said was the 108th militia attack on US bases in the country since mid-October.The Islamic Resistance in Iraq (IRI) - an umbrella group of Iraqi militias believed to be armed, trained and funded by Iran - said it carried out a drone attack on Sunday ""against the US occupation base in al-Omar oil field"".The IRI has claimed many of the drone, rocket and missile attacks that have targeted US troops in Iraq, Syria and Jordan since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. It says that they are a demonstration of solidarity with the Palestinian people.The attacks include the 28 January drone strike on the Tower 22 base near Jordan's border with Syria, which killed three US soldiers.Iran denied any involvement in the attack, but the US believes it manufactured the drone and that co-ordination of the militias is overseen by its Islamic Revolution Guard Corps' (IRGC) Quds Force. On Friday, the US struck more than 85 targets across seven facilities in Iraq and Syria used by the IRGC and affiliated militias, warning that it was just the ""start"" of its response to the Jordan attack.The strikes in Syria killed 29 pro-Iran fighters, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. In Iraq, authorities said 16 people were killed.Amid the heightened tensions in the region, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is currently in Saudi Arabia as part of a Middle East tour, his fifth since the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel.Mr Blinken will visit Egypt, Qatar, Israel and the West Bank later this week, pushing officials to cut a new deal to free Israeli hostages and to help prevent an escalation of the conflict.","A drone strike on a United States base in eastern Syria overnight has killed several fighters from Kurdish-led forces. The United Kingdom-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said on Monday that seven fighters were killed and at least 18 others injured. The attack followsUS strikeson targets in Iraq and Syria over the weekend. Iran-aligned armed groups said they had also struck US bases in Syria as well as western and northern Iraq, as a low-level war with Washington simmers. “This attack in the first response by the Iranian militias to American bases after American airstrikes on militia positions in various areas within areas they control,” the observatory said of Monday’s incident. The SOHR added that since October 19, “108 attacks” were carried out on bases of the US-led Combined Joint Task Force across Syria. The US-led coalition was set up in 2014 to fight ISIL (ISIS). The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) announced a different death toll, saying: “Six of our fighters were martyred due to a terrorist attack” with a one-way drone, targeting a “training academy in the Al Omar oilfield”. The extending series of strikes illustrates the rising threat that Israel’s bombardment of Gaza risks provoking a regional escalation across the Middle East. That danger rose dramatically late last month when a drone hit a US base in Jordan, killing three soldiers and wounding more than 40. Washington blamed the attack on Iran-backed forces and promised retaliation, which came over the weekend. The US military hit Tehran-backed groups in Iraq and Syria on Friday and Saturday. US and UK forces unleashed attacks against 36 Houthi targets in Yemen on Sunday. The US military’s Central Command (CENTCOM) said its forces “conducted a strike in self-defense against a Houthi … land attack cruise missile” and later hit “four anti-ship cruise missiles, all of which were prepared to launch against ships in the Red Sea”.

The Pentagon has insisted that it does not want a war with Iran. However, officials say that further military action is planned. White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told national TV on Sunday that Friday’s strikes were “the beginning, not the end, of our response, and there will be more steps – some seen, some perhaps unseen”. “I would not describe it as some open-ended military campaign,” he added. But when asked whether Washington would rule out the possibility of striking Iran directly, Sullivan said, “It would not be wise for me to talk about what we’re ruling in and ruling out.” In response, Iran said on Monday that it “will not hesitate” to respond if the US directly attacks its territory. Iran “has shown that it has always reacted decisively to any threat to its security, territorial integrity and sovereignty,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani said. He added that Tehran “will not hesitate to use its capabilities” to respond to any attacks but reiterated that it “does not seek to aggravate tensions and crises in the region”.    So far, Iran has avoided any direct role in the Gaza conflict and its overspill, despite its affiliation with groups that are at odds with the US. The Iran-backed Houthis, who have been attacking ships in the Red Sea for several months, in solidarity, they assert, with Palestinians in Gaza, said on Sunday that the US and UK strikes would not defeat them. “These attacks will not deter us from our … stance in support of the steadfast Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip,” said Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree on social media. The strikes “will not pass without response and punishment”, he added."
Shapps 'disappointed' by Netanyahu opposition to Palestinian state,Israel’s Netanyahu doubles down on opposition to Palestinian statehood,0.5225952373705713,2024-01-21,2024-01-21,"Creating two separate states is the only solution to ending the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, the defence secretary has said.Grant Shapps said it was ""disappointing"" that Israel's prime minister has rejected the idea. Benjamin Netanyahu's position was not ""a surprise"", he told the BBC.But Mr Shapps said Palestinians ""deserved"" a sovereign state, adding ""I really don't see that there is another solution"".Following a call with US President Joe Biden on Saturday, Mr Netanyahu's office released a statement saying he had ""reiterated his policy that after Hamas is destroyed Israel must retain security control over Gaza to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel, a requirement that contradicts the demand for Palestinian sovereignty"". Mr Shapps said the comments were ""very disappointing"". ""It's not in some senses a surprise - he's spent his entire political career against a two-state solution. But the point is, which other route is there to seriously resolve this?"" he told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme. ""Palestinians deserve a sovereign state, Israel deserves to have the full ability to defend itself, its own security.""Unless you pursue a two-state solution, I really don't see that there is another solution.""He added there were a variety of views within the Israeli government ""so we very much distinguish between the views of individuals and our overall support for Israel as a country"". Labour has also described Mr Netanyahu's comments as ""completely unacceptable"". Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper told Sky News: ""Statehood of a people is not in the gift of its neighbour, it is the right of a people and it is the right of the Palestinian people.""Mr Netanyahu's remarks appeared to deepen a public divide with the US.  Speaking to reporters after the call between the two leaders, Mr Biden insisted a two-state solution was still possible with Mr Netanyahu in office.""There are a number of types of two-state solutions. There's a number of countries that are members of the UN that... don't have their own militaries,"" he said.Hamas killed about 1,200 people and took 240 hostages in its surprise attack on southern Israel on 7 October. In response, Israel launched airstrikes and a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip.  According to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, more than 25,000 people have been killed in the territory since the start of the conflict. Also appearing on the programme, Scotland's First Minister Humza Yousaf, whose parents-in-law were trapped in Gaza for more than three weeks in the early stages of the war, repeated his call for an immediate ceasefire. Asked if he thought people sometimes placed a different value on Palestinian lives, he said: ""Without a shadow of a doubt. If you talk to anybody who is Palestinian, you speak to many people in the Muslim community, they feel that the Palestinian blood is very cheap.""In his interview, Mr Shapps also said the UK needed to be prepared for ""a more dangerous world"".In a speech on Monday he warned of growing risks posed by countries including China, Russia, Iran and North Korea, as well as terrorist groups. However, asked when the government would hit its target of spending 2.5% of gross domestic product (GDP), a measure of the size of the economy, on defence, Mr Shapps said he could not give an exact date. He told the BBC the trajectory was ""already upwards"", with spending ""comfortably above 2%"", and that the target would be met ""when economic conditions allow"". It comes after former head of the British Army Gen Lord Dannatt warned the UK risked a repeat of the 1930s, when the ""woeful state"" of its armed forces failed to deter Hitler, unless it invested more in its military.  Writing in the Times on Friday, he criticised the shrinking size of the Army and called for the government to commit to spending 3% of GDP on defence.Challenged over why the size of the Army was reducing if the threats to the UK were growing, Mr Shapps said: ""It's not the number of people alone that matters, it's the lethality, it's how capable our systems are of defence.""Correction 13th February: This article wrongly reported that about 1,300 people had been killed following the 7th October attack by Hamas. This was based on counting those who later died from their injuries in addition to the figure of more than 1,200. The article has been amended to now refer to about 1,200 deaths, a figure which includes those deaths and which Israel says is not final.","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeated his opposition to an independent Palestinian state, saying his country needed full security control over the Palestinian territories, rebuffing United States President Joe Biden’s stance on the issue. “I will not compromise on full Israeli security control over the entire area in the west of Jordan – and this is contrary to a Palestinian state,” Netanyahu posted on X late on Saturday night, doubling down his opposition to a Palestinian state a day after speaking to the US president, who has offered unconditional support to Israel in its war on Gaza Strip, in a phone call. Biden on Friday said he spoke with Netanyahu about possible solutions for the creation of an independent Palestinian state, suggesting one path could involve a non-militarised government. Biden’s call with Netanyahu was the first in nearly a month, the White House said. Asked if a two-state solution was “impossible” while Netanyahu was in office, Biden said, “No, it’s not.” But in a statement, the Israeli prime minister’s office said Netanyahu told Biden that “after Hamas is destroyed Israel must retain security control over Gaza to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel, a requirement that contradicts the demand for Palestinian sovereignty”. Netanyahu is under heat to appease members of his far-right ruling coalition by intensifying the war on the besieged Palestinian enclave, killing more than 165 people in the past 24 hours. Close to 25,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, have been killed in relentless bombardment since October 7. Heexpressed his oppositionto any Palestinian state multiple times since launching the war on Gaza deferring to the Biden administration’s stance on the issue. The UK said on Sunday that Netanyahu’s opposition to Palestinian sovereignty is “disappointing”. “I think it’s disappointing actually, to hear that from the Israeli prime minister,” said Defence Secretary Grant Shapps on the Sky News channel. Meanwhile, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Sunday said “the denial of the right to statehood for the Palestinian people” is “unacceptable”. “The right of the Palestinian people to build their own state must be recognized by all,” he posted on X. US-backed peace talks towards the so-called “two-state solution” that would see Israel existing side by side with a Palestinian state in Gaza, the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, collapsed a decade ago. On Thursday, US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said there was no way to solve Israel’s long-term security challenges and the short-term challenges of rebuilding Gaza without the establishment of a Palestinian state. Miller said Israel had an opportunity now as countries in the region were ready to give it security assurances.    Netanyahu says Israel must fight until it achieves “complete victory” and Hamas no longer poses a threat but has not outlined how this will be accomplished. Hamas has been governing Gaza since 2007 when Israel imposed a land, sea and air blockade on the enclave of 2.3 million people. But a member of Israel’s war cabinet, former army chief Gadi Eisenkot, has called a ceasefire the only way to secure the captives’ release, a comment that implied criticism of Israel’s current strategy. Critics have accused Netanyahu of preventing a cabinet-level debate about a post-war scenario for Gaza. They say he is stalling to prevent conflict within his coalition. Netanyahu’s office called the claim that he was unnecessarily prolonging the war “utter nonsense”. Israel launched itswar on Gazaafter the Hamas group’s unprecedented October 7 attacks that killed about 1,100 people, mostly civilians, in Israel and saw about 250 others taken captive. In a sign of the pressures Netanyahu’s government faces at home, thousands of Israelis protested in Tel Aviv on Saturday, calling for new elections, and others demonstrated outside the prime minister’s house, joining families of the more than 100 remaining captives held by Hamas and other fighters. They fear that Israel’s military activity further endangers captives’ lives."
Gaza war: Premature babies evacuated from al-Shifa hospital,Group of 28 premature Gaza babies evacuated to Egypt amid Israeli attacks,0.5215520345673661,2023-11-19,2023-11-20,"Thirty-one premature Palestinian babies have been evacuated from Gaza City's al-Shifa hospital, which the World Health Organization (WHO) has described as a ""death zone"".The babies have been taken to an Emirati hospital in the southern city of Rafah, close to the Egyptian border.Hundreds of people, including patients, left from al-Shifa on Saturday.The hospital - the territory's largest and most modern - is under the control of Israeli troops.They have been searching the complex for evidence that it served as headquarters of Hamas.On Saturday, hundreds of people, including some patients, evacuated the hospital, but some 300 critically ill people remained as well as 33 premature babies. A Red Crescent spokeswoman told the BBC that one baby then died on Friday evening and another on Saturday morning.On Sunday the 31 surviving babies were evacuated by the Red Crescent in coordination with the UN.World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the babies were ""very sick"", had been moved under ""extremely intense and high-risk security conditions"", and were now ""receiving urgent care in the neonatal intensive care unit"" in Rafah.Dr Mohammad Zaqout, general director of hospitals in the Gaza Strip, told AP some of the babies were dehydrated or had developed gastritis due to unsanitised water. Lack of medications had caused others to develop sepsis, and some had hypothermia as they could not be placed in incubators.The babies had been accompanied by six health workers and 10 staff family members, Dr Tedros said.Doctors at al-Shifa had previously said newborns had died after power for incubators was cut off due to a lack of fuel.Red Crescent spokeswoman Nebal Farsakh told the BBC that some of the premature babies' parents had been killed in Israeli air strikes. The BBC is not able to independently verify this.She said the surviving parents had been ordered to leave Gaza City - where al-Shifa hospital is located - before the babies' evacuation, and their current whereabouts were unknown.A Gaza health ministry Facebook page urged the babies' parents to rejoin their babies at the hospital in Rafah.Israel has not yet commented, though it previously said it would help evacuate babies to a ""safer hospital"".  The WHO was planning further missions to take the remaining patients and staff out of al-Shifa once safe passage guarantees had been secured, he said.Al-Shifa's hospital director Dr Muhammad Abu Salima has called on the WHO and the UN to help the medical teams and patients ""leave this desolated place"". He told BBC Arabic there were about 25 medical staff left at the hospital, but that without water and electricity they were unable to properly care for the hundreds of remaining patients.""The hospital, now, is a ghost house in the full sense of the word,"" he said. ""Corpses are spreading out in the emergency department, patients are screaming, the medical staff is quite helpless, while the army is walking freely around in the hospital,"" he said.Israel has said Hamas has a command centre under al-Shifa - a claim Hamas has denied - but has not yet provided substantial evidence of this. Later on Sunday the Israeli military released footage which it said showed a ""55m-long terror tunnel, 10m deep underneath the Shifa hospital"". The footage shows a tunnel leading to a door. The IDF said investigations were ""continuing to uncover the route of the tunnel"".Earlier this week, Israel military spokesman Lt Col Jonathan Conricus, said it could take weeks to fully search the medical complex.Hamas, classified as a terrorist organisation in many Western countries, attacked Israel on 7 October, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 240 hostage.Israel has launched a massive retaliatory operation - involving air and artillery strikes as well as ground troops - with the aim of eliminating Hamas.The Hamas-run health ministry says the death toll in Gaza since then has reached 12,300. More than 2,000 more are feared to be buried under rubble.","A group of 28premature babieshas been evacuated from al-Shifa Hospital in the besieged Gaza Strip and taken to Egypt for urgent treatment as Palestinian officials say Israeli forces have attacked another hospital in northern Gaza. The newborns had been patients at al-Shifa, Gaza’s largest medical facility, where several others had died after their incubators stopped working for a lack of fuel as medical services collapse during the Israeli military’s ground and air assault on Gaza City. The babies were transported on Sunday to Al-Helal L-Emirati Maternity Hospital in Rafah in southern Gaza, so their condition could be stabilised before making the trip to Egypt through the Rafah border crossing on Monday. “Three babies still remain at the Emirati hospital and continue to receive treatment,” a World Health Organization (WHO) spokesperson told the Reuters news agency. “All babies are fighting serious infections and continue needing health care.” Last week, Israeli forces seizedal-Shifa Hospital, the largest medical facility in Gaza, to search for what they said was a Hamas tunnel network and command centre built underneath the complex. Hamas has denied the allegations. During the Israeli operation, hundreds of patients, medical staff and displaced people left al-Shifa at the weekend and moved to the southern Gaza Strip. Since al-Shifa doctors have raised the alarm about the situation at the hospital for premature babies and the lack of clean water and medicines in the neonatal ward, eight infants have died, according to hospital officials. At another hospital in northern Gaza,at least 12 people were killedby artillery fire on Monday and dozens wounded, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said. The ministry said hundreds of people were trapped at the facility, which was encircled by Israeli tanks. Reporting from the hospital, journalist Anas al-Sharif described the scenes inside as “chaotic”. “There is an overwhelming state of panic among patients,” he told Al Jazeera. “Victims are piling up on the floor.” The WHO’s chief said the United Nations agency was “appalled” by the attack on the Indonesian Hospital. “Health workers and civilians should never have to be exposed to such horror, and especially while inside a hospital,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus wrote on X, formerly Twitter. .@WHOis appalled by an attack on the Indonesian Hospital in#Gaza, reportedly resulting in 12 deaths, including patients, and tens of injuries, including critical and life-threatening ones. Health workers and civilians should never have to be exposed to such horror, and… — Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (@DrTedros)November 20, 2023  Indonesia’s foreign minister condemned the attack on the hospital, which was built in 2016 and funded by Indonesia, and called it a “clear violation of international humanitarian laws”. “All countries, especially those that have close relations with Israel, must use all their influence and capabilities to urge Israel to stop its atrocities,” Retno Marsudi said. “We are very concerned about the fate of our colleagues and the fate of wounded and patients as well as [displaced] people who may have still [been] sheltering there. No ambulances can reach them, and we’re afraid the wounded will die,” said Nahed Abu Taaema, director of Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza. Like most hospitals and clinics in the northern half of the Gaza Strip, the Indonesian Hospital has largely ceased operations but is sheltering patients, staff and displaced people who have sought shelter at the site after Israel launched its assault on Gaza last month. As fighting continues between Israeli forces and Hamas in Gaza, US and Israeli officials said a Qatari-mediated deal to free some of the captives held in the Palestinian enclave and pause fighting temporarily to enable aid deliveries to stricken civilians was edging closer. About 240 hostages were taken during a deadly assault on southern Israel by Hamas on October 7. About 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed, according to Israeli tallies. After the attack, Israel promised to topple the armed group, which has governed Gaza since 2007, and it launched a devastating bombardment and ground offensive on Gaza. At least 13,000 Palestinians have been killed, including at least 5,500 children, according to Palestinian officials."

Gaza's borders have been closed since Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October.Rafah is expected to continue opening for limited time periods to let foreign nationals and injured civilians leave.The lists of those allowed to cross will be agreed between Egypt and Israel, with embassies from the relevant countries being informed in advance to ensure they can prepare to receive their citizens, Western officials say. The BBC understands there are about 7,000 dual nationals in Gaza. Speaking on Wednesday evening, US President Joe Biden said that thanks to ""concerted American leadership, safe passage for wounded Palestinians and foreign nationals has started"".American citizens were able to exit, he said, as part of the first group of ""probably more than 1,000"", adding that the process would continue over ""the coming days"".""We're working non-stop to get Americans out of Gaza as soon and as safely as possible,"" Mr Biden stressed.UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly earlier said the departure of the first of the estimated 200 Britons in the territory was ""a hugely important first step"".""We are working with Egyptian and Israeli authorities to ensure the crossing stays open so all British nationals can get to safety in the coming days,"" he wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.Israel has been bombarding Gaza for more than three weeks and has recently sent in ground forces in response to an unprecedented cross-border assault by Hamas gunmen in which 1,400 people were killed and 240 taken hostage. Gaza's health ministry says more than 8,700 people have been killed in the territory since then, while the UN says supplies of food, water, fuel and medicine are dangerously low because of a siege imposed by Israel.Ambulances were seen rushing to Rafah on Wednesday morning. At least two children were among the wounded - one with a bandaged stomach. After medical checks, they were carried away on stretchers.At least 76 had arrived in Egypt by the evening, according to a spokesperson for the Palestinian border authority and an Egyptian official.""Hospitals in the Gaza Strip are treating large numbers of injured people while suffering from a lack of medical supplies. Therefore [they] cannot operate on such cases,"" Nassem Hasan, a medic working with Gaza's health ministry, told Reuters news agency. ""Now they are being transported to the Egyptian side, and will then be evaluated and might be relocated to another hospital.""Most of the patients will be taken to a field hospital built by Egyptian authorities in Sheikh Zuweid, 15km (9 miles) from Rafah. Others will go to permanent hospitals in the nearby town of El-Arish or the city of Ismailia.The director general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, welcomed Egypt's decision to accept medical evacuations. But he warned: ""Attention must not be diverted from the far greater needs of thousands of patients in Gaza, many of them extremely fragile who cannot be moved. ""We need an immediate acceleration in the flow of medical aid permitted into Gaza. Hospitals must be protected from bombardment and military use."" The WHO says more than a third of Gaza's hospitals are not functioning, while the rest are only partly working and are overwhelmed by casualties. Gaza's health ministry says more than 20,000 people have been injured.  The Palestinian border authority said 335 foreign and dual nationals had crossed by Wednesday evening.As well as the unspecified number of Britons, they included 31 Austrians, five French nationals, four Italians and some Americans. MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res said 22 of its international staff had successfully crossed.  Egyptian state-run Al-Qahera News TV broadcast footage showing what it said was the first group getting off a coach, which included many women and young children. Mohammed Ghalayini, a British scientist from Manchester who had been in Gaza visiting family when the war began, accompanied his uncle to the crossing after he was named by Gaza authorities on the list of potential evacuees.   ""People are really afraid of what's going on and so if they have a chance to leave, they're trying to leave,"" he told the BBC.    ""But getting to the border is a struggle as well, because fuel supplies are short,"" he added. ""So you know, I saw people arriving on a donkey cart with their luggage at the border.""Other British nationals hoping to cross in the coming days include the parents-in-law of Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf. He welcomed news that the border was opening up, but said his in-laws were trapped without clean drinking water and with rapidly diminishing supplies. Also on Wednesday, another an Israeli air strike destroyed several residential buildings in Jabalia, in northern Gaza, for the second day in a row.Video footage and photos showed a scene of devastation in the north-western Fallujah area, with hundreds of people searching for survivors underneath rubble and shattered buildings.The Hamas-run health ministry said dozens of people were killed or wounded in the attack.On Wednesday night, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) issued a statement saying its fighter jets ""struck a Hamas command and control complex"" in Jabalia. ""We can confirm that Hamas terrorists were eliminated in the strike,"" it added.""Hamas deliberately builds its terror infrastructure under, around and within civilian buildings, intentionally endangering Gazan civilians.""The IDF also said it had been urging residents of Jabalia and other parts of northern Gaza to evacuate ""to mitigate harm to civilians"", as tanks and troops continue to advance from a number of directions.On Tuesday, the IDF said a strike in the centre of Jabalia camp had killed a senior Hamas commander and ""a large number of terrorists"" inside ""underground terror infrastructure"" embedded beneath buildings. The infrastructure and buildings had collapsed as a result, it added.Gaza's health ministry said at least 50 people were killed and 150 wounded. But a nearby hospital said it received 400 casualties, including 120 dead.Hamas denied that the commander was dead but said seven of the hostages taken from Israel, including three foreign passport holders, were killed in the strike - a claim that could not be verified.In a brief statement on X on Wednesday, the UN human rights office warned: ""Given the high number of civilian casualties & the scale of destruction following Israeli air strikes on Jabalia refugee camp, we have serious concerns that these are disproportionate attacks that could amount to war crimes.""UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres's spokesman also said he was ""appalled over the escalating violence in Gaza"" and reiterated that all parties must abide by international humanitarian law, including the principles of distinction, proportionality, and precaution.","The Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt has opened for the first time since the Israel-Hamas war erupted. More than 500 foreign nationals and dual citizens will be allowed to leave the enclave, the Gaza Borders and Crossings Authority said in a statement verified by Al Jazeera’s Sanad Agency. The list of the people allowed to cross was published by the authority that called on them to head towards the crossing on Wednesday at 7am local time (05:00 GMT). According to earlier reports, dozens of injured Palestinians needing medical treatment in Egypt will also be allowed to leave the enclave. Convoys of desperately needed aid have been trickling in Gaza through Rafah since last month but no people had been allowed through the crossing until Wednesday. Queues formed on Wednesday morning at the terminal. After being allowed into the terminal area, huge queues formed around crossing booths for checks on passports and other documents. Ambulances waited on the Egyptian side to take away the wounded and sick. Al Jazeera’s Hatim Omar, reporting from the Rafah crossing, said ambulances were still waiting and nobody had been allowed to leave Gaza yet. Trucks carrying aid were also waiting on the Egyptian side of the crossing, he said. The zone around the terminal has been hit during Israeli air raids on Gaza after the October 7 attacks which Israeli authorities say killed more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians. Another 240 people were taken captive. Some of those being taken out for treatment in Egyptian hospitals are among more than 15,000 wounded in Israeli air raids, which Gaza’s Ministry of Health says have killed more than 8,500 people, two-thirds of them women and children."

His eight-year-old body is easily dragged from the road by a friend.The life of Adam al-Ghoul ended in Jenin on Wednesday with a shot to the head, as Israeli forces withdrew from a military operation in the refugee camp there.Nearby, his 14-year-old friend, Basel Abu al-Wafa was fighting for his life after being shot in the chest, with gunfire hitting the ground around him.At Jenin Hospital, both boys were declared dead.  The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that during ""activity in the Jenin camp, a number of suspects hurled explosive devices toward IDF soldiers"". ""The soldiers responded with live fire toward the suspects and hits were identified."" As Basel's body was prepared for burial in the crowded hospital morgue, a relative watched as the teenager was wrapped in the green flag of Hamas. It wasn't what Basel would have wanted, he told the BBC.""He's innocent, not from the militias,"" he said, teetering between anger and grief. ""He's perfect in school, a good boy, kind.""  The hospital director, Dr Wissam Bakr, said the boys' wounds - from shots to the head and chest - showed that they were intentionally killed. ""There's no safe place in Jenin now,"" he said.  The war in Gaza has increased tensions here in the West Bank, where there are near-nightly raids by Israel's forces.  In its operations in Jenin overnight, the IDF said it had killed a senior commander for Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Mohammed Zubeidi, and another called Wissam Hanoun who had been inside a building with him. It accused Zubeidi of involvement in two shootings in May in which an Israeli civilian was killed and several soldiers were wounded.Palestinian Islamic Jihad - which like Hamas is classed as a terrorist group by Israel, the UK and other Western powers - confirmed that two of its local commanders were killed.  The IDF also said it had arrested 17 wanted individuals during the raid.Israeli missiles, grenades and explosives have left a broad scar of destruction in Jenin's camp - several houses gutted or collapsed, and large chunks of masonry hanging over mounds of rubble.Diggers were helping search for a body still believed to be buried there.Militant leaders were the target here, killed along with boys of eight and 14.Before the Jenin raid, the UN said that at least 225 Palestinians, including more than 50 children, had been killed by Israeli forces in the West Bank since 7 October.Adam and Basel are the latest casualties of a conflict that keeps getting older, even as children die.","Two Palestinian boys were shot and killed by Israeli forces in Jenin, in the north of the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian Ministry of Health has said. As talks toextend the trucebetween Israel and Hamas continued on Wednesday before a looming deadline, the Israeli army raided theJenin refugee camp, causing widespread destruction and killing four Palestinians, including two children. Adam Samer al-Ghoul, 8, was shot in the head and Basil Suleiman Abu al-Wafa, 15, died after he was shot in the chest. The Israeli army forced residents of the ad-Damj neighbourhood to leave their homes at gunpoint and destroyed streets in the neighbourhood, Palestinian news agency Wafa reported citing security and local sources. The army also bombed a house using a drone, the report said.    In a joint statement to Israeli media, the Border Police, Israeli army and Shin Bet security agency said the army had killed two people reportedly involved in armed resistance, including a key leader. They were named as Muhammad Zubeidi and Hussam Hanoun. The statement acknowledged that two more people were killed amid clashes in the area. An Israeli army spokesperson did not immediately respond to Al Jazeera’s request for further comment. According to the statement, 17 Palestinians were arrested in the raid. CCTV footage circulating online shows a boy falling on a street in the camp after being hit by a bullet. Another video appears to show the other boy being hit on the street and calling for help as more bullets are fired on the ground around him. The older boy can be seen struggling on the ground in apparent agony for at least half a minute. Al Jazeera’s Charles Stratford, reporting from Jenin, said people were “shocked” at the scale of Israel’s latest raid on the refugee camp, which has been subject to several Israeli incursions since the war began. “They’re describing it as the largest raid since October 7,” Stratford said, referring to the start of the most recent Israel-Hamas war. “We spoke to the owner of a house that was destroyed. He said that it was about 5am [03:00 GMT] this morning when Israeli soldiers surrounded the house. He then became aware of potentially at least one Palestinian fighter – possibly two – hiding in his home,” he added. “What subsequently happened is that the Palestinian fighters were killed as the house was destroyed.” The Palestinian Red Crescent Society said Israeli forces blocked its medics from reaching the camp, “despite the presence of injured persons who need help and whose life is threatened”. 🚨Israeli occupation forces prevent PRCS paramedics 🚑from reaching a besieged neighbourhood in Jenin Refugee Camp, despite the presence of injured persons who need help and whose life is threatened.#Jenin#NotATarget#IHLpic.twitter.com/ATCVDmBKHD — PRCS (@PalestineRCS)November 29, 2023  Israeli army raids have taken place on a daily basis across the West Bank since the war began. According to the Palestinian Prisoner’s Society (PPS) and the Prisoners’ Affairs Authority, Israeli forces arrested 35 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank within the past 24 hours, including a 12-year-old.

Putin makes rare foreign trip to Gulf states,Putin makes rare trip to Middle East to meet with UAE and Saudi leaders,0.5114265496658924,2023-12-07,2023-12-06,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has made a rare trip abroad to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia.Expected discussion topics included the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, as well as oil production, with the UAE president. The UAE is currently hosting the COP28 UN climate summit. Mr Putin, who has barely left Russia since March when the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued him an arrest warrant, will also see Iran's leader on Thursday in Moscow. The ICC has accused him of illegally deporting Ukrainian children to Russia - a war crime - but neither the UAE nor Saudi Arabia recognise the court's jurisdiction. The Russian leader has snubbed other recent international summits including Brics in South Africa in August and the G20 summit in September in India. The trips come as Russia is keen to project influence and undermine the West's attempts to isolate it.Mr Putin was greeted in the UAE with a full cavalry escort and motorcade while a national aerobatics team drew the Russian flag in the sky with smoke trails.  Russia's leader told UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan that ""our relations have reached unprecedented levels"".Trade and oil will be on the agenda in the UAE, which a Kremlin statement said is ""Russia's main economic partner in the Arab world"".The Russian president later travelled to Saudi Arabia to meet the kingdom's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.During a brief televised sitdown chat Mr Putin invited the crown prince to visit Moscow. ""Nothing can prevent the development of our friendly relations,"" he said, adding that it was important ""to exchange information and assessments"" on current regional events.The crown prince said bilateral co-operation had ""helped remove many tensions in the Middle East"".  The controversial leader of Russia's Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov, was also spotted attending the meeting between Mr Putin and the de facto ruler of the Gulf state.Ahead of the meeting the Kremlin reported that the two leaders would ""consider ways to promote de-escalation"" in the conflict between Israel and Hamas and that conflicts in Syria, Yemen and Sudan would be discussed in the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Russian news agency Tass also reported that Russian government spokesman,  Dmitry Peskov, had confirmed that Mr Putin and the crown prince had discussed Opec+ cooperation.Kremlin officials have announced that Mr Putin will meet Iranian President Ibrahim Raisi on Thursday to discuss the war in Gaza.","Escorted by four fighter jets, Russian President Vladimir Putin has made a rare one-day lightning tour to the Middle East during which he visited Saudi Arabia after a short trip to the United Arab Emirates. Putin landed on Wednesday in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the UAE, which is hosting the United Nations COP28 climate talks. He was escorted to the presidential palace, where he was greeted with a 21-gun salute and a flyby of UAE military jets trailing smoke in the colours of the Russian flag. The Gulf nation’s President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan called Putin his “dear friend”. “I am happy to meet you again,” Sheikh Mohammed said. He later issued a statement saying they discussed “the importance of strengthening dialogue and cooperation to ensure stability and progress”. The Russian leader echoed those sentiments. “Our relations, largely due to your position, have reached an unprecedentedly high level,” Putin told Sheikh Mohammed. “The UAE is Russia’s main trading partner in the Arab world.”    The meeting was part of Russia’s quest to stake out a more influential role in the Middle East, with oil cooperation and the Israel-Hamas war on the agenda. The two leaders discussed, among other things, bilateral cooperation in the energy industry and advanced technologies, according to Russia’s state-owned TASS news agency. Putin then jetted off to Riyadh, where he met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud – their first face-to-face meeting since October 2019. In introductory remarks shown on Russian television, Putin thanked the crown prince for his invitation, saying he had originally expected MBS to visit Moscow, “but there were changes to plans”. Their next meeting should take place in Moscow, he said, adding: “Nothing can prevent the development of our friendly relations.” Putin’s meeting with the Saudi crown prince came after oil prices fell, despite a pledge by OPEC+, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) as well as allies led by Russia, to further reduce output. However, it was not immediately clear what Putin, who has rarely left Russia since the start of the Ukraine war, intended to raise specifically about oil or geopolitics with the crown prince of the world’s largest crude exporter. On Thursday, Putin will host the Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in Moscow. Following that, the UAE will welcome Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Friday and Saturday. Putin’s rare trip to the region is his first since July 2022, when he met Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in Iran. The Russian leader has made few international trips after the International Criminal Court (ICC)issued an arrest warrant for himin March, accusing him of deporting Ukrainian children. Neither the UAE nor Saudi Arabia have signed the ICC’s founding treaty, and are not obligated to arrest him if he enters their territories. On Israel’s two-month bombardment of the besieged Gaza Strip, Putin has decried the war as a failure of the United States diplomacy. He has suggested Moscow could instead play the role of a mediator due to its friendly ties with both Israel and the Palestinians. Putin’s Middle East trip is also a part of his efforts to demonstrate that Western attempts to isolate Moscow throughsanctions for its war on Ukrainehave failed. “He seems to be pretty delighted to be on the ground in Abu Dhabi,” said James Bays, Al Jazeera’s diplomatic editor. It is unclear how this visit will be seen in Washington, as the UAE also has close ties with the US, he added."
Israeli forces detain director of Gaza's al-Shifa Hospital,"Israeli army arrests al-Shifa Hospital director, other doctors in Gaza",0.5106132922445152,2023-11-23,2023-11-23,"Israeli forces have detained the director of Gaza City's al-Shifa Hospital for questioning, a week after their controversial raid there.Dr Mohammed Abu Salmiya was held at a checkpoint as he evacuated patients to the south, a colleague told the BBC.The Israeli military said he was being questioned over evidence that al-Shifa ""served as a Hamas command and control centre"". He and Hamas have denied that.Meanwhile, heavy fire was reported around another hospital in the north.A doctor at the Indonesian Hospital in Beit Lahia said Israeli troops had also ordered its full evacuation. The Israeli military said it was checking the reports.Israel launched a major military campaign in the Gaza Strip with the objective of destroying Hamas - which it classes as a terrorist organisation - in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October in which 1,200 people were killed and about 240 others taken hostage.Gaza's Hamas-run government says more than 14,500 people have been killed in the Palestinian territory since the Israeli air and ground strikes began, while the United Nations has warned of a humanitarian crisis. On Wednesday, Israel and Hamas agreed to exchange 50 of the hostages - all children and women - for a four-day pause in the fighting. Mediator Qatar says the truce will start at 07:00 local time (05:00 GMT) on Friday, with the first group of 13 hostages to be released at 16:00. About 250 patients and staff members are estimated to remain at al-Shifa, which is the biggest medical facility in Gaza but is no longer operational.On Wednesday, 190 wounded and sick people, their companions, and a number of medical teams were evacuated from the hospital in an ambulance convoy to the south, in co-ordination with the World Health Organization and other humanitarian agencies, according to the United Nations.The Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said in a statement overnight that the evacuation process lasted for almost 20 hours ""as the convoy was obstructed and subjected to careful inspection while passing through the checkpoint"" on Salah al-Din Road that separates northern and southern Gaza. ""Furthermore, three paramedics and a companion of a wounded person were detained. The latter and two paramedics were later released, while the third paramedic, colleague Awni Khattab, is still detained until this moment.""Neither the UN or PRCS mentioned Dr Abu Salmiya. But the head of orthopaedics at al-Shifa, Dr Adnan al-Bursh, told the BBC he had also been detained while accompanying the evacuated patients on Wednesday.On Thursday afternoon, the Israeli military confirmed that Dr Abu Salmiya had been taken for questioning by the Shin Bet internal security agency, ""following evidence showing that al-Shifa Hospital, under his direct management, served as a Hamas command and control centre"".""The Hamas terror tunnel network situated under the hospital also exploited electricity and resources taken from the hospital. In addition, Hamas stored numerous weapons inside the hospital and on the hospital grounds.""Furthermore, after the Hamas massacre on 7 October, Hamas terrorists sought refuge within the hospital, some of them taking hostages from Israel with them,"" it added, also alleging that a female soldier who had been taken hostage was murdered on the premises.Hamas has repeatedly denied that the hospital was used as a shelter by fighters, as have hospital staff and health ministry officials. Hamas has also claimed the soldier was killed in an Israeli air strike.On Wednesday, the Israeli military showed embedded journalists what it said was further evidence of a Hamas ""terror tunnel complex"" beneath al-Shifa.  A Reuters news agency reporter said he had accessed a reinforced underground tunnel through an outdoor shaft in the hospital's grounds. The tunnel led to a series of rooms, including a bathroom, kitchen and an air conditioned meeting room that the military said was used by Hamas commanders, he added.Hospitals are specifically protected under international humanitarian law. This protection extends to patients, as well as to medical staff and ambulances.However, hospitals can lose their protection if they are used by a party to the conflict to commit an ""act harmful to the enemy"". In a separate development on Thursday, a senior doctor and a health ministry official said Israeli troops had ordered the full evacuation of the Indonesian Hospital, outside which fighting has been raging in recent days.The Indonesian Hospital's medical director, Dr Marwan Sultan, told the BBC the situation inside was ""very difficult"", with ""heavy firing continuing around the hospital, from tanks, every 15 minutes"".""We cannot stay in rooms, as the windows are being hit,"" he said. ""We are staying in corridors in the hospital. My office was targeted several times.""   ""We are currently 10 medical professionals and 200 patients. No Israeli soldiers are currently inside the hospital, but we expect the same scenario as al-Shifa to happen unless the truce takes place,"" he added.""We asked Gaza's health ministry for three buses today to evacuate the Indonesian Hospital, and we asked also for 13 ambulances for patients who cannot be seated. They are liaising with the Red Cross."" The Israeli military said on Thursday morning that its troops were ""striking terror targets"" in the Jabalia area, which is just to the south of the hospital. On Monday, the health ministry said 12 patients and other civilians at the hospital had been killed by Israeli fire. The Israeli military said its troops had targeted ""terrorists"" who opened fire at them from inside the facility. Deadly Israeli strikes were also reported in the north of Gaza on Thursday, as well as in the southern city of Khan Younis.","The Israeli army has arrested the director of al-Shifa Hospital, the largest medical complex in the besieged Gaza Strip. Hospital director Muhammad Abu Salmiya was held for questioning following “evidence showing that Shifa Hospital, under his direct management, served as a Hamas command and control centre”, the Israeli military said in a statement on Thursday. Palestinian health officials confirmed the arrest and said another doctor and two nurses were also detained. Gaza’s ministry of health said it wants an explanation from the World Health Organization, as medics were travelling in a WHO convoy with patients when they were stopped and detained by Israeli forces. “The World Health Organization has not yet sent us any report to explain the situation including the numbers and names of those detained,” said Ashraf al-Qudra, a spokesperson for the health ministry. He said the ministry has decided to stop coordination with the WHO regarding evacuations until they send them a report explaining what happened. In a statement, Hamas said it “strongly denounces” the arrest of Salmiya and his colleagues, calling on the International Committee of the Red Cross and other international organisations to work towards their “immediate release”.     Days before the arrests, “two Palestinian paramedics had been arrested by the Israeli occupation forces”, said Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from southern Gaza on Thursday. “This gives a clear sign that there is no immunity inside the Gaza Strip, neither for medical workers, civil defence crews or even journalists, as the attacks have reached all classes in the Palestinian community.” Al-Shifa Hospital has been amajor focusof Israel’s ground offensive in northern Gaza. The army ordered anevacuationof the facility on Saturday, but the handful of staff remaining there say there are about 180 patients still inside. The Israeli army, which raided the hospital last week, allege that Hamas fighters used a tunnel complex beneath the facility in Gaza City to stage attacks. Hamas and hospital officials have repeatedly denied the claims. Meanwhile on Thursday, Munir al-Bursh, the director-general of Gaza’s Health Ministry, said the Israeli army gave people in the Indonesian Hospital just hours to evacuate the facility in northern Gaza. He said there are about 200 patients left at the hospital after some 450 patients were evacuated yesterday, and he told Al Jazeera that bombing continues from all sides in the vicinity. “This hospital is considered to be the main central hospital that is still operating in the north of the Gaza Strip, alongside another two central hospitals,” Al Jazeera’s Abu Azzoum said, adding that there are patients, medical workers and displaced people inside. “Both hospitals [al-Shifa and the Indonesian hospital] are witnessing a very serious and even critical condition as the Israeli troops are still encircling and even exerting significant control,” our correspondent said. On Wednesday, the UN’s humanitarian office said the Israeli army “obstructed” a convoy of ambulances transporting 190 wounded and sick patients from al-Shifa Hospital to the south, resulting in the journey taking almost 20 hours. The lengthy delay at the Israeli military checkpoint dividing north and south Gaza put “the lives of the wounded and sick people in danger”, according to the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS). The medical service has earlier said that 14 of its ambulances, two UN buses and other vehicles were involved in the evacuation of the patients, as well as “a number of medical teams” from al-Shifa Hospital. The PRCS said three paramedics and a companion of one of the wounded patients were detained for more than three hours in the cold, while the patients were transferred to hospitals in the south.   "
US drone attack: Three US troops killed in drone strike on US base in Middle East,"Three US service members killed in Jordan drone attack, Biden says",0.5095226420180822,2024-01-29,2024-01-28,"Three US troops have been killed and dozens injured in a drone attack on a US base near Jordan's border with Syria.US President Joe Biden said the attack was carried out by ""radical Iran-backed militant groups"". He added: ""We shall respond.""Iran has denied any involvement in the attack.It is the first time that a strike has killed US troops in the region since Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel.Jordan says the attack took place in Syria, not inside Jordan.There have been other attacks on US bases in the region, but before Sunday there were no fatalities, according to the US military.It is not clear who is behind this latest attack.President Biden said the US ""will hold all those responsible to account at a time and in a manner of our choosing"".Iran denied US and British accusations that it supported militant groups blamed for the strike.""These claims are made with specific political goals to reverse the realities of the region,"" foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said, according to Tehran's official IRNA news agency. The White House said Mr Biden was briefed Sunday morning on the attack by US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and other officials. ""Jill and I join the families and friends of our fallen - and Americans across the country - in grieving the loss of these warriors in this despicable and wholly unjust attack,"" Mr Biden said in a statement.The names of the servicemen killed and injured have not yet been released as officials work to notify their families.On a visit to South Carolina, Mr Biden said ""we had a tough day last night in the Middle East. We lost three brave souls"".US officials say at least 34 military personnel were being evaluated for possible traumatic brain injury, and that some of the injured soldiers were medically evacuated from the base for further treatment.They also say that the drone struck the living quarters, which, if confirmed, could explain the high number of casualties.US Central Command and President Biden said the attack was on a base in northeastern Jordan, near the Syrian border. It was later named by US officials as Tower 22.A Jordanian government spokesman, Muhannad Moubaideen, however, told state TV that the attack targeted al-Tanf base in Syria.In December, US officials said that US bases in Iraq and Syria had been attacked at least 97 times since 17 October. Last month, the US carried out airstrikes against Iran-affiliated groups after three US servicemembers were injured, one critically, in a drone attack on a base in northern Iraq.Earlier in January, one retaliatory US strike in Baghdad killed a militia leader accused of being behind attacks on US personnel. In a pre-recorded interview with ABC News that aired on Sunday morning, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen CQ Brown said that America's aim in the region is to ""not have the conflict broaden"".""The goal is to deter them and we don't want to go down a path of greater escalation that drives to a much broader conflict within the region.""US and coalition troops are also stationed in the Red Sea after the Iran-backed Houthis began attacking commercial ships in the region. The Yemen-based group says it is targeting vessels in the region in support of Palestinians in Gaza, where Israel is fighting Hamas.The US military has previously said ""these unlawful actions have nothing to do with the conflict in Gaza"".""The Houthis have fired indiscriminately into the Red Sea, targeting vessels impacting over 40 countries around the world,"" Centcom has said.Two Navy Seals are presumed dead after they went missing in January during an operation off the coast of Somalia to seize Iranian-made weapons bound for Houthis in Yemen. ","Three US service members have been killed and at least 34 others wounded in a drone attack in northeast Jordan near the Syrian border, the United States military has said. “While we are still gathering the facts of this attack, we know it was carried out by radical Iran-backed militant groups operating in Syria and Iraq,” President Joe Biden said in a statement on Sunday. He said the US “will hold all those responsible to account at a time and in a manner [of] our choosing”.  The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group of Iran-backed armed groups, claimed attacks targeting three bases, including one on the Jordan-Syria border. Jordan condemned on Sunday the “terrorist attack” on a military advance post just inside its border with Syria and said it was cooperating with Washington to secure its frontier. In the first official statement on the attack, US ally Jordan said it was working with Washington to “fight terrorism”. Earlier, Jordanian state television quoted Muhannad Mubaidin, a spokesperson for Jordan’s government, as saying the attack happened outside of the kingdom across the border in Syria. The deaths are the first for US troops in the Middle East since Israel’s war on Gaza began on October 7. The attack comes amid soaring tensions in the region, where Israel continues its war on Gaza in response to an attack by the Palestinian group Hamas in southern Israel that killed at least 1,139 people, according to Israeli authorities. Israel’s subsequent assault on Gaza has killed more than 26,400 people, according to Palestinian officials in the besieged territory. Fears have grown about the possibility of a regional conflagration amidattacks from Yemen’s Houthi rebelson Red Sea shipping and near-daily rounds ofcross-border fire between Israeland the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah. In recent weeks, Iran-backed armed groups haveintensified their attackson US military bases in Iraq and neighbouring Syria in response to the Israeli military campaign in the Gaza Strip. The Iran-backed groups have called their strikes as retaliation for Washington’s support for the Israeli war on Gaza and say they aim to push US forces out of the region. The US in recent months has struck targets in Iraq, Syria and Yemen to respond to attacks on American forces in the region and to deter Iranian-backed Houthi rebels from continuing to threaten commercial shipping in the Red Sea.    Reporting from Tehran, Al Jazeera’s Resul Serdar said there have been more than 100 attacks on US military installations in the Middle East since Israel launched its assault on Gaza. “Iran’s position so far … has been quite clear. They say that these attacks are not conducted and planned by Iran. They say that Iran has allies across the region. However, these allies also make decisions based on their own decisions,” he said. “Iranians do not want a regional escalation. The Iranian officials know a direct military confrontation with Israel also means a war with the US which could be a deadly one for Iran.” Colin Clarke, senior research fellow at the Soufan Group, told Al Jazeera that these attacks show that there was a “regional war”. “There is no denying that. US troops have been killed and the US will respond forcefully whether that is in Iran proper or against the Iranian proxies in the various countries where they operate,” he said. “Iran can choose to distance itself as much as it wants, but it funds, trains and equips these groups … The Biden administration will be under immense pressure to show the US is not going to sit back and watch its troops being killed by these Iranian-backed groups.” “The question now becomes what shape this response will take,” Clarke said."
Israel's Netanyahu condemns 'cruel' Hamas video of Israeli hostages,Hamas releases video of three Gaza hostages addressing Netanyahu,0.505146196229612,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has condemned as ""cruel propaganda"" a video released by Hamas showing Israeli hostages taken during the 7 October attacks. The clip, released on Monday, shows three Israeli women, one of whom berates Mr Netanyahu and calls for the release of the hostages.Hamas seized at least 230 hostages in the attacks and at least 1,400 Israelis were killed. Only four have so far been released. Israel has launched a massive military operation in Gaza, saying the aim is to destroy Hamas and its rule over the territory.The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 8,000 Palestinians have been killed.The video of the hostages was released by the armed wing of Hamas, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades.We do not know anything about the conditions under which it was filmed.Only one of the hostages addresses the camera throughout the clip.We will not publish the video. Prisoners of war and hostages are protected under international humanitarian law, and the BBC does not broadcast material which may have been filmed under duress.In a statement, Mr Netanyahu said: ""This is cruel psychological propaganda by Hamas-Isis [so-called Islamic State].""We are hugging the families. We will do everything to return all the kidnapped and missing people home.""He also named the hostages as Elena Trupanov, Danielle Aloni and Rimon Kirsht.""I hug you,"" Mr Netanyahu said.Ms Aloni's five-year-old daughter, as well as her sister and brother-in-law and their three-year-old twin daughters, was also kidnapped on 7 October. At a news conference on Monday, Ms Aloni's father said his heart had ""nearly stopped beating"" when he saw her picture. He called on the Emir of Qatar, who has served as a key mediator in the hostage talks, to ""make every possible effort to bring them home"".On 21 October, two weeks after the initial attacks, Hamas released two hostages, mother and daughter Judith and Natalie Raanan.The group said the pair, who have US-Israeli citizenship, were freed for ""humanitarian reasons"".Two days later, another two women, Nurit Cooper, 79, and Yocheved Lifschitz, 85, were also freed. Both are Israeli but were released into Egypt.Hamas said again that it had freed them on humanitarian and health grounds, but claimed Israel had refused to receive them. Both women's husbands are still being held.It is no accident that the only images of the hostages we have seen since their violent abduction have been of women.There is absolutely no doubt that the release of the footage is designed to play on the emotions of all Israelis in ways that are likely to make Mr Netanyahu's situation even harder.He is already under enormous pressure from the families of hostages to do more to release their loved ones. Two days ago, he said this was his second priority, after the need to destroy Hamas.In the video, Ms Aloni delivers a furious attack on Mr Netanyahu's alleged failure to protect civilians on 7 October.Even if it was uttered under conditions of extreme duress, it plays into an anguished debate in Israel about how the government and the military allowed any of this to happen.At a separate news conference on Monday, Mr Netanyahu said he felt the ""anguish"" of the hostages' families, but insisted that ground action represented the best chance of freeing them. ""Hamas will not do it unless they're under pressure. They simply will not do it. This creates pressure,"" he said. ","The Palestinian armed group Hamas has released a video that shows three hostages held in the besieged Gaza Strip, drawing condemnation from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The video was released on Monday by the armed wing of Hamas, theQassam Brigades. The women who appear in the video are likely to have done so under duress. Denouncing the video as “cruel psychological propaganda”, Netanyahu identified the three as Yelena Trupanob, Danielle Aloni and Rimon Kirsht. In the video clip, three women are sitting side by side against a bare wall. They have no visible signs of injury. One of the women delivers an angry message to the Israeli prime minister, accusing Netanyahu of failing to protect Israeli citizens when Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7. At least 1,400 people were killed in the attack, according to Israeli officials, and more than 230 others were taken as hostages. The women in the video called for an agreement to secure their release in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners. “You were supposed to free all of us. You committed to free us all. But instead, we are carrying your political, security, military, diplomatic failure,” she said. Reporting from occupied East Jerusalem, Al Jazeera’s Alan Fisher said some families of those held captive had reacted “quite positively” to the release of the video. “It runs just over a minute,” Fisher said. “The background is deliberately nondescript so that no place can be identified. The woman who addresses Netanyahu in particular with the quotes says that she blames him for the security, intelligence and military failure on October 7. “Some families have reacted quite positively to the release of the video. They understand how it came about, but they say that anything that essentially gives proof of life is to be welcomed and gives them encouragement.” In a statement, Netanyahu repeated a pledge to make every effort to bring the hostages home. “Abducted by Hamas, which is committing war crimes, I embrace you. Our hearts are with you and with the other captives. We are doing everything to bring home all the captives and the missing,” he said. The women’s families were due to give a news conference at 7pm (17:00 GMT). The short video is the second hostage message to be issued by Hamas, following an earlier clip of 21-year-old Franco-Israeli woman Mia Schem that was released on October 17. The presence of the hostages in Gaza has complicated the ground operation in the enclave begun by Israeli forces last week, following an intense campaign of air strikes that Palestinian authorities say has killed more than 8,000 people. Four hostages have been releasedso far, but efforts to secure additional releases through back-channel efforts coordinated by Qatar appear to have been put on hold following the start of the ground operation.

Israel-Hamas truce in Gaza extended as more hostages freed,"CIA, Mossad chiefs meet in Qatar as Israel-Hamas truce is extended",0.5039987973301249,2023-11-30,2023-11-28,"Israel and Hamas have agreed to extend their truce for another day, minutes before it was due to expire.The temporary ceasefire was extended for a seventh day, shortly before 05:00 GMT, following mediation with Qatar. The deal has led to the release of dozens of hostages kidnapped by Hamas in exchange for Palestinians held in prisons and aid deliveries into Gaza.On Wednesday night, 16 more hostages taken captive by Hamas were released, as were 30 Palestinians.So far, some 102 Israeli hostages have been freed, while 210 Palestinians prisoners have been released. About 140 Israelis remain in captivity. Israel's military said the temporary ceasefire was being extended ""in light of the mediators' efforts to continue the process of releasing the hostages and subject to the terms of the framework"".The prime minister's office subsequently confirmed the extension, saying it had received a new list of women and children hostages, though it did not specify how many names were on the list.Hamas said there was an agreement to ""extend the truce for a seventh day,"" without giving further details.The initial truce was due to last four days but has been extended twice. When the agreement was negotiated, Israel said the pause in fighting would be extended by one day for every 10 further hostages released. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the truce was ""producing results"" and should continue.""We have seen over the last week the very positive development of hostages coming home, being reunited with their families,"" he said at a meeting with Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Tel Aviv on Thursday. ""It's also enabled an increase in humanitarian assistance to go to innocent civilians in Gaza who need it desperately.""But on Wednesday Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, repeated earlier pledges to resume the war once the truce ends.""There is no way we are not going back to fighting until the end. This is my policy, the entire cabinet stands behind it, the entire government stands behind it, the soldiers stand behind it, the people stand behind it - this is exactly what we will do,"" he said in a statement on Wednesday.Before the extension was agreed, United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that the Gaza Strip was in the midst of an ""epic humanitarian catastrophe"".He welcomed the negotiations to prolong the truce but added that a ""true humanitarian ceasefire"" was needed. The UN estimates that more than 1.8 million people in Gaza have fled their homes over the past seven weeks. About 60% of them are sheltering in 156 facilities belonging to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa.Earlier this week, World Health Organization spokeswoman Dr Margaret Harris said an assessment of those shelters had found outbreaks of infectious diseases, with cases of diarrhoea among children aged five and older more than 100 times normal levels.The truce has allowed a temporary halt to Israeli air strikes that began after 7 October when Hamas launched a major cross-border attack in southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking hundreds hostage. Since then, Israel's air and ground operation into Gaza has killed about 15,000 people, 40% of which are children, according to health ministry officials in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip. Large parts in the north of the Strip have been demolished or seriously damaged.","The heads of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Israel’s Mossad have met in Qatar to discuss theextension of a trucebetween Israel and Hamas as well as the captives being held by the Palestinian group in Gaza. CIA Director William Burns and David Barnea, head of the Mossad intelligence service, held talks with Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani on Tuesday, a day after Doha announced atwo-day extensionof an originalfour-day humanitarian pausein Gaza that had been due to expire. “We have to read a little bit between the lines here: [The intelligence chiefs were] important in the last meeting, which was on November 9. We believe that was one of the stepping stones getting us to the initial four-day deal,” Al Jazeera’s diplomatic editor James Bays said. “The fact that we’ve got intelligence chiefs sitting here with the Qatari prime minister, who is also the foreign minister, is interesting because they’ve got the intelligence picture. But also I think it’s interesting partly because of who the US has got leading this effort,” he said, adding that Burns is “more experienced a negotiator than Antony Blinken”, the US secretary of state.    Israel and Hamas have accused each other of violating the original truce. But they have continued to swap captives for prisoners. Hamas has released captives in its custody, with another 12 freed on Tuesday. Our teams have successfully facilitated the release and transfer of 12 hostages held in Gaza. We have been able to carry out this operation thanks to our neutral intermediary role. — ICRC in Israel & OT (@ICRC_ilot)November 28, 2023  Majed al-Ansari, a spokesperson for Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in a post on X that 30 Palestinian prisoners are set to be released. On Monday, mediator Qatar said a humanitarian pause in fighting between Israel and Hamas would be extended by two days, hours before the initial four-day truce in Gaza was set to expire. Qatar, the US and Egypt have engaged in intensenegotiations to establish and prolong the trucein Gaza. Over the course of the initial pause, Hamas released 69 captives – 51 Israelis and 18 people of other nationalities. In exchange, 150Palestinian prisoners– 117 children and 33 women – held in Israeli prisons were released and more humanitarian aid was allowed into Gaza. The talks between the US and Israeli intelligence chiefs and Qatar were also attended by Egyptian officials. “Is there a way that they can try and deal with the central problem here of keeping this [current truce] going while Israel at the same time wants to remove Hamas?” Bays asked. “We don’t know anything from the information on the ground, but one possibility that some are suggesting is perhaps a deal could be done for the Hamas military leadership to be persuaded to go into exile in another country,” he said. “That’s certainly not what we’re hearing from Israeli media sources; the latest we’re hearing from them is that the Israeli government does not want an extension beyond 10 days in total, taking us until the end of Sunday,” according to Bays. Meanwhile, far-right Israeli Minister for National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to allow soldiers to return to fighting in Gaza to “crush Hamas” as he reacted to an army statement that three explosive devices were detonated in two locations near troops in northern Gaza. “We must not wait until our fighters are killed. We must once again act in accordance with the goal of the war: the total destruction of Hamas,” the minister posted on X.   "
Houthis defiant after warning over Red Sea attacks,US-led coalition warns Houthis of ‘consequences’ after Red Sea attacks,0.5039731705138467,2024-01-04,2024-01-03,"The US, UK and 10 other states have warned rebels in Yemen they will face consequences if they continue to attack commercial shipping in the Red Sea. In a joint statement, the group of mainly Western countries called for an immediate end to the attacks.However the Houthis have responded with defiance, vowing to continue targeting vessels they consider linked to Israel.The situation in the strategically vital southern Red Sea is now at a stand-off.The Bab al-Mandab strait is a critical waterway through which almost 15% of global trade passes. If attacks continue, the fear is that fuel prices will rise and supply chains will be damaged. Iranian-backed Houthi rebels have declared support for Hamas in the war it launched against Israel in October. Since November, the rebels have attacked commercial shipping in the Red Sea more than 20 times using missiles, drones, fast boats and helicopters. They have claimed - often falsely - the ships were linked to Israel. US and British warships in the region have intercepted some missiles but they have resisted attacking targets in Yemen itself. That may be about to change.In their statement, the group of 12 states - Australia, Bahrain, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, the UK and the US - called the attacks on shipping ""illegal, unacceptable, and profoundly destabilising"" and said there was ""no lawful justification for intentionally targeting civilian shipping and naval vessels"".Any armed response is likely to mean armed action against Houthi bases, boats and weapons.US, British and French warships in the Red Sea all have the capability to shoot down Houthi missiles and drones but it is getting expensive and they can't be sure to hit every single one, especially if the Houthis decide to launch a ""swarm"" attack - launching multiple drones and missiles at once, as Russia has been doing in Ukraine. Yemen may be the poorest Arab nation but the Houthis have a large stockpile of missiles and drones.The International Chamber of Shipping says 20% of the world's container ships are avoiding the Red Sea and steaming around southern Africa instead. In a debate at the UN Security Council on Wednesday evening, there was unanimous condemnation of the Houthi attacks but there were also warnings against further escalation. The US ambassador to the UN for management and reform, Chris Lu, said the attacks posed ""grave implications for maritime security, international shipping and commerce"". Iran's role, he added, was ""the root of the problem"". ""Iran has long enabled these attacks by the Houthis,"" he said.Iran has denied supporting the strikes. Despite this, it is unclear how it may respond if Western air strikes are launched against its Yemeni allies.The group comes from a sub-sect of the country's Shia Muslim minority, the Zaidis. They take their name from the movement's founder, Hussein al Houthi.They have been fighting a civil war since 2014 against Yemen's government and control both the capital Sana'a and the north of the country, as well as the Red Sea coastline. The government has been backed against the Houthis by a coalition of Arab countries led by Saudi Arabia and the UAE.","A group of countries led by the United States have warned Yemen’s Houthi rebels of “consequences” unless they stop their attacks on Red Sea shipping vessels. “Let our message now be clear: we call for the immediate end of these illegal attacks and release of unlawfully detained vessels and crews,” said the statement released by the White House on Wednesday. “The Houthis will bear the responsibility of the consequences should they continue to threaten lives, the global economy and free flow of commerce in the region’s critical waterways”. The United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Germany and Japan are among the 12 signatories. The only country in the Middle East to sign the statement was Bahrain, which has a strained relationship with Iran, which is aligned with the Houthis. The statement comes after several reports that US President Joe Biden’s administration is considering direct strikes on the rebels if the attacks continue. The Houthis have said that their attacks in the busy waterway are an act of solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza and that they are targeting ships with links to Israel. The US has sent an aircraft carrier, the USS Dwight D Eisenhower, to the area and earlier announced a coalition of countries to protect movement in the Red Sea, through which 12 percent of global trade passes.    Earlier on Wednesday, the Houthis claimed responsibility for a previous attack on a merchant vessel in the Red Sea. “The naval forces of the Yemeni armed forces carried out an operation targeting the ship CMA CGM TAGE which was travelling towards the ports of occupied Palestine,” the Houthis said on X. The French operator CMA CGM said that its container ship was unharmed and suffered “no incident”. A CMA CGM spokesperson said the ship was headed for Egypt. The Houthi attacks in recent weeks have mainly been concentrated on the Bab al-Mandeb Strait. On Tuesday, Danish shipping giant Maersk extended a suspension of services through the waterway and the Gulf of Aden, south Yemen, “until further notice”."
