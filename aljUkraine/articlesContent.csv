EU agrees $5.5bn boost for military aid to Ukraine,"The move provides a welcome boost for Kyiv as support from its other major backer, the US, wavers and its outgunned forces struggle to hold back Russia.","European Union countries have agreed to provide 5 billion euros ($5.48bn) for military aid to Ukraine as part of a revamp of an EU-run assistance fund, handing Kyiv a timely boost as its forcesstruggle against Russia’s invasion. Ambassadors from the EU’s 27 member countries agreed to the overhaul of the European Peace Facility (EPF) fund at a meeting in Brussels on Wednesday aftermonths of wrangling, with EU heavyweights France and Germany at the centre of much of the debate. “The message is clear: we will support Ukraine with whatever it takes to prevail,” EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell posted on social media platform X after the decision. The fund operates as a giant cashback scheme, giving EU members refunds for sending munitions to other countries. France, a strong promoter of European defence industries, had insisted on a strong “buy European” policy for arms eligible for refunds. Other countries argued that such a requirement would inhibit efforts to buy worldwide to get weapons to Ukraine quickly. Germany, by far Europe’s biggest bilateral donor of military aid to Ukraine, had demanded donations be taken into account in determining the size of countries’ financial contributions to the fund. Diplomats said compromise was eventually reached allowing flexibility on the “buy European” rules and taking into account part of the value of bilateral aid when calculating members’ financial contributions. “This is yet another powerful and timely demonstration of European unity and determination in achieving our common victory,” said Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. “We look forward to the final decision being approved at the next EU Foreign Affairs Council meeting.”    The final text said the scheme should give priority to the European defence industry while “exceptionally allowing for flexibility in cases where it cannot provide within a timeframe compatible with Ukrainian needs”. The compromise will allow the fund to help finance a Czech initiative to buy hundreds of thousands of desperately needed artillery shells from countries outside Europe, according to diplomats. The EPF has already been used to allocate some 6.1 billion euros ($6.7bn) to military aid for Ukraine, according to the EU. Borrell proposed creating a new cash pot last year specifically for aid to Kyiv – the Ukraine Assistance Fund – inside the EPF, with a budget of up to five billion euros per year for the next four years. That prompted a prolonged debate about rules for future aid, eventually leading to Wednesday’s agreement. The compromise included measures to satisfy Hungary, which has previously blocked payouts from the EPF and said it does not want its contributions to finance arms for Ukraine. Under the deal, its contributions will be used to fund military aid to other countries, according to EU officials. “Ukraine needs more arms and equipment, we will provide them in sufficient quantities and in a coordinated manner,” said Hadja Lahbib, the foreign minister of Belgium, the current holder of the EU’s rotating presidency. “Europe is true to its commitments. Our freedom is at stake.”    The announcement of the latest funds for Ukraine has come as Kyiv’s forces are under pressure along the front line in the face of ammunition shortages. The United States on Tuesday announced a new $300m weapons package for Ukraine, but a further $60bn in funding remains stalled by Republicans in Congress. Warnings have grown in Europe that a failure to keep up support for Kyiv could see it ultimately defeated and that an emboldened Kremlin might then attack other countries. The EU is pushing to bolster weapons and ammunition production by its defence industry, buttwo years into the war, it is still struggling to ramp up output. The bloc is set to fall well short of a promise it made a year ago to supply Ukraine with a million artillery shells by this month. Meanwhile, Russia has stepped up its arms production by putting its economy on a war footing and has received major deliveries of weapons from Iran and North Korea.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/13/eu-5bn-euro-boost-for-ukraine-military-aid-fund-russia
Nordic tensions on the rise amid Russian anger over NATO accessions,"Finland PM urges EU to step up defence spending and coordination, as tensions rise with Russia following NATO accession.","Signs of tension with Russia are rising in the Nordic region following Sweden and Norway’s accession to NATO. Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo on Wednesday warned that Moscow is gearing up for a “long conflict with the West” and Denmark revealed plans to boost defence spending, as Russia continued to condemn the expansion of the Western military alliance in the wake of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. In comments delivered to the European Parliament, Orpo called for increased spending and coordination on European defence. “Russia is evidently preparing for a long conflict with the West and represents a permanent and essential military threat to Europe,” the Finnish leader declared. “If we, as a united Europe, fail to respond sufficiently to this challenge, the coming years will be filled with danger and the looming threat of attack,” he said, before adding: “Russia is not invincible.” Orpo, whose country neighbours Russia, urged the 27-country European Union to step up defence spending and said the bloc had to take care of its own defence, insisting that its security cannot hinge on the outcome of the election in the United States. Republican contender Donald Trump suggested last month thatNATO guarantees could be weakenedshould he win back the White House in November’s vote. Meanwhile, Moscow has continued to hit out at the Western alliance’s expansion. President Vladimir Putin said in remarks published on Wednesday that Finland andSweden’s entry into NATOwas “a meaningless step”. Russia will deploy troops and systems of destruction to the border after Finland joins the alliance, he reiterated. Putin also warned the West on Wednesday thatRussia was technically ready for nuclear warand that if the US sent troops to Ukraine, it would be considered a significant escalation of the conflict.  Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula in 2014 served as a wake-up call for European countries, and saw NATO increase its minimum defence spending recommendation from less than 1.5 percent to 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). Many have been struggling to hit that threshold. However, Moscow’s continuing invasion of Ukraine is focusing minds, while weapons and ammunition handed to Kyiv have boosted spending. Denmark, one of NATO’s founding members, on Wednesday said it would raise its defence budget by $5.9bn over the next five years to boost its military capacity, pushing it past the spending target starting this year. “The total defence budget, including aid to Ukraine, will amount to 2.4 percent of Danish GDP this year and in 2025,” Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told reporters. The increased funding will be used both to boost Denmark’s military capacity and provide aid to Ukraine. It will also go towards an expansion of conscription, which will be extended from four to 11 months and will include women for the first time. Denmark already announced last year that it was tripling its military spending over the next 10 years. “We haven’t stopped investing in defence, but it’s still not enough,” Frederiksen said. “If we want to reach NATO’s target of being able to deploy a brigade of 6,000 soldiers as quickly as possible and to defend Denmark against air strikes, we have to modernise even more quickly,” she stated.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/13/finnish-leader-says-russia-is-preparing-for-long-conflict-with-the-west

"Three killed, 38 injured in Russian attack on Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih",Ten children are among those injured in the missile attack on apartment buildings as rescue teams search for survivors.,"A Russian missile has hit two apartment buildings in the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih, killing three people and injuring at least 38, with rescue teams sifting through rubble in a night-time search for survivors. Serhiy Lysak, governor of the Dnipropetrovsk region, put the provisional injury toll from the attack on Tuesday at 28 adults and 10 children. “Two buildings were hit, one five storeys, one nine storeys,” Lysak wrote on Telegram. “The number of injured is constantly rising as is the number of children injured.” Video of the scene showed a blaze that erupted at the top of one apartment block and rescue teams carrying the injured out of shattered building entrances. “The emergency services and residents who care are rescuing residents blocked in their apartments and are continuing to search for anyone who might be under the rubble,” Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko wrote. “Four people have already been rescued.” Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who was born and raised in Kryvyi Rih, said on Telegram that search operations “will continue as long as they are needed.” In his evening address, he said: “We will inflict losses on the Russian state in response – quite rightly. They in the Kremlin must learn that terror does not go unpunished for them.” The city of Kryvyi Rih has been frequently targeted by Russian forces throughout the conflict.

Anti-Putin paramilitaries claim incursion into Russia from Ukraine,Ukraine’s military intelligence says anti-Putin Russian volunteer militias are not acting under orders from Kyiv.,"Pro-Ukrainian militias have claimed multiple attacks on Russian border regions as Russia insisted it beat back the raids, staged three days before it holds a presidential election. Ukraine-based armed groups, made up of pro-Kyiv Russian volunteer fighters who oppose Russian President Vladimir Putin, said on Tuesday they had entered the Kursk and Belgorod regions. The cross-border raids, which Russia’s defence ministry said were thwarted, took place as Kyiv launched dozens of drones and rockets in Russia in its largest attack since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The Ukrainian attack set twooil refineriesin Russia ablaze. Ilya Ponomarev, a former member of the Russian Duma, now acting as political head of the Freedom of Russia Legion, said on Telegram that the raids had been carried out by his group in a “joint operation” with the Russian Volunteer Corps and the Siberian Battalion. The Legion claimed it was still clashing with Russian forces as of 1:15pm local time (10:15 GMT). It published a video from a drone purportedly showing a vehicle being blown up and fighters on the streets of the village of Tyotkino, on the border between Russia and Ukraine. However, Russia’s Ministry of Defence said its forces had repelled the last attack at 8:25am (05:25 GMT), saying troops had fought off multiple attacks by “Ukrainian terrorist groups” that had attempted to invade from three directions after alleged “intensive shelling” of civilian sites. “All the Ukrainian attacks were repelled. The enemy was hit by aircraft, rockets and artillery,” it said. Kursk Governor Roman Starovoyt said there had also been a shootout in his region, but a larger incursion had been thwarted. In the wake of the attacks, schools in the city of Kursk were switching to online classes, according to the TASS news agency. Another pro-Kyiv paramilitary group, the Russian Volunteer Corps, posted night-vision video on Tuesday purporting to show its troops engaged in a firefight. Ukraine-based militias have claimed to be behind previous incursions into Russian territory. Andriy Yusov, a spokesman for Ukraine’s military intelligence, said that the Russian volunteer groups were not acting under orders from Kyiv. But he added that the attacks showed “the Kremlin is once again not in control of the situation in Russia”. A spokesperson for the political wing of the Freedom of Russia Legion told the AFP news agency on Tuesday that the attack was timed to coincide with Russia’s March 15-17 presidential elections. “This is not an election at all. It is the next stage of a usurpation of power, the formation of Putin’s dictatorship under the guise of elections,” spokesman Alexei Baranovsky said. The cross-border attack came as Kyiv launched one of its most significant drone strikes on Russia of the two-year war. Moscow said it downed 25 Ukrainian drones over regions including Moscow, Leningrad, Belgorod, Kursk, Bryansk, Tula and Oryol. Waves of drone attacks continued through the day, the defence ministry said. Russian officials reported attacks on energy facilities, including a fire at Lukoil’s NORSI refinery and a drone destroyed on the outskirts of the town of Kirishi, home to Russia’s second-largest oil refinery. Gleb Nikitin, governor of the Nizhny Novgorod region, posted a picture of a fire truck beside the NORSI refinery and said emergency services were working to put out a blaze there. “A fuel and energy complex facility was attacked by unmanned aerial vehicles,” Nikitin said on Telegram. Industry sources told the Reuters news agency on condition of anonymity that the main crude distillation unit (AVT-6) at NORSI was damaged in the attack, which means that at least half of the refinery’s production is halted. Lukoil declined to comment.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/anti-putin-paramilitaries-claim-incursion-into-russia-from-ukraine
European Commission to recommend EU accession talks with Bosnia,Brussels is pushing to accelerate EU expansion in Western Balkans as it eyes growing Russian and Chinese influence.,"The European Commission is set to recommend that the European Union open accession talks with Bosnia and Herzegovina. President Ursula von der Leyen said on Tuesday that the EU’s executive arm will ask member states to open negotiations with Sarajevo, despite lingering ethnic divisions in the Western Balkan country, as the West eyes the growing influence of Russia and China in the region. Bosnia is among six Western Balkan nations – alongside Albania, Serbia, Kosovo (a semi-autonomous territory and self-declared republic), Montenegro and North Macedonia – that are at different stages of the EU accession process. Despite early efforts to bring the sextet into the bloc to try to help consign the region’s wars and crises in the 1990s to history, impatience has been growing, with progress stalled for years. However,Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and inroads being made by Moscow and Beijing in gaining influence, are helping to focus some minds in the West, pushing EU officials to accelerate the process. “We have realised that it is not enough to just wait for the Western Balkans to move closer to us,” von der Leyen told the European Parliament. “It is not enough to say that the door is open. We must also take responsibility, and support their path towards our union in any possible way.” EU leaders are expected to discuss the recommendation at a summit in Brussels next week. There is no guarantee that member states will endorse it asMilorad Dodik, a pro-Russian, separatist Bosnian Serb leader, continues to undermine the presidency and other political functions in the country. Bosnia has been riven byethnic divisions even decades after the warthat tore it apart in the 1990s. In December, Dodik said he intended to keep weakening the country to the point where it falls apart.    Bosnia was granted EU candidate status in 2022. To join the bloc, countries must go through a lengthy process to align laws and standards and show that their institutions and economies meet democratic norms. Von der Leyen admitted that Bosnia needs “more progress”, but insisted that it has made “impressive steps”. “More progress has been achieved in just over a year than in over a decade,” she said. “First, Bosnia and Herzegovina is now fully aligned with our foreign and security policy, which is crucial in these times of geopolitical turmoil.” She also praised the country for its efforts in fighting money laundering, the financing of terrorism and improving the control of migration flows. “The country is showing that it can deliver on the membership criteria, and on its citizens’ aspiration to be part of our family,” she said. “The message coming from Bosnia and Herzegovina is clear. So our message must be clear too. The future of Bosnia and Herzegovina lies in our union.” Bosnia is perhaps the most fragile of the Balkan countries. Ethnic tensions there have persisted long after the end of the 1992-95 interethnic war that killed more than 100,000 people and displaced millions.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/european-commission-to-recommend-eu-accession-talks-with-bosnia
Ukrainian drones and missiles strike Russian oil refineries,Ukraine continues to target Russia’s oil and gas infrastructure.,"Ukraine has launched a barrage of drone and missile strikes against Russia, igniting two oil refineries. The overnight attacks, some of which reached deep into Russian territory, hit refineries in towns hundreds of miles apart in the Nizhny Novgorod and Oryol regions. No casualties were reported, according to regional officials. In Kstovo, a town located 828km (514 miles) from the Ukraine border in Nizhny Novgorod, a fuel and energy complex, reportedly owned by Lukoil – Russia’s largest privately-owned company – was attacked by drones, according to regional Governor Gleb Nikitin. “The special services are working on the spot, using all the necessary force and means to localise the fire at one of the oil refining installations,” he said on the Telegram messaging app. A drone also smashed into a refinery in the town of Oryol, some 160km (99 miles) from the Ukraine border, according to Andrey Klychkov, governor of the Oryol region. An emergency services official quoted by Russian state news agency RIA Novosti said a tank containing petroleum products caught fire. At least 17 people from high-rise buildings near the site of the drone crash were reported to have been evacuated to a temporary accommodation centre. Ukraine and Russia have often used drones to strike critical infrastructure, military installations and troop concentrations in their more than two-yearwar. Kyiv has concentrated fire on Russian refineries and energy facilities in recent months. The latest overnight operation saw it launch at least 25 drones and seven missiles, targeting Moscow, Leningrad, Belgorod, Kursk, Bryansk, Tula and Oryol, Russia’s Ministry of Defence said. One drone flying towards Moscow was downed over the Ramensky district near the capital, said Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin on Telegram. Meanwhile, Russian forces bombed a five-storey residential building in the eastern city of Kupiansk in the Kharkiv region, according to Ukraine’s State Emergency Service, destroying it and causing several fires. The attack came after four people were injured in Russian attacks in Kharkiv on Monday, including a 70-year-old woman.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/ukrainian-drones-and-missiles-strike-russian-oil-refineries

"Russia, NATO at odds over pope’s call for Ukraine to show ‘white flag’",Moscow said the pope’s comment was ‘quite understandable’ while NATO said ‘it’s not the time to talk about surrender’.,"The Kremlin has said Pope Francis’s call for talks to end the war in Ukraine was “quite understandable”, while NATO’s secretary general said now was not the time to talk about “surrender”. Pope Francis said in an interview recorded last month that Ukraine should have “the courage of the white flag” to negotiate an end to awarthat is now in its third year. As Russia makes gains on the battlefield, the West grapples with how to support Ukraine and the prospect of a dramatic change in United States policy if Donald Trump wins November’s presidential election. “It is quite understandable that he [the pope] spoke in favour of negotiations,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday. He said RussianPresident Vladimir Putinhad repeatedly said his country was open to peace talks. “Unfortunately, both the statements of the pope and the repeated statements of other parties, including ours, have recently received absolutely harsh refusals,” he said.    Moscow’s offers to negotiate have invariably been predicated on Kyiv giving up the territory that Moscow has seized and declared to be part of Russia, amounting to more than a sixth of Ukraine. Peskov said Western hopes of inflicting a “strategic defeat” on Russia were “the deepest misconception”, adding: “The course of events, primarily on the battlefield, is the clearest evidence of this.” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said negotiations that would preserve Ukraine as a sovereign and independent nation would only come when Putin realised he would not win on the battlefield. “If we want a negotiated, peaceful, lasting solution, the way to get there is to provide military support to Ukraine,” he told the Reuters news agency at NATO headquarters in Brussels. Asked if this meant now was not the time to talk about a white flag, he said: “It’s not the time to talk about surrender by the Ukrainians. That will be a tragedy for the Ukrainians.” “It will also be dangerous for all of us. Because then the lesson learned in Moscow is that when they use military force, when they kill thousands of people, when they invade another country, they get what they want,” he said. On Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dismissed Pope Francis’s call for talks with Russia as “virtual mediation” from a distance. In his nightly video address, Zelenskyy did not directly refer to Francis or his remarks, but said the pope’s ideas had nothing to do with efforts by religious figures in Ukraine to help the country. “They support us with prayer, with their discussion and with deeds. This is indeed what a church with the people is,” Zelenskyy said. “Not 2,500km [1,550 miles] away, somewhere, virtual mediation between someone who wants to live and someone who wants to destroy you.” Zelenskyy, who signed a decree in 2022 ruling out talks with Putin, said last week that Russia will not be invited to a peace summit due to be held in Switzerland.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/11/kremlin-nato-at-odds-over-popes-call-for-ukraine-to-show-white-flag
Hungary’s Orban claims Trump said he won’t ‘give a penny’ to Ukraine,PM Viktor Orban tells Hungarian state broadcaster that Trump has a ‘clear vision’ after meeting former US president in Florida.,"Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban says former US President Donald Trump has told him that he would “not give a penny” to the war in Ukraine. Orban related the comments by Trump, who is running in November’s presidential election, during an interview with state broadcaster M1 late on Sunday after he travelled to Florida to meet Trump. “He has a very clear vision, which is hard not to agree with. He says the following: First of all, he will not give a penny in the Ukraine-Russia war,” Orban said in the interview. There was no immediate response from Trump’s team on these comments from Orban. Orban often calls for a ceasefire and peace talks in theRussia-Ukraine war, which recently entered its third year. He also arguesTrumpis best qualified to end the conflict, having expressed hope for his return to power.    “That is why the war will end because it is obvious that Ukraine cannot stand on its own feet. … If the Americans do not give money, the Europeans alone will not be able to finance this war. And then the war is over,” he said. A statement from Trump’s campaign did not mention Ukraine but said the pair on Friday discussed issues affecting both nations, including their respective border security. Orban angered fellow European Union leaders by meeting Russian PresidentVladimir Putinin October and has maintained ties with the Kremlin since Russia invaded Ukraine. He has also spoken out against Western sanctions on Moscow. US President Joe Biden criticised the Trump-Orban meeting, saying the Hungarian leader was “looking for dictatorship”. European leaders have long been nervous that another Trump presidency would mean waning US support for both Ukraine and NATO.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/11/hungarys-orban-claims-trump-said-he-wont-give-a-penny-to-ukraine
Oppenheimer reigns supreme: Five takeaways from the 96th annual Oscars,"Christopher Nolan satisfies the Oscars’ cravings for meaty biopics, while protests for Gaza appear on the red carpet.","It was an explosive night at the96th annual Academy Awards, with the biopic Oppenheimer running away with themost trophies— and protesters taking advantage of the spotlight to call attention to the deadly conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine. Outside the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, California, traffic snarled to a standstill as demonstrators called for a ceasefire in Gaza, the Palestinian enclave that has been subject to a five-month-long Israeli military offensive. Inside the auditorium, actors and artists also used their wins to call for peace, drawing on themes presented in the various nominated films. With 13 nominations, the biopic Oppenheimer was the frontrunner going into the night’s ceremony. And it made good on early predictions about its Oscar success, with seven wins in major categories. Here are the night’s biggest takeaways. With its blistering portrayal of J Robert Oppenheimer, the so-called father of the atomic bomb, the film Oppenheimer started the night slowly but quickly built momentum, grabbing some of the ceremony’s biggest prizes. Robert Downey Jr scored the first win of the night with his much-expected Best Supporting Actor trophy. But his co-star Cillian Murphy faced tight competition in the Best Actor category — but he still made off with the golden statuette, prevailing over other leading men like Paul Giamatti. The film also delivered a long-awaited win in the Best Director category for Christopher Nolan, whose relationship with the Academy Awards stretches back over two decades. Nolan was first nominated for an Academy Award in 2002 for the memory-loss mystery Memento, but while his films have earned major prizes at the Oscars, Nolan himself had consistently come up empty-handed. That changed, however, with Sunday’s ceremony. Not only did Nolan grab Best Director, but his wife, producer Emma Thomas, took the stage with him to receive the Best Picture honour, the most-coveted trophy of the night. One of the final categories of the night was Best Actress — and the auditorium at the Dolby Theatre held its collective breath while the presenters unveiled the winner. The race was one of the tightest of the evening, but Lily Gladstone was widely believed to be the frontrunner, on the cusp of delivering a history-making win for her role in Killers of the Flower Moon. Never before had a Native American woman won the category, much less been nominated. Gladstone, a member of the Nez Perce and Blackfeet nations, played the role of Mollie Kyle, a real-life Osage woman who loses close family in a 1920s killing spree known as theOsage Reign of Terror. It was a quietly stunning performance, with Gladstone exuding steady intelligence in every scene. But in a surprise twist, she lost the Best Actress category to another top contender, Emma Stone, who delivered a zany, off-kilter performance in the surreal comedy Poor Things. With Gladstone’s loss, Killers of the Flower Moon was entirely shut out of the Oscar race, despite 10 nominations. Poor Things, meanwhile, picked up four wins, largely in technical categories like Best Production Design and Best Makeup and Hairstyling. On stage and off, however, world eventsdominated the conversation. Outside the Dolby Theatre, groups like the Los Angeles branch of Jewish Voice for Peace held up placards and chanted for a ceasefire in Gaza, blocking several lanes of traffic. Among the protesters was SAG-AFTRA Members for a Ceasefire, a group of working actors. The demonstrators said they sought to ensure that Israel’s assault on thesouthern Gaza city of Rafahwas not ignored, even amid the glitz and glamour of the evening. More than30,000 Palestinianshave been killed so far in Israel’s military offensive, which has prompted concerns over the risk ofgenocideandfamine. On the Oscar red carpet, appeals for peace in Gaza continued, with celebrities like singer Billie Eilish and Poor Things star Ramy Youssef sporting “Artists4Ceasefire” pins to raise awareness about the unfolding humanitarian crisis. “I think it’s a universal message of just: Let’s stop killing kids,” Youssef told the magazine Variety. “Let’s not be part of more war.” The director of the chilling Holocaust drama The Zone of Interest likewise lent his voice to the cause, while accepting his Oscar for Best International Feature. “Right now, we stand here as men who refute their Jewishness and the Holocaust being hijacked by an occupation that has led to conflict for so many innocent people, whether the victims of October 7 in Israel or the ongoing attack on Gaza,” he said to applause. The war in Gaza was not the only international conflict to grab the Oscar spotlight. With a win in the Best Documentary Feature category, the film 20 Days in Mariupol renewed attention about the ongoingRussian invasionof Ukraine. It has been more thantwo yearssince Russia launched its full-scale military assault in February 2022. With his documentary, filmmaker Mstyslav Chernov captured the early days of that war, as the southeastern city ofMariupolfaced Russian bombs. Chernov’s win in the category was historic. He explained from the Oscar stage that he was bringing home Ukraine’s first Oscar but that he would trade it all for peace in his homeland. “Probably, I’m the first director on this stage who will say: I wish I had never made this film. I wish to be able to exchange this to Russia never attacking Ukraine, never occupying our cities,” he said with deep emotion as he faced the crowd. “But I cannot change the history. I cannot change the past,” he continued, appealing to the filmmakers in the audience to continue to shine a light on Ukraine. “We can make sure the history record is set straight and that the truth will prevail, and that the people of Mariupol and those who have given their lives will never be forgotten. Because cinema forms memories and memories form history.” Currently, the US Congress is struggling topass aidto Ukraine, amid Republicanoppositionto the funding. The political divides in the US — and thepresidential electionlooming in November — also briefly coloured the night’s events. The Oscars delivered its usual mash-up of spectacle and glamour. In one of the night’s highlights, Canadian actor Ryan Gosling took to the stage for a live performance of his Barbie-themed power ballad I’m Just Ken, dressed in a sparkly pink suit and backed by cowboy-hatted dancers. In another eye-popping moment, actor and wrestler John Cena appeared naked on stage to present the Best Costume prize. But four-time Oscar host Jimmy Kimmel couldn’t resist sprinkling a little political humour into the night’s movie-themed zingers. He first took a shot at Katie Britt, a US senator from Alabama who recently delivered the rebuttal to President Joe Biden’sState of the Unionspeech. Kimmel compared Britt to the Frankenstein-like heroine of Poor Things, brought to life by Oscar-winner Stone. “Emma played an adult woman with the brain of a child, like the lady that gave the rebuttal to the State of the Union on Thursday night,” Kimmel quipped. Then, before the night closed, Kimmel reappeared on stage to read a mean social media post directed at him. Its author? Former US PresidentDonald Trump, a frequent target of Kimmel’s comedy. “Has there ever been a worse host than Jimmy Kimmel at The Oscars?” Kimmel said, reading from his phone screen. Looking up, he addressed the former president, who facesfour criminal indictments, directly: “Thanks for watching. Isn’t it past your jail time?”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/11/oppenheimer-reigns-supreme-five-takeaways-from-the-96th-academy-awards

Ukraine rejects pope’s call to ‘raise the white flag’ to end Russia’s war,"The Catholic leader, 87, told a Swiss broadcaster that Ukraine should negotiate with Russia and raised the idea of surrender.","Ukraine has rejected Pope Francis’s call to hold negotiations with Russia more than two years into its invasion, saying that Kyiv will “never” surrender. “Our flag is a yellow and blue one. This is the flag by which we live, die, and prevail. We shall never raise any other flags,” Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on social media Sunday, a day after the pope said Kyiv should “have the courage to raise the white flag”. The 87-year-old Catholic leader said in an interview with Swiss broadcaster RTS that Ukraine should negotiate with Russia, which has seized large swathes of Ukrainian territory since it launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. In part of the interview released on Saturday, the Catholic leader raised the prospect of surrender. “I believe that the strongest are those who see the situation, think about the people, and have the courage to raise the white flag and negotiate,” Pope Francis said in an interview that the Vatican said was conducted in early February. Kuleba called on the pope to stand “on the side of good” and not put the opposing sides “on the same footing and call it ‘negotiations'”. The strongest is the one who, in the battle between good and evil, stands on the side of good rather than attempting to put them on the same footing and call it “negotiations”. At the same time, when it comes to the white flag, we know this Vatican's strategy from the first half… — Dmytro Kuleba (@DmytroKuleba)March 10, 2024  Kuleba also appeared to reference some Catholic church collaboration with Nazi forces during World War II when he said the following: “At the same time, when it comes to the white flag, we know this Vatican strategy from the first half of the 20th century.” “I urge to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past and to support Ukraine and its people in their just struggle for their lives,” Kuleba added. He also thanked Pope Francis for his “constant prayers for peace” and said Kyiv hoped he would visit Ukraine. “We continue to hope that after two years of devastating war in the heart of Europe, the Pontiff will find an opportunity to pay an Apostolic visit to Ukraine to support over a million Ukrainian Catholics, over five million Greek-Catholics and all Ukrainians,” Kuleba said. The foreign minister of Poland, a vocal ally of Kyiv, also condemned the pope’s remarks. “How about, for balance, encouraging Putin to have the courage to withdraw his army from Ukraine? Peace would immediately ensue without the need for negotiations,” Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said in a post on X. How about, for balance, encouraging Putin to have the courage to withdraw his army from Ukraine?Peace would immediately ensue without the need for negotiations.https://t.co/gWNYSUt79u — Radosław Sikorski 🇵🇱🇪🇺 (@sikorskiradek)March 10, 2024  In a separate post, Sikorski made parallels between those calling for negotiations while “denying [Ukraine] the means to defend itself” and European leaders’ “appeasement” of Adolf Hitler before World War II. Andrii Yurash, Ukraine’s ambassador to the Holy See, compared the pope’s comments to calls for “talking with Hitler” while raising “a white flag to satisfy him”. Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk, the head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, also said Sunday that surrender is not on the minds of Ukrainians. “Ukraine is wounded, but unconquered! Ukraine is exhausted, but it stands and will endure. Believe me, it never crosses anyone’s mind to surrender. Even where there is fighting today: listen to our people in Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Odesa, Kharkiv, Sumy,” he said. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni later clarified that the pope supported “a stop to hostilities [and] a truce achieved with the courage of negotiations”, rather than an outright Ukrainian surrender. While Pope Francis has tried to maintain the Vatican’s traditional diplomatic neutrality, he has also expressed some sympathy with the Russian rationale for invading Ukraine, such as when he noted that NATO was “barking at Russia’s door” with its eastward expansion. Ukraine has remained steadfast on not engaging directly with Russia on peace talks, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy saying multiple times that peace negotiations must come from the country that has been invaded.

Turkey offers to host Russia-Ukraine peace talks as Erdogan hosts Zelenskyy,"Erdogan pitches himself as go-between, Zelenskyy indicates Russia would not be invited to the first meeting.","Turkey is ready to host a summit between Ukraine and Russia to end the war, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after talks with his Ukrainian counterpartVolodymyr Zelenskyyin Istanbul.

Zelenskyy said the talks had been “sincere and fruitful”, though he refrained from alluding to the mooted peace summit in a statement released on X after the meeting.

Zelenskyy also thanked Erdogan for his efforts in negotiating the release of Ukrainian prisoners “held in Russian prisons and camps under extremely harsh and inhumane conditions”.

Turkey’s strategic location on the Black Sea and its control of the Bosphorus Strait gives it a unique military, political and economic role in the conflict. Shortly after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Turkey hosted failed ceasefire talks between Kyiv and Moscow. “Both sides have now reached the limit of what they can achieve through war,” Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said this month. “We think it’s time to start a dialogue towards a ceasefire.” In July 2022, Ankara with the United Nations brokered the Black Sea Grain deal, the most significant diplomatic agreement so far reached between Kyiv and Moscow. But Moscow ditched the initiative a year later, complaining that the terms were unfair. Kyiv has since used an alternative shipping route hugging the coastline to avoid contested international waters. The Erdogan-Zelenskyy meeting comes a week after Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov met his Turkish counterpart Fidan at a diplomatic forum in Antalya. Russian President Vladimir Putin was set to visit Turkey last month, but postponed the trip, according to Turkish and Russian media citing diplomatic sources.

Ukraine’s former commander-in-chief appointed ambassador to UK,"Zaluzhnyi, known as the ‘Iron General’, had seen his once sky-high popularity falter after a failed counteroffensive.","Ukraine has namedValerii Zaluzhnyiits new envoy to the United Kingdom a month after he was removed from his position as the country’s military commander-in-chief. “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine sent a request to the British side for an agreement,” the foreign ministry said in a statement on Thursday. Ukraine has not had an ambassador in the UK since President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dismissed former envoy Vadym Prystaiko in July 2023 after he publicly criticised the leader. Zaluzhnyi had led the Ukrainian army since the start of the war against Russia, pushing back a vastly more powerful invading force in the first months of the conflict. Dubbed the “Iron General” by Ukrainian media, Zaluzhnyi came to symbolise the country’s resistance and enjoyed sky-high approval ratings among the public. But the failure of a much-vaunted counteroffensive last summer and public disagreement with Zelenskyy tarnished his reputation in the president’s office. He was replaced in February by Oleksandr Syrskii, who commanded Ukraine’s lightning autumn 2022 counteroffensive in the northeastern Kharkiv region. At the time of Zaluzhnyi’s dismissal, Zelenskyy took to X to thank the military leader for his two years of service and said that the time had come for changes in the military leadership. Zaluzhnyi himself conceded that Ukraine’s military strategy “must change” after roughly two years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion. “The tasks of 2022 are different from those of 2024. Therefore, everyone must change and adapt to the new realities as well in order to win together,” he wrote. “The war does not remain the same. War changes and demands change. New approaches and new strategies are needed,” Ukraine’s Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said at the time of his dismissal. On Thursday, UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps visited Kyiv, Zelenskyy said on X. “Our primary focus was on bolstering Ukraine’s air defence and long-range capabilities, as well as meeting other urgent needs for weapons and ammunition and developing joint weapon production,” he said.

"Russia’s presidential election: Putin, power, the possibility of protests",The 71-year-old president is all but certain to win another term in a vote that begins on March 15.,"Russian PresidentVladimir Putinis all but certain to win his fifth election. But according to the 2020 constitutional amendment that “nullified” his previous terms, the March 15-17 election is going to be his “first”. Putin announced his candidacy in December during a choreographed ceremony in a lavishly decorated Kremlin hall when talking to a separatist “colonel” from the southeastern Ukrainian region of Donbas. “On behalf of all of our people, our Donbas, the lands that reunited [with Russia], I wanted to ask you to take part in this election,” Artyom Zhoga, clad in an impeccable uniform adorned with medals, told Putin. “I’m not going to hide it, I’ve had different thoughts at different times, but now is the time to make a decision, and I will run,” poker-faced Putin replied. He has served four. He was elected president in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, 2012, and 2018. If he wins, as expected, he will serve another six years, thanks to constitutional amendments that have expanded the term. This would mark his fifth term. He can then be re-elected again in 2030 for a sixth term. That means he could be in power until 2036, when he will be 83 years old. The 71-year-old ex-KGB spy is already Russia’s longest-serving leader since Soviet leader Josef Stalin. Putin’s increasingly iron-fisted treatment of opposition, critics and antiwar protesters has been widely compared with Stalin’s “big terror” campaigns. But to Kremlin loyalists, Putin is a political “genius” who prevented Russia’s disintegration, reigned in billionaire oligarchs and subdued Chechen separatists. Putin’s supporters also call him a “gatherer of Russian lands”, an honourable sobriquet for Russian princes and czars, for waging the 2008 war on ex-Soviet Georgia, recognising two breakaway Georgian statelets, annexing Crimea in 2014 and parts of four more Ukrainian regions in 2022. On February 16, Alexey Navalny, Putin’s most outspoken political opponent, died in an Arctic prison in what his family, supporters, and much of the international communityclaimed was political murder. Navalny was denied registration in the 2018 presidential election that Putin won with almost 78 percent of the vote. Two more opposition figures – Ilya Yashin and Vladimir Kaza-Murza – have been sentenced to eight-and-a-half years and 25 years in jail, respectively, for their criticism of Putin’s war in Ukraine. Thousands more – opposition figures, critics and average Russians who posted an antiwar comment online or simply liked or shared one – have faced criminal charges. Tens of thousands have been arrested, fined or forced out of the country. In addition, at least a million Russian men fled after the war, especially following the September 2022 announcement of “mobilisation”. “I’ve got nothing to do with this farce. They wanted me to die, they wanted my son to be an orphan,” Demyan, a 32-year-old web designer who fled to Georgia and then to southern Portugal in late 2022, told Al Jazeera. Authorities largely do not prevent their exodus. But they adopted a law allowing confiscation of their property for “criticising the special military operation”, the Kremlin’s preferred euphemism for the war in Ukraine. Some 79 percent of Russians intend to vote for Putin, according to a February survey by VTsIOM, a Kremlin-controlled pollster. Some everyday Russians await the vote with apathy and hopelessness after adapting to the wartime reality around them. “Everyone seems to have gotten used to the situation, gave up or sometimes even began to gain from it,” Mikhail, a freelance copywriter from a Moscow suburb, told Al Jazeera. “The shock has been replaced with apathy and depression.” This is the first vote in Russian history that lasts three days instead of one. It is also the first time voters in 29 regions can vote online. Some 112 million people aged 18 and above in Russia are eligible to vote. People in annexed Crimea and occupied parts of Ukraine will also vote, a move Kyiv and its Western allies have condemned as illegitimate. Millions of Russian nationals living abroad – from the Russia-leased spaceport of Baikonur in southern Kazakhstan to California in the United States – can also vote in embassies, consulates or by mail. At least 61 percent of Russians are “definitely” taking part in the vote, according to a poll by FOM, a Kremlin-funded pollster, released on March 5. Another 16 percent are “likely” to cast their ballots, and only 9 percent will abstain from the vote, the poll said. Initial results are expected to be announced on March 19, with the final outcome to be revealed on March 29. The officially-expected turnout is nearly as high as during the 2018 vote, when almost 68 percent of Russians cast their ballots, according to official figures. In 2018, independent election monitors documented thousands of cases of vote rigging, including ballot stuffing and “carousels”, when hundreds of voters are bussed to multiple polling stations. Some of the monitors faced threats and were denied access to polling stations.    The vote was “overly controlled” and “lacked genuine competition”, said the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, an international election observer. Authorities coerced government employees, servicemen and law enforcement officers to vote for Putin, it said. Observers who follow Russian politics have little hope the vote will be carried out in a free and fair manner. Putin is running as an independent candidate because the ruling United Russia party is widely seen as corrupt and inefficient. Late opposition leader Navalny dubbed it the “party of crooks and thieves”. Other candidates are seen as figureheads whose participation is only supposed to show how “popular” Putin is. One is Nikolay Kharitonov of the Communist Party. He took part in the 2004 vote and finished a distant second. Another is Leonid Slutsky of the nationalist Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR). He has been accused of sexually harassing a journalist. Slutsky called the accusations part of a “conspiracy” against him. Slutsky replaces Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a flamboyant populist who ran against Putin four times and was widely compared with former United States President Donald Trump, as the LDPR presidential nominee. He died in 2020. And while the Communist and LDPR candidates are relatively known, the third registered candidate, Vladislav Davankov of the New People party, is obscure and barely known outside Moscow. All three are part of the “systemic opposition”, a handful of parties with a presence in the State Duma, Russia’s lower house of parliament.    All three back the war in Ukraine and generally support the Kremlin party line. Between 2 percent and 4 percent of Russians are expected to vote for each of them, according to the VtsIOM poll. Liberal opposition candidate Boris Nadezhdin was denied registration because of allegedly “invalid” signatures of support in his candidate application. Nadezhdin, who openly criticised the war in Ukraine, said he would recruit independent election monitors and has promised to keep fighting against the Supreme Court rulings against him. But there is no chance he will be able to run. He told Al Jazeerain early February that he was excluded “because my election rating, the number of people who are ready to vote for me grows 5 percent a week”. In the winter of 2011-12, some of the largest opposition rallies in Russia’s post-Soviet victory took place after the parliamentary and presidential votes that were widely seen as rigged. The Kremlin responded with a massive crackdown. It now has more advanced tools to silence opposition – facial recognition software and mobile phone data to identify each protester. Any protests “will be disunited and badly organised”, said Sergey Biziyukin, an opposition activist from the western city of Ryazan who was forced out of Russia after trying to register for the 2018 presidential vote. “Most of the populace, irrespective of their attitude to Putin, the elections look staged,” he told Al Jazeera.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/7/russias-presidential-election-putin-power-the-possibility-of-protests
"FM Wang Yi insists China ‘force for peace’, defends Russian ties","Speaking at a rare news conference in Beijing, Wang Yi calls for peace talks  to bring two-year-old Ukraine conflict to an end.","China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi has said China sees itself as a “force for peace” in the world, even as it pursues deeper ties with Russia despite Moscow’s invasion of neighbouring Ukraine. “In the face of complex turmoil in the international environment, China will persist in being a force for peace, a force for stability, and a force for progress in the world,” Wang told reporters at a press conference in Beijing on Thursday, on the sidelines of the country’s annual meeting of its parliament. Wang, who spoke in Mandarin, was also asked about China’s relationship with Russia, which began itsfull-scale invasion of Ukrainein February 2022. The two countries announced a “no limits” partnership shortly before the invasion, as Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Beijing, and visiting Moscow last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping hailed a “new era” of cooperation. The foreign minister said Beijing and Moscow’s closer relationship was a “strategic choice”, noting that bilateral trade had reached a record $240bn in 2023. “New opportunities” lay ahead, he added, portraying the two countries’ ties as a “new paradigm” in the relations between big powers. “Major countries should not seek conflict and the Cold War should not be allowed to come back,” Wang said. China has positioned itself as a neutral party in the Ukraine war, and on the first anniversary of the conflict, released a12-point peace plancalling for a ceasefire and talks between the two parties. On Thursday, Wang insisted that Beijing maintained an “objective and impartial position” on Ukraine and called again for peace talks, noting that peace envoy Li Hui was currently in the region. “A conflict, when prolonged, tends to deteriorate and escalate and could lead to an even bigger crisis,” Wang said. During the wide-ranging discussion, which lasted for 90 minutes, 70-year-old Wang was also asked about issues including the conflict in Gaza, China’s relationship with the United States, and the disputed South China Sea. The veteran diplomat called Israel’s five-month-long war in Gaza and the world’s apparent inability to stop the bloodshed, a “tragedy for humanity and a disgrace for civilisation”. Israel sent its forces into the territory after Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2006, launched an assault on Israel on October 7, killing 1,139 people and kidnapping some 250 Israelis and foreigners. At least 30,717 Palestinians have been killed in the bombardments since amid a collapse in the health system and a growing risk ofstarvation. Hamas released some of the captives during a ceasefire in November but is thought to still be holding about 100 people. Urging the release of “all detainees”, Wang called for an immediate ceasefire and peace talks. “The calamity in Gaza is a wakeup call for the world,” he said. Talks brokered by Egypt, Qatar and the US to reach a six-week ceasefire ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan have so farfailed to achieve a breakthrough. Wang also reiterated China’s longstanding commitment to a two-state solution, saying it was the only way to achieve an end to the conflict. He also said China supported Palestine’s “full” membership of the United Nations. On relations with the US, which recovered some equilibrium late last year after the countries’ two presidentsmet in San Francisco, Wang struck a note of optimism even as he lashed out at Washington for sanctions that he said had reached a “bewildering level of unfathomable absurdity”. Noting the US and China were due to mark 45 years of formal bilateral ties this year, Wang said China wanted relations that were “stable and consistent” and that Washington could work with Beijing on the basis of “mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation.” The two sides have been at odds over a range of issues from Taiwan to trade and an alleged Chinese spy balloon that was shot down after crossing into the US last year. Wang reiterated China’s claim over Taiwan, a self-ruled island that Beijing maintains is part of its territory, and said those who sought independence would be “liquidated by history”. He also had sharp warnings over the disputed South China Sea where China, whichclaims almost the entire seadespite an international tribunal ruling it without merit, has been involved in multiple confrontations with the Philippines in recent months. In the latest incident on Tuesday, the Philippines said its boat wasdamagedby a Chinese coastguard ship that tried to block a resupply mission to the disputed Second Thomas Shoal, which lies about 200km (124 miles) from the western Philippine island of Palawan and more than 1,000km (621 miles) from China’s southern Hainan Island. Manila has moved closer to the USamid the growing tension in the strategic waters where China also deploys a maritime militia and its fishing fleet. Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam also claim the parts of the South China Sea around their coasts. “We resolutely oppose all acts of hegemony and bullying, and will strongly uphold national sovereignty and security as well as development interests,” Wang said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/7/fm-wang-yi-insists-china-force-for-peace-defends-russian-ties
Russia attacks Ukraine’s Odesa as Greek PM visits war-stricken city,"At least five people killed in attack, a navy spokesperson was quoted as saying by Ukrainska Pravda media outlet.","Several people have been killed in a Russian strike on Ukraine’s port city of Odesa, according to a spokesperson for Ukraine’s navy. The attack came as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was giving a tour of the war-ravaged city to Greece’s prime minister on Wednesday. Russia said it successfully attacked a hangar housing Ukrainian naval drones in a strike on the port. “The goal has been achieved. The target has been hit,” the Russian Defence Ministry said in a statement. Zelenskyy was showing Greek PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis around the destruction inthe city where 12 people – including five children – were killedin a drone attack on March 2 at the time of the Russian strike. “You see who we’re dealing with, they don’t care where to hit,”Zelenskyytold reporters following the attack on Wednesday. Mitsotakis said the delegations were getting into their cars when they heard the blast, which he said is a “vivid reminder” that the city is embroiled in war with Russia. It is one thing to hear about the war and “quite another to experience war firsthand”, Mitsotakis said.    At least five people were killed in the attack, a navy spokesperson was quoted as saying by the Ukrainska Pravda media outlet. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen condemned the “vile attack”, which she described in a post on X as a “new attempt at terror” by Russia. Over the course of the conflict, foreign leaders have made numerous trips to Ukraine, occasionally having to take refuge in shelters when air raid sirens sound. Russia has ramped up its attacks on port infrastructure since mid-July, when it quit a United Nations-brokered deal that allowed the safe passage of Ukrainian grain shipments via the Black Sea.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/6/ukraines-odesa-hit-in-attack-as-greek-pm-was-touring-war-stricken-city
Russia takes more ground in east Ukraine but loses another ship at sea,"Ukraine’s naval drones score another hit in the past week, but its troops continue to fall back in Donetsk.","Russian troops continued a relentless march in eastern Ukraine for a third straight week, giving defenders no respite since seizing Avdiivka on February 17. Geolocated footage on February 29 showed Russian troops had advanced 5km (3 miles) west of Avdiivka to the outskirts of Orlivka and Berdychi. The following day, they were in central Orlivka. By Monday, they were spotted close to a road that connects Orlivka to the village of Tonenke to its south. By the estimate of the Russian Ministry of Defence, it took Moscow’s forces four months to advance 9km (5.6 miles) through the Donetsk region before seizing Avdiivka. By that standard, 5km in three weeks – including 3km (nearly 2 miles) in the past week alone – was fast progress. It was a similar story west of Bakhmut, another city in Donetsk, which Russian forces captured in May. Ukrainian forces said on Sunday that they were fighting fierce battles to hold onto Ivanivske, a village 2km (1.2 miles) west of Bakhmut. Geolocated footage showed Russian troops making their way into the village centre that day. “Our military is heroically resisting and trying to repel the enemy from the occupied lines,” said Captain Ilya Yevlash, a spokesperson for the defenders in the area. A spokesperson for the Tavria group of forces fighting there said they were managing to build tank trenches, ramparts and bunkers but these were isolated, not contiguous. It may not have been a coincidence that Ukraine’s military on Sunday announced record spending on fortifications in the Zaporizhia region on the southern front. Russian troops claimed to have advanced marginally at many points along the battlefront in Donetsk. Another advance was confirmed in the village of Novomykhailivka. Geolocated footage published on Tuesday showed Russian forces in the fields south of the settlement “I don’t buy … that this is going to shift the course of the war,” retired US Colonel Seth Krummrich told Al Jazeera. “Show me the map. Show me what’s been achieved in two years. … I see maybe one-eighteenth [of Ukrainian territory] in Russian control at the cost of 250,000 to 500,000 casualties. I don’t see imminent victory by the Russians,” said Krummrich, now vice president of Global Guardian, a security consulting firm. Yet the situation was worrying enough to bring Ukraine’s newly installed commander-in-chief, Oleksandr Syrskii, to the eastern front for three days. On Friday, Syrskii revealed he had made command personnel changes and reinforced decision-making in some brigades around Avdiivka. “I have sent groups of specialists to individual brigades where there are problems … to transfer experience and provide assistance,” he said. “In some cases, when … the actions and commands directly pose a threat to the life and health of subordinates, I am forced to make personnel decisions.” There appear to be qualitative changes in Russia’s tactics that could spell trouble for Ukraine. The Russian assault on Bakhmut last year relied heavily on pardoned prison inmates who were thrown into battle in continuous waves with little training and suffered heavy casualties. A number of Ukrainian soldiers who fought in Avdiivka recently told The Washington Post that the Russian assaults were well-prepared and the units well-manned and mostly well-trained. They also said Russian artillery targeting was accurate and fast. Ukrainian fallback positions were being shelled soon after Ukrainian defenders reached them, and a column of retreating troops was decimated, they added. “It was … a convoy of the best men ever. And in front of our eyes, this convoy was destroyed by artillery,” one survivor said. Perhaps most worrying was Russia’s effective use of air support to drop satellite-guided glide bombs – inertial bombs fitted with flight surfaces to achieve greater range and accuracy. Ukraine’s air force has been taking out the Sukhoi-34 and Sukhoi-35 fighter-bombers that deliver those bombs in increasing numbers, including six Su-34s on February 28 and 29 alone. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Kyiv’s forces had shot down 15 Russian military planes from February 1 to Sunday, an unusually high number. Russia may have decided to accept higher losses for increased firepower on the ground. Forbes and The New York Times have reported that Russia was adopting more aggressive air tactics, conducting an increased rate of 100 or more sorties a day on the eastern front. Observers have blamed Republicans in the United States Congress for holding up aid to Ukraine as the biggest cause for Russian advances. “The collapse of Western aid to Ukraine would likely lead to the eventual collapse of Ukraine’s ability to hold off the Russian military and significant Russian advances further west, likely all the way to the western Ukrainian border with NATO member states,” wrote the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank. Zelenskyy warned on February 25 that Russian forces were planning a major new offensive as early as May. Russia’s war on Ukraine’s will to fight scored a direct hit on Friday when a Russian drone demolished a nine-storey apartment building in Odesa, killing at least 12 people. It was the deadliest attack of the past week and one of the worst this year. “The delay in the supply of weapons for Ukraine, air defence systems for the protection of our people leads, unfortunately, to such losses,” Zelenskyy said after the attack. Ukrainian air force spokesperson Yuri Ignat said on Tuesday that it was not possible to protect Odesa from all missiles and drones. “Odesa is … a densely populated city bordering the coast, large buildings, infrastructure. The location of air defence in the Odesa region is built in such a way that it is not always possible to intercept both drones and missiles on the approaches to the city itself,” Ignat said. Another drone struck Odesa on Wednesday as Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis met with Zelenskyy in the city. Ukraine’s air defences downed 36 of 43 drones that Russia launched from February 29 to Tuesday, but officials have warned that it could run out of missiles for its air defence batteries without further support. Maksym Timchenko, who runs Ukraine’s largest electricity utility, told the Financial Times that Ukraine was better prepared for Russia’s first drone onslaught on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure last winter, and that increasingly in recent weeks, drones were reaching their targets. Russia had targeted energy infrastructure no fewer than 160 times just this year, he said. The brightest spot for Ukraine during the week was its sinking of the Russian patrol ship Sergei Kotov near the Kerch Bridge off eastern Crimea early on Tuesday. Ukrainian military intelligence’s Group 13 launched Magura V naval drones, which Ukraine claims to be the fastest in the Black Sea. Military intelligence spokesman Andriy Yusov said the ship suffered five direct hits. The final pair of drones seemed to detonate inside the hull, which had been ripped open by previous explosions. Group 13 has undertaken previous special operations with naval drones, sometimes in cooperation with the Security Service of Ukraine, sinking or disabling from one-third to half of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/6/russia-takes-more-ground-in-east-ukraine-but-loses-another-ship-at-sea
ICC seeks arrest of Russian officers over infrastructure attacks in Ukraine,It is the second time the court has announced arrest warrants for Russian officials in relation to the war in Ukraine.,"The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for high-ranking Russian commanders Sergei Kobylash and Viktor Sokolov over alleged war crimes in Ukraine, it said in a statement. The ICC said on Tuesday that the pair were responsible for “missile strikes carried out by the forces under their command” against Ukrainian electric infrastructure from at least October 10, 2022, until at least March 9, 2023. “During this timeframe, there was an alleged campaign of strikes against numerous electric power plants and sub-stations, which were carried out by the Russian armed forces in multiple locations in Ukraine,” the court said. The warrants mark the second such warrants issued calling for the arrest of Russian officials related to thewar in Ukraine, a conflict which recently hit the two-year mark. In March last year, the ICC issuedarrest warrantsfor President Vladimir Putin and Children’s Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova on war crimes charges related to the abduction of Ukrainian children. The Kremlin has rejected the allegations. The ICC said the attacks led by Koblylash and Sokolov on Ukraine’s electrical grid caused civilian harm which was excessive when compared with any expected military advantage. Before the ICC’s announcement, Ukraine’s prosecutors were already investigating possible war crimes after a winter campaign of air raids on Ukrainian energy and utilities infrastructure. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy welcomed the ICC’s decision on Tuesday. “Every Russian commander who orders strikes against Ukrainian civilians and critical infrastructure must know that justice will be served. Every perpetrator of such crimes must know that they will be held accountable,” he said on social media platform X.    Russia has denied deliberately targeting civilian infrastructure in Ukraine, saying that its attacks are conducted to limit Kyiv’s ability to fight. The Geneva Conventions and additional protocols under international courts say that militaries should distinguish between “civilian objects and military objectives”, without attacking the former. However, some infrastructure owned and used by civilians can also be a military target, with some experts arguing civilian power plants or railways could fall into this category. As with Putin and Lvova-Belova, there is little prospect that either Kobylash or Sokolov will be turned over to face trial in The Hague. Russia is not a member of the court, does not recognise its jurisdiction and refuses to hand over suspects charged by the court.

Russia accuses Western ambassadors of meddling in internal affairs,"Moscow hit out at envoys claiming they refused to meet with foreign minister, as relations continue to deteriorate.","Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has accused Western ambassadors in Moscow of meddling in its internal affairs and questioned their function. The statement on Tuesday followed complaints from Moscow’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov the previous day that ambassadors from European Union countries had refused to meet him. The rebuke comes with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine having pushed relations with the West to their lowest ebb in decades. Lavrov said on March 4 that he had invited EU envoys for a conversation ahead of Russia’s March 15-17 presidential election but that they had refused.There was no immediate reaction from Western diplomats. However, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova revived the subject on Tuesday on Russian state television. “The question indeed arises among everyone: what are they doing, and why, how do they interpret their conduct on the territory of our country if they do not perform their most important function?” Zakharova declared to anchor Vladimir Solovyov. Solovyov noted that EU ambassadors attended the March 1funeral of opposition politician Alexei Navalny, whom he labelled their agent. Navalny, whose death at an Arctic prison colony was announced on February 16, always denied he was a Western agent.    Zakharova said such behaviour showed Western ambassadors in Moscow were meddling in Russia’s affairs and putting on “performances” rather than doing their diplomatic work. The banner headline on Solovyov’s television show read: “Should the EU ambassadors be sent out?” The West is grappling with what support it will give to Kyiv after Russian forces regained the initiative on the battlefield after a failed Ukrainian counteroffensive last year. Diplomatic relations between Russia and the West continue to deteriorate as the war grinds on. Last week, President Vladimir Putin reiterated his claim that Russia is fighting defensively against a Western proxy war that risks provoking nuclear conflict. Even at a petty level, agreement is scarce. Russian media last week published an audio recording of a meeting of senior German military officials discussing sending missiles to Ukraine. Reports said on Monday that Moscow hadsummonedGermany’s envoy over the issue, but Berlin said the meeting had long been scheduled. Ambassador Alexander Graf Lambsdorff was also scolded over attempts by Berlin to restrict the activities of Russian journalists in Germany, Zakharova claimed on Tuesday. “If they touch Russian correspondents and bring their plans to conclusion, German journalists will leave Russia,” she asserted.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/5/russia-says-western-ambassadors-are-meddling-in-russias-affairs
Russia spins German military leak but chances of escalation slim: Analysis,"Russia intercepted a call that revealed top-level talk on striking the Kerch Bridge. But analysts say while Berlin may be embarrassed, it’s far from planning an attack.","Russian propagandistsmade surethe German military’s most embarrassing leak in years would look like an episode of the 1941-1945 Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union. “Comrades in uniforms,” or Russian intelligence services, intercepted a 38-minute-long conversation between German Air Force chief Lieutenant-General Ingo Gerhartz with his officers, Margarita Simonyan, the head of the Kremlin-funded RT television network, wrote on social media on Friday. “The bridge in the east is hard to hit, it’s a rather small target, but [German-made] Taurus [missiles] can do it, can also hit the ammunition depots,” one of the officers told Gerhartz, according to the leak Simonyanpostedonline. The bridge in question, the Kerch Bridge, is a $4bn, 19km long (12 miles) lacework of steel and concrete that links Crimea to mainland Russia. To the Kremlin, the link is both geographic and metaphoric and epitomised the success of Crimea’s 2014 takeover from Ukraine that skyrocketed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s approval ratings and paved the way for the ongoing war. To Ukraine, the bridge’s destruction would mean the disruption of a key supply route and a symbolic blow to the Kremlin’s determination to win the war. And the Taurus missiles could help achieve just that. They are equipped with stealth technology that makes them hard to detect by Russian air defence systems. But the scandal will not result in Germany’s involvement in the war, observers say. “So far, this will only affect the improvement of the security system during such talks and the identification of methods the Russian intelligence services used to make the recording,” Nikolay Mitrokhin of Germany’s University of Bremen told Al Jazeera. And no matter how much the Kremlin spins the scandal, to Germans, it “isn’t changing that much”, said Andreas Umland, a German political scientist who works for the Swedish Institute of International Affairs. “It’s a big topic in Russia, but in Germany, it’s mainly a topic in terms of how this leak was possible and how the Russians were able to get this recording. The content is a secondary issue, actually,” Umland told Al Jazeera. German officials said the audio was intercepted from a call happening on Cisco’s WebEx platform that has security flaws allowing potential hackers to join conversations as “ghosts”. The leak makes German Chancellor Olaf Scholz look weak, said Umland. “The conversation is undermining the Scholz narrative that the Taurus missile can only be used with assistance from Germany, and that’s why Germany cannot give them over to Ukraine,” he said. It also makes Germany look careless and untrustworthy to its Western allies, says a former Russian diplomat. “This may decrease the coordination of Europe’s efforts, the Germans will be less trusted,” Boris Bondarev, who quit his job as a member of Russia’s delegation to the United Nations in Genevato protest the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, told Al Jazeera. “[Scholz] most likely will hide his head in the sand even deeper,” he said. “I hardly believe in Berlin’s determination.”  Kyiv has long been urging Berlin, Ukraine’s second-largest provider of military aid after Washington,to supply the missilesthat have a range of up to 500km (310 miles). With this range, the missiles could hit targets deep within Russia, but Berlin has adamantly refused to supply them as it is also worried that Russia could get hold of a missile or two to steal its stealth technology. But the officers in the leaked conversation discussed the possibility of providing Kyiv with the missiles – and training Ukrainian servicemen to operate them. The training “may take three or four months”, one of the Germans said in the leak that she claimed took place on February 19. “This part of training may take place in Germany.” They also mentioned “many people in civilian clothes that speak with an American accent”, making the open secret about the presence of US instructors in Ukraine even more open. Germany’s Ministry of Defence confirmed the conversation was indeed “intercepted”, but could not say “whether changes have been made to the recorded or written version that is circulating on social media”. “It’s part of an information war Putin is waging” against the West, German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said on Saturday. “It’s a hybrid attack aimed at disinformation. It’s about division. It’s about undermining our resolve,” he said. And when bristling at Berlin, propagandist Simonyan referred to its 1945 takeover by Soviet troops that was followed by the division of Germany into the pro-Soviet East and the capitalist West that ended only in 1990. “Is this a high time for Russia to actively remind Germany how the blowing-up of Russian bridges ended for Germany last time?” quipped Simonyan, who has been blacklisted in the West for backing the annexation and the war. Other Russian public figures eagerly followed her rhetoric. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said NATO was “caught red-handed”. “If nothing is done, and the German people do not stop this, then there will be dire consequences first and foremost for Germany itself,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. Her words touched a nerve. The USSR lost 27 million people during the war, and many residents of former Soviet republics still associate the term for German air forces, Luftwaffe, with the harrowing and indiscriminate bombing of Soviet cities (including those in today’s Ukraine). Scholz’s reluctance to send the troops – let alone advanced weapons – echoes the feeling of guilt towards the Soviet Union and Russia that generations of Germans have been raised with. “We will not send European soldiers to Ukraine. We don’t want a war between Russia and NATO. And we will do all we can to prevent it,” Scholz said on Saturday. He responded to the suggestion of French President Emmanuel Macron, who on February 26 said the possible deployment of NATO troops to Ukraine was not “ruled out”. When Scholz said that a thorough check should be conducted, Simonyan immediately responded with a sarcastic: “You can turn to us, we can help with the check.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/5/russia-spins-german-military-leak-but-chances-of-escalation-slim-analysis
"Russian Black Sea ship Sergey Kotov sunk after drone strike, says Ukraine",Kyiv’s military intelligence unit says it sank the patrol ship Sergey Kotov near the Crimean peninsula.,"Ukraine claims to have destroyed a Russian military patrol boat near the annexed Crimean peninsula. The country’s military intelligence unit, GUR, said on Tuesday that it had hit the Sergey Kotov with drones. It reported that the patrol ship had sunk, making it the latest victim in a series of attacks on Russia’s Black Sea Fleet. Posting on the Telegram messaging app, GUR said that the vessel was destroyed by special unit Group 13 near the Kerch Strait, which sits between Crimea and Russia. The military intelligence unit published a video on social media, claiming that the grainy footage depicted the ship being downed. 📽️ Як топили «сєрґєя котова» ― відео знищення патрульного корабля чф рф 🔗https://t.co/UNfZROKTBWpic.twitter.com/llI1MoWyDY — Defence intelligence of Ukraine (@DI_Ukraine)March 5, 2024  It was not the first timeUkrainehad attacked the ship, reportedly worth $65m. However, this time, the overnight strike caused critical “damage to the stern, starboard and port sides”. Military intelligence spokesman Andriy Yusov said the strike had left some dead and wounded, but it was likely some crew members had managed to evacuate. In an apparent reference to the attack, the Ukrainian president’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said on Telegram that Russia’s Black Sea Fleet – based in the peninsula’s port of Sevastopol – is “a symbol of the occupation,” adding that, “it cannot be in Ukraine’s Crimea”. There has been no official response from the Russian defence ministry. The Black Sea has become an increasingly important battleground of Russia’s two-year invasion. In recent months, Ukraine has mounted a series of attacks on the Black Sea Fleet, pushing Russia’s ships out of the western waters to help free up a key export route. In February, theCaesar Kunikovlanding ship was hit off the southern coast of Crimea. Later the same month the missile-armed corvetteIvanovetswas shown on Ukrainian military footage sinking stern-first below the waves. On land, the adversaries remain largely bogged down on the front line in eastern Ukraine and continue to swap cross-border air attacks, as well as clandestine operations targeting infrastructure. On Monday, Ukraine hinted that it was behind an attack on arailway bridgein the Russian region of Samara, with military intelligence boasting that the attack had “paralysed’ traffic in the area. On Tuesday, a military intelligence source in Kyiv told AFP that Ukraine had carried out an attack on an oil depot in the Belgorod border region setting storage tanks ablaze.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/5/ukraine-claims-another-critical-strike-on-russias-black-sea-fleet
"Medvedev says ‘Ukraine is definitely Russia’, rules out peace talks",The former Russian president says parts of Ukraine should ‘return home’ as he rules out peace talks with Zelenskyy.,"Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, says Ukraine is part of Russia as he rules out peace talks with the current Ukrainian leadership. In a bellicose speech on Monday at a youth festival in the southern city of Sochi, Medvedev saidRussiawould prosecute what it calls its “special military operation” until the other side capitulated. The former president and prime minister said what he called historical parts of Russia should “return home”. Medvedev spoke in front of a map of Ukraine, which showed the country as a much smaller landlocked slice of territory squeezed up against Poland with Russia in complete control of its east, south and Black Sea coast. “One of Ukraine’s former leaders said at some point that Ukraine is not Russia,” Medvedev said. “That concept needs to disappear forever. Ukraine is definitely Russia,” he said to applause from the audience. Medvedev said peace talks would not be possible with the current Ukrainian leadership, led by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He said any future Ukrainian government that wants talks would need to recognise what he called the new reality on the ground. Commenting on East-West relations, Medvedev, who accused US special forces and military advisers of waging war against Russia, said ties between Moscow and Washington were worse than during the1962 Cuban missile crisis. On Sunday, Medvedev joined a chorus of Kremlin voices accusing Western countries of participating in the war in Ukraine after awiretap recordingof German military officials was published on Russian social media. The discussion revolved around the potential impact of Ukraine’s use of German-made Taurus missiles. The conversation included remarks about aiming the missiles at targets such as the Kerch Bridge, which links the Russian mainland to occupied Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has so far refused to send the missiles to Ukraine, fearing it would escalate the conflict. In a Telegram post on Sunday, Medvedev criticised the German military and claimed the country was preparing to attack Russia.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/4/medvedev-says-ukraine-is-definitely-russia-rules-out-peace-talks
"Ukraine hints at responsibility for Samara, Russia bridge attack",Kyiv publishes pictures of the damaged bridge deep inside Russia that was used to transport weapons.,"Ukraine has hinted that it was behind an attack on a railway bridge in the Russian region of Samara. Kyiv’s military intelligence agency boasted on Monday that the explosion on the bridge had “paralysed’ traffic in the area. While attacks on infrastructure in Russia have become regular, it is rare for Kyiv to comment. “A railway bridge over the Chapaevka River in Russia’s Samara region was blown up. On 4 March 2024, at around 6:00 am (0200 GMT), the bridge was damaged by blowing up its support structures,” the Defence Intelligence of Ukraine said on messaging site Telegram. It included a photograph of the damaged bridge in itspost. Russia was using the railway line to transport ammunition from a plant in the town of Chapayevsk, about 1,000km (621 miles) from the Ukrainian border, military intelligence added. The post stopped short of directly claiming responsibility for the attack, but Ukrainian intelligence rarely comments on attacks in Russia. “Given the nature of the damage to the railway bridge, its use will be impossible for a long time,” the statement read. The incident was the latest in a string of explosions targeting Russia’s rail network, which Kyiv says Moscow uses to move troops and equipment being used for its invasion of Ukraine. Chapayevsk is home to JSC Polimer, a weapons manufacturer sanctioned by the United States in December. Russia’s railway operator announced earlier that “an intervention by non-authorised persons” had caused the incident but said no one had been injured. “Rail traffic is suspended for the moment at this section,” it added. “There are no deaths or injuries,” the Russian Federal Security Service in the Samara region told the state news agency Tass on Monday, with the area around the bridge cordoned off by security forces. Moscow was yet to comment on the Ukrainian statements. Claims on both sides are hard to verify in the war, which has now entered a third year, with the front line in eastern Ukraine largely bogged down in trench warfare. Illustrating Kyiv’s increased confidence regarding attacks on Russian territory, its military agency said in January that “unseen opponents of the Putin regime” had burned down a railroad, as well as facilities Russian troops allegedly use for logistics in the Russian cities of Saratov, Yaroslavl and Dzerzhinsk.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/4/ukraine-hints-at-russia-rail-bridge-target-in-rare-statement
Russia claims German military leak proves Western involvement in Ukraine,Kremlin says the wiretap shows the German military is discussing plans to strike Russian territory.,"A wiretap recording of German military officials published over the weekend proves Western countries were participating in the conflict in Ukraine, the Kremlin has claimed. The assertion was made by a spokesman on Monday, shortly after Moscow had reportedly summoned the German ambassador. The previous day, Berlin said that the release of the recording via social media was part of efforts to “destabilise” Germany. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the discussions among military officials of the potential use by Ukraine of German-made Taurus missiles to hit Russian targets, “once again highlight the direct involvement of the collective West in the conflict in Ukraine”. Russian state-run agency RIA Novosti published a video of Germany’s envoy Alexander Graf Lambsdorff arriving at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Moscow, declining to answer the questions of Russian journalists. “The German ambassador … was summoned in connection with the publicised conversation of German officers about Crimea,” RIA said. However, Berlin said that, contrary to reports by Russian state media, the envoy was not summoned. “Our ambassador went to a long-planned meeting in the Russian foreign ministry (on Monday) morning,” a foreign ministry spokesman said. The 38-minute recording of the discussion was posted late on Friday on Russian social media. Subsequently, a Foreign Ministry spokesperson demanded on social media “an explanation from Germany”. The officers were discussing the potential impact of the use of Taurus missiles. The conversation included aiming the missiles at targets such as the Kerch Bridge, which links the Russian mainland to Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. The audio leak came amid a debate in Germany over whether to supply the missiles. Ukraine is seeking a boost to its arsenal as ammunition stocksrun short, Ukraine has been seeing setbacks on the battlefield after two years of war, with military aid from the United States being held up in Congress and the EU struggling to source enough weapons to send. However, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has so far refused to send the missiles, fearing that it would lead to an escalation of the conflict.    Peskov sought to press home the Kremlin narrative that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was really a defensive action against a proxy war, led by the US. “The recording itself suggests that the Bundeswehr [German armed forces] is discussing substantively and specifically plans to strike Russian territory,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. The spokesman added that it was not clear whether the German armed forces were acting on their own initiative. On Monday, Germany confirmed the authenticity of the call, saying it is investigating what it called an apparent act of eavesdropping by Russia that was part of an “information war”. It accused Russia of leaking the discussions in an attempt to divide Europe. “This hybrid attack aimed to generate insecurity and divide us,” a government spokesman said. “And that is exactly what we will not allow. We are in constant contact with our partners.” The Kremlin has repeatedly denied accusations of spreading false or misleading information when faced with allegations from other countries. Meanwhile, German Chancellor Scholz reaffirmed his reluctance to send Taurus to Ukraine. “You cannot deliver a weapons system that has a very wide reach and then not think about how control over the weapons system can take place,” he said on Monday. “And if you want to have control and it’s only possible if German soldiers are involved, that’s out of the question for me.” His hesitancy is a source of friction within his three-party coalition, and of contention with Germany’s conservative opposition.     Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said said that while the German officers discussed scenarios to use Taurus missiles, that did not mean a green light had been granted to supply the weapons to Ukraine, Russian state media TASS reported on Monday. “I think the officers did what they are there for. They are thinking through different scenarios without planning anything in any way and leaving no doubt about it,” Pistorius told reporters. “Neither I nor the chancellor have given the green light for the use of Taurus.” He said it is “their job as leaders” to contemplate what scenarios were possible. Germany is among the NATO countries that have supplied weaponry to Ukraine, including tanks. Russia accuses what it calls the “collective West” of using Ukraine to wage a proxy war against it; NATO says it is helping Kyiv to defend itself against a war of aggression.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/4/russia-summons-german-ambassador-over-military-leak-russian-media
They fled Ukraine to the Netherlands. Why are they being expelled?,"Thousands of third-country nationals who fled Ukraine must leave the country this week, a court has ruled.","Thousands of third-country nationals who found refuge in the Netherlands after Russia’s February 24, 2022 invasion of Ukraine have been told to leave the country by Monday, though a four-week reprieve to exit the nation has given them a little extension. Many of those affected, mostly students and young workers from Ukraine, have been gathering in the streets of Amsterdam to protest in recent weeks, accusing the recently-elected far-right Dutch government of discrimination. The expulsion order came after a high court of the Netherlands ruled in January that a European Union policy that allowed both Ukrainian nationals and residents to settle in the country since the war would no longer apply to temporary residents. Those affected must exit the country by March 4 or risk forced deportation. Here’s why the Dutch government is asking this group to leave now and how lawyers are hoping to overturn the ruling: Like most of the European Union, the Netherlands initially opened up its borders to those fleeing Ukraine right at the start of the war, in March 2022. A Temporary Protection Directive (TPD) from the EU provided that Ukrainian refugees and permanent residents be offered refuge for two years until March 4, 2024, and that permits could be extended by the bloc as needed on a yearly basis. However, unlike several other EU members, the Netherlands did not assess individual cases to distinguish Ukrainian nationals from those with temporary permits, like the thousands of students – mostly from India, Nigeria, Morocco and Egypt – who lived and studied in Ukraine for years before the fighting. “The point was to alleviate the burden on the asylum system,” Lotte van Diepen of Everaert Advocaten, an immigration law firm, told Al Jazeera. In most other countries, authorities assessed if people were able to return safely meaning those with temporary permits were then either allowed to stay on or return to their countries, according to the strength of individual cases. The Netherlands’ approach, however, was more attractive. Thousands of third-country nationals trooped to Dutch cities and about 4,500 were registered in municipalities across the country. The government provided most people with accommodation in refugee centres, a stipend, healthcare access and work permits.  Early in 2023, the Dutch government announced it would end protection for third-country nationals, and informed them via multiple letters to leave their shelters and the country by September 4, 2023 – or be kicked out. Dutch authorities argued that third-country nationals who could safely go back home to their countries had “abused” the protection system. Minister of Migration Eric van der Burg said not taking action would “overburden” municipalities and promised 5,000 euros ($5,422) in “remigration” compensation for those willing to leave voluntarily. “We didn’t know what to do because those letters were very petrifying, very scary,” said Isaac Awodola, a Nigerian graduate of Odessa State University and co-founder of the Derdelanders group, which represents third-country nationals. “We had like six months to prepare to do whatever we wanted, [but] at that moment we were still traumatised,” he said. Some third-country nationals working with immigration lawyers like van Diepen sued the Dutch government, questioning if it could terminate protection for a group it had previously greenlit under the EU directive. Many of those cases were fast-tracked in the courts, while others were left pending. With the legal intervention, Migration Minister van der Burg was forced to suspend the September 4 deadline, granting thousands like Awodola temporary relief. Now, uncertainty looms again for the refugees. Many want to stay because they are still tied to Ukraine, Awodola said. There are those who need to return to recoup lost certificates, or those, like medical students, who need to stay close because, although their university studies are held online, they have to be physically present for practical exams – and flight costs from their countries are not cheap. “We are also human beings regardless of our background or where we come from, because the bombs and rockets that dropped on Ukraine did not ask for a passport,” Awodola added. “There should not be any segregation or separatism involved.” In several individual cases, including those filed by van Diepen who represents at least six people, district courts ruled that the authorities did not have the power to terminate the stay of third-country nationals without an explicit EU directive. However, other courts ruled that van der Burg could ask third-country nationals to leave, even without a European law saying so. Due to the split, appeals went up to the Council of State, the highest administrative court in the Netherlands. The court had to decide if the Dutch government had the authority to expel people protected under the EU directive. In October, the EU extended the temporary protection directive for a second time until March 4, 2025. On January 17, the council ruled that Dutch authorities don’t have such powers, and that the minister could not separate third-country nationals from Ukrainian nationals when everyone had been initially provided with blanket protection. If the directive applied to Ukrainian refugees, the court said, it should apply to third-country nationals, too. However, the court also said permits for third-country nationals would expire on March 4 – the initial, flexible expiry date the EU set at the start of the war. In its ruling, the court said the EU extension in October did not explicitly mention third-country nationals, and thus, protection no longer covered that group. It was a convenient win for the Dutch authorities, but shocking for third-country nationals and their lawyers. The court “went beyond [the] scope of the initial dispute brought before it,” van Diepen argued, referring to the original question around the powers of the Dutch government. “The consideration about the end date being 4 March 2024 … was not a topic of the debate in court. It was only an additional expression of opinion uttered by the court in the final judgement, not essential to the decision and therefore – we argue – not legally binding as a precedent.” The Council of State’s ruling cannot be appealed. The Dutch government has granted an extra 28 days for people to organise their exits and will let them keep their accommodation until the first week of April. State-covered amenities like stipends or healthcare have ceased though, and work permits are cancelled. After the grace period, people could be deported. Dutch authorities have asked third-country nationals who don’t feel safe returning to their homes to file for asylum, but most don’t fall under that category. About 2,700 to 2,900 of the original 4,500 who initially settled in the Netherlands still remain. “I don’t have a plan yet,” one person from Zimbabwe, who just graduated from their online Ukraine university, said of this week’s deadline. Awodola, the Nigerian, has vowed to keep protesting. Van Diepen and other lawyers are going back to lower district courts to argue in pending cases that the EU’s extension did not have to explicitly mention third-country nationals, since it protected them before. If the lower courts disagree, they can request the EU’s Court of Justice to intervene. A ruling from the bloc supersedes national law. Third-country nationals say Ukraine was home for them, too, and that they are affected by the war. In several instances, African and Asian students said they were refused exit from the war zones back in 2022 because they were not Ukrainian. But migration is a tense topic in a Netherlands that voted for thefar-right, anti-migration Party for Freedom– headed by politicianGeert Wilders– in November’s parliamentary elections. Some Dutch citizens say third-country nationals are diverting resources meant for Dutch people and Ukrainian refugees, and that the government has a right to cancel their stay. “We recognise their move was very generous in the first instance,” van Diepen said. “But the issue is, for those who were already allowed in, you can’t now turn around and say we don’t want you again. It’s an unjust decision with no legal basis.” Some of the lower court cases, the lawyer said, will be heard in the next few weeks. But time is fast running out for the thousands of third-country nationals who now have to pack up.

Death toll rises to 10 in Russian drone strike on Ukraine’s Odesa,"Three children killed in the attack, officials say, as Zelenskyy calls on the West to boost Ukraine’s air defences.","The death toll from a Russian drone strike that destroyed an apartment block in Ukraine’s southern port city of Odesa on Saturday has risen to 10. Ukraine’s interior ministry reported that rescue workers on Sunday morning retrieved the remains of an infant and the baby’s mother, raising the number of children killed in the attack to three. “The mother tried to cover the 8-month-old child with her own [body]. She tried to save them. They were found in a firm embrace,” the ministry said in a Telegram post. On Saturday, Ukrainian authorities reported that a baby was among those killed after falling debris from an Iranian-made Shahed drone hit the apartment building – one of eight Russian-launched drones reported by officials. Russia has launched several thousand of these long-range winged drones throughout the war at targets acrossUkraine. Later on Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that a second child had also died. “Tymofiy was 4 months old. Mark was about to turn 3 years old. My condolences to all of their close ones,” Zelenskyy wrote on X. He added that a three-year-old girl and seven other people were injured in the attack. Four more people may be trapped in the rubble in Odesa, the local branch of Ukraine’s main emergency service said in a Facebook update on Sunday. Local Governor Oleh Kiper said that rescue workers continue to comb through the site, and regional authorities announced a day of mourning for the victims. Elsewhere in Ukraine, regional authorities reported that a 58-year-old man died under rubble after Russian forces shelled his village in the southern Kherson province. Another civilian man, aged 38, was killed in a Russian artillery strike on the neighbouring Zaporizhia region, local Governor Ivan Fedorov said. Zelenskyy called on Western allies to boost Ukraine’s air defences in the wake of the deadly attack. “Delays in the delivery of weapons to Ukraine, as well as air defence to protect our people, unfortunately result in such losses. … Ukraine has never requested anything more than what is necessary to protect lives,” Zelenskyy said. Ukraine is currently struggling for resources as the war grinds into its third year with a $60bn aid package held up in the United States Congress.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/3/death-toll-rises-to-10-in-russian-drone-strike-on-ukraines-odesa
Seven killed in Russian drone attack on Ukraine’s Odesa apartment block,Separate attacks killed an additional three people in Ukraine as Zelenskyy urges the West to deliver more air defences.,"A Russian drone attack on an apartment block in the southern Ukrainian port city of Odesa has killed at least seven people, including a three-year-old and a woman with an infant child, regional authorities said. “Rescuers in Odesa have just uncovered the bodies of a mother with a three-month-old baby,” Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said in a post on the Telegram app on Saturday. At the scene, smoke poured from rubble strewn across the ground where the drone had ripped a chunk several storeys high out of the building. Clothes and furniture were scattered in the ruined mass of concrete and steel hanging off the side of the apartment block. Ukraine’s State Emergencies Service posted photos, including of a dead toddler being placed in a body bag by rescuers. “This is impossible to forget! This is impossible to forgive,” it wrote. It said five people including a child had been rescued alive. Odesa region governor Oleh Kiper said eight people were wounded, and rescuers were still looking for more people under the debris. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the drone was a Shahed supplied by Iran. Russia has launched several thousand of these long-range winged drones throughout the war at targets deep insideUkraine. Al Jazeera’s Rob McBride, reporting from Kyiv, said a total of 17 Shahed drones targeted Ukraine in the overnight attacks, with most of them intercepted by air defences. Separate shelling attacks on the front-line Kharkiv, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions killed three, Ukrainian officials have said. The spate of attacks led Zelenskyy to re-iterate his calls on the West to deliver more air defence systems. “We need more air defences from our partners. We need to strengthen the Ukrainian air shield to add more protection for our people from Russian terror. More air defence systems and more missiles for air defence systems save lives,” he said. Ukraine is currently on the back foot in the two-year war as a crucial $60bn aid package is held up in the US Congress. Ukraine also appears to have launched an attack of its own, with a drone striking a five-storey residential building in St Petersburg, Russia’s second city, on Saturday causing no casualties, according to Russia’s National Guard division. Videos on Russian social media showed what appeared to be a drone spiralling downwards into the building, triggering an explosion, blowing out windows and causing small fires. The city’s National Guard division said its preliminary assumption was the damage was caused by a “falling drone”. Ukrainian media reported that the drone was shot down by Russia’s air defences while targeting an oil depot around a kilometre from the crash site.

"After Macron touted troops to Ukraine, Putin warns West of nuclear war risk","The Russian president, in a state of the nation address, upped the ante on Thursday. Should the world be worried about his threat?","President Vladimir Putin hasthreatened to use nuclear weaponsif Western powers send soldiers to within striking distance of Russia. His comments on Thursday, in a state of the nation address, were the kind of remarks usually uttered by Dmitry Medvedev, a Putin ally who served as Russia’s president from 2008-2012 and prime minister until becoming a top security official in 2020. Throughout the conflict in Ukraine, Medvedev has warned of nuclear action and penned countless social media posts showering Western leaders and nations with slurs and threats. “Medvedev used to write posts about the riders of the apocalypse in the style of [US filmmaker Quentin] Tarantino, and Putin brought his threats back to the limits of sanity,” Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kushch told Al Jazeera. Putin has now upped the ante, responding to French President Emmanuel Macron’sassumptionon Monday that a deployment of European troops to Ukraine cannot be “ruled out”. Putin issued his threats during his annual national address – a carefully choreographed ceremony broadcast live to be chopped into soundbites and quotes that Russian media will likely repeat and comment on for days.    The West has “announced the possibility of sending Western military contingents to Ukraine,” Putin said on Thursday. “The consequences for possible interventionists will be way more tragic. “They should eventually realise that we also have weapons that can hit targets on their territory. Everything that the West comes up with creates the real threat of a conflict with the use of nuclear weapons, and thus the destruction of civilisation,” he said. Moscow has the world’s largest nuclear arsenal including a new generation of hypersonic missiles and several times more tactical nuclear weapons than the collective West. “Now it is Putin who clearly draws a red line about using the nukes,” Kushch said, adding that Macron had probed Putin’s reaction on when Moscow would be ready to launch the nukes. But to Boris Bondarev, a senior Russian diplomat who quit his job to protest against Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, there was “nothing new” in Putin’s menacing diatribe. The threats were Putin’s “usual scares and a projection of his own unrealised desires on to the West,” Bondarev, who served in the United Nations office in Geneva until 2022, told Al Jazeera. This was not the first time Moscow bared its teeth in a confrontation with the United States and Europe. Soviet helmsman Nikita Khrushchev banged his shoe on the podium in the United Nations headquarters in New York in 1960 ranting about “toady American imperialism” and promising “further interventions”. Two years later, Khrushchev provoked the Caribbean Missile Crisis that nearly triggered a nuclear apocalypse. Soviet leaders in the late 1970s and early 1980s routinely hinted at the possibility of a nuclear war until Mikhail Gorbachev started his perestroika reforms that prompted a sign of relief in the West, but buried the USSR. During the war in Ukraine, the Kremlin pulled out of nuclear arms control treaties with Washington in moves that many predicted would start a new arms race. “This is not a bluff,” Putin said in 2022 when announcing the possibility of a nuclear strike. “Putin’s regime has not once used the scare of a nuclear war to frighten the West and convince it not to provide military aid to Ukraine,” Alisher Ilkhamov, head of Central Asia Due Diligence, a think tank in London, told Al Jazeera. “In the past, the scare was usually voiced over by Medvedev and all sorts of propagandists, now it’s Putin’s turn to announce them,” he said. And it wasn’t Macron’s assumption that irked Putin – it was Ukraine’s success in striking airfields, fuel depots, warships and military planes deep in Russia and Russia-occupied areas, Ilkhamov said. So far, the West has been able to raise the stakes in providing increasingly effective weaponry to Ukraine and ignore the Kremlin’s threats, he said. And Putin will chicken out of a direct duel because Russia’s military-industrial potential is too exhausted to support an all-out confrontation with NATO, he said. “The power of [both] sides is too unequal,” Ilkhamov said. “Putin has nothing to lean on in the confrontation with the West. He understands it very well and won’t go farther beyond the scares.” The widow of Russia’s most outspoken opposition leader offered a useful insight into how Putin issues his threats and acts upon them. “You’re dealing not with a politician but with a bloody monster. Putin is the head of an organised criminal group,” Yulia Navalnaya, whose husband Alexey Navalny died on February 16 in an Arctic prison, said in a video on Wednesday. “It’s impossible to harm Putin with yet another resolution or yet another batch of sanctions that are no different from previous ones. You can’t win over him thinking he is a man with principles, with morals and rules,” she said. During his speech, Putin seemed in denial about his own role in the war that grinds into its third year. “I noticed during Putin’s speech that he said Russia did not start the war,” Ivar Dale, a senior policy adviser with the Norwegian Helsinki Committee, a human rights group, told Al Jazeera. “He thought about the risks, he decided to do it, and he failed. The right thing to do now is to withdraw all troops from Ukraine, and not continue to threaten innocent people with a nuclear holocaust,” Dale said. Putin’s blackmail is not his first and probably not his last, and the West should indeed deploy NATO troops to aid Ukraine, said an expert on Eastern Europe. “The emergence of Western servicemen in Ukraine will, of course, cross yet another ‘red line,'” Nikolay Mitrokhin of Germany’s Bremen University told Al Jazeera. “Although it would very much help Ukraine and give it a chance to free several brigades that are currently guarding the rear and the border with [breakaway and pro-Russian Moldovan region of]Transnistria.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/1/how-real-is-putins-threat-to-nuke-the-west
Ukraine’s strategic goal in 2024 is to make Russia’s war felt in Moscow,Ukraine is doubling down on remote warfare to smash Putin’s power base and ability to fight.,"Ukraine appears to have few resources with which to mount another counteroffensive. The European Union is upping its military aid from 28 billion euros ($30bn) in the past two years to 21 billion euros ($23bn) this year alone, but that is still not enough to replace United States military aid, stalled in Congress. The Financial Times reported last month that certain US officials had urged Ukraine to play defence in 2024 and conserve strength for a counteroffensive next year. “Defensive operations do not necessarily present Ukraine with more opportunities to husband materiel and expand reserves,” wrote the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, in a scathing critique of that advice. Talking to journalists on Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hinted that he would appease conservatives with a summit in Switzerland this spring to thrash out a peace proposal. But he also said, “We believe that it is only right to get stronger on the battlefield … We do not want any negotiation formats or peace formulas to be imposed on us by countries that are not here today, not at war.” If Ukraine is to fight for a better bargaining position, many experts feel offence is its only choice. “We are headed towards a war of attrition, which plays into Russia’s hands,” Vienna-based geopolitical strategist Velina Tchakarova told Al Jazeera. “Ukraine will launch a military offensive – it is clear,” said Tchakarova, who also predicted Russia’s 2022 invasion. Ukraine has hinted as much. “We are doing everything possible and impossible to make a breakthrough,” Rustem Umerov, defence minister, said in the past week. “Plan 2024 is already there. We do not talk about it publicly. It is powerful, it is strong, it gives not only hope but also will give results in 2024,” he said. Ukraine still aims to restore the borders Russia recognised in 1991, which means pushing Russian forces out of four partially occupied regions – Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia and Kherson – and also retaking Crimea. A survey for the Munich Security Conference showed that at least three-quarters of Ukrainians still back all of these goals. But how will it be done? Last year’s counteroffensive strategy was to capture Melitopol and reach the Sea of Azov. From there, Ukrainian forces could cut off Russia from Crimea by firing on the Kerch bridge. Had it succeeded, the strategy would have delivered Crimea, Kherson and most of Zaporizhia, and saddled Russian President Vladimir Putin with enormous political pressure to end the war. Tchakarova said the 2023 counteroffensive failed because it depended on weapons deliveries from allies. The Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a think tank, measured that weapons commitments in August-October last year were 87 percent lower than during the same period in 2022, the first year of the war. “This was the decisive factor that led to no significant breakthroughs on the front lines,” Tchakarova said. This year, Ukraineplans to makeas many of its own weapons as possible. “We are expecting a lot more [help from allies] if we believe the announcements – F-16s, drones and ammunition,” said Tchakarova. “But I don’t expect any serious support,” underlining the wisdom of Ukraine’s new approach.    Ukraine’s tactics are also evolving. Last June’s counteroffensive was based on mechanised manoeuvres and manpower, but its expenditure in weapons and lives proved unsustainable beyond September. At about the same time, though, Ukraine launched a series of ranged attacks that proved more sustainable and, in some ways, more devastating to Russia. In May it struck the Kremlin with drones and followed up with more attacks in the heart of Moscow. That “produced an incredible sense of worry”, Jade McGlynn, a Russia expert at King’s College London’s War Studies department, told Al Jazeera. “They were targeting that whole ministry of defence area or the area where the Kremlin elites live, so it was a signal to anyone in that circle that ‘even you are not safe’.” Surface drones of Ukraine’s own manufacture and Storm Shadow missiles provided by Britain and France have since struck repeatedly in the waters around Crimea, sinking or rendering inoperable half of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet. Aerial drones and missiles have destroyed Crimean air defences, aircraft and the Black Sea Fleet headquarters in Sevastopol. More recently, drones have targeted oil and gas infrastructure in Russia itself, vital to its export revenue. Russian newspaper Kommersant said refineries had to reduce their output by four percent in January compared with January 2023, because of damage caused by Ukrainian drones. Zelenskyy said this month that “our task this year is not only to bolster our sky shield and Ukraine’s long-range capabilities to the fullest extent possible, but also to inflict maximum systemic losses on Russia”. That has been a constant in Ukraine’s strategy. In September 2022, then-commander-in-chiefValery Zaluzhnysaid Russia’s ability to strike Ukraine with impunity was “the true centre of gravity of the enemy”, and sought long-range weapons to reciprocate the pain. “It’s important that Ukrainians continue,” said McGlynn. “Unless [Russians] feel even a thousandth of what Ukraine feels, they’re not going to feel any responsibility to act against it.” Ukraine is now levelling up this strategy. It has said it will build 20,000 drones with a range of hundreds of kilometres, suggesting a devastating intended usage rate of 55 a day, and 1,000 drones with a range of more than 1,000km (621 miles) to strike deep inside Russia. Zelenskyy on Sunday summarised this year’s strategic goals. “We have to prove that we can deprive Russia of its air supremacy, its financing of aggression and its political power. This is a task for the year,” Zelenskyy told allies gathered in Paris. Ukraine’s emphasis on remote warfare seems to go hand in hand with a more conservative use of manpower in 2024. When ground forces commanderOleksandr Syrskyiireplaced Valery Zaluzhny as commander in chief this year, there was concern about a return to costlier tactics. “He is from this Soviet old school of thinking, which is highly artillery-driven and more prone to devote mass to the front, which generates a great deal of concern in Ukraine,” Cambridge University’s Rory Finnin, a Ukraine historian, told Al Jazeera. Yet Syrskyii belied this assumption on February 17, when he withdrew his troops from the almost surrounded eastern city of Avdiivka. It was a reversal of his tactics in Bakhmut, where he had ordered them to fight a rearguard for every inch of territory. “Social media showed Russia was caught off guard by the fact that Ukrainian forces pulled back,” said retired Colonel Seth Krummrich, now vice-president of Global Guardian, a security consultancy. As part of its effort to conserve manpower, Ukraine plans to build a million short-range drones this year, which can deliver small bombs with great accuracy near the front lines, a goal experts havetold Al Jazeerais feasible. Such a rate of production would average about 20,000 bombs a day, and would likely overwhelm Russian volumes. On February 12, Ukraine reported downing 1,157 Russian short-range drones in a week. Short-range drones might also be the key to equalising artillery power, a step Zelenskyy said was necessary before any new counteroffensive. “We need to come to those moments when we had appropriate operations, counteroffensive actions, when we went [to a ratio of] 1 to 1.5-3. Then we will be able to push back the Russians,” he said at Sunday’s press conference. What would be the effect on Russia if Ukraine succeeded in its remote warfare strategy? Russia has managed to avoid many dire predictions so far. Despite a mutiny by the Wagner military company last year and numerous antiwar protests, Putin has not been toppled. The rouble did not collapse. Russia circumvented sanctions to sell oil and buy weapons. However, some experts believe the effects are accumulating. “I think this year will be the high watermark of Putin’s capacity to influence clearly what’s going on in Ukraine,” British historian Mark Galeotti told the Futucast podcast last month, predicting that “towards the end of this year … we’ll see some very, very large chickens coming home to roost.” Those chickens include rising household debt, thinning public services and disillusionment with Putin, Galeotti believed: “The system is more and more vulnerable to the unexpected, and the unexpected could come tomorrow or in five years’ time.” On Monday, Zelenskyy suggested he might focus directly on Crimea this year. “We must fight for the full restoration of international law in relation to Crimea,” he said in a statement marking the 10th anniversary of Russia’s annexation of the peninsula. Ukrainian military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said last month that attacks on Crimea would intensify, and this month predicted, “the peninsula will be brought back”. This, too, has been a strategic goal since 2022, because Russia maintains five airfields on the peninsula from which it has attacked Ukraine, and uses it to support troops in Zaporizhia and Kherson. Even if it doesn’t recapture the Crimean peninsula this year, Ukraine can render it unusable as a Russian base of operations using drones and missiles. With US aid stalled, Europe has an opportunity to play a bigger geopolitical role, career British diplomat and lecturer at Cambridge University’s Centre for Geopolitics Suzanne Raine told Al Jazeera. “For many years now, America has been the first mover that has given us the confidence to do something, and that’s a ridiculous position for us all to be in, frankly,” Raine said. “If the EU wants to be able to take itself seriously on anything, it needs to be able to galvanise conversations that lead to decisions and action.” The EU has passed 12 sanctions packages and invited Ukraine to become a member with record speed, but these were low-hanging fruit, said Raine. “Sanctions are easy and theydon’t really work. Accession talks are easy as long as you don’t actually allow them to join,” she said. Britain has so far been the only European country to upstage the US on new categories of weapons, offering Ukraine tanks in January 2023 followed by medium-range Storm Shadow missiles in May. Germany has an equivalent Taurus missile it refuses to send Ukraine until the US approves ATACMS. Raine said she is waiting for the continent to wake up. “If not now, when?” she said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/1/ukraines-strategic-goal-in-2024-is-to-make-russias-war-felt-in-moscow
Russian troops inch ahead as war in Ukraine barrels into third year,"Meanwhile, Ukraine downs a second A-50 radar detection plane, Macron talks ground troops, and Putin threatens nuclear risk.","Ukrainian forces in the east struggled to find stable new defences during the past week, as Russian troops continued to advance after capturing Avdiivka – suggesting that artillery and other shortages were affecting Ukraine’s ability to hold the entire 1,000km (620-mile) front line. Ukrainian forceswithdrewfrom Avdiivka on February 17, after a four-month Russian onslaught to take the town. On February 24, Ukrainian defenders also withdrew from the village of Lastochkyne, three kilometres (1.9 miles) west of Avdiivka, never having had a chance to build proper defences under fire. “There were no defences built there, and the fighters had to withdraw from the battles in Avdiivka and gain a foothold in the very process of hostilities,” one Ukrainian military reporter known as DeepStateUA wrote on Telegram to his 700,000 followers, predicting that the same would occur at other points of retreat. Three days later, Ukrainian troops withdrew from the villages of Stepove and Sieverne, north and south of Lastochkyne, after fierce overnight battles. Oleksandr Tarnavskyi, commander of the Tavria Group of Ukrainian forces, which is fighting in this area, said on February 27 that the line of defence had “stabilised” along Tonenke-Orlivka-Berdychi axis, a row of three villages immediately to the west of Lastochkyne, but even that assumption seemed precarious. Geolocated footage the following day showed Russian troops at the southeastern approaches to Orlivka. Tavria spokesman Dmytro Lykhoviy said Russian forces had increased the size of attacking units from squads to platoons or even companies. A squad can be as small as half a dozen troops. Platoons can be as big as 50, and a company can reach 200 troops. Russian troops also claimed on February 26 to have advanced to the outskirts of Ivanivske, a village west of Bakhmut, the last city to fall to Russian forces, in May. And Russian forces reclaimed Robotyne, a village Ukrainian troops recaptured during last summer’s offensive at the western end of the front, in Zaporizhia. Geolocated footage on February 24 showed Russian troops in the centre of Robotyne, where military reporters said they had secured the central fortified positions in the school and recreational centre. Russian troops also continued to assault Ukrainian positions in Krynky, on the left bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson, without success. One reason for Russian success in Avdiivka appears to have been the fact that Moscow’s forces secured local air superiority and used it to drop glide bombs – large, inert weapons fitted with fins to fly further and strike more accurately. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia had dropped more than 3,200 glide bombs since the beginning of the year. Ukraine has targeted Russian bombers and the command planes that coordinate them. On February 27, Ukraine downed two Sukhoi-34 bombers, at least one of them in the east, which are used to drop glide bombs. More consequentially, on February 23 the Ukrainian military shot down a Russian A-50 early warning and control plane over the Sea of Azov coast. The A-50 is an airborne radar used to monitor enemy air activity and air defences. Russia has used them to feed target coordinates to fighters, bombers and long-range missiles. Ukrainian military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said the operation had left Russia with just six A-50 planes in the Ukraine theatre, and that more would be downed. Zelenskyy told allies gathered in Paris that a strategic goal for this year was to deprive Russia of air superiority, just as it had been deprived of its control of the Black Sea and its superiority on land. Ukraine has long-targeted these planes, which are very difficult to replace. Russia only built 40 of them, and crew training takes years. Some reports suggest they will be vital to Russian efforts to shoot down Ukrainian F-16s, once they start flying. Western allies have promised to hand Ukraine at least two dozen. A year ago, fighters bombed the Machulishchi air base in Belarus, where Russia had parked an A-50, damaging it. On January 15, Ukraine downed an A-50 in the Sea of Azov, along with an Ilyushin-22 command plane. Ukraine also continued ranged attacks on Russian energy and defence infrastructure. On February 24, its military intelligence and security service said they had jointly organised a successful drone attack against the Novolipetsk Metallurgical Plant, in Lipetsk, 370km (230 miles) southeast of Moscow. The plant supplies steel for the manufacture of artillery, missiles and drones. Russia, too, continued its aerial campaign against Ukrainian infrastructure using missiles and drones. From February 21-28, Ukraine downed 79 Iranian-designed Shahed drones out of 98 launched, along with a number of missiles. Ukraine’s allies continued to pledge military assistance. Denmark announced a $228m military aid package including 15,000 rounds of ammunition. Germany announced a new military aid package that included 14,000 artillery rounds and reconnaissance drones. French President Emmanuel Macron gathered 20 heads of government, including 15 from the EU, in Paris on February 26, to discuss increasing the supply of artillery rounds to Ukraine. The European Union has said it will be in a position to manufacture a million artillery rounds a year by the end of 2024. Macronalso calledfor the formation of a new alliance to supply “missiles and bombs of medium and long range to carry out deep strikes”. France and the UK were the first to supply Ukraine with Storm Shadow/SCALP missiles, with a 140km (87-mile) range, last May. Until then, the longest-range weapon Ukraine had was 80km (50-mile) range HIMARS rockets. The US is now reportedly thinking of supplying 300km range ATACMS missiles, and Ukraine claims it has developed a 700km range (435-mile) missile. While there was “no consensus” on the sending of Western ground troops to Ukraine, “nothing should be excluded. We will do whatever it takes to ensure that Russia cannot win this war,” Macron said. Russian President Vladimir Putinrespondedwith a threat of nuclear war, should NATO members send troops to Ukraine. “[Western nations] must realise that we also have weapons that can hit targets on their territory,” he told assembled lawmakers on Thursday. “All this really threatens a conflict with the use of nuclear weapons and the destruction of civilisation.

Putin warns risk of nuclear war if West sends troops to Ukraine,"Two weeks ahead of the presidential election, the Russian leader says his troops won’t back down in Ukraine.","Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned of a “real” risk of nuclear war if the Western countries sent troops to fight in Ukraineduring an annual address to the nationtwo weeks ahead of the presidential election. “There has been talk about the possibility of sending NATO military contingents to Ukraine. But we remember the fate of those who once sent their contingents to our country’s territory. But now the consequences for possible interventionists will be far more tragic,” Putin said addressing parliament and other senior elites. “They must realise that we also have weapons that can hit targets on their territory. All this really threatens a conflict with the use of nuclear weapons and the destruction of civilisation. Don’t they get that?” Putin has previously spoken of the dangers of a direct confrontation between NATO and Russia, but his nuclear weapon warning on Thursday was one of his most explicit. Putin’s warning comes in the wake of French President Emmanuel Macron’s proposal on Monday of European NATO members sending ground troops to Ukraine. The United States, Germany, the United Kingdom and some other members rejected the suggestion. But Putin suggested that Western leaders remember the fate of those like Germany’s Adolf Hitler and France’s Napoleon Bonaparte, who unsuccessfully tried to invade his country in the past. The Russian leader previously pulled Moscow out of theSTARTarms control treaty with the US last year and previously said he was “not bluffing” when he stated he was ready to use nuclear weapons. Putin also said Russia was “ready” for dialogue with the US on “strategic stability” issues despite the invasion of Ukraine triggering the worst relations between Moscow and the West since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis.  Putin praised Russian troops fighting in Ukraine as “courageous” warriors who would not back down. Most opposition candidates are either in jail or forced out of the country, making it easier for Putin to secure another six-year term in the March 15-17 vote. His most formidable challenger, jailed leader Alexey Navalny,mysteriously diedin prison in mid-February. “I look at these courageous people, sometimes very young guys, and without any exaggeration I can say my heart fills with pride. They will not back down, will not fail and will not betray,” Putin said. His comments also come with the Kremlin revelling in itsrecent gainsin Ukraine, an economy that has defied the devastating effects of sanctions, and signs of Western support for Ukraine becoming strained. On the war in Ukraine, Putin said the Russian army had increased its combat capabilities and is “confidently” advancing across the front line. “Today, when our homeland is defending its sovereignty and security and protecting the lives of our fellow countrymen in Donbas and Novorossiya [regions of Ukraine that Russia claims to have annexed], the decisive role in this righteous struggle belongs to our citizens, our unity, devotion to our native country and responsibility for its fate,” he said. Earlier on Thursday, Russia said it fought off an attempted landing by Ukrainian special forces on the Tendra Spit sandbar in the Black Sea, killing “up to 25” Ukrainian personnel.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/29/putin-warns-risk-of-nuclear-war-if-west-sends-troops-to-ukraine
"Why has the EU sanctioned Indian, Chinese companies for Russia links?","The latest sanctions, coinciding with the anniversary of the Ukraine war, touch New Delhi, Beijing for the first time.","A day before the two-year anniversary ofRussia’s invasion of Ukraine, the European Union released anexhaustive new listof companies, entities or people in countries including Russia, India, Iran, China and Syria, that it said it was sanctioning over allegations that they were connected to Russia’s defence and security sector. The new sanctions added 27 new entities to a list of more than 600 that were already facing EU bans and restrictions. But the additions included companies in mainland China and India for the first time, targeting entities in the countries that have been the biggest buyers of Russian fossil fuels since the Kremlin launched its full-fledged war on Ukraine in February 2022. Here’s more about the new sanctions, who they target, why these companies have been sanctioned, how China, India and Russia have responded – and why all of this matters. While 619 of the 641 entities on the 27-nation bloc’s sanction list are in Russia, a handful of entities from other countries are also on the sanctions register. These include: Besides Russian companies, the sanctions are also against Russian officials, including judiciary members, local politicians and people the EU said were “responsible for the illegal deportation and military re-education of Ukrainian children”. Most international companies were sanctioned by the EU in June 2023. Only 27 of the entities on the list were first announced to be sanctioned on Friday. The foreign companies have been sanctioned over allegations that they have exported dual-use goods to Russia that could be used in its war against Ukraine. A dual-use item is something that can be used for both civilian and military applications such as technology, satellites ordrones. The EU regulation describes the foreign countries as “third countries”. Ali Ahmadi, a scholar of sanctions and economic statecraft, explained that these countries are often “points of transshipment” – places through which sensitive technology is routed to Russia. If European countries refuse to export an item to Russia because it might have military applications, the item might still be sent to a country like Uzbekistan or the UAE. From there, it could in turn be sold to Russia – at times without the branding and labelling of its country of origin. “So it essentially ends up in Russia indirectly,” added Ahmadi, an executive fellow at the Geneva Centre for Security Policy and an analyst at Gulf State Analytics. TheUS also imposedroughly 600 new sanctions against entities in Russia and other countries on Friday in the largest single round of penalties sinceRussia’s invasion of Ukraineon February 24, 2022. US President Joe Biden said the sanctions were a response to the war in Ukraine and Russian opposition leaderAlexey Navalny’sdeath. There is overlap between the entities the US and EU have sanctioned. Ahmadi said that the US and the EU “certainly cooperate with each other a lot, but there are entities that are on one sanctions list, not on the other”. The EU sanctions mean that EU member states can not sell battlefield or dual-use goods to the entities on the sanctions list. The US and EU sanctions on the companies in countries besides Russia are “going to make it substantially harder for them to interact with the outside world,” said Ahmadi. Ahmadi compared the sanctions with former US President Donald Trump’smaximum pressure campaignsagainst Iran or Syria, adding that it is a much more aggressive stance reflecting that “the Europeans have acknowledged their sanctions are veryleaky“. However, Ahmadi added that the third countries themselves will not necessarily take a significant hit – yet – since only a handful of companies from these nations have been targeted so far. Take Iran, the country with the most companies targeted, other than Russia. The Iranian companies on the list are state-owned institutions. “Whatever business they do is with Iran’s allies,” said Ahmadi. “They don’t have any interaction with the dollar. They don’t do business with any European entities.” Their very purpose and design effectively shield them from the new sanctions. So what’s the point of the sanctions? Simply, say experts, to send a signal of the EU’s disapproval – and a reminder to the countries hosting these companies, including China and India, of what Brussels could do more of, if it wants to. After the sanctions were announced, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce released a statement on Monday condemning them. In the statement, the ministry said that the sanctions were unilateral, with “no basis whatsoever in international law and authorisation from the United Nations Security Council”. Beijing, New Delhi and most Global South capitals have long criticised sanctions imposed by individual countries and blocs like the EU that do not have the legitimacy of the UN’s approval, though China’s veto power on the Security Council makes it practically impossible for that body to sign off on sanctions against Beijing. The Chinese statement also added that the sanctions go against the spirit of discussions during theChina-EU leaders’ meeting, which happened between Chinese President Xi Jinping and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in December 2023. China warned that these sanctions would have a detrimental impact on China-EU economic and trade relations. Yet, Ahmadi said China’s response – much like the EU sanctions – was for the most part symbolic. “It is something that China feels like it has to react to,” said Ahmadi. However, he added that only Chinese microtechnology companies have been affected, which does not affect China so much. If the EU attempted to impose sanctions on major Chinese banks, that would likely have significant implications for the global economy. But, Ahmadi said, “I don’t think the Europeans or the Americans are ready to go that far, even if they may be, it may be the only way to stop transshipment through China.” Si2 Microsystems Pvt Ltd, based in India’s Bengaluru, is a new addition to the sanctions list as of Friday. Si2 designs integrated circuits for commercial, military and space industries and has partnered up with India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (Meity) and the state-funded Indian Institute of Technology Madras, as part of an effort to research the fabrication of chips with silicon photonic processor cores. It manufactures chips for quantum computing and avionics among other sectors and has claimed the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), General Electric and IBM to be past customers, according to a government press release and global tech publisher, The Register. The EU sanctions do not detail what specifically Si2 is believed to have helped Russia with, but experts suspect it is accused of having to facilitate semiconductor shipments to Moscow. Many modern weapons systems rely on semiconductors. India is a close strategic partner of the EU and the US. Though it has purchased the most Russian fossil fuels since the start of the war, after China, the West has, until now, avoided targeting New Delhi or Indian entities. Adopted on July 31, 2014, the European Council’s Regulation 833/2014 states that it is “prohibited to sell, supply, transfer or export, directly or indirectly, dual-use goods and technology” to Russia or for use in Russia. It was adopted in the aftermath of the Russian annexation of Crimea and the Kremlin’s support for secessionist movements in eastern Ukraine. The EU Regulation that came on Friday is essentially an amendment to Regulation 833/2014. The last amendment was made to the regulation on December 18, 2023, when 13 new entities were added to the sanctions list. Initial sanctions and restrictive regulations largely targeted Russian and Belarusian entities. In February 2023, seven Iranian entities were sanctioned for allegedly manufacturing items used by Russia’s military in the war. In June 2023, entities from Hong Kong, China, Uzbekistan, the United Arab Emirates, Syria and Armenia also made the sanctions list. As a response to the latest round of EU sanctions, Russia’s foreign ministry announced that it had significantly expanded a list of EU officials and politicians banned from entering Russia. The announcement was made on Friday. “The European Union is continuing its fruitless attempts to put pressure on Russia through unilateral restrictive measures,” the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/29/why-has-the-eu-sanctioned-indian-chinese-companies-for-russia-links
"Zelenskyy seeks support, arms at Albania summit of Balkan nations",Ukrainian president promotes idea of joint arms production at two-day summit of Southeast European countries.,"President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has tried to drum up Balkan support for his vision of peace in Ukraine and has promoted the idea of joint arms production at a two-day summit of Southeast European countries. The meeting was held in the Albanian capital, Tirana, as Kyiv is trying to improve its defensive capabilities to beat back Russian forces at a time of faltering US support a little more than two years into Russia’s full-scale invasion. “We are interested in co-production with you and all our partners,” Zelenskyy told delegations from Albania, Serbia, North Macedonia, Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Croatia and Moldova in his opening remarks at the summit on Wednesday. “There are about 500 defence companies operating in Ukraine. Each of them adds strength, but it is not enough to win [against Russian President Vladimir] Putin. We see the problems with the supply of ammunition, which affects the situation on the battlefield.” Zelenskyy proposed organising a Ukrainian-Balkans defence forum in Kyiv or a Balkan capital to nurture arms cooperation, repeating similar initiatives conducted last year with British and US weapons companies. Albania, North Macedonia and Montenegro are NATO members, have joined Western sanctions against Russia, and sent arms and equipment to Ukraine. There are significant arms industries in parts of the Balkans, especially Serbia and Croatia, a legacy of the former Yugoslavia. Longtime Moscow allySerbia has not imposed sanctions, and neither Belgrade nor Kyiv recognise the independence of Kosovo, Serbia’s former predominantly Albanian southern province, which backs Ukraine and is seeking European Union and NATO membership. Zelenskyy said he had invited all Balkan leaders to take part in a summit of partners and allies in Switzerland this spring that would discuss his vision of peace, which entails a Russian military withdrawal from all Ukrainian territory.    That diplomatic initiative – based on what is known as Zelenskyy’s“peace formula”– does not involve Russia and has been dismissed by Moscow as a non-starter. Zelenskyy said he met Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama for talks and the two leaders had signed an Agreement on Friendship and Cooperation. “This document will contribute to the development of cooperation and strengthening of Ukraine’s position in the Balkan region,” Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram messenger. His chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said: “They also spoke about Ukraine’s defence needs and the possibility of joint weapons production.” Zelenskyy said at a news conference later that every time weapons supplies to Ukraine are delayed, it is a “gift” to Putin, an apparent allusion to the months-long impasse in the US Congress over providing more military aid to Kyiv. Zelenskyy, who was inSaudi Arabia for talkson Tuesday, is also due to meet the leaders of Serbia, North Macedonia, Kosovo, Bosnia and Montenegro at the summit. Thirteen countries are attending the summit along with officials from the EU and other international institutions. “A pivotal moment for fostering bilateral ties, and standing in solidarity with Ukraine in its heroic fight against Russia’s aggression,” Albanian Foreign Minister Igli Hasani wrote on X shortly after Zelenskyy’s arrival.

Zelenskyy’s trip came as Kyiv’s forces are slowly being pushed back in eastern Ukraine. Russia has the upper hand due to its big advantage in troop numbers and weapons supplies, military analysts said, as Kyiv waits for news of new provisions from its Western partners. The Ukrainian military said on Tuesday that after intense overnight fighting, it has withdrawn its forces from two more villages in the eastern region of Donetsk nearAvdiivka, which fell to Russian forces this month after a four-month offensive.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/28/zelenskyy-seeks-support-arms-at-albania-summit-of-balkan-nations
Transnistria tensions: Will Russia try to annex Moldova’s breakaway region?,"Pro-Russian rebels hint at a referendum, a move Moldova has dismissed as meaningless propaganda.","Bucharest, Romania –Alexandru Flenchea’s phone has been ringing non-stop since last week. “I cannot tell you how many phone calls I have received in the last two days from both the press and just acquaintances,” Flenchea told Al Jazeera, by phone. People keep asking him whether it is safe to stay in Moldova. “It is just insane,” he said. Flenchea heads the Initiative 4 Peace Association in Chisinau, Moldova’s capital. He has been fielding calls since Ghenadie Ciorba – an opposition figure in Transnistria – recently reportedly suggested that separatists may call for a referendum on the region’s annexation to Russia. On Wednesday, the call Ciorba touted did not quite come at a rare special congress in the narrow strip of land that isinternationally recognisedas Moldovan territory but backed by Russia. But the “congress of deputies of all levels” in the separatist region’s capital did pass a resolution seeking Moscow’s support in staving off an apparent economic crisis, which they blamed on Moldova. “There is social and economic pressure on Transdniestria, which contradicts European principles and approaches to the protection of human rights and free trade,” the resolution said. Transnistria has been under the control of separatist authorities since 1992, and is home to about 470,000 people. Moldovan authorities have dismissed its demand as a propaganda move and downplayed the recent events, saying there is no risk of escalation. Wednesday’s meeting took place just a day before Russian President Vladimir Putin’s annual address to the Russian Federal Assembly.  Wedged between Moldova and Ukraine, Transnistria is not recognised by any member of the United Nations as an independent entity. About 1,500 Russian troops are stationed in the strip, which is home to ethnic Russians, Ukrainians, and Moldovans. “People from Transnistria have their own passport that is not valid anywhere,” said 36-year-old Cristina Afinoghenova, who is originally from Transnistria and currently living in Chisinau. As a result, “many obtain secondary documents”, she added. Most Transnistrians have Moldovan passports, while some have Russian and Ukrainian papers. Afinoghenova, who was six when the region declared independence, recalled discussions “particularly about language”, arguing “whether the Moldovan language lacked prestige” or “if Russian was considered cool”. The conflict over Transnistria in 1989 was over “the language issue”, according to Anatoli Dirun, head of the Tiraspol School of Public Studies; Tiraspol is the region’s capital. Transnistria was part of what was known as the Moldavian Republic within the Soviet Union. However, with the proclamation of perestroika, the political and financial reform movement launched by Russian leader Mikhail Gorbachev, the growth of national movements began in many Soviet republics. “Moldova was no exception,” Dirun said. Then, the Moldova parliament in 1990 decided that the only state language in the republic would be Moldavian in the Latin script. Transnistria, historically under the sovereignty of the Russian Empire, which had just joined Bessarabia (Moldova) in 1940, “did not agree with this decision”, Dirun added. “After their demands were ignored, the population of Transnistria organised a large-scale strike”, he explained. The war in Ukraine has polarised opinion on both sides of the Dniester River. Dirun believes that since 2014, amid the Donbas conflict and Russian annexation of Crimea, “Ukraine has seriously changed its attitude towards Transnistria, considering the Russian troops stationed there as a threat to its national security.” After February 2022, following Russia’s invasion of its neighbour, Ukraine closed its border with Transnistria. “Tiraspol has found itself sandwiched between Chisinau and Kyiv,” said Dirun. The Russian aggression in Ukraine has also impacted negotiations, said a Moldova government spokesperson of a department focused on reintegration policies. “[It] is currently [impossible] to hold meetings since two of its very important actors, Ukraine and Russia, cannot sit at the same table to negotiate,” said the spokesperson. According to Afinoghenova, there are children and parents in Transnistria “who have different views [regarding the war in Ukraine] and stopped meeting and speaking with each other”. The closure of the border with Ukraine, combined with a Moldovan decision to tax goods imported into the separatist region, has skyrocketed prices of basic products, said Afinoghenova, whose parents and relatives live in Transnistria. According to Dirun, the war has rocked Transnistria’s economy “but also forced the leadership of Transnistria to take a more restrained position” and “not demonstrate its pro-Russian views”. The war in neighbouring Ukraine has also made Transnistria “an even greater ground for disinformation campaigns”, said Anastasia Pociumban, a research fellow at the Center for Order and Governance at the German Council on Foreign Relations. Another challenge “has been related to the supply of electricity”, Pociumban added. Moldova was once one of the European nations most dependent on Russian energy. By 2023, it became independent of Russian gas, but it continues to rely on electricity sourced from the breakaway region of Transnistria. Pociumban argued that “Moldova’s previously full dependency on Russian and gas and electricity from Transnistria was used as a vulnerability for Russia’s blackmailing”. On the other bank of the Dniester River, in Moldova, “this war has [also] polarised the population even more”, said Alexandru Flenchea. However, “if there’s one thing that all Moldovans have in common, it is that almost all of us don’t want war,” he added. Moldova was officially granted candidate status by the European Union in June 2022, a process the bloc still believes in. “Moldova’s European future cannot be held hostage by the conflict,” Peter Stano, EU spokesperson, told Al Jazeera.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/28/transnistria-tensions-could-russia-try-to-annex-moldovas-breakaway-state
"Fishy business: After Russia invaded Ukraine, its seafood industry thrived","Observers say Russia’s seafood industry was not sanctioned quickly or harshly enough, especially during the onset of the war.","After Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the West’s reaction was swift and decisive, with unanimous decisions by the European Union and the United States to support Ukraine and punish Russia with economic sanctions. Two years on, the war continues whileRussia’s economyremains resilient. “Sanctions work. And there is hardly any alternative that would work more effectively. But they are not working at full capacity,” Agiya Zagrebelska, a department manager at the Ukrainian National Agency on Corruption Prevention, told Al Jazeera. While parts of the Russian industry were sanctioned immediately, some important industries were not. The Russian fishing industry was only partially blocked by Washington and marginally by the European bloc, which continues to import about  $1bn worth of seafood from its aggressive neighbour. “Are the lives of a few hundred Ukrainians worth a crab or salmon?” said Zagrebelska. Since February 2022, when the invasion started, the EU has passed 13 sanction packages on Russia targeting President Vladimir Putin and people close to him, Russian banks, media companies, political parties and paramilitary groups. However, the European sanctions excluded most food products from Russia. The bulk of Russia’s billion-dollar seafood business, such as Alaskan pollock or cod, kept flooding EU and US fish markets and restaurants. The US included Russian seafood in sanctions in March 2022. And late last year, the government issued an executive order, taking additional steps by banning any Russian-origin seafood that had been incorporated or substantially transformed into another product in a third country. The new sanctions aimed at closing loopholes. With Russia was unable to export its seafood directly to the US, it sent ships to South Korea or China for processing. According to Stephanie Madsen, the head of the US-based At-Sea Processors Association, Russian fish made it through EU and US borders ultimately in disguise, under another country’s label. Madsen testified in front of the US Congress that Russian fish exports also directly funded Moscow’s war in Ukraine. In 2023, newly-added Russian fish export duties and $3.97bn from auctions distributing pollock and crab fishing quota reportedly went to support Putin’s warfare. “The majority of American consumers do not support the war in Ukraine,” said Sally Yozell, the director of the environmental security programme at the Stimson Center, a think tank. “I think they would feel very uncomfortable if they thought that their fish sticks that they’re eating at home or the [fish] sandwich that they’re eating at lunch was made up of Russian pollock that was supporting the Russian regime in its war against Ukraine.” Even if fish sanctions are in place, ensuring the fish does not enter European or US markets can be difficult because seafood is not always easily traceable. One representative from the Environmental Justice Foundation, a United Kingdom NGO, said that “many EU member states do very little verification of seafood imports, providing opportunities for the products of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing to enter the EU market”. Yozell said, regarding the US system, that mandatory catch licenses showing where the fish is coming from are easily manipulable PDF files. She added that while the US has been monitoring illegally-harvested seafood that enters the US market through the Seafood Import Monitoring Program since 2018, the scheme only focuses on 13 species and does not include some of the Russian seafood that enters the US market like pollock and halibut. That means that even in the US, where Russian seafood is directly banned, the fish served in restaurants or sold in supermarkets might be supporting the Russian economy. The result is that the EU imports about 740,000 tonnes of Alaskan pollock, a third of which comes directly from Russia, while another third gets it from China, of which 95 percent is of Russian origin, said Guus Pastoor, the president of the EU Fish Processors and Traders Association (AIPCE). In 2022, Russia ramped up its fish exports to the EU – despite tensions over the war in Ukraine, Russia’s Kommersant daily reported, citing trade data. Volumes increased by 18 percent that year, and by another 13 percent in 2023, reaching an all-time high. Before reaching Western markets, many Russian catches make a pit stop at the Busan harbour in South Korea, one of the world’s biggest shipping ports. Since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, the port has seen significant increases in Russian seafood. Data obtained for this investigation, in part from the Environmental Justice Foundation, shows that the Russian side of the harbour has been busier than ever. The numbers are staggering. For example, in 2021, no halibut – a highly-priced white-fleshed fish often caught in the Russian/Norwegian Barents Sea – was brought into the Busan harbour by Russian vessels. But in 2023, after the war started, the harbour imported more than 11,000 tonnes. While some of that fish might end up in the South Korean market, halibut exports from Korea to the US and China increased significantly in the same year. In 2023, South Korea imported 213,000 tonnes of seafood from Russia, compared with 439,000 in 2022 and 185,000 in 2020. Korean exports of fish to Europe and the US surged. From 2021 to 2022, exports of frozen herring to the US increased by 99 percent, while fillet exports to Germany skyrocketed by 541 percent. For most of the war, as well as being exempt from sanctions, Russian seafood producers enjoyed some privileges. Some fish arrived in the EU free of duties or at a reduced tariff. In January 2024, the Council of the European Union ended these perks. But not everyone was happy about the increased tariffs on Russian fish. “This, of course, will mean that the price [of fish] will go up because these tariffs are calculated into the final price for the consumer,” said Guus Pastoor, the president of the EU Fish Processors and Traders Association. “We understand the political reasons behind this but we think it sets a dangerous precedent.” Back in Ukraine, Zagrebelska is working around the clock to campaign for stricter sanctions. “Until 2014, I thought that freedom and basic rights were what we had by default. Today, every Ukrainian knows that freedom is something to be won and defended.” This article was developed in cooperation with Aktuálně.cz and Kringvarp Føroya in the Faroe Islands with the support ofJournalismfund Europe.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/28/fishy-business-after-russia-invaded-ukraine-its-seafood-industry-thrived
China lauds Russia relations and calls for strengthened Asia-Pacific role,Beijing official said relations with Moscow are at an historic high.,"China has heralded historically strong relations with Russia as it called for the pair to coordinate on security, stability and development in the Asia-Pacific region. China and Russia should play a “better role as an anchor of stability in the changing circumstances of the century,” the foreign ministry in Beijing said in a statement issued on Wednesday following a visit to Moscow by Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong. Although wary of damaging ties with the West, Beijing has refused to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and relations between the two BRICS states have remained warm amid the war. Sun said in the statement that “under the strategic guidance of President Xi Jinping and President Putin … relations between the two countries are at the best period in history”. Such statements will do little to quell suspicion in the West, which has viewed Moscow and Beijing with increased anxiety over the past two years as theyramp up tiesin trade and defence. Beijing hasresponded with angeras Chinese companies have been blacklisted by the United States and European Union for their role in helping Russia evade trade sanctions. Moscow has looked to Beijing as a crucial economic lifeline amid the sanctions, while China has benefitted from cheap energy imports and access to vast natural resources. At the same time, China’s interest in Russia’s sparsely populated, resource-rich, far-eastern region has long been viewed with some concern in Moscow, which sits 11 time zones westwards. Sun stressed Chinese hopes of deepening “coordination” in the Asia-Pacific region, extolling the role of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), a Eurasian political, economic, international security and defence organisation established in 2001. “Both sides should promote the SCO to better play its role as a ‘stabilizing anchor’ in the century-old changes, strengthen communication and coordination in Asia-Pacific regional affairs, and jointly safeguard regional security, stability and development,” he said. During his trip to the Russian capital, the Chinese official also exchanged views with Moscow’s foreign minister Sergey Lavrov on the Ukraine crisis, the situation on the Korean peninsula, and other international and regional matters, the statement noted, without offering details. Separately, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry said on Wednesday that its special representative for Eurasian affairs will tour Russia, Poland, Ukraine, Germany and France in early March to promote a political settlement of the Ukraine crisis.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/28/china-lauds-russia-relations-and-calls-for-strengthened-asia-pacific-role
"Zelenskyy in Saudi Arabia to push for peace, POW deal with Russia",Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has sought to position himself as a potential mediator to end war between Ukraine and Russia.,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has held talks in Saudi Arabia with the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) in an attempt to push for an end to the invasion of Ukraine and the return of prisoners of war from Russia. A statement on Zelenskyy’s website said the two men discussed a Ukrainian plan to end the conflict, and said that the president had thanked MBS for his mediation role. “The head of state [Zelenskyy] noted in particular Saudi Arabia’s strivings to help in restoring a just peace in Ukraine,” the statement said. “Saudi Arabia’s leadership can help find a just solution.” The state-run Saudi Press Agency said that MBS had “affirmed the Kingdom’s keeness and support for all international endeavours and efforts aimed at resolving the Ukrainian-Russian crisis”. It later reported that Zelenskyy had left Saudi Arabia. MBS has sought to position himself as apotential mediatorto end the war between Ukraine and Russia – even as Riyadh remains closely aligned with Russia on energy policies through the OPEC+ group of countries. Zelenskyy’s trip on Tuesday came as Kyiv’s forces are slowly being pushed back in eastern Ukraine. Russia has gained the initiative due to its big advantage in troop numbers and weapons supplies, military analysts say, as Kyiv waits for news of new provisions from its Western partners. The Ukrainian military said Tuesday that it has withdrawn its forces from two more villages nearAvdiivkain the eastern Donetsk region following intense overnight fighting, according to a Ukrainian army spokesman. Ukrainian troops have pulled back from Sieverne and Stepove, Dmytro Lykhovyi said on national television. The two villages had a population of some 100 people in total before the full-scale invasion, he said. Ukraine continues to “rely on Saudi Arabia’s ongoing active support” in pushing forward with what has been described as a “Peace Formula” to end the full-scale invasion, which marked itssecond anniversaryover the weekend, Zelenskyy said in a message on X. Zelenskyy has presented a 10-point peace formula that, among other things, seeks the expulsion of all Russian forces from Ukraine and accountability for war crimes – at a time when the two sides are fighting from largely static positions along a roughly 1,500km (930-mile) front line. Such ideas are rejected out of hand by Moscow. “The second topic is the return of POWs and deportees,” Zelenskyy wrote. “The kingdom’s leadership has already contributed to the release of our people. I am confident that this meeting will also yield results.” On Monday MBS also met with Russian State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin, the SPA reported, adding that they had discussed ways to boost parliamentary cooperation and “developments of common concern”. In recent years, MBS – the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia – has reached a detente with Iran, pursued a peace deal with Yemen’s Houthi rebels and also offered himself as a leader in other crises worldwide. That is after facing widespread international condemnation for Saudi Arabia’s involvement in the war in Yemen and the 2018 killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, which US intelligence agencies believe was carried out on his orders – a claim MBS denies. In May, Zelenskyy travelled to Saudi Arabia for a meeting of Arab leaders and also met then with MBS. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar – all neighbours on the Arabian Peninsula – have been involved in prisoner exchanges since the war broke out in 2022.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/27/zelenskyy-lands-in-saudi-to-push-for-peace-pow-deal-with-russia
"Germany, NATO rule out sending troops to Ukraine as Russia rebukes Macron",Rebuttal of Macron’s remarks comes as Kremlin warns of conflict if West puts boots on ground in Ukraine.,"Germany, Poland and NATO have ruled out sending ground troops to Ukraine, as the Kremlin warned such a move would mark a major escalation and result in direct conflict between Russia and the Western security alliance. The statements on Tuesday came a day after French President Emmanuel Macronraised the prospectfollowing a European leaders’ meeting on boosting support for Ukraine in its war against Russia. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said participants of the conference in Paris discussed the matter but had agreed “that there will be no ground troops, no soldiers on Ukrainian soil who are sent there by European states or NATO states”. Scholz said there was also consensus “that soldiers operating in our countries also are not participating actively in the war themselves”. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala – two of Kyiv’s strongest supporters – meanwhile said they too were not considering sending troops. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg also told The Associated Press news agency that while members of the alliance had provided “unprecedented support” to Ukraine, “there are no plans for NATO combat troops on the ground in Ukraine”. The idea of sending troops has been taboo, particularly as NATO seeks to avoid being dragged into a wider war with nuclear-armed Russia. Nothing prevents NATO members from joining such an undertaking individually or in groups, but the organisation would get involved only if all 31 members agreed. The Kremlin, meanwhile, warned that a direct conflict between NATO and Russia would be inevitable if the alliance sent combat troops. “The very fact of discussing the possibility of sending certain contingents to Ukraine from NATO countries is a very important new element,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters,commenting on Macron’s remarks. It is “absolutely not in the interests” of European members of NATO, Peskov said. “In that case, we would need to talk not about the probability, but about the inevitability [of direct conflict].” With Macron increasingly looking isolated, his government subsequently sought to clarify his comments. French Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne said on Tuesday the president had in mind sending troops for specific tasks such as helping with mine clearance, production of weapons on site, and cyber-defence. “[This] could require a [military] presence on Ukrainian territory, without crossing the threshold of fighting,” Sejourne told French lawmakers. “It’s not sending troops to wage war against Russia,” the minister said. The conference in Paris was held just after France, Germany and the UK each signed 10-year bilateral security agreements with Ukraine as its government works to shore up Western support.

Russian activist Oleg Orlov sentenced to 30 months in prison,Moscow court finds veteran human rights advocate who spoke out against the war in Ukraine guilty of discrediting armed forces.,"A Russian court has sentenced prominent human rights campaignerOleg Orlovto two-and-a-half years in prison after he was found guilty of discrediting the army. Footage posted online on Tuesday byMemorial, a now-banned Russian human rights group, showed the handcuffed 70-year-old smiling as he was put by officers in a van after the verdict by the Golovinskii district court in Moscow. Nobel Prize-winning Memorial, which has Orlov as its co-chairperson, slammed the trial as “a mockery of justice and an attack on the fundamental right to free expression”. It said in a statement cosigned by dozens of rights groups that the campaigner’s legal team would appeal the verdict and pledged to continue its work. #HandsOffOrlovOleg Orlov being taken awaypic.twitter.com/ub6FAc0tFd — Memorial in English (@EnMemorial)February 27, 2024  Human rights groups say the targeting of Kremlin critics has escalated since Russia launched a full-scale invasion against Ukraine in February 2022. The case against Orlov was based on an article he wrote that year in which he denounced the invasion and said Russia, under the leadership of President Vladimir Putin, had descended into “fascism”. A district court initially fined him 150,000 roubles ($1,629), but a retrial was ordered, and prosecutors sought a jail sentence of two years and 11 months. The prosecution claimed that Orlov published the article motivated by hostility “against traditional Russian spiritual, moral and patriotic values” and hatred of the Russian military, according to independent Russian news outlet Mediazona. In his closing remarks on Monday, Orlov said he had committed no crime and regretted nothing, instead slamming the “totalitarian” and “fascist” Russian state. “All these are links in the same chain: The death, or rather, the massacre of Alexey [Navalny], the judicial reprisals against other critics of the regime, including me, the strangulation of freedom in the country, the entry of Russian troops into Ukraine.” Navalny, an opposition politician and staunch Kremlin critic,died suddenlyearlier in February in an Arctic penal colony. While the circumstances of his death remain unclear, many, including world leaders and activist groups, blame Russian authorities for his death. The Kremlin rejected the allegation as “unsubstantiated and groundless.” The UN special rapporteur on human rights in Russia, Mariana Katzarova, called Orlov’s trial “an orchestrated attempt to silence the voices of human rights defenders in Russia”. Orlov himself, in a recent interview with the AFP news agency, had said he held no illusions about the trial’s outcome. Even as other campaigners fled Russia as antidefamation laws intensified and those found guilty of spreading “fake information” about the army could face up to 15 years in prison, Orlov remained in the country where he said he was “more useful” than abroad. He told AFP his long career spent working on documenting Soviet crimes and human rights abuses in modern Russia gave him no choice but to also campaign against the invasion of Ukraine.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/27/russian-activist-oleg-orlov-sentenced-to-30-months-in-prison
"Two years in, left and right united in opposing more US aid for Ukraine","With no end in sight to conflict with Russia, conservatives and progressives say ‘no’ to more military aid for Ukraine.","Two years after Russia invaded Ukraine, Americans’ support for the war is waning, creating a surprising alliance between the political left and right. Forty-one percentof Americans told Gallup pollsters three months ago that the United States is spending too much to support Ukraine on the battlefield. That compares with 24 percent of Americans who felt similarly in August 2022, six months after the start of the war. Perhaps most surprising, though, is that the shift is most pronounced among Republicans, the political party that has historically been known for its hawkishness. In March 2022, 9 percent of Republicans believed the US was supplying Ukraine with too much military aid; by December last year,48 percentof Republicans said their government was spending too much on Ukraine, according to Pew Research Centre surveys. The percentage of Democrats who view the Biden administration’s spending on Ukraine as excessive is only 16 percent, according to the same December poll. To be sure, partisan politics shapes the rift in Washington with Republicans in the House of Representatives refusing to pass legislation that includes $60bn in military aid for Ukraine. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson has said the bill passed by the Democratic-controlled Senate doesn’t do enough to protect the southern border from immigration, a stance that bolsters Donald Trump’s presidential campaign against incumbent Joe Biden. And Representative Marjorie Taylor Green leads a group of staunch conservatives in Congress who haveconsistently opposedUS funding for Ukraine. Still, a number of liberals, such as the writer Glen Greenwald and the podcaster Jimmy Dore, have joined conservatives, such as media presenter Tucker Carlson, in questioning the federal government’s priorities in spending billions on a distant war while the US has so many pressing needs, including immigration, affordable housing, healthcare and student debt relief. “The motivations for the far left and the far right are very different, but what unites them is where they arrive on Ukraine and also this anti-establishment populist strain,” said Dominik Stecula, assistant professor of political science at Colorado State University While some in the Republican Party — like presidential candidate Nikki Haley and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell — have a traditional national security focus reminiscent of the Cold War, the faction of the party that identifies with former President Trump’s political movement – MAGA, short for his campaign slogan Make America Great Again – is increasingly rejecting Ukraine spending. Isolationism has been a feature of Trump’s political message since 2016, explained Rachel Blum, an assistant professor in the University of Oklahoma’s Department of Political Science. “That is a really core thread of the MAGA movement.” The white working-class voters who make up the bulk of Trump’s supporters are animated by the sense that they are being left behind in a shape-shifting economy and money that would be better spent on their families is going to people of colour, the LGBTQ community and big business, including defence contractors. These sentiments often converge with racist, homophobic and transphobic beliefs. Blum told Al Jazeera that Trump’s isolationism is of a particular type that does not necessarily transfer to other conflicts. “Trump is much warmer toward Israel than he is toward Ukraine,” she explained. “So I think a lot of it has to do with Trump’s very personal animosity toward Ukraine and [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy and his past problems there and his affinity for [Russian President Vladimir] Putin.” As the MAGA movement has strengthened its hold on the Republican Party, she said, “it’s not surprising that those sentiments are starting to spill over.” Republicans are divided between those who remember Cold War policy and view Putin, a former Soviet intelligence officer, as a threat and those who are inclined to blindly follow Trump, she said. In a Venn diagram, those two groups do not overlap. “It’s hard for me to think of an example of a Republican who is pro-Ukraine aid and super supportive of Trump,” Blum said. As the November election draws closer, Blum said Trump’s position as the presumptive nominee gives Republicans an incentive to oppose aid to Ukraine to win favour with Trump if he returns to the White House. A number of factors played pivotal roles in the Republicans’  shift against Ukrainian aid, said David Hopkins, associate professor of political science at Boston College. A generational divide is part of the story. Older conservatives remember the Cold War alliance between the US and Western Europe against the Soviet Union while younger conservatives don’t have memories of the tensions between the West and the Soviet bloc, he said. Generally, Americans’ foreign policy worldview is likely to be influenced by authority figures they trust, including politicians and media personalities, he said. And conservatives are reflexively sceptical of policies favoured by Democrats, such as Biden’s support for Ukraine.    Moreover, Trump supporters’ sense of American exceptionalism extends to unfavourable views on Europe – which is seen as not wholly sharing the same values as the US – and, consequently, NATO. “They are open, just on the merits, to the argument that the US should be looking for ways to remove itself from involvement with European politics and alliances with international allies and organisations like NATO and the UN,” Hopkins said. Trump supporters are also open to viewing Putin as a traditionalist with similar values to theirs. “Under Putin, Russia has advertised itself internationally as a bulwark of traditional Christianity,” Hopkins said. “I think there are elements of the populist right in the United States that respond very positively to that message and indeed see figures like Putin as ideological allies in the culture war and international politics.” In aJuly 2022 piece for Foreign Policy, Stecula and co-author Jan Dutkiewicz argued that while the majority of Americans supported aid to Ukraine, many on the far right and far left argued the US should not intervene — an observation they explained with the “horseshoe theory”. The theory comes from French philosopher Jean-Pierre Faye, who believed extreme political positions aligned like a horseshoe magnet, which widens in the middle before nearly converging at its prongs, Stecula explained. On the far right, there is a warmth toward authoritarianism, he said. “I don’t think it’s a feature of conservatism, but it’s a feature of the Republican Party right now under Trump.” He agreed with Hopkins that the populist right is warming to Putin’s agenda, including his anti-LGBTQ policies. “He’s very well-versed in American culture wars. He talks about cancel culture. He talks about woke-ism all the time,” Stecula said. Meanwhile on the political left, the argument is that the Democrats have become gradually more hawkish since the Vietnam War in an effort to thwart Republican efforts, especially by former President Ronald Reagan, to portray the party as soft, and naive about the threats posed by communism. It is not uncommon, for instance, to hear progressives on popular podcasts express their view that the Democrats have, in fact, become even more hawkish than the Republicans as a means of rewarding their Wall Street donors with windfall profits that accrue from investments in arms suppliers such as Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and General Dynamics. Leftist writers and pundits contend that former President Barack Obama was the most interventionist, hawkish president in US history, launching air strikes or combat operations in at least seven countries – Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, Syria, Somalia and Pakistan – and dramatically expanding the Pentagon’s military footprints in Africa. And while Trump enthusiastically embraced the wars he inherited from Obama, even progressives acknowledge that he did not start any new wars, and he reduced the Pentagon’s military presence in Africa. In a 2023 interview with then-Fox News host Carlson, the progressive Greenwaldsaid:“I’ve been asking since February, in what conceivable way will the lives of American citizens be materially improved? How will you or your family’s lives be protected or fostered by sending tens of billions of dollars, now in excess of $100bn, for the war in Ukraine?”    Another popular progressive, the YouTuber Dore, said at an antiwar rally last year: “We could have spent that money saving lives with universal healthcare, but instead, we spend that money taking lives overseas, which is our specialty.” And Robert F Kennedy Jr, who is popular with both the left and the right in the US, announced his 2024 presidential campaign by contrasting the “$113bn committed to the Ukraine” with the “57 percent of Americans [who] can’t put their hand on $1,000 if they have an emergency” and the “one-quarter of Americans [who] go to bed hungry”. Stecula attributed the convergence of the left and right on the issue of Ukraine to a populist streak that has long been present in US politics. “They’re people on the fringes who reject the establishment, who are more anti-elite. And it’s a weird situation where people who are seemingly very different from each other can arrive at similar conclusions about what the US should be doing in regards to the conflict in Ukraine.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/26/with-no-end-in-sight-to-conflict-with-russia-conservatives-and-progressives-say-no-to-more-military-aid-for-ukraine
France’s Macron does not rule out Europeans sending troops to Ukraine,"French president opens door to European nations sending troops to Ukraine, although he cautioned that there was no consensus at this stage.","French President Emmanuel Macron has said that sending Western ground troops to Ukraine could not be “ruled out” as European allies announced new measures to deliver munitions and boost Kyiv in its fight against Russia. The comments on Monday came after some 20 European leaders gathered in Paris to send Russian President Vladimir Putin a message of European resolve on Ukraine and counter the Kremlin’s narrative that Moscow was bound to win a war now in its third year. “We are convinced that the defeat of Russia is indispensable to security and stability in Europe,” Macron told reporters after the meeting. “There’s no consensus today to send in an official, endorsed manner troops on the ground. But in terms of dynamics, nothing can be ruled out,” he said. “We will do everything that we must so that Russia does not win.” Macron declined to provide details about which nations were considering sending troops, saying he prefers to maintain some “strategic ambiguity”. A White House official told the Reuters news agency that the United States had no plans to send troops to fight in Ukraine and that there were also no plans to send NATO troops to fight in Ukraine. We are talking about our support for Ukraine and our collective security. A collective leap is necessary from all of us.pic.twitter.com/NViI9ntaVY — Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron)February 26, 2024  The conference in Paris signalled Macron’s eagerness to present himself as a European champion of Ukraine’s cause, amid growing fears that US support could wane in the coming years. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Poland’s President Andrzej Duda were among the European heads of state and government present at the conference, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy joined virtually. Duda said the most heated discussion was about whether to send troops to Ukraine and “there was no agreement on the matter”. “Opinions differ here, but there are no such decisions,” he said. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, who has opposed military aid to Ukraine, meanwhile said several NATO and European Union members were considering sending soldiers to Ukraine on a bilateral basis. “I can confirm there are countries that are prepared to send their own troops to Ukraine, there are countries that say never, among which Slovakia belongs, and there are countries that say this proposal needs to be considered,” he said before boarding his plane home. The conference was called as Ukraine suffered setbacks on eastern battlefields, with its generals complaining of shortages of arms and soldiers. It saw progress on a Czech-led initiative to buy hundreds of thousands of ammunition rounds from third countries, something that France has been cautious about as it wants to prioritise developing Europe’s own industry. Ammunition supplies have become a critical issue for Kyiv. The EU, though, is falling short of its target of sending Ukraine a million rounds of artillery shells by March. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said about 15 countries had agreed to sign up to his initiative. “We are talking about hundreds of thousands of pieces of ammunition we should and could get in relatively short time,” Fiala told reporters. Defence ministers had been mandated to come up with a plan within the next 10 days, Portugal’s Prime Minister Antonio Costa said. Rutte said the Netherlands would contribute 100 million euros ($108.5m) for the purchase of munitions overseas. He said the countries that would provide the munitions had asked not to be identified. “I think there was a great sense of urgency, particularly for the short term on ammunition and on air defence,” Rutte said. “I hope other countries will follow.” Macron also announced a new coalition would be set up to supply Ukraine with “missiles and bombs of medium and long range to carry out deep strikes”. There was a “broad consensus to do more and quicker”, he added, saying there was also a consensus to ramp up joint production of armaments with Ukraine and boost its own military industry. The Paris conference comes after France, Germany and the UK recently signed 10-year bilateral agreements with Ukraine to send a strong signal of long-term backing as Kyiv works to shore up Western support.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/26/macron-holds-meeting-in-paris-to-rally-european-support-for-ukraine
"Hungary ratifies Sweden’s NATO bid, clearing final obstacle to membership",Vote by Hungarian parliament ends more than 18 months of delays.,"Hungary’s parliament has voted to ratify Sweden’s bid to join NATO, bringing an end to more than 18 months of delays that have frustrated the alliance as it seeks to expand in response to Russia’s war on Ukraine. Monday’s vote, which passed with 188 members for and six against, was a culmination of months of wrangling by Hungary’s allies to persuade its nationalist government to lift its block on Sweden’s membership. The government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban submitted the protocols for approving Sweden’s entry into NATO in July 2022, but the matter had stalled in parliament over opposition by governing party lawmakers. Unanimous support among all NATO members is required to admit new countries, and Hungary is the last of the alliance’s 31 members to give its backing since Turkey ratified the request last month.  Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson called it “a historic day”. “We stand ready to shoulder our share of the responsibility for NATO’s security,” Kristersson wrote on X. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said the military alliance would soon be “stronger”. “Now that all Allies have approved, Sweden will become the 32nd #NATO Ally,” the secretary-general wrote on X. “Sweden’s membership will make us all stronger and safer.” Orban, a right-wing populist who has forged close ties with Russia, has said criticism of Hungary’s democracy by Swedish politicians had soured relations between the two countries and led to reluctance among lawmakers in his Fidesz party. But the vote on Monday removed the final membership hurdle for Sweden which, along with neighbouring Finland,first applied to join the alliance in May 2022, just a few months after the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Finland experienced fewer roadblocks in its membership application and joined NATO in April last year.    Addressing lawmakers before the vote on Sweden, Orban said: “Sweden and Hungary’s military cooperation and Sweden’s NATO accession strengthen Hungary’s security.” Orban criticised Hungary’s European Union and NATO allies for placing increased pressure on his government in recent months to move forward on bringing Sweden into the alliance. “Several people tried to intervene from the outside in the settling of our disputes [with Sweden], but this did not help but rather hampered the issue,” Orban said. “Hungary is a sovereign country. It does not tolerate being dictated by others, whether it be the content of its decisions or their timing.” This month, a bipartisan group of United States senators visited Hungary and announced it would submit a joint resolution to the US Congress condemning Hungary’s alleged democratic backsliding and urging Orban’s government to immediately lift its block on Sweden’s transatlantic integration. On Friday, Kristersson met with Orban in Budapest, where they appeared to achieve a reconciliation after months of diplomatic tensions. After their meeting, the leaders announced the conclusion of a defence industry agreement that will include Hungary’s purchase of four Swedish-made JAS 39 Gripen jets and the extension of a service contract for its existing Gripen fleet. Orban said the additional fighter jets “will significantly increase our military capabilities and further strengthen our role abroad” and will improve Hungary’s ability to participate in joint NATO operations. “To be a member of NATO together with another country means we are ready to die for each other,” Orban said. “A deal on defence and military capacities helps to reconstruct the trust between the two countries.” A presidential signature is needed to formally endorse the approval of Sweden’s NATO bid, which is expected within the next few days. Sweden will then be invited to accede to the Washington Treaty and officially become NATO’s 32nd member.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/26/hungary-ratifies-swedens-nato-bid-clearing-final-obstacle-to-membership
"Denmark’s Nord Stream probe finds sabotage, not enough grounds for case",Police find deliberate sabotage responsible for 2022 blasts at Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines but not sufficient grounds to pursue criminal case.,"Denmark says it has closed its investigation into mysterious blasts that in 2022 damaged two pipelines built to carry Russian gas to Europe, with authorities concluding they were an act of sabotage but there were not enough grounds for a criminal case. The explosions at the multibillion-dollar Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines contributed to tensions that followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine two years ago. Russia and Ukraine’s Western allies swiftly traded blame over the incident under the Baltic Sea, which also caused environmentally damaging releases of vast amounts of methane into the air. Danish police said in a statement on Monday that their investigation – one of three into the explosions – had found “there was deliberate sabotage” of the pipelines, but “the assessment is that there are not sufficient grounds to pursue a criminal case”. In response to the announcement, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the decision was “close to absurdity” and accused Denmark of closing the case to cover up for its allies. “On the one hand, they recognise that a deliberate sabotage took place, but on the other hand they are not moving forward,” Peskov told journalists, adding that Denmark had refused requests to provide information about its investigation. Denmark’s announcement came after Sweden also said earlier this monthit was closing its probe, noting that the case did not fall under its jurisdiction. Swedish officials also said they handed over to Germany “material that can be used as evidence in the German investigation”. The German federal prosecutor’s office said on Monday that its investigation continues and that it would not provide more information.  The undersea explosions shortly after midnight on September 26, 2022 ruptured the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which was Russia’s main natural gas supply route to Germany until Russia cut off supplies at the end of the previous month. They also damaged the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which never entered service because Germany suspended its certification process shortly before the invasion of Ukraine. The explosions took place about 80 metres (260 feet) underwater on the ocean floor in the Baltic Sea. Seismic measurements indicated that they occurred shortly before the discovery of unexplained leaks. Months after the detonations, there is no accepted explanation. As investigations continue, a series of unconfirmed reports have variously accused Russia, the United States and Ukraine of sabotage. The pipelines were long a target of criticism by the United States and some of its allies, who warned that they posed a risk to Europe’s energy security by increasing dependence on Russian gas. Russia has accused the US of staging the explosions, which they have described as a terror attack. The US has denied involvement. In March 2023, German mediareportedthat a pro-Ukraine group was involved in the explosions using a vessel and setting off from the German port of Rostock. Ukraine rejected suggestions it might have ordered the attack and German officials voiced caution over the accusation. Swedish prosecutors earlier hinted that the identity of the perpetrator was likely to remain unclear. Beyond their geopolitical impact, the Nord Stream pipeline leaks were a huge environmental disaster with local wildlife affected and huge volumes of methane discharged into the Baltic Sea in what observers believe could be the single largest release of methane due to human activity.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/26/denmarks-nord-stream-probe-finds-sabotage-not-enough-grounds-for-case
"Zelenskyy says 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers killed in war with Russia",Ukrainian president’s comments are the first time that Kyiv has confirmed the number of its losses since the Russian invasion began.,"Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in action in the two years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion. Speaking at the “Ukraine. Year 2024” forum in Kyiv, Zelenskyy said that “each of these losses is a great sacrifice” for Ukraine. He added that “tens of thousands of civilians” had been killed in occupied areas of Ukraine, but said that no exact figures would be available until the war was over. It’s the first time that Kyiv has confirmed the number of its losses since the start of Russia’s full-scale war against Ukraine on February 24, 2022. Russia has also provided few official casualty figures. Independent Russian news outlet Mediazona said on Saturday that about 75,000 Russian men died in 2022 and 2023 fighting in the war. A United States intelligence report declassified in mid-December 2023 estimated that 315,000 Russian troops had been killed or wounded in Ukraine. If accurate, the figure would represent 87 percent of the roughly 360,000 troops Russia had before the war, according to the report. It has been two years since RussiainvadedUkraine and commemorations to mark the second anniversary brought expressions of continued support, new bilateral security agreements and new aid commitments from Ukraine’s Western allies. But Ukraine’s Defence Minister Rustem Umerov highlighted that they still needed to deliver on their commitments if Kyiv is to have any chance of holding out against Moscow and stressed that delays in arms shipments will cost lives. “We look to the enemy: Their economy is almost $2 trillion, they use up to 15 percent official and nonofficial budget [funds] for the war, which constitutes over $100bn annually. So basically whenever a commitment doesn’t come on time, we lose people, we lose territory,” he said, speaking at the Kyiv forum. Europe has admitted it will fall far short of a plan to deliver more than one million artillery shells to Ukraine by March, instead hoping to complete the shipments by the end of the year. Umerov highlighted that such delays put Ukraine at a further disadvantage “in the mathematics of war” against Russia, which the West has said is increasingly building a war economy. Kyiv has also been weakened by the blocking of a vital $60bn US aid package amid political wrangling in the US Congress. US President Joe Bidensaidthe hold-ups directly contributed to Ukraine being forced to withdraw from Avdiivka. On Sunday, Ukraine’s Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said he was “deeply convinced that the US will not abandon Ukraine in terms of financial, military and armed support”. In recent weeks, fighting has intensified on parts of the front line. On Sunday, Russian shelling and rocket strikes continued to pummel Ukraine’s south and east, as local Ukrainian officials reported that at least two civilians were killed and eight others were wounded in the Zaporizhia and Kherson provinces. Moscow and Kyiv also continued to trade nightly drone attacks, with Ukraine’s air defences shooting down 16 of 18 Iranian-made Shahed drones launched overnight by Moscow and a Russian drone on Sunday morning striking an unspecified facility in Ukraine’s western Khmelnytskyi region, the regional military administration reported without giving details. Russian troops also appeared to be pressing on west ofAvdiivka, the strategic city whose capture this month handed Moscow a significant victory. Zelenskyy told a news conference on Sunday that Ukraine has a clear plan for a new counteroffensive against Russian forces. Kyiv’s troops conducted a counteroffensive last year, but were unable to break through prepared defensive lines in the Russian-occupied south and east. “There is a plan [for a counteroffensive], the plan is clear, I can’t tell you the details,” Zelenskyy said. He said that a major shake-up that saw the head of Ukraine’s military replaced earlier this month was connected to the new plan of action on the battlefield. “This plan is related to the change of management; there are corresponding changes. Several plans will be prepared due to a leak of information,” Zelenskyy said, without elaborating. Earlier he said that Kyiv’s plans to conduct a counteroffensive last year had been leaked and ended up “on a desk in the Kremlin” before the operation had even begun. Meanwhile at the forum in Kyiv, besides highlighting issues in military deliveries, Umerov insisted that Ukrainian forces were doing “everything that’s possible, and also what’s impossible, to secure a breakthrough” this year. The defence minister said that a “strong” military strategy is already in place for the coming months, but did not disclose details.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/25/ukraines-umerov-says-delays-in-western-arms-deliveries-costing-lives
Should Russia pay Ukraine to rebuild – or even to defeat its own invasion?,The EU finds itself in uncharted legal territory as it ponders using Russia’s frozen assets against it.,"Within days of invading Ukraine in February 2022, Russia lost control of the assets its central bank held in foreign currencies abroad. Some $300bn was frozen in the European Union, United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Japan – about half the bank’s holdings – as Ukraine’s allies sought to hobble Russia’s ability to wage war. Legally, the money belongs to Russia, but the EU, which holds the largest chunk – about $207bn – is struggling to find a legal way to use Russia’s money to rebuild Ukraine’s shattered infrastructure. Some experts believe Russia’s money could even be used to generate immediate benefits for Ukraine’s war effort – especially since $60bn of US military aid remains stalled in Congress. On January 29, EU leaders told European financial institutions to keep separate accounts for Russian-immobilised money, along with any profits made from investing it, pending a decision on what to do. “This decision paves the way for the council to decide on a possible establishment of a financial contribution to the EU budget raised on these net profits to support Ukraine and its recovery and reconstruction at a later stage,” said the European Council. The G7 supported its decision. “So far, the EU has been putting out into the public domain the idea of taxing this money,” Anton Moiseienko, an international law expert at Australian National University, told Al Jazeera.    Tax on the profits made from investing the money is said to amount to about $2.5bn. “What we’re seeing today is the beginning of a more ambitious approach … separating the profits suggests that the entire [proceeds] might be sent to Ukraine,” Moiseienko said. The proceeds could amount to between $15bn and $17bn over four years. The legal reasoning is that Russia will, at some point, be called upon to pay compensation for invading Ukraine. “What we have here is a recognised debt. Russia owes reparations to Ukraine,” said Moiseienko. “At some point, it does become rather perverse that we all know Russia owes the debt and we’re going to pay Ukraine to rebuild but we’re not going to touch the Russian money.” Some law experts go further. “I would invest it in the defence industry,” Maria Gavouneli, an international law professor at Athens University and director of the Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy, a think tank, told Al Jazeera. “We wouldn’t be buying bullets to send Ukraine, we’d be making bullets to send Ukraine. Under such a formula, you could use the entire principal [of $207bn] as well as the proceeds,” Gavouneli said. EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton last month floated the idea of a 100-billion-euro ($108bn) European Defence Investment Programme (EDIP), to revive Europe’s dormant defence industries, without specifying where the money would come from. Investing Russia’s money would enable the EU to plough vast resources into raising the production of artillery rounds and air defence missiles which Ukraine sorely needs. It would, perhaps, be the first time in history that an aggressor’s assets would be used to help the defender’s war effort, Gavouneli said. But, she said, it would not amount to a confiscation of Russian assets, which would be illegal. “When the war is over there has to be an accounting. It has to be clear that Russia’s property can be returned to Russia. If it is going to be kept against reparations [to rebuild Ukraine], that will be decided at that time,” she said. Ukrainian experts go further, still. Russian money could be leveraged and used as collateral for loans worth several times its nominal value, Tymofiy Mylovanov, president of the Kyiv School of Economics, told Al Jazeera. “You can get much more than the proceeds if you need to,” Mylovanov said. “It also serves to bring a sense of fairness.” As attractive as all this sounds, there are also serious risks involved, bogging the discussion down in a legal and political morass of dissent and fear of consequences. The EU was meant to propose a legal formula to make use of Russia’s assets last December, but nothing of this emerged publicly. Another discussion was to be held earlier this month – but, again, there was no decision. One fear is the risk of retaliation by Russia which, on December 29, said it had a list of European, US and other assets it could seize. Russian state news agency RIA put their value at $288bn last month. RIA did not provide details, and it was not clear if this sum included assets Western companies have already written down or divested themselves of. For example, British Petroleum pulled out of a stake in Russian state oil company Rosneft, valued at $14bn, days after the war began. Shell withdrew from Russian gas projects valued at $3bn. The greater fear, however, is the reputational impact on the US dollar and the Euro, currently the world’s two most dependable reserve currencies, attracting vast investments from governments, central banks, corporations and individuals around the world. “It will undermine the confidence of other countries in the United States as well as in the EU as economic guarantors. Therefore, such actions are fraught with very, very serious consequences,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists in December. The European Central Bank agrees. “The euro is the second most important currency in the world, and we have to consider its long-term reputation,” said ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos late last year. “Weaponising a currency inevitably reduces its attractiveness and encourages the emergence of alternatives,” Bank of Italy governor Fabio Panetta said last month. Despite all this, EU leaders have tried to hammer out a new legal theory that protects the reputation of the euro and deals a measure of justice for Ukraine. Although states are obliged to respect the assets of other states, international law provides an exception known as countermeasures, Dapo Akande, professor of public international law at Oxford University, told Al Jazeera. “Countermeasures just means that you are taking action which is ordinarily unlawful, but is justified as a response to a prior unlawful action by the other state,” said Akande. In this case, Russia’s unlawful act was to wage a war of aggression, against the statutes of the United Nations Charter and its recognition of Ukraine’s borders in 1991. Countermeasures carry an important condition, says Akande, “that the object of it is to induce compliance by the other state with its obligations, which means countermeasures have to be temporary and reversible and inducing compliance”. In other words, if Russia withdrew from Ukraine, its money should be returnable, so any investments made with it should be reversible. The pricklier question is who can enforce countermeasures. “Can the states that are not the direct victims of the violation, ie states that are not Ukraine, seize assets?” asked Akande. “There’s been a growing number of lawyers who’ve come out and said yes, that would be perfectly lawful,” said Moiseienko. Still, by acting on Ukraine’s behalf, the EU would be breaking new legal ground that Russia might challenge in European courts. The impetus may ultimately be provided by unprecedented political circumstances. The longer US funding for Ukraine remains blocked by allies of presidential hopeful Donald Trump in Congress, and the more Russia challenges European sovereignty by pushing deeper into Ukraine, the less tenable it may become politically to hold in awe the untouchability of Russian assets.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/25/should-russia-pay-ukraine-to-rebuild-or-even-to-defeat-its-own-invasion
"Bitter but resilient: Ukraine fights on, two years into Russia’s war","Short of ammunition though not determination, Ukraine faces an uncertain future. What is clear is that it won’t buckle to Russia.","Kharkiv, Ukraine –Andriy’s undermanned squad can only shoot 10 shells a day at encroaching Russian troops because of a dire shortage of ammunition. The 45-year-old suffers from stomach pains, deteriorating eyesight and other consequences of multiple contusions that landed him in hospital several times. Two years ago, Andriy defended Kyiv in the full-scale war’s first weeks until Russian troops withdrew after heavy losses, and fought in the eastern town of Bakhmut that fell to the Wagner private army last May. The timing and duration of tours to “zero” positions, or the front lines of the eastern Donbas region, are unpredictable, and his commanding officers deliberately report less “zero” time for him to decrease his pay, he said. But when it comes to Andriy’s determination to stand his ground, he has no doubts or qualms. “This is my land, understand? I grew up here. I eat bread grown on this land. That’s what keeps me going,” he told Al Jazeera while on a break in the eastern city of Kharkiv. He withheld his last name and his unit’s location in accordance with wartime regulations. Theabsolute majorityof Ukrainians – 85 percent – are confident of victory in the war that began two years ago today, according to a survey by the Rating Group, a Kyiv-based pollster, released on Monday. Most of the remaining 15 percent hail from eastern or southern regions next to the front lines and occupied areas that witness the worst consequences of the war firsthand, it said. “I’d agree for peace if they want to keep the occupied lands,” Konstantin, a resident of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city that sits near the Russian border, told Al Jazeera. Last spring, the shockwave from an explosion right next to his apartment building shattered his windows and blew open his solid metal front door. He stayed on, but almost daily bombardments and the failure of last year’s counteroffensive have worn him out. “I don’t want to grow old hearing the incoming [shelling] every day and night, because one day it’ll hit my home,” he said. Western aid is crucial to Ukraine’s victory, say 79 percent of Ukrainians, according to the Rating Group’s poll. But the aid is dwindling, while Western governments tacitly urge Kyiv to sign a truce with Moscow by recognising the loss of occupied areas that amount to one-fifth of Ukraine’s territory. Yet, the public mantra of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and every Ukrainian politician is: Moscow has to withdraw from all occupied areas before peace talks can begin. “The political acknowledgment of the occupation is impossible, no politician will go for it, and the public won’t accept it, ” Kyiv-based analyst Alexey Kushch told Al Jazeera. “There are unofficial talks about freezing the conflict according to the Korean scenario,” he said, referring to the Korean Armistice of 1953, under which North and South Korea agreed to an end to fighting without formally ending the war. But until the war is over, Ukraine will “officially announce maximal goals” to mobilise the public and Western allies, Kushch said. The war has cost Ukraine 30 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) and 3.5 million jobs, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Wednesday. But the biggest loss is to its people. At least 6.5 million people have fled abroad, and the population in Kyiv-controlled areas is below 30 million, analysts say – a far cry from the 52 million at the dawn of Ukraine’s independence in 1991. Many refugees have nothing to go back to. Last June, Halyna, a 28-year-old woman from the southern city ofMariupol, where tens of thousands of civilians died during a months-long siege, told Al Jazeera about the horrors her two young children went through during Russian air raids and shelling. “When things got real tense, they just convulsed with hysteria in those basements. And they asked questions: ‘Does it hurt to die?’ she said. After moving to the Czech Republic, her children are safe – but still scarred. “Only recently, my son stopped being frightened by the sound of planes. The daughter sometimes weeps at night, wants to go back to her past life, to her pillow with [the images of] cats,” she said. “There’s a new life looming for us, but it’s not in Ukraine, unfortunately,” she said. Last week, Russia scored a rare victory after Ukrainian forces pulled out of the town of Avdiivka in the Donbas region held by Russian-backed separatists since 2014. But the Kremlin-funded propaganda blew it out of proportion. “The Kyiv regime and its protectors have missed a blow they will possibly not recover from,” publicist Kirill Strelnikovwroteon Tuesday. The news coincided with the death of jailed opposition leader Alexey Navalny, and Russian President Vladimir Putin gloated. “The objectives our ill-wishers had in terms of limiting, isolating Russia, obviously fell apart,”he saidon Wednesday. While independent observers reject Putin’s assessment, they admit that Russia’s economy has shown unexpected resilience to Western sanctions designed to crush it. On Friday, the US imposed its latest round of sanctions against Russia, in response to Navalny’s death in an Arctic prison. “The sanctions didn’t affect Russia’s economy the way they had been expected to, Russia’s isolation didn’t become total,” Temur Umarov of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, a think tank in Berlin, told Al Jazeera. With all walks of life around them militarised, many Ukrainians tilted to the political right largely accepting fiercely anti-Russian slogans spawned by fringe nationalist groups, said Kyiv-based human rights advocate Vyacheslav Likhachev. These groups stood for banning all things Russian, including the language, the literature and the Orthodox Church that reported toMoscow Patriarch Kirill. These days, millions of Russian-speaking Ukrainians voluntarily switch to Ukrainian in daily life, while Zelenskyy’s government is pondering a ban on the Russia-affiliated church. “Radical ideas that used to be marginal are now shared by a sizable part of the public and are to some extent implemented by the government,” Likhachev told Al Jazeera. What the war made clear is the sense of identity, unity and true political independence. “The war showed us that a sovereign state can’t exist simply by default. That sovereignty demands constant work on self-determination, self-understanding, self-respect,” Svetlana Chunikhina, vice president of the Association of Political Psychologists, a group in Kyiv, told Al Jazeera. Ukrainians “acquired the sense of volumetric political optics that lets them see themselves as full-fledged participants of the historical process within the [European] continent and the world,” she said. And they didn’t forget about their trademarksense of humourthat helped them survive the war’s first months. After Poland objected to the import of Ukrainian grain citing concerns from its farmers, Ukrainians retorted: “Wonder whether Polish farmers can stop Russian tanks?”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/24/this-is-my-land-ukrainians-are-bitter-but-resilient-two-years-into-war
Western leaders visit Ukraine to show solidarity as war enters third year,Visit comes as Kyiv is on the defensive amid flagging Western aid and Russian territorial gains.,"Western leaders including the European Commission’s Ursula von der Leyen and Canada’s Justin Trudeau have visited Kyiv to show solidarity with Ukraine as it enters the third year of its war with Russia. Von der Leyen, Trudeau, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and Belgium Prime Minister Alexander De Croo arrived in the country on Saturday on an overnight train from neighbouring Poland as Ukraine marks the second anniversary of Moscow’s invasion on the defensive amid flagging Western aid and Russian territorial gains. “We have been fighting for this for 730 days of our lives. We will win on the best day of our lives,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said at an anniversary event at Kyiv’s Gostomel Airport, which was targeted by Russia in the first days of its invasion. Oleksandr Syrskii, the chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, said: “I am convinced that unity is our victory. And it will definitely happen. Because light always conquers darkness.” Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) major democracies, chaired this year by Italy, also held a videoconference with Zelenskyy later on Saturday, vowing to continue supporting Ukraine. “As Ukraine enters the third year of this relentless war, its government and its people can count on the G7’s support for as long as it takes,” the group said in a statement. It added that it would look for ways to make Moscow pay for the damage inflicted by its invasion: “We will continue to raise the cost of Russia’s war, degrade Russia’s sources of revenue and impede its efforts to build its war machine.” In a post on the social media platform X, von der Leyen said: “More than ever, we stand firmly by Ukraine. Financially, economically, militarily, morally. Until the country is finally free”. At the Wall of Remembrance, I pay my respects to the Ukrainians who made the ultimate sacrifice fighting for our values. Freedom, democracy, the rule of law. They are in our hearts and minds. Their legacy lives on. And it will shine through the day Ukraine wins this war.pic.twitter.com/2SeulZsNPe — Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen)February 24, 2024  Trudeau said that Ukrainians were fighting for “our collective future”. “They are fighting to remind the world that democracy is both important enough to die for and strong enough to win,” he said in a statement before arriving in Kyiv. “As the war continues, that is what is at stake. And that is why Canada has stood with Ukraine since day one.” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg expressed confidence that Ukraine will join the transatlantic military alliance. “It is not a question of if, but of when. As we prepare you for that day, NATO will continue to stand with Ukraine,” he said. On Saturday in Kyiv, Zelenskyy also signed security agreements with Canada’s Trudeau and Italy’s Meloni intended to shore up Ukraine’s security until it can reach its aim of becoming a NATO member. Trudeau’s office said Canada would provide more than 3 billion Canadian dollars ($2.22bn) in financial and defence aid to Ukraine in 2024, while Meloni gave no financial details about the Italian accord. Earlier, the United Kingdom announced a new $311m defence package to help boost the production of “urgently needed artillery ammunition” for Ukraine. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promised: “We will stand with Ukraine today and tomorrow, prepared to do whatever it takes, for as long as it takes, until they prevail.”    Kyiv’s fortunes have suffered in recent weeks amid shortages of military supplies, with Russia this month capturing the eastern town ofAvdiivkain its biggest victory on the battlefield in months. United States President Joe Biden has blamed Republicans in Congress for holding up a $61bn package of military funding, casting the support as crucial to Kyiv’s efforts to repel Moscow. Biden on Friday announced Washington’s largest package ofsanctions against Russia, pledging to keep up pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “war machine”. On Friday,Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kulebadelivered a rebuke to sceptics who doubt Kyiv’s ability to defeat Moscow, insisting that “Ukraine will win the war” and victory would come “sooner rather than later” with international support. Zelenskyy earlier this week told diplomats in an emotional address that he remained “convinced that victory awaits us”. While neither Ukraine nor Russia has provided official estimates of the number of military casualties in the war, both sides claim to have inflicted heavy losses. The New York Times in August cited US officials who estimated that about 70,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed and a further 100,000-120,000 wounded. In December, leaked US intelligence suggested that about 315,000 Russian troops had been killed or injured. In its latest report, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine said this week that it been able to corroborate the conflict-related deaths of 10,582 civilians since February 2022. It had verified that 19,875 civilians had been wounded. “The actual numbers are likely significantly higher,” it said.

"Russia-Ukraine war: List of key events, day 731",These are the main developments on the second anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.,"Here is the situation on Saturday, February 24, 2024.      ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/24/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-731
"Two years after Putin ordered a war on Ukraine, what’s changed in Russia?","While fears simmer on the border near Ukraine, life goes on as usual in most of Russia as Putin prepares for a predictable election.","On December 30,a volley of rocket firehit the Russian city of Belgorod near the Ukrainian border. “I live in the very centre of the city, and three or four things fell just outside my home. I don’t know whether it was a shell or shrapnel or what,” said 21-year-old Yuliya, a journalist from Belgorod who requested Al Jazeera use only her first name. “The buildings nearby were seriously damaged. My own building was fine, but it was very frightening, very loud. In that moment, you can only think, ‘This is the end.’’” Belgorod’s been bombarded severaltimessince the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, but December’s barrage was the deadliest. At least 25 civilians, among them five children, were killed in the attack blamed on Ukraine’s armed forces. For the residents of the Russian border city, the war had come home. “The atmosphere in the city shifted dramatically since December 30 because people in Belgorod finally felt what war is, that it’s nearby and that it’s not so safe in the city as it seemed,” Yuliya said. “Life has greatly changed.” She said children now know what it’s like to be shelled, recognise the sound of air raid sirens and know how to tie a tourniquet. “Now the council doesn’t discuss how many tulips to plant for the summer festivals but how to paint the insides of bomb shelters. I think life in Belgorod will never be the same.” In the weeks after the invasion on February 24, 2022, the picture looked bleak for Russia as the rouble crashed and foreign investors fled. But the economy has withstood sanctions. “The Russian economy went through multiple stress tests,” economist Artem Kochnev said. “The first one was in 2014 when the first round of sanctions was introduced and Russia took some lessons from that specifically by building a national financial infrastructure and tightening the grip over the financial sector. The second was the COVID crisis and how they tried to manage logistics in very rapidly changing circumstances. So they had some experience they could draw upon.” Kochnev added that the gradual implementation of sanctions gave Russia time to readjust its oil exports. The European Union halted its imports from Russia, so Russia turned to China and India instead, using a “shadow fleet” of barges registered with shell companies in third countries such as Cameroon. Russia also had vast cash reserves from its petroleum sales, which were originally set aside to offset the shock from any drop in oil prices. “Now this money has been used for completely another purpose – financing the war,” Kochnev said. “That’s a fiscal stimulus which is actually larger than what government has put into the economy during the COVID crisis.” Major global brands, such as McDonalds and Starbucks, have left Russia, forced to sell off their assets far below market value to buyers approved by a government committee before being rebranded. For example, Starbucks has become Stars Coffee. A few firms have effectively been nationalised. According to Kochnev, the assets went mainly to powerful and well-connected individuals, which may have created some friction between elites. Despite adramatic mutinyby Wagner mercenaries last year, Putin’s position appears to be stable. He is expected to win a fifth six-year presidential term in the upcomingMarch election. Assuming he lasts until the end of his term, he’d be the longest-serving Russian leader since the tsars, overtaking even Josef Stalin. Two candidates running on an anti-war platform, Yekaterina Duntsova and Boris Nadezhdin, were disqualified by the Central Election Commission despite neither being considered a serious contender against Putin. The war has certainly left an impact on society: After a decade of decline, problematic drinking has reportedly become more common, which some health experts have attributed to geopolitical confrontations. But on the whole, life goes on. There are still music concerts and exhibitions, and customers can still buy foreign goods, such as Coca-Cola, which have been rerouted through third countries such as Uzbekistan. Some Russians are even upbeat. “I’ve heard a lot about propaganda in the West. It makes people idiots,” 51-year-old Alec from St Petersburg said. “But absolutely everything is still here. You think people don’t want to make money? Nothing has changed except the psychopathic liberals have left. Whether we like it or not, Russia has started it’s great game, and it’s very interesting to see. You have to be here to understand it.” On the front lines in Ukraine, nearly 45,000 Russians have been killed in action since February 2022, the independent outlet MediaZona has reported. That is three times the Red Army’s losses during its decade-long occupation of Afghanistan. Even so, Russia has greater resources in terms of manpower than Ukraine. Since Ukraine’s failed counteroffensive in the summer, Russian forces have slowly inched forward, capturing the town ofAvdiivkathis month after a fierce, months-long battle. “Russia’s hidden mobilisation has continued,” said Oleg Ignatov, senior Russia analyst for the International Crisis Group think tank. “Regions are given the number of contract soldiers they have to call up. As a result, regional officials persuade whoever they can to sign up. These include debtors, people with financial and lifestyle problems, single men, ex-criminals and so on as well as [state employees]. The military, in turn, persuades conscripts to sign a contract. Also, more foreigners are coming to the front. But apparently, such methods work. The Russian army manages to replenish its ranks faster than the Ukrainian army.” Russia’s defence industry appears to still be functioning at full capacity, pumping out shells to be fired on Ukrainian positions. “Russian military production has grown significantly, including by restoring production at old Soviet factories,” Ignatov added. “Russia has been able to outpace Western ammunition supplies and maintain its advantage in equipment and long-range weapons. Sanctions, of course, increase the price of production and create logistical problems but do not hinder the production of shells and hardly prevent Russia from modernising old Soviet equipment and sending it to the front. Russia’s industrial capability to produce weapons is very large but not enough to create a decisive advantage, so Russia buys ammunition from North Korea.” Besides the shelling of Belgorod, there have been several cross-border raids by the Russian Volunteer Corps, a militia of Russian citizens with far-right nationalist views fighting for Ukraine, engaging in brief skirmishes with Russian forces and border guards before falling back. Their strategic impact on the war has been limited but has undermined Russia’s sense of security. Meanwhile, drones have targeted Russia’s oil infrastructure, spectacularly blowing up a fuel export terminal near St Petersburg in January. “Ukraine has conducted a series of successful attacks on Russian infrastructure and apparently managed to destroy several units of valuable and expensive equipment, but in general, these attacks do not change the overall picture, which is still in Russia’s favour,” Ignatov said. This will bring little comfort to Yuliya, whose heart still races whenever she steps outside. “Some of my friends who’ve left Russia and see the shelling of our city say, ‘Well, what did you expect? People are dying in Ukraine as well, and rockets are flying from Belgorod to Kharkiv,’” she said. “But I live here, and no matter what I do, I can’t stop these rockets. No one in our city can. So I don’t know how you can say that we had it coming. It’s very upsetting.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/23/two-years-after-putin-ordered-a-war-on-ukraine-whats-changed-in-russia
US sanctions 500 Russia-linked targets ahead of Ukraine war anniversary,US reiterates support for Ukraine with largest package of economic restrictions as Republicans block military aid.,"The United States has issued sanctions on more than 500 Russian-linked targets in response to Moscow’sinvasion of Ukrainetwo years ago and the death in prison of opposition leader Alexey Navalny. Washington has also imposed new export restrictions on nearly 100 entities for providing support to Russia and take action to further reduce Russia’s energy revenues, US President Joe Biden said on Friday. The entities and sectors targeted include Russia’s Mir payment system, Russian financial institutions and its military industrial base, sanctions evasion, and future energy production, and will also include officials believed to be involved in the death of Navalny, the Treasury and State departments said. The measures represent the largest single tranche of penalties since Russia invaded Ukraine onFebruary 24, 2022, and come on the back of a series of new arrests and indictments that the US Department of Justice announced on Thursday, targeting Russian businessmen, including the head of state-owned VTB Bank, Russia’s second-largest bank. “They will ensure Putin pays an even steeper price for his aggression abroad and repression at home,” Biden said of the sanctions. The new economic restrictions come after the White House said this week that it was preparing“major” penaltiesafter the death ofNavalny, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s most prominent critic, in an Arctic penal colony. Biden said on Thursday, after meeting Navalny’s widow Yulia and daughter Dasha in California, that “we’re going to be announcing sanctions against Putin, who is responsible for his death, tomorrow”. Today, I met with Yulia and Dasha Navalnaya – Aleksey Navalny's loved ones – to express my condolences for their devastating loss. Aleksey's legacy of courage will live on in Yulia and Dasha, and the countless people across Russia fighting for democracy and human rights.pic.twitter.com/aiCcgTrws3 — President Biden (@POTUS)February 22, 2024  The Kremlin hasdeniedPutin was behind Navalny’s death and slammed the West for making assumptions before there was proof to back up its allegations. Deputy US Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo told the Reuters news agency on Thursday that the sanctions will also be taken in partnership with other countries who are looking to keep up the pressure on Russia over its war on Ukraine. “Tomorrow we’ll release hundreds of sanctions just here in the United States, but it’s important to step back and remember that its not just America taking these actions,” Adeyemo said. Washington has been coordinating with its European allies in its efforts to cut Russia off from the global economy. The European Union on Friday announced its13th package of sanctionsagainst Russia, banning nearly 200 additional entities and individuals accused of involvement in the two-year conflict. “Today, we are further tightening the restrictive measures against Russia’s military and defence sector,” said EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell. “We remain united in our determination to dent Russia’s war machine and help Ukraine win its legitimate fight for self-defence.” Commitment met: two years after the start of the full-scale Russian aggression against#Ukraine, the 13th package of sanctions is adopted. These measures are taking a heavy toll on Russia’s economy.https://t.co/65gyOcE67t — Josep Borrell Fontelles (@JosepBorrellF)February 23, 2024  The United Kingdom hasimposed sanctionson six officials overseeing the penal colony where Navalny died. “Sanctions and export controls are geared towards slowing Russia down, making it harder for them to fight their war of choice in Ukraine,” Adeyemo said. The Biden administration has exhausted money previously approved for Ukraine, and a request for additional funds for military aid to Ukraine is stuck in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. “But ultimately, in order to speed Ukraine up, to give them the ability to defend themselves, Congress needs to act to give Ukraine the resources that they need and the weapons they need,” Adeyemo added.    The US and its allies have additionally capped the price at which Russian crude oil can be sold on global markets, frozen billions of dollars of its central bank’s assets and imposed trade restrictions in an attempt to block technology and equipment used by Moscow to supply its military. However, they have not dented Russia’sability to wage war. On Friday, Putin claimed that 95 percent of Russia’s strategic nuclear forces had been modernised and that the Air Force had just taken delivery of four new supersonic nuclear-capable bombers. In a recorded speech to mark Russia’s annual Defender of the Fatherland Day, which celebrates the armed forces, he also praised soldiers fighting in Ukraine as heroes battling for “truth and justice”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/23/us-to-sanction-500-russia-linked-targets-ahead-of-ukraine-war-anniversary
More than 14 million people fled homes in Ukraine since Russia invasion: UN,"As second anniversary of conflict nears, millions remain displaced at home and abroad, with ‘no end in sight’ to war.","The United Nations has said that more than 14 million Ukrainians were forced to flee their homes at some point in the two years since Russia’s invasion, as UN rights chief Volker Turk spoke of the “horrific human cost” of the conflict. AsRussia’s war in Ukrainegrinds into its third year, the UN’s International Organization for Migration (IOM) said on Thursday that nearly 6.5 million people are now living outside the country as refugees. It said an estimated 3.7 million people are still displaced within Ukraine. Reflecting on thetoll of the war, which started when Russia invaded its neighbour on February 24, 2022, IOM director general Amy Pope said: “The destruction is widespread, loss of life and suffering continues.” While a total of more than 14 million people – nearly one-third of Ukraine’s population – fled their homes at some point during the war, the agency said that more than 4.5 million people returned home to date, from either abroad or displacement within the country.

But, it pointed out, needs were continuing to grow, outpacing resources. Some 14.6 million people remain in need of some form of humanitarian assistance in 2024, IOM said. For those who return home, the challenges are immense. Federico Soda, director of the IOM’s humanitarian response and recovery department, said returnees faced “insecurity, loss of livelihoods, damaged housing and infrastructure, and strained services”. Since the start of the war, the agency has received $957m in donations. Overall, the UN says it needs $4.2bn this year to provide humanitarian aid in Ukraine and to refugees who have fled.

"‘Era of peace in Europe over’ says Ukraine, as Avdiivka falls to Russians","Russian forces capture their first city in more than nine months, partly a result of failing weapons deliveries from allies.","Russiaachievedits first major territorial success in more than nine months in the Ukraine war, capturing the eastern city of Avdiivka last week. The once-bustling community of 30,000 civilians was gone and it was doubtful whether the local employer, Europe’s biggest coking plant, could be returned to operability soon. But the capture offered Russian President Vladimir Putin bragging rights ahead of theelectionhe faces in March. Russian forces began to press Ukrainian defenders in earnest last October, after Ukraine’s three-month-long summer counteroffensive had ended, promising to deal Ukraine a winter blow. They formed a pincer to the north and south of the city, and during the four months of most intense fighting Ukraine’s Tavria forces commander, Oleksandr Tarnavskyi, estimated they had sustained 47,000 casualties, and lost 364 tanks, 248 artillery systems, 748 armoured fighting vehicles and five aircraft. The news fell like a bombshell on the continuing Munich Security Conference, where Ukraine’s Western allies convened to survey a gloomy outlook for 2024. “The era of peace in Europe is over,” Dmytro Kuleba, Ukrainian foreign minister, told those present. “And every time Ukrainian soldiers withdraw from a Ukrainian town because of the lack of ammunition, think of it not only in terms of democracy and defending the world-based order, but also in terms of Russian soldiers getting a few kilometres closer to your towns.” Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also seized upon the moment to press allies for more weapons supplies. “Unfortunately, keeping Ukraine in artificial deficits of weapons, particularly in deficits of artillery and long-range capabilities, allows Putin to adapt to the current intensity of the war. This self-weakening of democracy over time undermines our joint results,” Zelenskyy told the conference. Many Ukrainians squarely blame the United States for the emboldening of Russia, as a $60.6bn military assistance measure for Ukraine remains stalled in Congress. Unfortunately, keeping Ukraine in artificial deficits of weapons, particularly in deficits of artillery and long-range capabilities, allows Putin to adapt to the current intensity of the war. This self-weakening of democracy over time undermines our joint results. — Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa)February 18, 2024  “In 2022, the [US] administration [of Joe Biden] submitted funding requests in the spring, almost immediately after the invasion,” wrote Kyiv School of Economics director Tymofiy Mylovanov. “But in 2023, it waited until mid-fall to announce what it plans to submit,” he said. “Avdiivka demonstrates the cost of these political delays: human lives, lost territory, and encouraged Russia. If that’s the plan ‘to be with Ukraine as long as it takes’, then the US delays in aid have just prolonged the war.” The key to breaking the months-long impasse on the ground seems to have come from the air. “Russian forces appear to have temporarily established limited and localised air superiority and were able to provide ground troops with close air support during the final days of their offensive operation,” said the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank. Sergei Shoigu, Russian defence minister, said Moscow’s forces had made 450 high-precision air strikes in the final days of the campaign for Avdiivka. Many of those came in the form of glide bombs, massive unpowered munitions fitted with adjustable fins to travel further than ordinary inertial bombs and strike with greater precision. One Ukrainian soldier reported 60 being dropped on February 17 alone. The use of forward air power came at a cost. Ukraine shot down two Sukhoi-34s and a Sukhoi-35 over Donetsk on Saturday as they performed sorties to drop glide bombs. On Monday they shot down another Sukhoi-34 and a Sukhoi-35 striking Ukrainian positions with glide bombs, and a Sukhoi-34 on Wednesday. In all, Ukraine said it shot down seven planes in five days. The first signs that Ukraine’s defences around Avdiivka were failing came on Thursday, when geolocated footage showed Russian forces advancing to new positions south of the city. On Saturday, Ukraine’s newly appointed commander in chief,Oleksandr Syrskii, said he ordered Ukrainian units to withdraw early in the morning in order to avoid encirclement and capture. Geolocated footage showed Russian troops entering Avdiivka along a railway line running past quarries to the northeast of the city and to the coking plant in the east. By evening Russia claimed “full control” over Avdiivka. Shoigu also claimed that Ukrainian forces had withdrawn in great disarray, suffering a large number of dead, wounded and captured men. He may have overstated the case. The New York Times quoted unnamed Western officials confirming that a “significant” number of Ukrainian troops may have been captured. Two Ukrainian soldiers put the number at 850 to 1,000. But Tavria Group spokesman Dmytro Lykhovyi said that report was influenced by Russian information operations, and the actual number captured was much smaller. It remains an open question whether Russian forces can keep repeating the formula that helped them capture Avdiivka in other areas of the front. Russian forces in the last week also ramped up their attacks on the eastern cities of Lyman and Kupiansk, which some observers believe are their next targets, on Robotyne, in western Zaporizhia, which Ukraine recaptured last year, and on Ukrainian positions on the left bank of the Dnipro river in Kherson. Beyond the symbolic loss of another town, the first since Bakhmut fell in May last year, Avdiivka may offer Russia few strategic advantages. “Avdiivka offers Russian forces limited avenues for future advance,” said the ISW. “Ukrainian forces have long fortified many of the surrounding settlements, which Russian forces are also struggling to capture.” The week also brought some good news for Ukraine. The fall of Avdiivka prompted Denmark’s prime minister to donate all of the country’s remaining artillery assets to Ukraine, prompting others to a similar shift in attitudes. “We, Denmark, have decided to transfer all our artillery to Ukraine,” wrote Mette Frederiksen on X, formerly Twitter. “There is military equipment in Europe … We have weapons, ammunition, air defense systems, which we do not use yet. They must be handed over to Ukraine.” France and Germany pledged to lead an air coalition to supply Ukraine with a million First Person View drones, with a total of nine countries saying they planned to join. Germany and Ukraine signed a multi-year defence cooperation agreement including $7.5bn in defence transfers this year alone. Lithuania said it was stepping up delivery of artillery rounds to Ukraine, and Norwegian-Finnish ammunition manufacturer Nammo said it was adopting a round-the-clock schedule at a plant in Sweden to increase the production of 155mm artillery shells for Ukraine. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg also said the alliance was opening a training centre for Ukrainian personnel in Poland.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/22/era-of-peace-in-europe-over-says-ukraine-as-avdiivka-falls-to-russians
Zelenskyy invites Poland’s leaders to border to resolve farmers’ protests,"Polish farmers have been protesting Ukrainian food imports, angry at what they say is unfair competition.","Ukraine’s president has invited Polish leaders to meet him at their shared border to resolve a blockade by Polish farmers protesting Ukrainian food imports. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on social media on Wednesday that he hoped the proposed border meeting for him, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and a European Union representative could happen before the two-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Saturday, February 24. “This is national security,” Zelenskyy said. “I am ready to be at the border with our government.” “We have had enough misunderstanding. We should not humiliate each other; we should not humiliate either Ukrainian or Polish farmers. We need unity. We need solutions – between us, Ukraine and Poland, and at the level of the whole of Europe,” Zelenskyy said in a statement. There was no immediate reaction from the Polish government. Zelenskyy added that Ukraine could not accept the appearance of slogans supporting Russian President Vladimir Putin at the protests, after one such banner was displayed on Tuesday. Earlier, Polish authorities voiced concern over the slogans praising Putin and his war against Ukraine. Poland, a member of NATO and the European Union, has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion, accepting unlimited numbers of refugees and providing Ukraine with weaponry.    Poles, with past oppression by Moscow rooted deeply in generational memory, are largely supportive of Ukraine. But tensions have been growing as Polish farmers blame imports of Ukrainian grain and other food for pushing down prices and harming their livelihoods. Polish farmers are among farmers across Europe who have been protesting competition from Ukraine as well as EU environmental policies, which they say will increase their production costs. On Tuesday they staged a major day of protest, blocking almost all traffic on the border with Ukraine, angering Kyiv, in an escalation from previous demonstrations. Earlier Wednesday, Poland’s Foreign Ministry said it believed that extreme groups were trying to take over the protest movement “perhaps under the influence of Russian agents”. It noted “with the greatest concern the appearance of anti-Ukrainian slogans and slogans praising Vladimir Putin and the war he is waging”. On Tuesday, a tractor at a protest in the southern Polish region of Silesia carried a Soviet flag and a banner that said: “Putin, put things in order with Ukraine, Brussels, and our rulers.” A photograph was published by the Gazeta Wyborcza daily. Poland’s Interior Minister Marcin Kierwinski called the banner “scandalous” and said it was immediately secured by police, and prosecutors were investigating. “There will be no consent to such criminal activities,” he said.    The public promotion of a totalitarian system can be punished with up to three years in prison under Polish law. The Foreign Ministry called on protest organisers “to identify and eliminate from their movement” the initiators, arguing it was necessary for Poland’s interest. “The current situation of Polish farmers is the result of Vladimir Putin’s aggression against Ukraine and the disruption of the global economy, not because Ukrainians are defending themselves against the aggression,” the ministry said. Polish farmers blocked eight major roads on Wednesday. Police said protests continued at border crossings to Ukraine in Medyka and Korczowa, but passenger traffic was smooth and some trucks were also being let through.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/21/zelenskyy-invites-polands-leaders-to-border-to-resolve-farmers-protests
UK imposes sanctions on heads of penal colony where Russia’s Navalny died,"Cameron promises to hold those responsible accountable, as Navalny’s mother takes legal action to recover his body.","The United Kingdom has imposed sanctions on six officials overseeing the Arctic penal colony where Russian opposition leaderAlexey Navalnydied. The sanctions, announced by British Foreign Secretary David Cameron on Wednesday, target the head and five deputy heads of theIK-3 penal colonyin Kharp in Russia’s Yamal-Nenets region, who now face a ban on entering the UK and will have their assets frozen. “Those responsible for Navalny’s brutal treatment should be under no illusion – we will hold them accountable,” Cameron said. “It’s clear that the Russian authorities saw Navalny as a threat and they tried repeatedly to silence him.” The UK is the first country to impose sanctions in response to Navalny’s death, the Foreign Office said as it described him as “a political prisoner who dedicated his life to exposing the corruption of the Russian system, calling for free and open politics, and holding the Kremlin to account”. 🔴 SANCTIONED: heads of Arctic penal colony where Alexei Navalny was killed.pic.twitter.com/2FZn0W5b73 — Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (@FCDOGovUK)February 21, 2024  The sanctioned individuals include Vadim Konstantinovich Kalinin, who oversaw the prison whereNavalnywas kept in solitary confinement for up to two weeks at a time, it added. The penal colonyabout 1,900km (1,200 miles) northeast of Moscowis considered one of the toughest in Russia. Its inmates are convicted of grave crimes. Russian authorities have said the cause of 47-year-old Navalny’s sudden death on February 16 at the colony, called “Polar Wolf”, is still unknown and have refused to release his body for the next two weeks, pending a preliminary inquest. On Wednesday, Navalny’s mother,Lyudmila Navalnaya, filed a lawsuit at a court in the town of Salekhard near the penal colony, contesting officials’ refusal to release her son’s body so she could bury him with dignity. A closed-door hearing has been scheduled for March 4, Russia’s state news agency TASS reported. Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, released avideoon Monday claiming the authorities had not yet handed over his body because they were waiting for traces of the Novichok nerve agent to disappear. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has rejected allegations of a cover-up and President Vladimir Putin’s alleged involvement as “unfounded, insolent accusations about the head of the Russian state”. The UK’s decision to take targeted punitive action against the prison heads coincided with plans by theUnited Statesto impose sanctions against Russia over the Putin critic’s death and the two-yearwar in Ukraine, set to be announced on Friday. Cameron will attend the G20 foreign ministers’ meeting in Brazil later on Wednesday and the Foreign Office said “he will use the opportunity to call out Russia’s aggression and its global impact directly to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.”   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/21/uk-imposes-sanctions-on-heads-of-penal-colony-where-russias-navalny-died
EU approves new sanctions against Russia over Ukraine war,"Bloc officials say 200 people and entities have been added to the sanctions list, bringing the total to 2,000.","European Union members have approved a 13th package of sanctions against Russia over itswar in Ukraine, banning nearly 200 additional entities and individuals accused of involvement in the two-year conflict. “EU Ambassadors just agreed in principle on a 13th package of sanctions in the framework of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine,” Belgium, which holds the rotating EU presidency, said on X on Wednesday, calling it “one of the broadest approved by the EU”. The sanctions will be formally approved by the 27-nation bloc on February 24, the day in 2022 when Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine. “I welcome the agreement on our 13th sanctions package against Russia. We must keep degrading Putin’s war machine,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen wrote on social media. I welcome the agreement on our 13th sanctions package against Russia⁰We must keep degrading Putin's war machine.⁰With 2000 listings in total, we keep the pressure high on the Kremlin.⁰We are also further cutting Russia’s access to drones.https://t.co/AfSxsEUB8x — Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen)February 21, 2024  EU representatives in Brussels signed off on the package, which targets individuals and organisations linked to the Russian government and the invasion. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said 200 people and entities have been added to the sanctions list, bringing the total to 2,000. “With this package, we are taking more action against entities involved in circumvention, the defence and military sectors,” Borrell said on X. The EU recently targeted companies based in China, Uzbekistan, Iran and the United Arab Emirates that are allegedly involved in circumventing the bloc’s sanctions. The latest measures go after the Russian weapons industry’s access to components to manufacture drones, diplomats told the German Press Agency dpa. Companies in the bloc would not be allowed to sell goods and technologies with military connections to Russia. The focus is on entities and individuals that are part of Russia’s military industrial complex and those involved in trafficking andkidnapping Ukrainian children, EU sources told the Reuters news agency. One North Korean and one Belarusian firm were also added, the sources said. The companies in the latest round are mainly Russian and also include three mainland Chinese firms and one Hong Kong-based company, Reuters reported. However, the fresh sanctions do not contain wide-ranging measures to impact specific economic sectors. A previous round of EU measures included a prohibition on importing diamonds and jewellery from Russia. A far-reaching ban on imports of crude oil, coal, steel, gold and luxury goods as well as measures aimed at banks and financial institutions has been in place for some time. While Western allies’ focus on Ukraine has been winding down amidwar fatigue, concerns over the excessive costs of the war and the conflict in Gaza, thedeathlast week of Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny has given a fresh impetus to impose new sanctions. On Tuesday, President Joe Biden said theUnited Stateswill also announce new economic restrictions on Russia. While Biden did not provide details, White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the package will target a range of items, including Russia’s defence and industrial bases, along with sources of revenue for the economy.

"Analysis: How Russia, Ukraine’s militaries stack up after two years of war","Ukraine is outgunned by Russia, but plans to increase drone production as the war drags on into a third year.","Ukraine has been fighting Russia for two years to liberate its lands and drive Russia back – but supply, tactics and the flat terrain have meant that themuch-vaunted Ukrainian counteroffensiveof last year has produced few tangible results. In the wide-open agricultural land of southern Ukraine, there is not much in the way of cover for an attacking force. Russia had months to prepare its defences, and built them in depth. Row after row of trenches, anti-tank obstacles, ditches and reinforced bunkers have formed a barrier, often kilometres deep, effectively containing Ukrainian forces as they have repeatedly tried to break through into the open country beyond, with little success. The counteroffensive has bogged down into slow, attritional warfare, as Russia’s strategy of making Ukraine pay for every metre it tries to take is showing signs of succeeding. The quality of Russia’s soldiers may be questionable, but they are still able to slow down Ukrainian advances, protected in fortified dugouts, along with the help of surveillance drones that stop Ukraine’s military from springing surprise attacks on them. Even so, a mixture of new and old weaponry has changed the dynamics of the modern battlefield and the war fought in Ukraine. Some new tactics are being developed and successful weapons systems have been brought into play as old ones, such as the tank, have been kept on. Yet despite all the 21st-century innovations, the battlefields of southern Ukraine are starting to take on an eerie World War I dynamic. A general from a century ago would have no problem understanding the brutal slog of this conflict. Drones have been integral to both sides of this war. Russia was very late to adopt their use and paid the price as attempts by its military to surprise Ukraine were dashed, with mass artillery used to destroy Russian armoured and infantry units. Small Ukrainian drones were used to drop grenades onto Russian positions, demoralising the troops stuck in trenches and foxholes. Ukrainian artillery used them to spot for batteries that could quickly adjust fire in real time, catching Russian troops and tanks in the open as they tried to advance across flat, featureless fields. Moscow’s forces have, over time, applied the same lessons and turned the tables. It is now Ukrainian units that get caught advancing only to be destroyed by Russian artillery strikes. The rivals have both realised the value not just of surveillance drones, but also of longer-range drones that can be used to strike valuable targets deep behind enemy lines. Russia has used hundreds of Iranian-imported Shahed-136 drones as cheap cruise missiles. While slow flying, they serve to exhaust Ukrainian air defences, depleting Ukrainian missile inventories as a combination of drone, cruise and ballistic missile attacks steadily erode Ukraine’s ability to defend itself. Ukraine has learned the lesson that plenty of cheap, effective, armed drones are useful in an industrial-level war and a good way to offset a weaker air force. Ukraine plansmass production of dronesthat can destroy targets up to 1,000km (620 miles) away, theoretically bringing Moscow and St Petersburg into range. More importantly, marshalling yards, port facilities, train depots and barracks would now all potentially come under fire, further complicating Russian logistical challenges in supplying its forces on the front lines. To give an idea of the reliance on drones, Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, said that in 2023 alone, domestic drone production rose to 300,000 drones, and this didn’t include foreign donations. The target this year is to make over a million drones, with at least half the components locally made, in an effort to offset waning United States support for Ukraine. Regardless ofwho wins the US election, backing for Ukraine has eased as domestic concerns and other wars, such as Israel’s campaign in Gaza, soak up US support and resources. Ukraine is not getting the military aid it desperately needs as Russia puts its economy on a light war footing, now allocating 6.5 percent of its total budget to replacing its significant losses on the battlefield. One estimate, published this month by the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think-tank, says Russia can now produce 125 tanks per month, more than enough to replace those destroyed in recent fighting. European members of NATO have been increasingly relied on to make up any potential US shortfall in military aid. Boosting Ukrainian defence manufacturing in drones and artillery ammunition is now considered a national priority. The brutal arithmetic shows Ukraine needs an extra 240,000 shells a month to even keep pace with Russia. As most of the fighting is being conducted at long range, artillery is key to both sides. Russia’s industry has significantly ramped up production of artillery shells and multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS), together with large imports of North Korean artillery ammunition and ballistic missiles. Russia is now able to fire five shells for every Ukrainian one. Desperate Ukrainian defenders in some areas are now down to firing a few rounds a day, just to stave off defeat. The world’s militaries have been watching the conflict unfold and have had to take several hard lessons onboard. Prewar estimates for artillery production were woefully small and the Ukrainian conflict shows just how much industrial power one needs when fighting an equivalent army or larger. Prewar stockpiles of missiles are also extremely low. Most land-attack missiles were leftovers from the Cold War and would mostly have been nuclear tipped, a few hundred sufficing. It’s now clear that thousands would be needed, which means that low-cost, quickly manufactured missiles are key parts of any arsenal. So too is a layered air-defence system, again reliant on plentiful amounts of cheap missiles, whose production can be quickly scaled up. The same goes for cruise missiles. The likes of theStorm Shadowmissile – with a range of more than 250km (155 miles) – are extremely effective but are expensive and take a long time to build. Cheap alternatives are needed. The idea of the tank has made a comeback. Pre-invasion, many militaries were steadily getting rid of their tank inventories. But experience now shows that the tank, properly protected and part of a combined-arms assault, still has great uses on the battlefield and remains a formidable weapon. Back to drones, which have infused themselves at every level of the battlefield. Serious force multipliers, they can help any military leverage what equipment and weapons it has. One Ukrainian soldier recently noted, in an interview with Politico, that the accuracy of artillery units increased by 250 percent when paired with drones.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/21/analysis-how-russia-ukraines-militaries-stack-up-after-two-years-of-war
"US to impose ‘major sanctions’ on Russia over Navalny death, Ukraine war",Biden does not give details of measures to be announced on Friday ahead of second anniversary of Russian invasion.,"The United States is set to announce new sanctions against Russia over the death of opposition leaderAlexey Navalnyand the two-yearwar in Ukraine. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, US President Joe Biden did not give details but said he would provide more information about the package of measures on Friday, ahead of the second anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said that the “major sanctions package” would hold Russia “accountable” for what happened toNavalnyand respond to the “vicious and brutal war that has now raged on for two years”. The new sanctions will target a range of items, including Russia’s defence and industrial bases, along with sources of revenue for the economy, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said. According to a senior US official, a sanctions package was already being planned to mark the second anniversary of the war, which Washington will now reconsider and supplement in response to the death of Putin’s most prominent opponent. Russian authorities have said the cause of 47-year-old Navalny’s sudden death on February 16 at a penal colony north of the Arctic Circle is still unknown and have refused to release his body for the next two weeks as the preliminary inquest continues, according to the opposition leader’s team. On Tuesday, Navalny’s mother,Lyudmila Navalnaya, urged Putin to “immediately” release her son’s body so she could bury him. The demand was echoed by his widow Yulia Navalnaya, who had previously claimed in avideo statementthat the authorities had not yet handed over the body because they were waiting for traces of the Novichok nerve agent to leave his corpse. The European Union summoned Russia’s charge d’affaires over Navalny’s death, as Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and Poland called in Russian ambassadors.    The US and its allies have already imposed araft of sanctionsto isolate Moscow since it invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022, hitting Putin, thousands of Russians and firms. The measures have included freezing Russian Central Bank funds, banning certain Russian goods, restricting Russian banks’ access to SWIFT – the dominant system for global financial transactions – and imposing a $60-per-barrel price cap on Russian oil and diesel, among other measures. The US Treasury’s under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, Brian Nelson, was discussing sanctions over Navalny’s death on a trip to Europe this week, the Reuters news agency reported. Nelson, in visits to Germany, Belgium and France, is also discussing Washington’s authority to target those funding Russia’s war production efforts even if they are in third countries, the Treasury said, adding that Washington was “aggressively pursuing those who attempt to evade our sanctions”. Policy experts have advanced an array of proposals meant to further starve Russia of the money it needs to continue its invasion – from seizing the nation’s Central Bank funds housed largely in Europe to lowering the Group of Seven price cap on Russian oil. Charles Kupchan, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said, “Sanctions are always in the quiver, but they’re not going to matter that much – because let’s be honest, the sanctions have not had a huge impact on the Russian economy. “What will make a big difference is military and economic assistance to Ukraine, full stop,” he added.

"Ten years ago Russia annexed Crimea, paving the way for war in Ukraine",Russia’s annexation of the peninsula was not recognised by any nation except Moscow.,"On March 7, 2014, a husky man in his late 30s with closely cropped hair addressed an uneven line of four dozen “volunteers”. Next to him were three men in body armour and green uniforms, with no insignia. The crowd of men, aged 20 to 50, were gathered outside a white Stalinist-era government building in Sevastopol, a port in Ukraine’s Crimea. They were uphill from the seashore, next to huge sequoias, blossoming cherry trees and elderly ladies holding hand-written posters that read, “In Russia through a referendum” and “I want to go home to Russia.” Eight days later, Moscow would hold a “referendum” on the Black Sea peninsula’s “return” to Russia, and the men were a nascent “self-defence unit” that would “prevent provocations,” the man said. I approached them with a notebook and a dictaphone – and was immediately seized by two “volunteers”. “Got a spy here!” they yelled, twisting my arms and ready to beat me to a pulp. But the instructor told them and me to wait. He kept on talking for half an hour, telling the crowd that they would train at a military base outside Sevastopol and should arrive in “comfy clothes” and sneakers. One of the volunteers asked him whether they should bring firearms. Many others nodded approvingly. “When you take up arms, we become an armed criminal group. But if something happens, each unit will be backed by fire,” the instructor said. After the meeting, he checked my press ID and told me he was a retired intelligence officer who had served in Russia’s volatile North Caucasus region and arrived in Crimea as a “volunteer”. “Our groups will have to respond to challenges, provocations because there is a shortage of policemen in town,” he told me. “There’s NATO propaganda at work. “Our aim is to prevent the first shot. If the first shot happens, you won’t stop the mess,” he said. He politely declined to say what his name was. The first shot didn’t happen, but what took place in Crimea 10 years ago paved the way for today’s war between Ukraine and Russia. On February 20, 2014, Vladimir Konstantinov, speaker of Crimea’s regional parliament and a Russian politician, said he “didn’t rule out” the peninsula’s “return” to Russia. On the same day, thousands of gun-toting men in unmarked uniforms appeared throughout Ukraine’s Crimea. They responded to the victory of pro-Western protests in Kyiv that would within days remove pro-Russian Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. Dubbed “little green men” or “polite people,” the servicemen didn’t interact with locals or reporters, while Russian President Vladimir Putin said in Moscow that “they are not there”. They appeared next to Ukrainian military, naval and air bases, and the interim government in Kyiv ordered Ukrainian servicemen in Crimea to leave without firing a single shot. Many servicemen – along with thousands of police officers and government officials – joined the pro-Russian “government” formed by Sergey Aksyonov, a minor political figure and former mafia boss nicknamed “Goblin.” Some servicemen were detained, including Ihor Voronchenko, deputy head of Crimea’s coastal defence at the time. “There was a solitary cell, without a window, when you lose the sense of time, space. It affects one psychologically,” Voronchenko told me in 2018 when he was head of Ukraine’s navy. No shots were fired, but blood was spilled. On March 4, a “self-defence” unit abducted a Crimean Tatar protester, Reshat Ametov. He was held with other hostages in Simferopol, Crimea’s administrative capital, and tortured for a week. His naked, bruised body was found on March 15, head wrapped in plastic, eyes poked out. A day later, the “referendum” took place. Only a handful of schools and government buildings were used as “polling stations” so that the jubilant pro-Russian “voters,” mostly the elderly nostalgic about their Soviet youth, would throng and fill them, creating an illusion of mass vote. Moscow said 90 percent of Crimeans voted to join Russia, but the “referendum” was not recognised by Ukraine or any other nation. On March 21, Russian President Vladimir Putin made Crimea part of Russia. The annexation propelled his sagging approval ratings to an atmospheric 88 percent, and some Russians saw it as a first step to restoring the USSR. In response to the Arab Spring, a series of mass protests in the Middle East, the Kremlin came up with the idea of a “Russian Spring,” stoking protests in Russian-speaking Ukrainian regions in the east and south. Ancient Greeks, Romans, Mongols and Turks contested Crimea, the westernmost end of the Great Silk Road. It became a jewel in the crown of Russian czars, who annexed it in 1783 from the Crimean Tatars, whose Muslim state was ruled by the descendants of Genghis Khan and allied with Ottoman Turkey. The czars and communists understood Crimea’s utmost strategic importance in controlling the Black Sea, and Nazi Germany occupied it during World War II. Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin accused Tatars of “collaborating” with the Nazis and ordered their entire community of 200,000 deported to Central Asia. “Early in the morning, there was a loud bang on the door. I yelled, ‘Mum, Dad is back from the war! But there were two soldiers who told us to start packing,’” historian Nuri Emirvaliyev, who was 10 at the time, told me about the May 18, 1944 deportation. More than half of them died en route, including his younger sister. “During stops, soldiers yelled, ‘Got any dead? Bring them out!’” Emirvaliyev recalled. The rare survivors and their descendants were allowed to return to Crimea in the late 1980s only to see their homes occupied by ethnic Russians and Ukrainians and become a distrusted and vilified minority. Crimea was made part of Soviet Ukraine in 1954 during the construction of the North Crimean Canal which made agriculture inarid interiorareas possible and triggered the growth of urban centres. Moscow turned Crimea into a Soviet Riviera, and millions of former Soviet citizens still reminisce about their holidays there. After the 1991 Soviet collapse and Ukraine’s independence, Crimea remained predominantly Russian-speaking, its residents were mostly loyal to Moscow, andRussia’s Black Sea Fleetwas based in Sevastopol. Since the 2000s, Russian politicians, including Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov, began visiting Crimea and openly urging its residents to “reunite” with Russia. Meanwhile, Ukrainian political elites didn’t pay much attention to the peninsula’s development and allowed graft to thrive, “thinking that corruption would tie local elites to central ones,” Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kushch told Al Jazeera. But the practice misfired in 2014, when Crimean elites saw the success of the pro-Western revolt in Kyiv, got scared of “responsibility for the corruption,” and preferred the annexation, he said. The annexation was followed by the arrival of Russian officials – and the transformation of endemic corruption. They conducted a massive revision of ownership rights and expropriated thousands of properties, including beachfront hotels, vineyards, a film studio Alexander Strekalin, 75, resisted the takeover of his small cafeteria in the port of Yalta. In September 2017, he doused himself with acetone, flicked a lighter and died three agonising days later. “He died for nothing,” his widow Mila Selyamieva told me. Meanwhile, the Kremlin and pro-Moscow authorities initiated a crackdown on critics, including secular dissidents and religious Crimean Tatars, sentencing dozens to jail for alleged “extremism” and “encroachment on Russia’s constitutional order”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/20/crimea-anniversary-war-ukraine
Russia arrests dual US citizen for Ukraine-linked ‘treason’,The woman is accused of raising funds that benefitted the Ukrainian armed forces.,"Russia’s internal security and intelligence agency has arrested a woman who holds dual Russian and United States nationality in the Ural district for committing “treason” by raising funds for Ukraine. The Federal Security Service (FSB) in the city of Yekaterinburg took into custody the unnamed woman, identified only as a 33-year-old resident of Los Angeles, state media reported on Tuesday. She “was involved in providing financial assistance to a foreign state in activities directed against the security of our country”, said a statement by the security agency carried by Russian media. It said since February 2022, she was “proactively collecting money” for a Ukrainian organisation that would ultimately benefit the Ukrainian armed forces in the form of purchase of “tactical medicine items, equipment, weapons and ammunition”. The woman had also allegedly taken part in multiple public demonstrations in the US in support of Ukraine, which is financially and militarily backed by a Western coalition after Russia invaded it in February 2022. Russian state media released a video as well, which showed hooded FSB officers escorting and handcuffing a woman in a white coat and a white hat pulled down over her eyes. Treason is punishable by up to 20 years in prison in Russia. The Wall Street Journal reporter, Evan Gershkovich, is one of several US nationals who are currently imprisoned in Russia. The journalist wasarrested last year on charges of espionagethat have been rejected by Gershkovich, the US outlet and the US government. On Tuesday, a court in Moscow rejected Gershkovich’s appeal against the extension of his pre-trial detention period and said he “will remain in custody until March 30”. Russian-American journalistAlsu Kurmashevahas been in prison since October and charged with failing to register as a “foreign agent” and spreading “false information” about Russia’smilitary campaign in Ukraine. Paul Whelan, a former US marine and security executive, was arrested in Russia in 2018 and convicted of spying in 2020. Russian President Vladimir Putin said this month that Moscow is open to a prisoner swap for Gershkovich as a “gesture of goodwill”. Russia and Ukraine have also completed several rounds of prisoner exchanges in the past few months,with 100 prisoners of war exchangedearlier this month.

Ukraine PM calls for long-range missiles to fight back Russia,"Shmyhal says delays in providing long-range artillery, missile equipment is ‘main danger for us on the battlefield’.","Ukraine needs long-range missiles and other ammunition to repel Russian troops, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal has said, as the country nears its third year of war amid battle losses and shrinking foreign aid. Speaking during a visit to Japan on Tuesday, Shmyhal said Ukraine has modern equipment and trained soldiers and is fighting at NATO standards, but the country needs more long-range missiles for air defence against Russia on the front line. “Unfortunately, now they prevail in the air and unfortunately this leads to some consequences from the front line, but I should say that we have no refuses from our partners to supply military equipment to Ukraine,” he said. Shmyhal’s comments came as ammunition shortages and limited manpower are causing Ukraine some serious losses on the battlefield. On Sunday,Russian troops captured Avdiivka, a key hub city to access the industrial Donbas region, marking their biggest success since the fall ofBakhmutin May. But support from Western powers has been facing pushback over growing costs, while lawmakers in Washington continued to wrangle over a military aid package for Kyiv. Should the $95bn foreign aid package survive a vote in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, US media reports suggest that President Joe Biden is considering including long-range ballistic missiles. These are weapons with a longer reach compared with the medium-range missiles sent so far by the United States. They would allow Ukraine to hit inside the Russian-controlled Crimean Peninsula. The US has until now provided Ukraine with about $111bn, largely in weapons but also equipment and humanitarian assistance. When Ukraine begins fielding F-16 fighter jets later this year, “we will balance the situation on the battlefield and it will be much easier for us”, Shmyhal said. But currently, with the ongoing shortage of long-range artillery and missile equipment, “if it will be stopped, if it will be delayed, this is the main danger for us on the battlefield”. On Tuesday, Sweden said it would give $682m worth of military equipment to Ukraine. “The reason we are continuing to support Ukraine is a matter of humanity and decency. Russia started an illegal, unprovoked and indefensible war,” Defence Minister Pal Jonson told a news conference.    Shmyhal was in Tokyo to meet Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida whose country hopes to build momentum for global support for Ukraine as the war drags on and attention has been diverted to the conflict in Gaza. Japan has focused on reconstruction aid, in part due to constitutional restraints on providing lethal weapons. The previous day, Kishida promised a long-term commitment to Ukraine’s reconstruction at a conference focused on economic growth. During their meeting, Shmyhal also called for new sanctions on Russia following thedeath of prominent opposition leader Alexey Navalny. The 47-year-old critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin died on Friday in a remote prison colony in Russia under circumstances that remain murky. Navalny’s death prompted global outrage, with many Western leaders, including Biden,blaming Putin. “We are fighting for democratic values for all the democratic world, this is an existential war of democracy against autocracy,” Shmyhal said on Tuesday during the news conference in Tokyo. Germany, Lithuania and Sweden have also called for new penalties on Moscow during a meeting of the European Union’s top diplomats.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/20/ukrainian-prime-minister-calls-for-new-sanctions-on-moscow
"Maksim Kuzminov, Russian pilot who defected to Ukraine, killed in Spain",Spain’s EFE news agency says Maksim Kuzminov’s body was found on February 13 in the southern town of Villajoyosa.,"The bullet-riddled body of a Russian pilot who defected to Ukraine last year has been found in a town in southern Spain, according to Spanish and Ukrainian media. Spain’s EFE news agency, in a report on Monday, said Maksim Kuzminov’s body was found in an underground garage on February 13 in the town of Villajoyosa, situated near Alicante in southern Spain. “This traitor and criminal became a moral corpse at the very moment when he planned his dirty and terrible crime,” said Sergey Naryshkin, the head of Russia’s SVR foreign intelligence service, on Tuesday. He did not confirm or deny any Russian involvement in the former pilot’s death. “In Russia, it is customary to speak either good of the dead or nothing at all,” Naryshkin said, according to Russian state media. Kuzminov, who had landed in Ukraine with his Mi-8 helicopter last August, had been living in Spain with a Ukrainian passport under a different name, EFE reported. A spokesperson for Ukraine’s GUR military intelligence confirmed that Kuzminov had died in Spain, but did not specify the cause of death. Spanish police confirmed that a body was found of a gunshot victim in the town, but did not disclose the victim’s identity. A source at Spain’s Guardia Civil police force told the Reuters news agency that the victim could have been living under a fake identity. Spain’s La Informacion newspaper, which first reported the shooting, said investigators were searching for two suspects who had fled in a vehicle that was later found burned out in a nearby town. Kuzminov’s defection to Ukraine was presented last year as a major coup for Kyiv. The pilot said the GUR had lured him into defecting. “I contacted representatives of the Ukrainian intelligence service, explained my situation. I was offered security guarantees, new documents, monetary compensation, remuneration. We discussed the details and started planning my flight,” Kuzminov said, according to a report by Interfax Ukraine. EFE, citing a GUR source, said Kuzminov had decided to go live in Spain instead of staying in Ukraine.

Ukraine accuses Russia of killing unarmed prisoners after fall of Avdiivka,Security Service of Ukraine announces probe after footage of alleged executions circulates on Telegram messaging app.,"Ukraine has launched an investigation into allegations that Russian forces executed eight unarmed Ukrainian soldiers after they took control of the city of Avdiivka. The Security Service of Ukraine, under the guidance of the Donetsk Regional Prosecutor’s Office, opened a pre-trial investigation into the alleged killing of unarmed prisoners of war in Avdiivka and the village of Vesele, state-run media outlet Ukrinform said on Monday. “Under the procedural supervision of the Donetsk Regional Prosecutor’s Office, a pre-trial investigation has been initiated into the violation of the laws and customs of war combined with premeditated murder (Part 2 of Article 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine),” Ukrinform quoted the security agency as saying in a statement. Ukrinform said evidence of the killings was shared on the Telegram messaging app, including footage showing a Russian soldier shooting two captured Ukrainian soldiers at close range. Moscow has not publicly responded to the claims. Ukraine has repeatedly accused Russia of unlawful killings and other war crimes since Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of its neighbour in February 2022. Russia has also accused Ukraine of committing violations of international law. Russia on Saturday announced that it had taken fullcontrol of Avdiivkaafter the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces  in the biggest gain for Moscow since thefall of Bakhmutlast May. Russian President Vladimir Putin hailed the capture of the city as “an important victory” in the nearly two-year-long war. Ukraine’s military said on Sunday that Russian forces launched multiple attacks to the west of Avdiivka to build on their territorial gains, including unsuccessful assaults on the village of Lastochkyne. “The enemy is trying to actively develop its offensive,” Ukrainian military spokesman Dmytro Lykhoviy said on state TV. Ukrainian forces’ retreat from Avdiivka came after they were forced to ration ammunition due to dwindling supplies, which the administration of United States President Joe Biden has blamed on Congress’s failure to swiftly approve a package of military aid for Kyiv.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/19/ukraine-accuses-russia-of-executing-prisoners-after-fall-of-avdviivka
"Russia claims full control of Avdiivka, says Ukrainian troops still in town",Russia makes its biggest gain since capturing Bakhmut in May as war with Ukraine is set to enter its third year.,"Russia says it has full control of the Ukrainian town of Avdiivka after Ukraine withdrew, adding that some Ukrainian troops are still holed up in a vast Soviet-era coke plant following one of the most intense battles of the war. The fall of Avdiivka is Russia’sbiggest gainsince capturing the city ofBakhmutin May 2023 and comes almost two years to the day since President Vladimir Putin triggered a full-scale war by ordering the invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s Ministry of Defence on Sunday said its troops had advanced 8.6km (5.3 miles) in that part of the 1,000km (621-mile) front line, and that Russian troops were pressing forward after a deadly urban battle that has left the town an almost completely depopulated wreck. Putin hailed the fall of Avdiivka as an important victory and congratulated Russian troops. “The head of state congratulated Russian soldiers on this success, an important victory,” the Kremlin said in a statement on its website.    Ukraine said it had withdrawn its soldiers to save troops from being fully surrounded after months of fierce fighting. Moscow has been trying to grind down Ukrainian forces just as Kyiv ponders a major new mobilisation and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appoints anew commanderto run the war. But Russia said some Ukrainian forces were still holed up at the Soviet-era coke plant, once one of Europe’s biggest, in Avdiivka, which is key to Russia’s aim of securing full control of the industrial Donbas region. “Measures are being taken to completely clear the town of militants and to block Ukrainian units that have left the town and are entrenched at the Avdiivka Coke and Chemical Plant,” Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said. Russian state television showed blue-and-yellow Ukrainian flags being taken down in Avdiivka and Russia’s white, blue and red tricolour flag raised, including over the coke plant. There was no public comment yet by Ukrainian authorities on this. Putin sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February 2022, triggering the full-scale war after eight years of conflict in eastern Ukraine between Ukrainian forces on the one side and pro-Russian Ukrainians and Russian proxies on the other. Avdiivka, which is called Avdeyevka by Russians, has endured a decade of conflict. It holds particular symbolism for Russia as it was briefly taken in 2014 by Moscow-backed separatists who seized a swath of eastern Ukraine but was then recaptured by Ukrainian troops who built extensive fortifications. Control over the city was key to Moscow’s efforts to secure full control of the industrial Donbas region. Losing Avdiivka represents a significant blow for Ukraine which has been facing growing challenges in repelling Russian forces amid great ammunition shortages and limited manpower. Capturing Avdiivka is likely to provide a morale boost for Russia ahead of Putin’s bid for re-election next month, which he is almost certain to win. It is also seen as another step towards securing Moscow’s hold on the regional centre of Donetsk, about 20km (12.4 miles) to the east, held by Russian and pro-Russian forces since 2014.

Biden says he told Zelenskyy he’s ‘confident’ US will renew aid to Ukraine,US president warns of further losses of Ukrainian territory if Congress does not renew military aid.,"United States President Joe Biden has said he assured Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy that he is confident Congress will renew military aid to repel Russia after its forces captured the Ukrainian stronghold of Avdiivka. “I spoke with Zelenskyy this afternoon to let him know that I was confident we’re going to get that money,” Biden told reporters on Saturday. Biden said he was not confident another Ukrainian city would not fall to Russian forces without US support and that it would be  “absurd” and “unethical” for lawmakers not to approve a new package of military aid. “I find it contrary to everything we are as a country,” he said. Biden spoke to Zelenskyy in a call hours after Russia announced thecapture of Avdiivkafollowing the earlier withdrawal of Kyiv’s forces, which the Ukrainian leader described as “a professional decision that will save many Ukrainian lives”. Russian President Vladimir Putin hailed the capture of Avdiivka, an industrial hub located some 10km (6.2 miles) north of the city of Donetsk, as an “important victory” in the war, which is nearing the two-year mark. The White House said in a statement after the call that Ukrainian forces withdrew after being forced to “ration ammunition due to dwindling supplies as a result of congressional inaction, resulting in Russia’s first notable gains in months”. Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram after the call that he was “glad that I can count on the full support of the American president” and that he had faith in the “wise decision of the US Congress.” US Vice President Kamala Harris also took aim at Republicans for holding up aid on Saturday, accusing them of “political gamesmanship” after meeting with Zelenskyy on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference in Germany. Democrats and Republicans have been sharply divided over continuing support for Kyiv, with allies of former US President Donald Trump insisting the funds be spent on domestic issues, including border security. While the US Senate passed a $95bn package of aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan earlier this week, the bill faces a difficult road in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson has slammed the bill for not addressing security on the US-Mexico border, which he has described as the “most pressing issue facing our country”, and insisted the House will not be rushed to approve the aid. On Friday, Biden blasted House Republicans for taking a two-week recess, saying it was “time they step up” and assuage concerns about the US being a reliable ally.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/18/biden-tells-zelenskyy-hes-confident-us-will-renew-aid-to-ukraine
Russia claims capture of Avdiivka after Ukraine withdraws from key city,President Putin hailed ‘important victory’ for Russia after Ukraine said it withdrew to preserve its soldiers’ lives.,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has hailed his army’s capture of the eastern Ukrainian town of Avdiivka as an “important victory”, following an earlier withdrawal by Kyiv’s forces. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu informed Putin about the seizure of the front-line town in a meeting at the Kremlin on Saturday, his ministry said in a statement. Avdiivka was a “powerful defensive hub” for Ukraine’s armed forces and its capture would “move the front line away from Donetsk [city],” reducing Ukraine’s ability to shell the Russian stronghold, the defence ministry said. “The President congratulated our military and fighters on such an important victory, on such a success,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told state news agencies. Ukrainian troops earlier withdrew from Avdiivka, the newarmy chiefannounced, after months of heavy fighting and little progress in repelling Russian forces on the country’s eastern front. “I decided to withdraw our units from the town and move to defence from more favourable lines in order to avoid encirclement and preserve the lives and health of servicemen,” Oleksandr Syrskii said on Saturday, days after taking the helm of the Ukrainian military in amajor shake-up. The battle for the industrial hub, less than 10km (six miles) north of the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk, has been one of the bloodiest of the two-year war. Many compare it withthe battle for Bakhmut,in which tens of thousands of soldiers were killed. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that pulling out troops “was a professional decision that will save many Ukrainian lives”. “Our actions are limited only by the sufficiency and length of range of our strength,” he added, pointing to the situation in Avdiivka. Russia had been trying to capture the city since October and had surrounded it on three sides, leaving limited resupply routes for Ukrainian forces before they withdrew. Avdiivka had about 34,000 inhabitants before the Russian invasion. Most of the city has been since destroyed but an estimated 1,000 residents remain, according to local authorities. Videos on social media showed a town left in rubble.    Before issuing orders to pull out of Avdiivka, Oleksandr Tarnavsky, Ukraine’s army’s commander in the area, said on Friday that several Ukrainian soldiers had been captured by Russian forces. Avdiivka lies in the Donetsk region of Ukraine, which the Kremlin has claimed to be part of Russia since a 2022 annexation that remains unrecognised by nearly all United Nations members. The city has important symbolic value and Moscow hopes its capture will make Ukraine’s bombing of Donetsk more difficult. Ukraine’s withdrawal and Russia’s capture of Avdiivka have come in advance of Russian presidential elections scheduled for March in which incumbentPutinis set to win a fifth term, allowing him to continue leading the invasion of Ukraine. At the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, Zelenskyy pushed for countries to give Ukraine longer-range weapons and more air defence systems. “Unfortunately, keeping Ukraine in the artificial deficit of weapons, particularly in the deficit of artillery and long-range capabilities, allows Putin to adapt to the current intensity of the war,” Zelenskyy said in Germany. “The self-weakening of democracy over time undermines our joint results.” He also promised “to surprise Russia” later this year with new drone systems and electronic warfare. Zelenskyy on Friday signed security pacts with France and Germany to lock in support for Kyiv. He was also expected to make further pleas for financing and armaments at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday. All 27 European Union countries this month agreed on an additional 50-billion-euro ($54bn)aid package for Ukraine. United States President Joe Biden said on Thursday that Avdiivka risked falling to Russian forces because of ammunition shortages following months of Republican congressionalopposition to a new US military aid packagefor Kyiv.

Ukraine signs French security pact after similar agreement with Germany,"Deal with France promises $3.23bn in military aid to Ukraine, while pact with Germany secures $1.22bn support package.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has signed a new long-term security pact with France, hours after securing a similar deal and aid from Germany. France and Ukraine signed a bilateral security agreement seeking to help Kyiv in its war against Russia, the Elysee said on Friday. Signed by Zelenskyy and French President Emmanuel Macron, the pact includes pledges from Paris to deliver more arms, train soldiers in Ukraine and send up to three billion euros ($3.23bn) in military aid. The pact is set to run for 10 years and will not only strengthen cooperation in the area of artillery but also help pave the way towards Ukraine’s future integration into the European Union and NATO, Macron and Zelenskyy said. “Our cooperation yields results in the protection of life in Ukraine and our entire Europe,” Zelenskyy said on his social media platforms, shortly before meeting Macron. Париж. Запланована зустріч із Президентом Макроном і важлива угода. Наша співпраця дає результати в захисті життя України та всієї нашої Європи. 🇺🇦🇫🇷 — Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa)February 16, 2024  Earlier on Friday, the German Ministry of Defence announced that a deal had been signed between Zelenskyy and Chancellor Olaf Scholz. The German security pact, which will last for 10 years, commits Germany to supporting Ukraine with military assistance and hitting Russia with sanctions and export controls, and ensuring that Russian assets remain frozen. Berlin also prepared another immediate support package worth 1.13 billion euros ($1.22bn) that is focused on air defence and artillery. “The document’s importance cannot be overestimated. It makes clear that Germany will continue to support an independent Ukraine in its defence against the Russian invasion,” Scholz said. “And if in the future there is another Russian aggression, we have agreed on detailed diplomatic, economic and military support,” he added. Zelenskyy’s visit to France and Germany is part of hismini-European tourwhere he was attempting to secure much-needed aid for Ukraine as Russia’s war in the country rages on, edging closer to its third year. On Friday, Ukrainian troops were trying to hold back Russian forces closing in on the eastern town of Avdiivka. The Ukrainian army said it was pulling back from a position on the southern outskirts of the front-line city, but that its forces were taking up “new positions”. Avdiivka, which Russia has been trying to capture since October, is a main target for Moscow ahead of the second anniversary of the start of the Ukraine war. To tackle battlefield challenges, Ukraine has been facing a shortage of ammunition stockpiles amid delays in Western military assistance. “We are doing everything we can to ensure that our warriors have enough managerial and technological capabilities to save as many Ukrainian lives as possible,” Zelenskyy said on arriving in Germany. In January, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak also signed a security accord with Ukraine. Meanwhile, across the pond in Washington, DC, US President Joe Biden has repeatedly been stressing the importance of sending more aid to Ukraine. On Tuesday, the US Senatepasseda $61bn aid bill for Ukraine. But the bill still faces an uncertain fate with several right-wing US Republicans in the House already saying they will block it as the money should be spent on domestic issues. On Friday, Biden highlighted that the reported death of Russian anticorruption activistAlexey Navalnybrings new urgency to the need for Congress to approve funds for Ukraine to stave off Moscow’s invasion. “The failure to support Ukraine at this critical moment will never be forgotten,” Biden said. “And the clock is ticking. This has to happen. We have to help now.”   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/16/ukraine-signs-french-security-pact-after-similar-agreement-with-germany
"Zelenskyy seeks German, French support as Russia tightens noose on Avdiivka","Ukraine president’s trip to Berlin and Paris comes as battle for eastern city, one of the bloodiest in near two-year war, rages.","Ukraine’s army says heavy battles are raging withpressing Russian forcesin the front-line city of Avdiivka, as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy embarked on a mini-European tour in a new attempt to secure much-needed aid. The army said on Friday its forces were taking up “new positions” in the eastern city as the second anniversary of the war finds Ukraine faced with battlefield challenges and a shortage of ammunition stockpiles amid delays in Western military assistance. “Fierce battles are taking place within the city,” Ukrainian General Oleksandr Tarnavskiy said on social media. “Our troops are using all available forces and means to restrain the enemy,” he added, calling the situation “difficult but controlled”. “New positions have been prepared and powerful fortifications continue to be prepared, taking into account all possible scenarios,” said Tarnavskiy, adding that commanders have been tasked to “stabilise the situation”. Russia has been trying to capture the city since October and has surrounded it on three sides, leaving limited resupply routes for Ukrainian forces. The fraught situation and questions on Ukraine’s ability to hold Avdiivka have fuelled speculation that Russia hopes to take control of it before the Russian presidential election next month, where Vladimir Putin is set to be re-elected. Capturing Avdiivka is a crucial aim for Russia as it would allow it complete control of the two eastern Donbas provinces – Donetsk and Luhansk. But Zelenskyy, who arrived in Germany on Friday before heading to France later in the day, said his government was sending to the region as much support as possible. “We are doing everything we can to ensure that our warriors have enough managerial and technological capabilities to save as many Ukrainian lives as possible,” Zelenskyy, who last weekreplacedhis popular army chief and reshuffled his military command, said during his evening address. The army has also rushed reserve fighters from its Third Assault Brigade, comprised of assault infantry and one of Ukraine’s most prominent fighting groups, to the eastern town. On Thursday, the unit said on Telegram that the situation in Avdiivka was “hell” and “threatening and unstable”. “The situation at the moment the brigade was brought in was extremely critical.” The brigade added that it had conducted a raid against Russian forces in parts of the city and inflicted heavy casualties. Reporting from the city of Kharkiv, further north, Al Jazeera’s Rob McBride said the situation looked “increasingly precarious” for Ukrainian soldiers defending Avdiivka. “At some point, and we may be reaching that point, the Ukrainians may have to decide it’s not worth holding on to something for the sake of the lives of their men and it’s time maybe to pull back,” he said. US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby also told reporters in Washington on Thursday night that “Avdiivka is at risk of falling into Russian control,” citing Ukrainian reports.    The battle for the city has been one of the bloodiest fighting zones since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022. Many have compared it with the fight forBakhmut, where tens of thousands of soldiers were killed and Russia seized control. However, Ukrainian leaders have highlighted the increasingly tricky situation on the eastern front lines because of ammunition shortages. A possible$60bn package of military aidhas been held up in the United States since last year because of wrangling in Congress. Alongside with the US stalling, the European Union has admitted that it will only be able to send half of the one million artillery shells it promised by March. During Zelenskyy’s talks in Berlin and Paris on Friday, the Ukrainian president will attempt to secure guarantees for his country when the war ends. The German defence ministry announced that a deal had been signed between Zelenskyy and Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Friday and that Berlin has prepared a military support package worth 1.13 billion euros ($1.22 bn) that is focused on air defence and artillery. “Our security agreement with Ukraine is historic. For the first time in its history, the Federal Republic of Germany is acting as a guarantor state,” said Defence Minister Boris Pistorius in a statement from the ministry.

"Kyiv aims to use more Ukrainian drones; Trump, Biden clash on NATO",Ukraine’s new military command wants to use the armed forces more efficiently and build up defence industries.,"Ukraine changed its military leadership and announced a change of tactics in the past week, as a vote in the US Senate brought renewed hope of US aid for the embattled country. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyyappointedground forces commander Oleksandr Syrskii as commander-in-chief of the armed forces on February 8. Zelenskyy reportedly asked the outgoingValery Zaluzhnyto “continue to be part of the team”, without specifying what that meant. “We stood against a vile and powerful enemy. Endured together,” wrote Zaluzhny, an immensely popular general who stopped Russia’s invasion in February 2022 and ordered a counterattack in August that year, which claimed more than 1,500sq km (580sq miles) Since then, Ukrainian forces have become bogged down in positional warfare. A counteroffensive last summer failed to achieve its goal of cutting the Russian front in two. “The tasks of 2022 are different from the tasks of 2024,” Zaluzhny wrote.  In his first meeting with Rustem Umyerov, the defence minister, the following day Syrskii said drones and electronic warfare would play a greater role – something Zaluzhnyhad also saidshortly before his dismissal. Ukraine has set a goal of building a million small drones – essentially flying bombs – this year. Prime Minister Denys Shmyal said the government’s primary goal was to develop high-tech defence industries during a budget meeting on Tuesday, with $1bn going to drones alone. “We are talking about the developments of the Defence Tech cluster, scaling up the production of drones of various categories, electronic warfare,” Shmyal said. Mykhailo Fedorov, minister for digital transformation, told Reuters the number and range of Ukraine’s domestically built drones were dramatically increasing. “In December alone, drone deliveries were 50 times higher than in the entire 2022,” he said. Ukraine’s defence ministry launched a web form for Ukrainians to become involved in a community of innovators to “help solve the most difficult challenges at the front”, and is seeking to build a 10:1 technological advantage over Russia. This strategy has been showing results. Two long-range drones struck Russian oil refineries in Ilsky and Afipsky in Krasnodar Krai on Friday. Geolocated footage showed smoke rising from the refineries. Ukrainian naval drones sank the Russian Landing shipCaesar Kunikovoff the southern tip of the Crimean Peninsula on Wednesday. Ukrainian military intelligence’s Group 13 used Magura-V surface drones in the attack. It was the fifth Russian landing ship in the Black Sea Ukraine sank or disabled. Nocturnal video shot by the drones showed the Caesar Kunikov being struck and capsizing to port. A week earlier, Ukraine’s military intelligence used six Magura drones to sink the Ivanovets, a missile corvette.  Bringing greater efficiency to logistics, to keep front lines better supplied, and restoring Ukraine’s units with rest, new troops and training, was also a priority, Syrskii said. Ukraine has almost a million troops under arms. Syrskii also sought to overcome his image as “the butcher”, earned when he ordered a stout defence of the eastern town of Bakhmut that was costly in lives. “Of course, we need to improve tactics. For us, the main task and value is the life of our soldier,” he told Germany’s ZDF television. “I would rather leave, perhaps some position, but I will not allow the death of the entire personnel,” Syrksyii said. He emphasised self-reliance, saying “We, first of all, have to rely on our own strength. Not only on partners.” As these words aired, the US Senate passed a bipartisan national security bill approving $60.6bn in financial and military aid to Ukraine by a vote of 70 to 29. The bill also contained $35bn in aid for Israel and Taiwan. The bill must also pass the House of Representatives, but House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican ally of presidential hopeful Donald Trump, has said he will not consider aid to Ukraine, even though 84 percent of the appropriations would go to US defence manufacturers. “There is no question that if the Senate bill was put on the floor in the House of Representatives, it would pass,” US President Joe Biden said. “So, I call on the speaker to let the full House speak its mind and not allow a minority of the most extreme voices in the House to block this bill even from being voted on.”  Trump has campaigned on cutting US defence costs in Europe, including the cost of defending NATO allies who, he believes, should spend more on defence. “One of the presidents of a big [NATO] country stood up, said, if we don’t pay and we’re attacked by Russia, will you protect us?,” he told students at Coastal Carolina University on Saturday. “No, I will not protect you, in fact, I would encourage [the Russians] to do whatever the hell they want. You gotta pay,” he said to cheers. Biden responded, saying, Trump “gave an invitation” to Russian President Vladimir Putin to invade the US’s NATO allies. “When he looks at NATO, he doesn’t see the alliance that protects America and the world. He sees a protection racket,”said the president. Trump peppered his speech with inaccuracies. He put the bill of US aid to Ukraine thus far at $200bn, and Europe’s contribution at $25bn. In fact, the US has contributed $113bn in financial and military aid, and Europe 88.3 billion euros ($95bn), but Europe has approved a further 39.5 billion euros ($42.5bn) in financial and military aid for this year. Trump’s influence over House Republicans means there are no US appropriations for Ukraine so far this year. The Financial Times reported that Ukraine is already facing artillery shortages. The New York Times reported that Ukraine’s air defence missiles will run out by March unless replenished.    Russian forces, meanwhile, continued to rage against Ukrainian defenders in the east, launching as many as 100 assaults a day. Ukraine’s armed forces estimated they were killing or wounding about 1,000 enemy troops across the front each day – a figure that could not be verified. Tavria group commander Brig-Gen Oleksandr Tarnavskyi said Russia’s aim was to capture Avdiivka. “The enemy is increasingly adding armoured groups to assault infantry groups,” he said. Syrskii made his first trip as commander-in-chief to the eastern front, accompanied by Umyerov. He said troops faced “extremely difficult conditions”. Umerov said drones and electronic warfare reinforcements were on their way. “Avdiivka, Kupiansk, Lyman are extremely important areas on which all our attention is concentrated,” said Umerov.

NATO chief warns US aid delay harming Ukraine’s battle against Russia,"A $95bn aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan requires approval from the US House of Representatives.","NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has warned that the delay in approving United States military aid to Ukraine is harming Kyiv’s forces as they battle against Russia’s invading troops. Before a meeting of NATO defence ministers on Thursday, Stoltenberg said he “expects” the US Congress to agree to “continued support to Ukraine”. On Tuesday, the US Senate approved a$95bn aid packagefor Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, but SpeakerMike Johnson, an ally of former President Donald Trump, has yet to put it to a vote in the lower chamber, the House of Representatives. Stoltenberg said if Russia were to win the war, “it will not only be bad for the Ukrainians, a tragedy for Ukrainians, but also be dangerous for us. It will make the world even more dangerous and us more vulnerable.” Earlier, Russia launched missiles on Ukraine, hitting infrastructure and damaging residential and commercial buildings, injuring at least 11 people in different parts of the country. The Ukrainian military said seven Ukrainian regions were targeted, including the capital, Kyiv, and the cities of Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia and Lviv. The air force said air defence systems shot down 13 of the 26 Russian-launched missiles. On Thursday, military spokesman Dmytro Lykhoviy said the army is withdrawing some troops from the eastern town of Avdiivka to “more advantageous positions” to push Russian forces out of the country. “The key announcement with regards to all this is that supplies to Avdiivka and evacuations from there are difficult,” he said, adding that they had prepared a “reserve logistics artery” in advance. Since last year, Avdiivka has become a significant battleground after Russian forces nearly encircled it and made attempts to enter it. The commander-in-chief of Ukraine’s military, Oleksandr Syrskii, described the situation as “extremely difficult” after a visit to soldiers around the town. Meanwhile, at least six people, including a child, were killed and 18 wounded in a Ukrainian missile attack on the Russian city of Belgorod, Russian officials said. Roman Starovoit, governor of the neighbouring Kursk region, called the attack “a new crime of the Ukrainian Nazis” and said a shopping mall, an outdoor sports facility and residential areas were hit. Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of the Belgorod region, which borders Ukraine, said on social media that five children were among the wounded. There was no immediate comment from Ukraine regarding the reported attack. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is to meet French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday to sign a security agreement at Elysee Palace, the French presidency said. “As Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine will soon enter its third year, this visit will be an opportunity for the President of the Republic to reaffirm France’s determination to continue to provide, in the long term and with all of its partners, unwavering support for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people,” Macron’s office said on Thursday. His office said details would be announced during a press conference. The accord is to outline the framework for long-term humanitarian and financial aid, support for reconstruction and military assistance. According to two diplomats aware of the talks, France is expected to announce a 200-million-euro ($214.7m) fund for civilian projects to be carried out by French companies.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/15/nato-chief-warns-us-aid-delay-harming-ukraines-battle-against-russia

Russia’s Putin signs law to seize assets of those who discredit military,Latest attempt to crush dissent comes into effect ahead of presidential elections in March.,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a law allowing authorities to confiscate the assets of people convicted of spreading “deliberately false information” about the military. The law, which was signed on Wednesday, targets individuals convicted of a range of offences which include “discrediting” the government and spreading “deliberately false information” about the army, threatening them with the loss of money, property, assets and valuables. It would also apply to those convicted of publicly inciting “extremist activities” and calling for actions harmful to state security. The measure wasquickly approvedby the lower and upper houses of parliament. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the law, which could potentially target exiled critics with property at home, had “absolutely” nothing to do with Soviet-style confiscations and said fears it could be misused in practice were “groundless”. Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin had previously said it targets “scoundrels and traitors, those who today spit on the backs of our soldiers, who have betrayed their homeland”. An existing law against “discrediting” the military was adopted as part of a sweeping government crackdown on dissent afterRussia invaded Ukrainein February 2022. It covers offences such as “justifying terrorism” and spreading “fake news” about the military, and has been used extensively to silence Putin’s critics. Thousands of activists, bloggers and other Russians have received long jail terms, or been detained or fined for speaking out against the war amid an escalatingcrackdown on free speechand opposition to Putin. The new law goes into effect just ahead of the second anniversary of the Ukraine offensive andpresidential elections in Marchthat Putin is almost certain to win. Putin has not allowed real electoral opposition during his 24-year leadership of Russia, with rivals such as opposition leaderAlexey Navalnybehind bars. Presidential hopefulBoris Nadezhdin, a prominent critic of the war in Ukraine, has seen his bid to run blocked.

"Ukraine claims critical strike on Caesar Kunikov, Russian Black Sea warship",The attack near occupied Crimea came as Ukraine’s new military chief toured the front lines.,"Ukraine reported its forces have critically damaged a large Russian warship off occupied Crimea, landing a new blow on its foe’s Black Sea fleet. Ukraine’s armed forces said on Wednesday that the attack with naval drones had “destroyed” the Caesar Kunikov landing ship. The strike came as Kyiv’s new military chief toured the front lines, describing the situation as “complex”. The military said via the Telegram messaging app that it had acted in concert with defence ministry intelligence to target the ship, which was in Ukrainian territorial waters near Alupka as it was hit. The Ukrainska Pravda media outlet published videos showing a column of smoke over the sea off the southern coast of Crimea, and helicopters flying over the water. Ukraine has mounted a series of attacks on Russia’s Black Sea Fleet in recent months. Pushing its ships out of the sea’s western waters would help free up a key export route. InFebruary, Ukrainian forces used sea drones to attack and destroy a Russian warship. Cruise missiles struck a large Russian landing warship inDecember. There was no immediate comment from Russia on the latest attack. On land, the pair continues to swapcross-border air strikes. Russia launched several missile attacks on the town of Selydove in the eastern Donetsk region overnight, killing three people, injuring a dozen, and damaging a hospital and several apartments, Ukrainian officials said. Donetsk Governor Vadym Filashkin said on the Telegram messaging app that 100 patients were evacuated after a wing of the town’s hospital was damaged. Several apartments in a five-storey residential building were destroyed, he added, injuring at least four people, including two children. Russian state agency RIA reported that Moscow’s air defence systems destroyed nine Ukraine-launched drones over the Belgorod and Voronezh regions, as well as over the Black Sea. Russia and Ukraine both deny targeting civilians in their attacks on each other’s territories. The use of air strikes has grown as the front line has become largely bogged down in recent months. Nevertheless, fierce fighting continues in the country’s east. Visiting the area, newly appointed Ukrainian military chiefOleksandr Syrskyiidescribed the situation as “extremely complex and stressful”. Syrskyii, who was accompanied by Defence Minister Rustem Umerov, said in a social media statement that the Russian occupiers had “a numerical advantage in personnel”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/14/ukraine-strikes-russian-ship
Biden slams Trump criticism of NATO as ‘shameful’ and ‘un-American’,The Republican frontrunner had questioned the United States’ willingness to support its NATO allies if they were attacked.,"United States President Joe Biden has condemned comments about NATO by his likely 2024 election opponent and former President Donald Trump as “dangerous” and “un-American”, and said they raised the stakes for the US Congress to approve new funding to support Ukraine. Speaking at the White House, the Democratic president on Tuesday criticisedTrump’s comment over the weekendcalling into question the US’s willingness to support members of the Western defence alliance if they were attacked. Biden said the comments by Trump, the Republican frontrunner in the presidential race, made it more urgent that Congress pass his long-stalled funding request to support Ukraine in its war against Russia. “The stakes were already high for American security before this bill waspassed in the Senate,” he said. “But in recent days, those stakes have risen. And that’s because the former president has sent a dangerous, and shockingly, frankly un-American signal to the world.” At a rally in the state of South Carolina on Saturday Trump blasted what he called “delinquent” payments by NATO members and recounted what he said was a past conversation with the head of “a big country” about a potential attack by Russia. “No, I would not protect you. In fact I would encourage them [Russia] to do whatever the hell they want. You gotta pay,” Trump claimed he told the unnamed leader. Biden said Trump’s remarks amounted to an invitation to Russia to invade US allies. “Can you imagine a former president of the United States saying that? The whole world heard it. And the worst thing is he means it,” Biden said. “No other president in our history has ever bowed down to a Russian dictator. Well, let me say this as clearly as I can: I never will.”    In remarks calling for Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson to bring a Senate-passed $95.34bn military aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan to a vote in the House of Representatives, Biden said of Trump’s comments: “For God’s sake, it’s dumb, it’s shameful, it’s dangerous, it’s un-American.” Failing to support Ukraine war funding would amount to support for Vladimir Putin, Biden said, adding that the Russian president’s attacks may move beyond Ukraine’s borders deeper into Europe. NATO, a military alliance of 29 European and two North American countries, has a provision in its statute that says it must defend any member that is attacked. This is not the first time Trump has criticised the alliance. When president, Trump threatened to pull the US out of NATO. He also suggested he could cut Washington’s funding of the organisation, and repeatedly complained thatthe US pays more than it should. As the war in Ukraine nears its second year, concerns have mounted over the ramifications of a potential Trump victory in November.

Ukraine’s new army chief is known as the ‘butcher’. Can he beat Russia?,"New commander-in-chief, Oleksandr Syrskyii, has a strong history of tactical success, but much hinges on US military aid.","The new commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel General Oleksandr Syrskyi has built a fearsome reputation as a military commander in the war with Russia, but he faces some major challenges, including how to mobilise new forces and combat corruption in the ranks. Over the past week, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has fired most of his top generals in an attempt to “reset” management of the country’s decimated, undermanned and undersupplied armed forces. The list of 15 dismissed generals includes the popular commander-in-chief,Valerii Zaluzhnyi, who has been replaced by Syrskyi – described by some as a “butcher” with little regard for loss of human life. Some heads of combined forces, military reserve, ground and airborne forces, along with some of their deputies and advisers, have survived the cull. “The first thought is that this is an absolutely unprecedented action,” said Nikolay Mitrokhin of Germany’s Bremen University, who has been writing detailed analyses of the Russia-Ukraine war since the conflict began in 2022. “Apparently, it was coordinated with the new commander-in-chief, Syrskyi, who named the people he would want to work with as a team,” Mitrokhin told Al Jazeera. The wave of dismissals follows the failure of last year’s counteroffensive to regain Russian-occupied areas in southern and eastern Ukraine, corruption scandals, dire delays to Western military aid and chaotic management of the armed forces. However, the scale of dismissals reflects the way Zelenskyy has been managing Ukraine since coming to power in 2019. “It’s very much in Zelenskyy’s style with his decision to ‘fire ’em all’, not only those who failed their work, but even those who belong to the wrong generation or team,” Mitrokhin said. The only top officers who have kept their jobs are the ones who commandedsuccessful operationsagainst the Russian fleet on the Black Sea, along with some heads of the air force and air defence force who “demonstrate success or stability in repelling Russian attacks”, he said. The new top brass faces a string of challenges – and mobilisation is number one. Kyiv does not disclose its battlefield casualties, but Washington believes Ukraine has lost at least 70,000 servicemen. The now-dismissed Zaluzhnyi had wanted to mobilise 500,000 men, but Zelenskyy rejected the idea fearing popular protests and citing limitations in training, housing and arming. Thousands of Ukrainian men of fighting age are believed to have bribed their way out of the country – or crossed Ukraine’s borders illegally, either by land or even by swimming across the ice-cold waters of the Prut River near Moldova. Some conscription officers have been arrested after receiving bribes of thousands or tens of thousands of dollars to “free” someone from military service and have now amassed enormous assets in Ukraine and abroad. Zelenskyy fired each regional conscription officer, replacing them with battle-tested veterans vetted by intelligence services. But the new appointees failed to mobilise enough men for the 1,000km-long front line amid devastating losses of manpower. Meanwhile, some servicemen are snubbing the shake-up of Ukraine’s top brass. One seasoned veteran who enlisted in 2014, after pro-Russian separatists took up arms against Kyiv in the southeastern Donbas region, and had just returned from the front line, was especially dismissive about new top general Syrskyi. “This man sent me to die as if I were meat,” he told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity, saying the servicemen who complain about their superiors or corruption end up dispatched to the most dangerous front-line spots to be killed. He claimed that medical doctors are instructed to ignore life-threatening wounds and injuries. “A man lost two legs and still was deemed fit for service,” he said. Other servicemen have reportedly complained about Syrskyi’s “butcher” tactics of neglecting human losses. Syrskyi addressed these concerns in his first public speech on the new job. “The life and health of servicemen has always been and is the main value of the Ukrainian army,” Syrskyi said on February 9. The former deputy chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said Syrskyi is indeed “harsher” than his predecessor. “Judging by his previous actions, he has a harsher approach in preparing and organising action and in holding his subordinates accountable,” Lieutenant-General Ihor Romanenko told Al Jazeera. However, Syrskyi “is very scrupulous in preparing for hostilities, he goes into details, thoroughly studies matters of supply and so on”, Romanenko said. While heading land forces, Syrskyi has been credited with two significant successes. One was the defence of Kyiv in February and March 2022, when tens of thousands of Russian soldiers tried to encircle the capital from the north. Under Syrskyi’s command, small and highly autonomous groups of servicemen and irregular forces attacked Russian troops and armoured vehicles, cut off their supply lines and used drones for reconnaissance and surprise attacks. One such serviceman was Bohdan Yavorsky, whose group of two dozen men ambushed a column of armoured vehicles in the northern Kyiv suburb of Bucha. They immobilised the column by bombing the first and last vehicles and showering the rest with grenades and Molotov cocktails before speeding away and calling in an air raid to destroy the rest of the vehicles. “This crap was stinking in the centre of Bucha for a month until it was removed,” Yavorsky told Al Jazeera in August 2022. Syrskyi’s second big success was also in 2022, when he clandestinely amassed light infantry in the eastern Kharkiv region to break through Russian defences and liberate the entire region despite Russia’s superiority in artillery. Another major challenge for Ukraine’s new top brass is delays in Western aid. The 27 member states of the European Union agreed earlier this month to unblock 50 billion euros (about $54bn) in aid, but Republicans in the US Congress aligned with GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump still object to a $60bn package from the United States. “It’s obvious [the EU] won’t solve everything without the Americans. That’s why the American conundrum has been going on for too long, which is definitely not positive for us,” Romanenko said. The delay is not ruining Ukraine’s economy but is absolutely crucial for the military. “The economy is not going to crash until the year’s end,” Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kushch told Al Jazeera. “The main problem is the supply of arms and ammo. Without US aid there’s not enough money for that.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/13/who-is-ukraine-armys-new-commander-in-chief-and-what-challenges-does-he-fa
Russia puts Baltic officials on wanted list as Estonia warns of war plans,"As Estonian PM Kaja Kallas is targeted by Russian police, intel chief warns Russian war on West coming in ‘next decade’.","Russia has put top officials from the Baltic states on its wanted list as tension continues to simmer amid the war in Ukraine. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Tuesday that Estonian Prime MinisterKaja Kallasand two other top Baltic officials have been added to the country’s wanted list. The move coincided with the release of an Estonian intelligence report warning that Russia is gearing up to wage war on the West in the coming decade. Kallas, Estonian State Secretary Taimar Peterkop and Lithuanian Culture Minister Simonas Kairys have been listed on the interior ministry’s database due to the “destruction” of monuments to Soviet soldiers. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have removed numerous Soviet-era memorials since they gained independence as the Soviet Union broke up in 1991. That process, which had already soured relations with Moscow, has gained momentum since Russia invaded Ukraine. Following up, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov accused Kallas of conducting hostile actions against Russia. Like her counterparts in Latvia and Lithuania, theEstonian leaderis among Europe’s most outspoken supporters of Ukraine. “The regime is doing what it has always done: it is trying to stifle freedom … and to continue to create its own version that is at odds with facts or logic,” said Kairys in a statement relayed via AFP. The same day, Estonia’s chief of intelligence claimed that Russia is “anticipating a possible conflict withNATOwithin the next decade or so”. Unveiling the country’s annual report on national security threats, Kaupo Rosin said the assessment was based on Russia’s plans to double the number of troops stationed along its border with the Baltic states and Finland, all of which are NATO members. However, the report noted that with Russian forces bogged down in Ukraine, a direct military attack on the West in the short term is “highly unlikely”. At the same time, the intelligence chief noted United States presidential candidateDonald Trump’s commentsthat he would not defend allies who don’t spend enough on defence, saying “such statements are never helpful”. Estonia and the other Baltic States have increased their military spending to more than 2 percent of gross domestic product since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, and NATO allies have raised their presence in those countries. Germany plans to have 4,800 combat-ready troops in the region by 2027, in its first permanent foreign deployment since World War II.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/13/russia-declares-estonian-pm-and-other-baltic-officials
Global defence spending jumped to record $2.2 trillion last year: Report,"Spending set to rise in 2024 with Israel’s war on Gaza, Russia-Ukraine conflict, tensions in Indo-Pacific.","Global defence spending jumped 9 percent to a record $2.2 trillion last year, a British military think tank said, and is set to rise in 2024 with Israel’swar on Gaza, the conflict in Ukraine and rising tensions in the Indo-Pacific region. A new report on Tuesday from the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) also mentioned growing unease in the Arctic, North Korea’s pursuit of nuclear weapons, concerns over China and the rise of military regimes in the Sahel region of Africa as contributing to the world entering “a highly volatile security environment”. “The current military-security situation heralds what is likely to be a more dangerous decade, characterised by the brazen application by some of military power to pursue claims,” read the annual report which the IISS has been compiling annually for the past 65 years. The “era of insecurity” is resetting the global defence-industrial landscape, with the United States and Europe ramping up production of missiles and ammunition “after decades of underinvestment”, the report added. Driven in part by NATO member states’ response to Russia’sinvasion of Ukraine, global military spending reached a record $2.2 trillion, it noted. The alliance’s non-US members have boosted military spending by 32 percent since Russia invaded Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014, the institute found. Wars in Ukraine and Gaza, Iran’s use of networks of influence, and China’s more assertive foreign and security policy all contribute to a picture of global strategic instability and a new era of contested power |@B_Giegerich#MilitaryBalancehttps://t.co/fOs6Itoa6X — IISS News (@IISS_org)February 13, 2024  The report comes days after Republican frontrunner Donald Trump said he had previously told an unspecified NATO member’s leader that he would“encourage” Russiato do “whatever the hell they want” in that country if it had not met its financial obligations to the military alliance. “You got to pay. You got to pay your bills,” Trump said at a campaign rally in South Carolina on Saturday. Ten members of the alliance met the goal of spending 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) on defence, up from just two members in 2014. According to IISS figures, 19 members increased spending last year. “Russia’s actions have reinvigorated NATO, with Finland completing its rapid alliance accession process in April 2023,” the report noted. “Russia’s border with NATO members is now more than 1,300 kilometres [800 miles] longer.”    The report said that Iran’s supply of missiles to Houthi rebels in Yemen and drones to Russia highlightedTehran’s growing influence in conflict zones. China had also demonstrated “increased power-projection capacity”, it added. The conflicts are not just overlapping, but they are also involving an increasing number of non-Western countries compared to two decades ago, said Samir Puri, a visiting lecturer in war studies from King’s College London. “The West was leading the sort of military involvement of normal armed forces rather than insurgents,” Puri told Al Jazeera. “Twenty years later, there’s a much wider range of countries that are involved in conflicts, countries like Russia and Turkey, and indeed Saudi Arabia and others have become much more interventionist, much more active,” Puri said. Defence spending is also being fueled byrising tensions in Asiawhere countries are arming themselves for deterrence, but also by the growing demand for modern technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and Global Position Systems (GPS). “Everything else that requires a lot of research and development spending,” Puri added.    One of the report’s key findings was that Russia has lost some 3,000 main battle tanks during the fighting in Ukraine, or roughly as many as it had in its active inventory before the full-scale invasion began in February 2022. While Moscow has replenished its forces by pulling 2,000 older tanks out of storage, the Ukrainian government is relying on Western nations to provide the ammunition and weaponry it needs to hold off its bigger neighbour. Lessons learned from the war in Ukraine are starting to influence military planning in other countries, the IISS said, with many countries recognising that they need to increase production of military hardware and build up bigger stockpiles in case they are forced to fight a protracted war.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/13/global-defence-spending-jumped-to-record-2-2-trillion-last-year-report
Elon Musk denies selling Starlink to Russia after Ukraine claims use in war,Moscow says SpaceX’s internet service ‘cannot be officially used here in any way’.,"Elon Musk has denied selling his Starlink internet service to Russia after Ukraine claimed the terminals were being used by Russian troops on the front lines of the war. “A number of false news reports claim that SpaceX is selling Starlink terminals to Russia. This is categorically false,” Musk, who leads SpaceX and several other companies including Tesla, said in the post on X on Monday. “To the best of our knowledge, no Starlinks have been sold directly or indirectly to Russia.” Moscow also rejected Kyiv’s claim that Starlink terminals had been smuggled into Russia and were being used on a “systematic” basis in Russian-occupied Donetsk. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Starlink is not certified for use in Russia. “It cannot be officially supplied here and is not officially supplied here,” Peskov told reporters on Monday. On Sunday,Ukraine’s military intelligence agency GUR said that intercepted conversations among Russian forces revealed that Starlink terminals had been deployed among troops operating near the towns of Klishchiivka and Andriivka. GUR spokesman Andriy Yusov said on state TV that Starlink terminals were entering Russia through parallel importing, not official channels. Starlink said in a post on X last week that it “does not do business of any kind with the Russian Government or its military” and the service “will not work” in the country. Ukraine’s military has credited Starlink for allowing its forces to communicate, gather intelligence and coordinate attacks more quickly and securely than would be possible using radio or phone communications. Last year, Musk came under scrutiny after it emerged that he had refused a request by Ukraine to activate Starlink to assist in a surprise attack on Russia’s fleet in Crimea’s port of Sevastopol. Musk said he had refused the request, which was first reported in extracts of Walter Isaacson’s biography about the billionaire because it would have made him “explicitly complicit in a major act of war and conflict escalation”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/13/elon-musk-denies-selling-starlink-to-russia-after-ukraine-claims-use-in-war
"US House speaker blasts aid deal for Israel, Ukraine as Senate backs bill",Republican Mike Johnson says the bill does not address the ‘most pressing’ issue of security at the US-Mexico border.,"United States House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson has cast doubt on the fate of a $95.3bn aid package for countries including Ukraine and Israel as the Senate voted to advance the legislation aimed at reassuring Washington’s allies. Johnson, the top Republican in the House, said the Senate had “failed to meet the moment” by not addressing security on the US-Mexico border, which he described as the “most pressing issue facing our country”. “The mandate of national security supplemental legislation was to secure America’s own border before sending additional foreign aid around the world,” Johnson said in a statement on Monday. “It is what the American people demand and deserve.” Johnson previously said that anearlier version of the bill would be “dead on arrival”as curbs it placed on unauthorised migration did not go far enough. Last week, a majority of Senate Republicans voted to kill a bipartisan bill that included the most comprehensive immigration reforms in years amid opposition by former President Donald Trump, who has led his party to adopt more sceptical stances towards immigration and intervention overseas. After stripping out the immigration provisions from the legislation, the Democratic-led Senate on Monday voted 66-33 to bring the military aid package closer to a final vote that could come as soon as Wednesday. Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer said the deal reflected “our security, our values, our democracy” and would be a “down payment for the survival of Western democracy and the survival of Western values”. “The entire world is going to remember what the Senate does in the next few days,” Schumer said. US President Joe Biden has urged Congress to quickly approve additional military aid for Ukraine, Israel and Asia Pacific allies including Taiwan. Conservative Republicans in the House have resisted Biden’s calls, insisting on measures to tackle “illegal” immigration at the southern border and questioning the need to continue support for Ukraine. Senator JD Vance, an Ohio Republican, on Monday blasted the push to support Ukraine as a “fetish”. “There are some Republicans for whom Ukraine is the most important issue confronting the country,” Vance said in an interview with former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. “And I just say, even if you’re pro Ukraine funding, and obviously I’m not, don’t we have 10 more important issues confronting this nation, between the border problem, the debt problem? Why are we so obsessed with this?”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/13/us-house-speaker-casts-doubt-on-israel-ukraine-aid-package-as-senate-advances-bill

"Russia slaps sanctions on British officials, historians and academics",Moscow says UK bears responsibility for ‘crimes against civilians’ for assisting Ukraine to repel Russia’s invasion.,"Russia has imposed sanctions on 18 British citizens including officials, academics and Russia experts for what Moscow says is an attempt to demonise Russia and fan the war in Ukraine. “We are forced to state that Russophobically charged British representatives do not shy away trying to discredit the constitutional system and socio-political processes in our country,” Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Monday. “The so-called brain trusts operating on the basis of the largest British and Western educational institutions make a significant contribution to the subversive work of London in the Russian direction.” The Russian Foreign Ministry also said the United Kingdom’s strategy on Ukraine has led to further escalation and loss of life in the war. “By pushing the [President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy regime to continue the bloodshed, the British must realise that, along with Ukrainian neo-Nazis, they bear responsibility for crimes against civilians,” the ministry alleged. Personal sanctions were announced against British Deputy Defence Minister James Cartlidge, Deputy National Security Adviser Sarah MacIntosh and Director of Submarines Simon Asquith. Others targeted included Stuart Peach, the British prime minister’s special envoy to the Western Balkans, as well as Lords Dan Hannan and Michael Ashcroft. The academics sanctioned included historians Orlando Figes, Norman Davies, Timothy Garton Ash, Rob Johnson, David Abulafia and experts including Roy Allison of the University of Oxford, Graeme Robertson of the University of North Carolina, Calder Walton of Harvard University and James Sherr of the International Centre for Defence & Security in Tallinn. There was no immediate comment from the British government. The UK has provided military and financial aid to Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. In January, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the country will increase its military aid to Ukraine in the next financial year to 2.5 billion pounds ($3.15bn), an increase of 200 million pounds ($252m) on the previous two years. Sunak and Zelenskyy also signed a security agreement that the Ukrainian leader said would remain in place until Kyiv joined the NATO military alliance. Ukraine had been fighting for the principles of freedom and democracy for two years, Sunak said in a statement in January. “We will stand with Ukraine in their darkest hours and in the better times to come,” he promised.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/12/russia-slaps-sanctions-on-british-officials-historians-and-academics
Ukraine protests destruction of grain exports by Polish farmers,"Farmers continue to protest that cheap grain imports, mandated by the European Union, are hurting them, despite financial support.","Ukraine has condemned what it called the “destruction” of its grain by protesting Polish farmers amid a long-running spat over imports of cheap grain. The agriculture ministry said on Monday said Kyiv “strongly condemns the deliberate destruction of Ukrainian grain by Polish protesters”. With Russia’s invasion limiting Ukraine’s grain exports via the Black Sea, Brussels mandated tariff-free access to European Union markets. However, farmers in eastern member states have complained that the imports undercut them. Kyiv’s anger follows the emergence of images and videos online showing demonstrators on the border between Ukraine and Poland dumping grain from trucks onto the road in a show of protest. Polish truckers and farmers have been staging protests at multiple border crossings with the neighbouring country for several months. They have expressed anger towards EU officials, demanding they scrap rules that allow cheap Ukrainian grain to enter the bloc. The acceptance of the cheap Ukrainian grain is part of policies adopted by the bloc tosupport Kyiv’s economy amid the ongoing warwith Russia, but protesters have said this has harmed their livelihoods. Despite having been one of Ukraine’s staunchest supporters amid the Russian invasion, Poland – as well as several other countries in the region, such as Romania – imposed temporary bans last year on imports of Ukrainian grain. The EU has condemned such measures, instead offering financial assistance to help make up for the losses. But some farmers have remained defiant,using their tractorsto block border crossings and destroying grain. After launching its invasion two years ago, Moscow initially blocked shipping routes from Black Sea ports to stall Ukrainian vessels from transporting grain and other agricultural products. The blockade eventually ended, but the war has had a significant impact on grain supplies across the world, with both Russia and Ukraine major exporters.

"For Ukraine’s defence industry goals against Russia, the sky’s the limit","To defeat Russia’s might and allies’ political flicker, Ukraine wants to build the defence workshop of the world.","As Ukraine approaches the second anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion, it plans to produce more if its own ammunition and key weapons systems. The goal of greater self-sufficiency comes as Ukraine’s Western allies meet increasing political resistance to military aid and Russia ramps up weapons production. Last month, Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said the country plans to increase its domestic weapons production sixfold this year. Ukraine’s defence industry has already begun to expand. Strategic industries minister Oleksandr Kamyshin said Ukraine last year doubled its ammunition production for NATO-calibre artillery systems. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said it had produced three times more equipment and weapons than in the first year of the war. That included armored vehicles and anti-tank missile systems. But it’s in unmanned systems that Ukraine aims to be a global pioneer. Almost 200 companies produced drones in Ukraine last year, up from seven in 2022, and their production increased 100-fold, said Shmyal. That meant Ukraine was already producing 90 percent of the drones it uses, Zelenskyy said during a meeting with the joint chiefs this month. The armed forces approved eight new models for procurement last month alone. On Tuesday, Zelenskyy explained why. He founded  the Unmanned Systems Forces, suggesting “special units” would be embedded in the army, air force and navy, and promised “constant scaling of production” to keep them supplied. “Our task this year is not only to bolster our sky shield and Ukraine’s long-range capabilities to the fullest extent possible, but also to inflict maximum systemic losses on Russia,” Zelenskyy said. As part of that goal, Ukraine plans to produce a million light drones and 11,000 medium- and long-range drones, the latter with a range of more than 1,000km (620 miles), said Kamyshin. Ukraine had “established production” and a  “financing plan” to achieve this, Rustem Umyerov, defence minister, told a meeting of the G7 representatives in Kyiv last December. Days before he was dismissed,Valerii Zaluzhny, commander in chief,  wrote that unmanned systems were “almost the only tool” to break the current stalemate, making up for Russia’s superiority in heavy equipment and personnel. Experts tell Al Jazeera Ukraine’s ambitions are realistic. “Kyiv certainly has the capacity to mass produce FPV [first person viewer] UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles] given that many of these are based on commercial or hobbyist products,” Douglas Barrie, senior fellow for military aerospace at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), a think tank, told Al Jazeera. “Manufacturing larger multi-role UAVs is more demanding, but again Kyiv has the ability to do this, if on a far smaller scale,” Barrie said. “After the fall of the USSR, [Ukraine] was one of few countries that had a functioning aircraft engine industry,” Pieter Wezeman, senior researcher at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), told Al Jazeera. “They can use that knowledge to rebuild a missile or a drone production capacity. It’s not coming from nowhere,” said Wezeman, whose research focuses on arms transfers and military production. Early in the war, Ukraine repurposed commercially available FPV drones to drop grenades into the hatches of parked Russian tanks, instantly killing their crews. They offered an added propaganda bonus: drones could beam back video of the kills, allowing Ukraine to humiliate the Russian armed forces while boosting their own morale. Ukraine believes building these drones more cheaply by itself would offer it more bang for the buck, cycle military expenditure back into its tax base and one day produce export revenue. “Basically, they want to build a million flying munition pieces,” said Wezeman. “They will need some foreign components – a little chip, a camera like the one in a mobile phone… it’s not as extreme as it may sound.” Oleksiy Danilov, who heads Ukraine’s National Defence and Security Council, recently claimed that Ukraine was already among the top three drone manufacturers in the world. Russia’s plans to produce more than 32,000 drones each year by 2030 seem tame in comparison to Ukraine’s. Unable to match Ukraine’s production, Russia agreed to pay Iran $1.75bn for 6,000 Shahed drones, Ukrainian hackers recently revealed. Suddenly last summer, Ukraine used a concert of unmanned systems to strike the occupied Crimean Peninsula with devastating effect. On August 23, it destroyed a Russian S-400 anti-aircraft missile system 120km (74 miles) from the front line. On September 12, a combination of 10 drones and cruise missiles crippled a Russian submarine and a landing ship undergoing maintenance at the Sevastopol dry docks. Two days later, surface dronesstruck two patrol shipsand a missile corvette, while missiles destroyed a second S-400 battery in western Crimea’s Yevpatoria. The reason for the escalation wasRussia’s withdrawalfrom the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which allowed Ukraine to export agricultural goods. These are a lifeline for its economy and war effort, bringing it $23bn last year. The most crippling strikes were yet to come. On September 20,Ukraine destroyedhalf the Black Sea Fleet’s communications headquarters in Verkhnosadove northeast of the fleet base in Sevastopol, and two days later hit the fleet command headquarters in Sevastopol itself, claiming to have killed 34 officers, including fleet commander Admiral Viktor Sokolov. Ukraine built up a sense of mystique around its weapons systems during this time, claiming to have developed a missile capable of travelling 700km (435 miles) and to have put variants of its naval drone into experimental operational use with success. “The missiles used against Crimea may very well go back to missiles Ukraine developed before the war started,” said Wezeman. Ukraine was known to be developing the Hrim-2, a short-range ballistic missile for Saudi Arabia. “They may have continued that project and used prototypes of that or other preproduction missiles,” said Wezeman. Ukraine’s ranged strikes have continued. Last month, Ukraine sent drones 1,250km (780 miles) to blow up aNovatek gas processing plantnear the Russian city of St Petersburg, forcing the company to suspend operations. Last week, a wolf pack of six droneshunted down and sankthe missile corvette Ivanovets off Crimea. The astonishing success of this remote warfare is that lacking a fleet, Ukraine has nonetheless managed to secure a corridor for grain ships in the Black Sea. More than 600 ships have safely used it since Russia announced it was shutting down traffic to Ukraine’s ports. Defence minister Umerov last year invited Western defence companies to invest in Ukraine, enticing them with a $7bn procurement budget for the year. Apart from low labour costs, Ukraine offers the world’s largest and most active battlefield to test new designs. Although Israel’s war in Gaza now claims much of the world’s attention, large numbers of personnel from the Russian and Ukrainian sides are reportedly dying on Ukraine’s battlefields every day. “The Western companies want to have access to the battlefield so they can have feedback on their systems. They need to know if they are ready for the future wars … so Ukraine is leveraging this to create the industrial base,” Tymofiy Mylovanov, the director of the Kyiv School of Economics, told Al Jazeera. Ukrainians are themselves rushing to cash in on the industry, he said. “We have… a lot of garage, Steve Jobs-style innovators, some [in] hardware, some software, some just assembly, but we’re talking hundreds if not thousands of companies,” he said. “This area is really booming right now… The talent from the entire economy went into miltech,” he said, using shorthand for military technology. Proximity to the battlefield offers the industry a quick feedback loop. “There’s also a lot of military personnel being advisers, co-owners, members of startup teams,” said Mylovanov. “People who are engineers themselves are on the front lines deploying their own equipment and immediately fixing it.” Domestic production would also tighten the loop to market, he said. “I have seen Polish military companies adjust their products by several generations already in two years, just to respond to what’s happening,” said Mylovanov. “There’s definitely been a level of openness on the part of many, many Western defence companies taking the first step and entering into very basic level discussions with the Ukrainians,” Elisabeth Gosselin Malo, a defence correspondent for Defence News, told Al Jazeera. But the safety of personnel is a concern, she said. Whereas last winter Russia attempted to destroy Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, since December 29, it has used drones and missiles to target defence industries. “We’ve seen cooperation increase in smaller steps – first entering into a cooperation agreement, providing them with systems, then maybe sending a few operators to train people there, and a few companies took it a little further, maybe assembling a few parts in Kyiv,” said Gosselin Malo.    For this reason, some contractors have recently opted to base production facilities in nearby Poland and Lithuania, which are under NATO’s security umbrella. Ukrainians have decided to cope differently. One manufacturer, TAF Drones, dispersed production to a dozen locations in six cities and changes those locations every three months, CEO Oleksandr Yakovenko recently told the TV channel Espresso. Despite such difficulties, Turkishdrone manufacturer Baykarrecently revealed it was building a factory in Ukraine to produce about 120 drones a year. Germany’s Rheinmetall, among the world’s 30 largest defence industries, last year established a joint venture to build armoured vehicles in Ukraine “to assure its strategic autonomy”. Finnish armoured vehicle maker Patria is also said to be considering a joint venture in Ukraine. Others may follow, including Belgium and France. United States President Joe Biden met with leaders of venture capital firms at the White House last month to encourage investment in Ukraine. Perhaps the most difficult period of this war for Ukraine came after it defeated Russia’s initial assault to take Kyiv and the entire southern littoral in early 2022. Russia dug in and imposed on Ukraine a war of attrition, steamrolling over a series of eastern cities – Severodonetsk, Lysychansk and Bakhmut – with relentless manned assaults that produced a huge loss of life. Ukraine allowed itself to be drawn into this urban warfare, reasoning that it killed far more attackers than defenders and expecting Russian President Vladimir Putin to hit a wall recruiting new troops. But Putin raised half a million new troops without much political backlash last year and expects to do the same this year.  Zaluzhny’s insistence that Ukraine do the same may have brought him a step closer to dismissal on February 9. “Russia has taken a different approach by not thinking in terms of smart arms but in terms of manpower and surface warfare and large kill offensives – old style,” said Wezeman. “They have failed but it has put Ukraine in a very hard position.” Ukraine’s position, he said, was, “We need the smart weapons because we’re not going to sacrifice our soldiers in the same way as Russia.” So, Ukraine is innovating. In January it unveiled the Sirko-S1, a four-wheeled robot that autonomously follows troops into battle, conducts reconnaissance and helps evacuate the wounded. In December, Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) revealed the Mamai, a new surface drone with a top speed of 110km/h (68 miles/h), claiming it was “the fastest object on the Black Sea to date”. Given Russia’s highly developed electronic warfare, which disables guided munitions by scrambling their satellite positioning signals, Ukraine is focusing on developing ballistic munitions. “A smart platform gets close enough so it can use a dumb, non-suppressible weapon to actually hit precisely enough,” explained Mylovanov. He saw a bright unmanned future made in Ukraine, whose youth will fight in the lab, not in the mud. “I think in a couple of years, [the world will have] walking or self-driving platforms with a sniper rifle that get deployed for surgical strikes.” “But yes,” he said, recalling the present. “We need bullets, we need shells.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/12/for-ukraines-defence-industry-ambitions-the-skys-the-limit

Ukraine aid package approval gains momentum after key US Senate vote,"Despite opposition from former US President Donald Trump, senators moved closer to passing a foreign aid bill.","A narrowly divided US Senate moved closer to passing a $95.34bn aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, showing undiminished bipartisanship despite mounting opposition from Republican hardliners and former US President Donald Trump. On Sunday, the Democratic-led Senate voted 67-27 to clear the latest procedural hurdle and moved the foreign aid measure towards an ultimate vote on passage in the coming days. Eighteen Republicans backed the legislation after Trump, the dominant Republican White House candidate, criticised the bill on social media by saying that the foreign aid should take the form of a loan. Democratic President Joe Biden, who has been seeking the aid for months, on Friday said Congress would be guilty of “neglect” if it failed to pass the measure. The bill includes $61bn for Ukraine, $14bn for Israel in its war against Hamas and $4.83bn to support partners in the Indo-Pacific, including Taiwan, and deter aggression by China. It also would provide $9.15bn in humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza and the West Bank, Ukraine and other conflict zones around the globe. The money is viewed as crucial by Kyiv, as it grinds toward the second anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Passage of the bill in the US Senate would send the legislation on to the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, where it faces an uncertain future. During a visit to Kyiv on Friday, a bipartisan delegation of House lawmakers vowed to do their part to pass the measure. Senate Republicans believe bipartisan passage would help stir support among Republicans in the House. “It will shape the environment such that … more Republicans will feel comfortable advancing the bill,” Senator Todd Young, an Indiana Republican, told reporters. Republicans want amendments that could address the increase in migration across the US-Mexico border and forgo humanitarian assistance provisions by restricting foreign aid to weapons and materiels. But some Republicans who oppose further aid to Ukraine have vowed to delay consideration by forcing the Senate to comply with a labyrinth of time-consuming parliamentary rules. “It is necessary to maintain American support. And I am grateful to our American partners who recognise this. We cannot let Russian war and evil spread,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksyy said in a statement on his social media platforms on Saturday. “[Russian President Vladimir] Putin sobers up only when he sees strength in front of him. Strength is required. I am grateful to everyone who helps us increase it,” Zelenskyy said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/11/ukraine-aid-package-approval-gains-momentum-after-key-us-senate-vote
Ukraine intelligence ‘confirms’ Russian forces using Starlink,"Starlink terminals, which provide high-speed communications, have been vital in giving Ukraine’s military an edge over invading Russian troops.","Ukrainian intelligence said it has confirmed that Russian forces are using satellite internet service Starlink on the battlefield in occupied areas in the east of the country. Releasing what it said on Sunday was proof, Ukraine’s military intelligence said it has confirmed earlier reports that of the “systemic” use by Russian troops of terminals of Elon Musk’s satellite communications system. Starlink systems have been vital for Ukraine‘s battlefield communications in Russia’s nearly two-year-old invasion as Kyiv has faced a larger and better-equipped military. The personal control of Starlink by the US billionaire, who has regularly repeated Kremlin talking points regarding the conflict, remains a concern for Kyiv and its allies. The terminals were rushed in to help Ukraine after Russia’s February 2022invasionand have been vital to Kyiv’s battlefield communications. Following reports in Ukraine, Space X said last week that it “does not do business of any kind with the Russian government or its military”. However, the Ministry of Defence’s Main Directorate of Intelligence (GUR) posted an audio clip on Telegram which it said featured Russian troops discussing setting up the terminals in eastern Ukraine. “Cases of the Russian occupiers’ use of the given devices have been registered. It is beginning to take on a systemic nature,” GUR quoted spokesman Andriy Yusov as saying. In a statement, the agency said the terminals were being used by units like Russia’s 83rd Air Assault Brigade, which is fighting near the embattled towns of Klishchiivka and Andriivka in the partially-occupied eastern region of Donetsk. Reports from Ukraine last week claimed that Russia has been sourcing Starlink equipment in spots such as Dubai. Western tech components have regularly been found among Russia’s arsenal as Moscow has become more skilled at evading sanctions, often importing goods via third countries.    Russian forces launched 45 drones at Ukraine overnight, Kyiv reported on Sunday. The five-and-a-half-hour attack targeted agricultural facilities and coastal infrastructure, officials for Ukraine’s southern defence forces wrote on Telegram. They added that a strike in the Mykolaiv region had injured one person, sparking a fire and damaging nearby residential buildings. Another person was injured in Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk region when a blaze broke out due to falling debris from a destroyed drone, said the head of the region’s military administration, Serhiy Lysak. The strikes come as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy continues his shakeup of military commanders in a bid to maintain momentum against attacking Russian forces. Kyiv announced that former Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Pavlyuk would become the new commander of Ukraine’s ground forces. The post was previously held byOleksandr Syrsky, who was named Thursdayas the replacement for Ukraine’soutgoing military chief, Valerii Zaluzhny. New presidential decrees also named Yurii Sodol, the former head of Ukraine’s marine corps, as the new commander of Ukraine’s combined forces; Ihor Skibiuk as commander of Ukraine’s air assault forces; and Ihor Plahuta as commander of Ukraine’s territorial defence forces. Incoming commander-in-chief Syrsky has signalled that his immediate goals include improving troop rotation at the front lines and harnessing the power of new technology at a time when Kyiv’s forces are largely on the defensive.

Overnight Russian drone attack kills at least seven in Ukraine’s Kharkiv,"Three children among the dead, says official, as the Russian attack triggers fire and damages homes.","An overnight Russian drone attack has killed at least seven people, including three children, in Ukraine’s eastern city of Kharkiv, officials say. Regional Governor Oleg Synegubov said on Telegram on Saturday three children, aged seven, four, and six months, were among the victims after the strikes hit at least 15 houses, causing large-scale fires. Kharkiv, about 30km (18 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border, has often felt the brunt of Russia’s winter campaign of long-range strikes that commonly hit civilian areas. On January 23,a barrage of missiles struck Kharkivand two other Ukrainian cities in one of the heaviest bombardments since the start of the year. At least 11 people were killed as about 5,000 windows in 222 buildings were broken by the blasts and shockwaves throughout the region, officials said. It marked what the United Nations called “an alarming reversal” of a trend last year that saw a drop in civilian casualties from Moscow’s attacks. The city with a pre-war population of 1.5 million is Ukraine’s most vulnerable urban centre. Russia lies north and east of it, and the border of Moscow-annexed Luhansk region is about 150km (90 miles) to the southeast.    Since day one of the full-scale invasion in February 2022, Russian forces have tried to seize Kharkiv, dispatching armed personnel carriers almost to the city centre. Moscow has deployed strategic bombers, ballistic or cruise missiles, and Iranian or Russian-made drones that take just minutes to reach the city from across the border. Unlike the capital, Kyiv, which received advanced Western air defence systems within months, Kharkiv remains almost defenceless. Residents and authorities have had to adapt quickly as any delays mean lost lives. Russian strikes keep Ukrainians on edge while the 1,500-km (930-mile) front line has barely budged. Both sides’inability to deliver major gainson the battlefield has pushed the fighting towards trench and artillery warfare. Ukraine’s struggles with ammunition and personnel come on the heels of a failed counteroffensive last summer and as European allies try to bump up their military production. To shake things up, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursdayappointed Oleksandr Syrskyas the new head of Ukraine’s armed forces. The move amounted to the most serious change of the top military brass since the start of the war.

"Who is Colonel General Oleksandr Syrsky, Ukraine’s new army chief?","Syrsky, who replaces General Valerii Zaluzhny, has been called ‘Snow Leopard’ and ‘Hero of Ukraine’ for his battlefield successes.","Colonel General Oleksandr Syrsky, the man President Volodymyr Zelenskyyhas chosento lead Ukraine’s military, has played a key role in some of the country’s biggest victories in its war with Russia, including overseeing the successful defence of the capital, Kyiv, in the early days of the invasion. Like most senior officers of his generation, Syrsky was born in Soviet Russia, in July 1965, and studied at a Red Army academy in Moscow. In the 1980s he was deployed to Ukraine, then part of the Soviet Union. But when the Soviet Union collapsed, he remained in Ukraine, studying at the National Defence University in Kyiv and joining the ranks of the newly independent Ukrainian army. The choice of Syrsky as commander-in-chief is hardly a surprise because few in the Ukrainian military have the experience and know-how to be able to fill the shoes of his popular predecessor, General Valerii Zaluzhny. In 2014, he commanded Ukrainian troops fighting a Moscow-backed insurgency in the eastern Donetsk region and was given the call sign “Snow Leopard”. In 2019, he became head of Ukraine’s land forces and led the country into war when Russia invaded in February 2022. In the early months of the war, he was named a “Hero of Ukraine”, the country’s highest honour, because of his successful defence of Kyiv. In July 2022, Syrsky planned and executed a lightning counteroffensive that pushed Russian troops away from the northern city of Kharkiv and retook swathes of land in the east and southeast. Two months later, Syrsky was credited with orchestrating the counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region, which was the most significant Ukrainian victory in the war and enabled Kyiv to retake the cities of Kupiansk and Izyum from the Russians. He has also led the Bakhmut operation, which was the war’s longest and bloodiest and has been criticised because of the high losses suffered by Ukrainian forces. The tactic to pin Russian forces in the strategically insignificant salt-mining town in eastern Ukraine also exhausted Russian troops and resources, sapping their ability to forge major breakthroughs elsewhere. Some military analysts believe his battlefield tactics reflect his hierarchical Soviet training. His successes on the front lines have earned him the backing of his soldiers, who have been locked in grinding battles for two years. He says his priority is the morale of his soldiers, whom he is regularly pictured visiting at the front. But as triumphs turned to attrition in the war, Syrsky has had to oversee the most difficult phase of the conflict, which will enter its third year this month. Shortages of ammunition and fresh personnel threaten to weaken the Ukrainian lines as Russians eye an advance. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian forces’ main goal this winter has been holding the territory it controls, as much-needed United States military aid is held up in Congress.

Decoding Putin’s ‘obsessive ideas’ in the Tucker Carlson interview,"In a two-hour talk, the pair covered history, politics and war. Ukrainians and Russia watchers say it was simply propaganda.","Russian President Vladimir Putin has told conservative US journalist Tucker Carlson that ending Moscow’s almost two-year-old invasion of Ukraine is “simple”. In his first interview with a Western reporter since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began two years ago, the Kremlin handpicked Carlson, a former Fox News superstar-turned-online commentator. The reason is obvious – Carlson has characterised the Russia-Ukraine war as a “border dispute”, called on Americans to cut off multibillion aid packages to Kyiv, and compared Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to a “rat” and a “pimp”. During the two-hour interview recorded in a Kremlin audience hall with gilded furniture, Carlson did not pressure Putin the way he used to sandbag the pro-Democrat guests on the Fox News show he wasfired from last year. Putin’s goal appears obvious – he wanted Carlson to urge Republicans to stop supporting Ukraine and concentrate on domestic problems. “You have issues on the border, issues with migration, issues with the national debt,” Putin told Carlson, who looked gullible and sheepish for most of their sit-down. “You have nothing better to do, so you should fight in Ukraine? Wouldn’t it be better to negotiate with Russia?” When Carlson asked whether Putin could just call US President Joe Biden to “work it out”, Putin refused – but said the solution was “very simple”. “If you really want to stop fighting, you need to stop supplying weapons. It will be over within a few weeks. That’s it. Then we can agree on some terms,” he said. Carlson did not even try to refute Putin’s outlandish and ungrounded claims. One was Putin’s belief that elected leaders do not run the United States. “So, twice you’ve described US presidents making decisions and then being undercut by their agency heads. So, it sounds like you’re describing a system that’s not run by the people who are elected in your telling,” Carlson said. “That’s right,” Putin said without offering further explanation – and Carlson readily agreed. Then he asked Putin who was behind the 2022explosionin the Baltic Sea that damagedNord Stream, a natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany that was crucial for Moscow’s coffers. Carlson called it “the biggest act of industrial terrorism ever”, but did not dispute Putin’s claim that it was the CIA that had allegedly blown up the pipeline – and presented no concrete evidence whatsoever. Putin began the interview with a lengthy lecture on Eastern Europe’s history, in which he reiterated the Kremlin’s manipulative view onKyivan Rus, a medieval superpower whose disintegration spawned today’s Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. Carlson seemed completely ignorant about the issue – and just kept nodding in bewilderment when Putin told him about a Viking prince named Ruric whose descendants ruled Kyivan Rus. One of them, Prince Vladimir, converted to Orthodox Christianity a millennium ago. According to Putin’s logic, Russia was the only legitimate successor to Kyivan Rus, and the very idea of Ukraine was “invented” by czarist Russia’s archrival – Austria. “Before World War I, Austrian general staff relied on the ideas of Ukrainianisation and started actively promoting the ideas of Ukraine and the Ukrainianisation,” Putin said. To Carlson’s audience and many in the West, the lecture may seem boring and irrelevant. But to Ukrainians, Putin’s interpretation of events is a sobering and threatening reminder that the Kremlin denies Ukraine’s very right to exist. “Because all of these anecdotes about Prince Vladimir and Rurik have to tell all sceptics just one thing – this man has obsessive ideas,” said Maria Kucherenko, from Come Back Alive, a Kyiv-based charity. “And he won’t stop at anything to make them real,” she told Al Jazeera. Ukrainian officials and public figures who have met with Putin face to face have long maintained that the Russian president is determined to subjugate and annihilate Ukraine no matter what. “He is tough and he behaves like he has this almost divine power, over Ukraine in particular,” Yuriy Vitrenko, who headed Naftogaz, Ukraine’s state energy company, at the time, told this reporter in 2021 recalling his encounters with Putin. Putin reiterated his old claims that today’s Ukraine is an “artificial state” created by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin who annexed areas in Poland, Hungary and Romania making them part of Soviet Ukraine. Putin also suggested that Hungary, whose nationalist helmsman Viktor Orban remains the most pro-Russian leader within the European Union, “has the right to take back its lands.” An observer compared Putin’s intention to those of Nazi dicatator Adolf Hitler who triggered World War II by annexing areas in Eastern Europe that were populated by ethnic Germans. “I think that the response to his Hitlerism on the part of North American and European elites will resolutely be harsh and will lead to more military aid to Ukraine,” Nikolay Mitrokhin of Germany’s Bremen University told Al Jazeera. “Here Putin worked for Biden by trying to animate Trump’s audience.” To other Ukrainian observers, the interview offered nothing but tired Kremlin tropes. “The only remarkable thing in this interview is the size of the table – it’s tiny! The rest we have seen and heard a gazillion times,” Svetlana Chunikhina, vice president of the Association of Political Psychologists, a group in Kyiv, told Al Jazeera. “Tucker goddamned Carlson served very well as a microphone stand for the crazy maniac who for two hours rambled about how he loves to kill Ukrainians.” To a Russian observer, the interview is a Kremlin public relations stunt designed to convince average Russians that Putin’s war did not turn their nation into an international pariah spurned by the West. “They want to show that Russia doesn’t confront the civilised world but only separate elites within it. To sort of emphasise that there are other elites, and here’s a well-known journalist interviewing [Putin],” said Sergey Biziyukin, an exiled opposition activist from the western Russian city of Ryazan. “And that once [these elites] win elections, the West will admit that Russia is right,” he told Al Jazeera referring to Donald Trump’s possible victory in the November presidential vote and to the recent success of several nationalist and far-right groups in Europe. The interview’s timing was critical for Ukraine. On Wednesday, Republicans blocked a multibillion aid package that was critical for Kyiv – while Zelenskyy announced his highly divisive decision to fireValerii Zaluzhnyi, the highly trusted and influential top general. However, to Ukrainian servicemen, the interview is nothing but a demonstration of weakness. “They’re two losers trying to support each other, trying to voice their conspiracy theories,” said Valentin, a Ukrainian drone operator stationed in the eastern region of Donetsk who watched parts of the interview on his cellphone. “They can’t face the truth about Ukraine that is real and will prevail,” he told Al Jazeera by phone.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/9/decoding-putins-obsessive-ideas-in-the-tucker-carlson-interview
"‘God of war’: Russian Orthodox Church stands by Putin, but at what cost?","The head of the Russian Orthodox Church is the president’s spiritual leader, but he risks losing global clout.","A masked, uniformed, gun-toting soldier hasthe letter Z, a Kremlin-approved symbol of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, on his shoulder. Jesus Christ, frail and devoid of aggression, is portrayed right behind him. Both are depicted on the billboard that reads “Christ triumphed over hell, and Russia will too”. This image is part of an outdoor art exhibition in central Moscow that urges Russian men to enlist. Moscow Patriarch Kirill, head of the world’s largest Orthodox Christian Church whose clout transcends Russia’s borders to believers in former Soviet republics and diasporas, hasdefended the Kremlin’s “right”to start the war. Russia has “the right to stand on the side of light, on the side of God’s truth”, he said days after the invasion began in February 2022. The white-bearded 78-year-old known for his eloquence and business acumen promised eternal salvation to Russian servicemen fighting in Ukraine against “corrupting” Western values. “[The West’s] goal was to take us with bare hands, without any war, to fool us, to make us part of their world, to inoculate us with their values,” Kirill said last April. The Russian Orthodox Church (ROC), helmed by Kirill since 2009, has tens of thousands of parishes in Russia and elsewhere, from California to Kazakhstan to Ukraine’s Kyiv. Ukraine was the ROC’s second-largest “canonical territory” with some 12,000 church communities – and remains paramount to one of the ideological pillars of Russian statehood. A millennia ago, Orthodox priests from Constantinople baptised Prince Vladimir, whose state,Kyivan Rus, became the progenitor of Ukraine, Belarus and Russia. Once dubbed “the Second Rome”, Constantinople fell to the Turks, and Russian czars proclaimed Moscow “the Third Rome”. The political and canonical loss of Ukraine, the heartland of Kyivan Rus, nullifies the concept. Today’s ROC is the largest of the world’s 16 Orthodox sees that claims 100 million Russians as its flock – although experts say the real figure is much lower. It is also the world’s richest Orthodox Church that gets multimillion state subsidies, and donations from businessmen and believers, and runs hundreds of tax-exempt businesses such as publishing houses, hotels and jewellery stores. Kirill is no stranger to luxury. Once spotted wearing a $30,000 Breguet wristwatch, he travels by a personal jet and a custom-made, bulletproof limousine guarded by Kremlin-paid security. The Kremlin eagerly persecutes any “rival” Christian denominations – making the ROC a moral police of sorts that sanctifies persecution of ideological and political foes. The Kremlinneeds the ROCfor ideological backing, said fugitive opposition activist Sergey Biziyukin, and gives it privileges such as real estate, state funds and “a chance to keep competitors on a short leash”. But Nikolay Mitrokhin, a Russia expert and fellow of Germany’s University of Bremen, told Al Jazeera that the ROC’s participation in the war means it “faces the prospect of losing its ‘universal character’ and clout, and of reducing its borders to those of [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s political empire”. In a detailed report, Mitrokhin concluded that the backing of Putin’s war “directly results in the boost of Kirill’s short-term clout and the defection of most of autonomous churches”. Kirill instructed some 20,000 clerics from the Baltic to the Pacific to deliver a prayer “for peace” – and urged their parishioners to complain about any sermon they considered pro-Ukrainian. Father Andrey Kordochkin fell victim to one such complaint. The Oxford-educated theologian spent two decades serving his parish in the Spanish capital, Madrid. The white-walled, golden-domed Church of St Mary of Magdalene whose construction he oversaw was endorsed by the descendants of the Romanov czars who replaced Kyivan Prince Vladimir’s descendants. But Kordochkin’s flock largely consisted of Ukrainian labour migrants who prayed next to believers from Georgia, Moldova and Bulgaria. Very few of his parishioners took part in an online campaign against him that ended up with a petition to Kirill in November that complained Kordochkin denounced the war and said that the Z symbol stood for “zombies”. The 46-year-old priest left his parish and the ROC’s jurisdiction for the Istanbul-based Constantinople Patriarchate and moved to Germany to resume theological studies. But he is still bitter about the fate of his parish – and Orthodoxy in Russia. Kordochkin thinks that Kirill and Putin transgressed to the veneration of a “god of war” that has little to do with Christianity’s message. “He’s far from harmless, this god demands human sacrifices, and the problem is that he never gets enough,” Kordochkin told Al Jazeera. He was one of almost 300 Russian clerics to sign an antiwar petition in March 2022. Almost all of them have been persecuted, while other antiwar priests are in a precarious position because of large families and no secular jobs to fall back on. “I’d be out in the cold with my whole family without a job and a place to live,” said a dissenting priest, who lives in Russia, but did not sign the petition. He withheld his last name and exact location, fearing for his safety. After the officially atheist USSR collapsed in 1991, tens of millions of Russians embraced their forefathers’ Orthodox faith. “This was the time of a huge upheaval, of great expectation. Many people were spiritually reborn at that time,” Kordochkin recalled. But after Putin came to power in 2000, the resurgent ROC gradually tilted towards his party line and turned a blind eye to unpopular steps such as the elimination of benefits for the elderly, the largest group of believers. Its clericsconsecratednuclear missiles calling them Russia’s “guardian angels”, and blessed the persecution of dissidents. Theycondemnedsame-sex marriages, abortions, sex education and HIV prevention programmes that kept Russia’s aids epidemic at bay. “They’ve devolved into the Orthodox Taliban,” Father Gleb Yakunin, who spent five years in Soviet jails for documenting the persecution of believers, told this reporter in 2012. In 1991, Yakunin led a parliamentary commission that published documents listing future Patriarch Kirill and other hierarchs as KGB informers. The Church defrocked and excommunicated Yakunin, and unknown assailants beat him up several times. Putin “independently interprets spiritual matters while the Church acts as an interpreter”, he said. However, experts say that the subservience and belligerence are already knocking down the ROC’s clout in ex-Soviet republics and among Russian diasporas worldwide. Kirill’s warcry was not approved by the Holy Synod, the ROC’s nominal ruling body that consists of Russian hierarchs and the leaders of autonomous but not independent churches in Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova and Central Asia. Only Belarusian Metropolitan Veniamin said in August 2022 that the West “endorses a modern-day Nazi regime” in Ukraine. The Holy Synod fell short of denouncing Kiriil’s truculence – while other Orthodox sees, including the Constantinople Patriarchate, lambasted it. Back in 2019, its Patriarch Bartholomew, the “first among equals” of Orthodox leaders, approved the establishment of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church independent of Kirill. The “older” Ukrainian Church kept most of its parishes but severed ties with the ROC in May 2022. The Latvian and Lithuanian Churches followed suit. Kirill even fell out with Pope Francis after trying to convince him the war was “justified”. “I spoke with Kirill for 40 minutes on Zoom. For the first 20 minutes, he read from a piece of paper he was holding in his hand all the reasons that justify the Russian invasion,” Pope Francis told an Italian newspaper in March 2022.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/9/far-from-harmless-patriarch-kirill-backs-putins-war-but-at-what-cost

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country “will make every effort to continue prisoner exchanges”, in a Friday post on X.

So far, 3,135 Ukrainian POWs have been freed from Russian captivity, Zelenskyy said on social media on Thursday night. Kyrylo Budanov, head of the intelligence directorate at the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence, urged Ukrainians to disregard scepticism about the time involved in a complicated process. “As you can see, it has taken a bit of time, but the only thing that matters is the result. Look over there and you have the answer to your question,” Budanov said at the undisclosed site of the servicemen’s return. In January, the two countries exchanged 195 POWs each, in the first prisoner swap since the crash of a Russian military transport plane that Moscow said was carrying 65 Ukrainian soldiers. The Il-76 transport plane was downed in Russia’s Belgorod region. Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Ukraine of downing the plane using a US Patriot missile. Ukraine has neither confirmed nor denied that it downed the plane and has demanded proof of who was on board. Both sides have carried out periodic prisoner swaps via intermediaries since the war began nearly two years ago, despite the absence of any peace talks between them since the early months of the conflict. The biggest exchange was on January 3, when they traded a total of 478 captives following mediation by the UAE. Putin warned in an interview that defeating Russia in Ukraine was “impossible by definition”, but insisted he was not seeking to expand the war to neighbouring countries such as Poland and Latvia. He repeated his claim that invading Ukraine was necessary to stop the country from threatening Russia by joining NATO, denied that he had territorial ambitions across Europe, and insisted he would only send troops into neighbouring countries if attacked first.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/9/russia-and-ukraine-exchange-100-prisoners-each-after-uae-mediation
What did Vladimir Putin say to Tucker Carlson? Five key takeaways,"Bill Clinton flip-flopping, releasing detained US journalist and US military aid to Ukraine were all on the agenda.","On Thursday, President Vladimir Putinspent two hoursbeing quizzed by former Fox News host Tucker Carlson in a highly anticipated TV interview. Theinterviewtook place just ahead of the second anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and at a time when United States politicians are pushing to restore military funding to Ukraine. Here are the five key takeaways: Putin revealed that, at some point, former US President Bill Clinton told him that Russia would have an opportunity to be welcomed into the military alliance, NATO. “At a meeting here in the Kremlin with the outgoing President Bill Clinton, right here in the next room, I said to him, I asked him: ‘Bill, do you think if Russia asked to join NATO, do you think it would happen?’ Suddenly he said, ‘You know, it’s interesting. I think so,’” said Putin who was speaking through an interpreter. “But in the evening, when we met for dinner, he said: ‘You know, I’ve talked to my team, no, no, it’s not possible now.’ You can ask him. I think he will watch our interview, he’ll confirm it,” the Russian president said. “I wouldn’t have said anything like that if it hadn’t happened. Okay, well, it’s impossible now,” he added. “Would you have joined NATO?” Carlson asked. “Look, I asked the question, is it possible, or not, and the answer I got was no,” Putin said. “But if he had said yes, would you have joined NATO?” Carlson said. “If he had said yes, the process of rapprochement would have commenced, and eventually it might have happened if we had seen some sincere wish on the other side of our partners. But it didn’t happen. Well, no means no. Okay, fine,” Putin said. Putin also highlighted that they were promised that NATO would not expand to the East. “Not an inch to the East … and then what? They said, ‘Well, it’s not enshrined on paper, so we’ll expand.'” “There were five waves of expansion. We tolerated all that. We were trying to persuade them. We were saying, ‘Please don’t. We are as bourgeois now as you are. We are a market economy, and there is no Communist Party power. Let’s negotiate’,” Putin added. Putin said that it might be possible to free Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who is awaiting trial on spying charges, in exchange for a Russian prisoner. The Russian president suggested that, in return, Moscow wanted Germany to free Vadim Krasikov, who was convicted of the 2019 murder of a Chechen dissident in Berlin. Gershkovichwas arrestedon March 29, 2023 in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg and accused of trying to obtain defence secrets. He and his newspaper strongly reject the charges and the US government has designated him as wrongfully detained. “We are willing to solve it but there are certain terms being discussed via special services channels. I believe an agreement can be reached,” said Putin, stressing that Western powers will have to take what he called “reciprocal steps”. “There have been many successful examples of these talks crowned with success. Probably this is going to be crowned with success as well but we have to come to an agreement,” said Putin. Russia and the US have agreed high-profile prisoner swaps in the past – most recently in December 2022 when Moscow traded Brittney Griner, a US basketball star convicted of a drugs offence in Russia, for Russian arms trafficker Viktor Bout. Carlson asked Putin: “Can you imagine a scenario where Russia is ready to send troops to Poland?” “Only in one case if Poland attacks Russia, why? Because we have no interest in Poland, Latvia or anywhere else,” Putin said. US politicians have said we “have to continue to fund the Ukrainian effort, or US soldier citizens could wind up fighting there. How do you assess that?” Carlson asked. That argument is based on the fact that Poland and the Baltic states are NATO members, and the alliance’s principle of collective security would kick in if any if them were attacked, necessitating US forces to intervene directly. “This is a provocation. I do not understand why American soldiers should fight in Ukraine,” Putin said. “Well, if somebody has the desire to send regular troops, that would certainly bring humanity to the brink of a very serious global conflict. This is obvious,” Putin added. “Do the United States need this? What for? Thousands of miles away from your national territory. Don’t you have anything better to do? You’ve issues on the border, issues with migration, issues with the national debt… you have nothing better to do, so you should fight in Ukraine? “Wouldn’t it be better to negotiate with Russia? Make an agreement. Already understanding the situation that is developing today, realising that Russia will fight for its interests to the end.” Putin also said a solution would be possible if the US stopped supplying weapons. “If you really want to stop fighting, you need to stop supplying weapons. It will be over within a few weeks, that’s it, and then we can agree on some terms. Before you do that, stop,” Putin said. Putin also blamed the CIA for the explosions of theNord Stream pipelines, cutting off a major route for Russian gas exports to Europe and fuelling geopolitical tensions. “Who blew up Nord Stream?” Carlson asked. Putin replied: “You, for sure.” Carlson jokingly responded, “I was busy that day”. Putin said, “You personally might have an alibi, but the CIA has not such alibi”. “Do you have evidence that NATO or the CIA did it,” Carlson said. The Russian president responded he “won’t get into details” but you should “look for someone who is interested” and who “has capabilities”. Many people might be interested but not all “of them are capable of sinking to the bottom of the Baltic Sea and carrying out this explosion”, Putin said. Putin said the world is changing faster than “during the collapse of the Roman Empire”. He also said: “Mankind is currently facing many threats due to the genetic researchers – it is now possible to create this superhuman. A specialised human being. A genetically engineered athlete, scientist, military man. There are reports that Elon Musk has already had the chip implanted in the human brain in the US.” “What do you think of that?” Carlson asked “I think there’s no stopping Elon Musk. He will do as he sees fit,” Putin said. “Nevertheless, you need to find some common ground with him, search for ways to persuade him,” Putin explained. He said that humanity needed to think about what to do about the advances in genetics and artificial intelligence and suggested the nuclear arms control treaties of the Cold War could be a guide. “When there arises an understanding that the boundless and uncontrolled development of artificial intelligence or genetics or some other modern trends, cannot be stopped, that these researches will still exist just as it was impossible to hide gunpowder from humanity… when humanity feels a threat to itself, to humanity as a whole, then, it seems to me, there will come a period to negotiate at the interstate level on how we will regulate this,” Putin added.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/9/five-key-moments-from-tucker-carlsons-interview-with-vladimir-putin

Russia’s Putin and China’s Xi denounce US ‘interference’,"Kremlin said the two spoke about creating a ‘multipolar, fairer world order’ in face of US-led efforts to contain their countries.","Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping have rejected what they call US interference in the affairs of other countries, the Kremlin has said. During an hour-long phone call on Thursday, Xi and Putin denounced the “US policy of interfering in the internal affairs of other states”, Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov told journalists. The two leaders spoke about creating a “multipolar, fairer world order” in the face of US-led efforts to contain both of Washington’s biggest adversaries, he said. “The leaders of the two countries realise that the US is practically implementing a policy of double containment, [toward] both Russia and China,” he added. The West has viewed Moscow and Beijing, both of whom are seeking to expand their global influence, with increased anxiety over the past two years as theyramp up tiesin trade and defence. Moscow has looked to Beijing as a crucial economic lifeline since the West hit Russia with unprecedented sanctions over its military assault on Ukraine. China has, meanwhile, benefitted from cheap Russian energy imports and access to vast natural resources, including steady gas shipments via the Power of Siberia pipeline. Trade between the two countries has surged in the last two years, hitting $218.2bn during January-November, according to Chinese customs data, achieving a goal set by the two countries in 2019 a year ahead of schedule.    Moscow and Beijing have also increasingly carried out trade in roubles and yuan as they move to phase out trade in US dollars. Putin and Xi stressed on their call that it was important to build a “financial infrastructure that ensures reliability of payments”, Ushakov said. Putin and Xi also discussed the situation in Ukraine and conflict resolution in theMiddle Eastand see eye to eye on those conflicts, Ushakov said, without elaborating. Beijing and Moscow declared a “no limits” partnership days before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and the two have expanded ties even as most Western countries turned their back on Moscow. China has itself been criticised, notably by the US, over a number of thorny issues, including its behaviour towards self-ruled democratic Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its territory. “In discussing the situation in the Asia-Pacific region, the Russian President reaffirmed his principled position on the Taiwan issue, which is to support the ‘one China’ policy,” the Kremlin said in its statement about the call. Xi told Putin the two “should closely collaborate strategically, defend the sovereignty, security and development interests of their respective countries”, according to a readout from Chinese state broadcaster CCTV. Xi also emphasised that both sides should “resolutely oppose interference in internal affairs by external forces”, CCTV said. Putin and Ximettwice last year. Ushakov said the two leaders would continue to have “close personal interaction” but there were no plans for reciprocal visits right now.

Ukraine’s Zelenskyy names new army chief after dismissing Zaluzhny,"President Zelenskyy thanks General Valerii Zaluzhny for his service, says he should remain ‘on his team’.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has appointed Oleksandr Syrsky, who has led Ukraine’s ground forces since 2019, as the new head of Ukraine’s armed forces, after he dismissed General Valerii Zaluzhny. In a post on X, Zelenskyy on Thursday thanked Zaluzhny for his two years of service, and said that the time had come for changes in the military leadership. Zelenskyy said Zaluzhny should remain “on his team”. I met with General Valerii Zaluzhnyi.I thanked him for the two years of defending Ukraine.We discussed the renewal that the Armed Forces of Ukraine require.We also discussed who could be part of the renewed leadership of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.The time for such a renewal…pic.twitter.com/tMnUEZ3BCX — Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa)February 8, 2024  Zaluzhny conceded that the country’s military strategy “must change” almost two years into Russia’s invasion. “The tasks of 2022 are different from those of 2024. Therefore, everyone must change and adapt to the new realities as well in order to win together,” he said after his long-rumoured dismissal was announced. The move amounts to the most serious shakeup of the top military brass since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in Febraury 2022. “The war does not remain the same. War changes and demands change. New approaches and new strategies are needed. Today, a decision was made on the need to change the leadership of the Armed Forces of Ukraine,” Ukraine’s Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said. Zelenskyy said the new armed forces leadership team will be taking over on Thursday. He called on the country’s new military leadership to devise a strategy for this year to beat back Russian forces. “A realistic, detailed action plan for the Armed Forces of Ukraine for 2024 should be on the table, taking into account the real situation on the battlefield now and the prospects,” Zelenskyy said. Last year, he said, Ukraine managed to “regain control” of the sky, but said failed to reach objectives “on the ground”. Zelenskyy said the country needs “working rotation systems”, and a new approach to mobilisation and recruitment. Al Jazeera’s Rob McBride, reporting from Kyiv, said there has been “deepening speculation” for a number of weeks about disagreements between Zelenskyy and his top soldiers, “especially over the conduct of the war”. “Zaluzhny is not an easy man to remove. He’s widely seen here as a military hero and also as a potential political rival for Zelenskyy here in the future,” McBride said. Zaluzhny was credited with thwarting the full-scale Russian invasion two years ago, but is also being blamed for “recent military setbacks”, he said. “It’s being presented as an amicable separation, but I think everybody accepts that this is Zaluzhny’s dismissal,” McBride said. Ukraine’s struggles with ammunition and personnel come on the heels of a failed counteroffensive last summer and as European allies try to bump up their military production. At the same time, a political standoff in the United States is holding up further aid from Ukraine’s main supplier. Zelenskyy’s announcement comes as the Kremlin’s forces push harder to take the eastern Ukraine city of Avdiivka, throwing more troops into the four-month battle and bombarding Ukrainian defences, as they stretch Kyiv’s resources. Some analysts warned that Zaluzhny’s exit could bring unwelcome disruption, potentially driving a wedge between the Ukrainian army and politicians, and fuelling uncertainty among Kyiv’s Western allies. There has been little change in positions along the 1,500km (930-mile) front line over the winter, though the Kremlin’s forces have kept up their attacks at certain points. Faced with a shortfall in anticipated supplies of Western weaponry, Ukraine has been digging defences, while Moscow has put its economy on a war footing to give its military more muscle. Retired Australian General Mick Ryan, a fellow of the Center for Strategic and International Studies think-tank in Washington, DC, described Zaluzhny as “a charismatic and popular military leader” who would be hard to replace.    His replacement will have to build personal relationships with US and NATO military chiefs, while the perception of government instability “is a real danger area for” Zelenskyy, Ryan wrote recently in an article posted online. Earlier Thursday, Ukrainian forces claimed to have shot down a Russian attack helicopter in eastern Ukraine near Avdiivka, where soldiers are fighting from street to street. Avdiivka has become “a primary focus” of Moscow’s forces, the UK Defence Ministry said in an assessment Thursday. The General Staff of Ukraine’s armed forces reported Thursday that its troops had fended off 40 enemy assaults around Avdiivka over the previous 24 hours. That is roughly double the number of daily Russian assaults at other points along the front line. Ukraine has built multiple defenses in Avdiivka, complete with concrete fortifications and a network of tunnels. Despite massive losses of personnel and equipment, Russian troops have slowly advanced since October.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/8/ukraines-zelenskyy-names-new-army-chief-after-dismissing-zaluzhnyi
UN committee urges Russia to end ‘forcible transfer’ of Ukrainian children,"Kyiv claims 20,000 children have been taken from Ukraine to Russia without families’ or guardians’ consent.","The United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child has urged Russia to end the forcible transfer of children from occupied areas of Ukraine and return them to their families. Last month, a panel of 18 independent experts pressed Russia on deportation allegations while reviewing its record. Their conclusions, published on Thursday, called on Russia to “put an end to the forcible transfer or deportation of children from occupied Ukrainian territory”. Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, has argued that “placements for evacuated children are arranged, first and foremost, at their request and with their consent”. Yet Kyiv has alleged that 20,000 children have been taken from Ukraine to Russia without the consent of their families or guardians, and theInternational Criminal Court(ICC) is seeking the arrest of Russian President Vladimir Putin for alleged illegal deportation of children, an accusation the Kremlin denies. Russia’s commissioner for children’s rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, is also accused of abducting children from Ukraine and has been issued an arrest warrant by the ICC. The UN committee demanded that Moscow investigate war crimes allegations against Lvova-Belova but did not mention Putin. The committee also asked Moscow to provide information about how many children were taken from Ukraine and where they are living, so “parents or legal representatives can track them, including through identification of such children and registration of their parentage, and ensure that children are returned to their families and communities as soon as possible”. They expressed concern at the impact that Russia’s war in Ukraine is having on children, outlining the “killings and injuries of hundreds of children as a result of indiscriminate attacks … with explosive weapons”. However, Russia has argued that it has only been protecting vulnerable children from a warzone. In January’s hearing in Geneva, the head of the Russian delegation, Alexey Vovchenko, the labour and social protection deputy minister, denied that any Ukrainians were forcibly removed from their country. He said 4.8 million residents of Ukraine, including 770,000 children, had been taken in by Russia. But UN committee chairperson Ann Skelton said the committee members and the Russian delegation had been “talking past one another” at the meeting. “We found often in the dialogue that we were using one type of terminology and they were using another,” she said. “We were using the word ‘adoption’, and they were denying that it’s adoption and talking about ‘fostering children’.” Last year, the UN added Russia to a list of countries that violate children’s rights in conflicts, referencing boys and girls who were killed during attacks on schools and hospitals in Ukraine.

Putin’s antiwar rival blocked from contesting Russia presidential election,"Boris Nadezhdin, who has won support for his criticism of the Ukraine war, vows to challenge poll commission’s decision.","Russia’s presidential hopefulBoris Nadezhdinhas said his bid to run in elections in March has been blocked, and that he will challenge the decision of the election commission in the country’s highest court. Nadezhdin, a prominent critic of thewar in Ukraine, is intent on unseating incumbent Vladimir Putin. But his bid was stymied by the Central Election Commission (CEC), which refused to register him as a candidate, he said on Thursday on Telegram, adding that he would launch an appeal in the country’s Supreme Court. Running on the ticket of the small centre-right Civic Initiative party, Nadezhdin last month submitted the 100,000 signatures required to register as a candidate for the election to be held on March 15-17. However, the CEC had informed Nadezhdin on Monday that it had foundflawsin 15 percent of signatures he had collected in support of his candidacy, and that some of the purported signatures were those of dead people. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that the decision by election officials was in line with the rules. “I collected more than 200,000 signatures across Russia. We conducted the collection openly and honestly – the queues at our headquarters and collection points were watched by the whole world,” Nadezhdin said. “Taking part in the presidential election in 2024 is the most important political decision of my life. I am not giving up on my intentions.”    ‘Fatal mistake’ Nadezhdin, a 60-year-old municipal councillor who is known for his criticism of Putin, had caught the attention of Russia’s small opposition forces with promises to end the war in Ukraine. Born in Soviet-ruled Uzbekistan to a Jewish mother who was a music teacher and a physicist father – he has spent the last 30 years in Russian politics, working as a councillor in the town of Dolgoprudny outside Moscow. He says Putin, 71, made a “fatal mistake” by launching the invasion and has pledged to end it via negotiation. It was already thought that authorities would not welcome a candidate who would introduce antiwar rhetoric in the race. Putin is almost certain to win re-election to extend his 24-year leadership of Russia, including eight years as prime minister, for at least another six years. He has not allowed real electoral opposition during his rule, with rivals such as opposition leaderAlexey Navalnybehind bars. Putin will be running as an independent, rather than as the candidate of the governing United Russia party, meaning he needs 300,000 signatures to support his candidacy. He has already collected more than 3.5 million, according to his supporters.   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/8/putins-anti-war-rival-blocked-from-contesting-russia-presidential-election
"Russia-Ukraine war: List of key events, day 715","As the war enters its 715th day, these are the main developments.","Here is the situation on Thursday, February 8, 2024.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/8/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-715
Ukraine’s Zaluzhny touts drones as path to victory; Russia suffers strikes,"In the past week of war, Ukraine strikes a missile corvette, an airfield and an oil refinery with missiles and drones.","Ukraine’s commander-in-chief has outlined a plan to massively scale up the use of unmanned systems to overcome Russia’s advantages in manpower and materiel and break the deadlock in this war. The effectiveness of such systems was proved again last week as they sank a Russian missile corvette, grounded three planes and set an oil refinery on fire. Russia, too, continued to attack Ukraine with drones and missiles, but it failed to capture new territory despite its superior resources and constant assaults on the eastern city of Avdiivka and Ukraine’s stronghold at Krynky on the left bank of the Dnipro River in the Kherson region. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s Western allies made progress on securing funding for the war. The European Unionfinally approveda 50-billion-euro ($63bn) aid package for Ukraine, and the United States Senate unveiled a $118bn bill that includes $60bn for Ukraine. “Unmanned systems … are almost the only tool for withdrawing from military operations of a positional form,” Ukrainian commander-in-chiefValerii Zaluzhnywrote in a doctrinal paper on Thursday, because traditional heavy armour and manpower are “increasingly a dream” for Ukraine’s armed forces. He called for a “completely new state system of technological rearmament” that could “take up to five months”. Zaluzhny’s new military doctrine dovetailed with the government’s pledge late last year to build 1 million first-person viewer drones and 11,000 medium- and long-range drones this year. Ukraine has used such systems with devastating effect.  On January 31, Ukraine struck the Belbek airfield in western Crimea. Russia’s Ministry of Defence said it intercepted 20 air-launched missiles, but Russians in Crimea filmed some of the missiles flying undisturbed directly over dormant air defence systems. The following day, Ukraine struck Belbek again, this time damaging or destroying three Russian fighter planes on the ground, according to southern forces spokesperson Natalia Humenyuk. One Russian military reporter described it as a complex, two-day operation targeting three airfields and involving decoy missiles, HARM radar-seeking missiles, Storm Shadow attack missiles and surface drones. Those surface drones sank a Russian warship near Lake Donuzlav off western Crimea. Footage released by Ukraine’s armed forces showed them repeatedly striking the Ivanovets, a 480-tonne missile corvette, crippling it and then destroying it in a pair of massive explosions. It was reportedly one of only three still operating in Russia’s Black Sea Fleet. Ukrainian military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said his service’s drone unit Group 13 sank the Ivanovets using Magura V5 surface drones. “There were six direct hits to the hull. … The ship overturned on its stern and sank,” he said. Two days later, Ukraine’s Security Service struck the Rosneft refinery in Volgograd, one of the largest in Russia, apparently using two aerial drones. Footage showed at least four burning oil tanks destroyed. Budanov said he believes the number of attacks would increase. “Hypothetically, there is a plan by which all this happens. I believe that this plan includes all the main objects of critical infrastructure and objects of military infrastructure of the Russian Federation,” Budanov said. Ukrainian air force spokesman Yuri Ignat suggested attacks on Crimea would continue to target airfields. “Russia uses not only Belbek. About five airfields are actively used for attacks on Ukraine. These are planes of various modifications: MiG-31, … MiG-29, Su-27 and helicopters,” he said.  Ukraine has pursued other forms of asymmetric warfare. Its military intelligence said a Russian Tu-95 bomber, who had reportedly taken part in raids on Ukraine, was shot dead in Russia. Ukrainian hackers from the Prana Network broke into a Russian Defence Ministry server, stealing documents that revealed Russia had agreed to pay Iran $1.75bn for 6,000 Shahed drones. Russia kept those drones flying into Ukraine throughout the week, accompanied by missiles. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Dnipropetrovsk was one of Russia’s main targets for those attacks. “The danger is constant, high. Russia considers the region as one of the main targets for terrorist attacks. It is our enterprises, our economic potential, this region,” he said. Dnipropetrovsk lies at the heart of Ukraine’s territories on the left bank of the Dnipro River and sits among the contested regions of Kharkiv, Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia and Kherson. As if to vindicate Zaluzhny’s turn from conventional battlefield weapons, EU leaders confirmed they would not be able to provide Ukraine with 1 million artillery shells by March as promised. European foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said 330,000 had been delivered and the number would reach about 524,000 by March. “By the end of the year, the planned deliveries will reach more than 1 million because the figure in the pipeline amounts to 630,000,” Borrell said. Some estimates have put Russian artillery shell production capacity at 6 million to 7 million a year. North Korea has reportedly delivered an additional 1 million more shells. There was some good news for Ukraine on the financial front. European leaders overcame objections from Hungary to approve 50 billion euros ($54bn) in financial aid for Ukraine over the next four years. The first 4.5 billion euros ($4.85bn) was to arrive in Ukraine in March as part of a total of 18 billion euros ($19bn) for Kyiv this year. That left the EU with 20 billion euros ($21.5bn) in military aid still to approve. US senators on Sunday released a $118bn national security bill for discussion that included $60bn for Ukraine this year. US President Joe Biden, a Democrat, requested the sum late last year, but congressional Republicans had tied any Ukraine aid to increased security on the border with Mexico.  Months of bipartisan negotiations produced sweeping reforms to asylum procedures, presidential parole to migrants and funding for border security. “Now all indications are this bill won’t even move forward to the Senate floor,” said Biden on Tuesday, blaming Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump. “He’s done nothing, I’m told, than reach out to Republicans in the House and Senate and threaten and intimidate them to vote against this proposal. And it looks like they’re caving, but they owe it to the American people to show some spine,” Biden said in a White House briefing. Despite leading Ukraine’s armed forces to some spectacular successes, there was speculation that Zaluzhny was due to be replaced after Zelenskyy hinted at major changes in an interview that aired on Sunday night. “A reset, a new beginning is necessary,” Zelenskyy told Italy’s state television Rai News. “If we want to win, we must all push in the same direction, convinced of victory. We cannot be discouraged, let our arms fall. … That’s why I’m talking about restarting, replacement. I have something serious in mind, which is not about a single person but about the direction of the country’s leadership,” Zelenskyy said.

Ukraine lawmakers pass first reading of mobilisation bill,The legislation would tighten draft conditions as Kyiv struggles to replenish its ranks as Russian war grinds on.,"Ukrainian lawmakers have passed the first reading of a revised mobilisation bill after difficulties in pushing through legislation aimed at increasing its military ranks. The parliament tentatively backed the revised draft of the bill on Wednesday. The legislation would lower the age of military service and make it harder to avoid the draft as Kyiv struggles to find enough soldiers to maintain its defences againstRussia’s invasion. In its current form, the legislation would lower the age at which people can be mobilised for combat duty by two years to 25. It would also require potential military personnel who are abroad to have up-to-date military registrations. Obtaining such a document would be a prerequisite to receiving consular services. Tighter sanctions for draft evasion, including an asset freeze, are also included. While the bill would also allow soldiers who have served continuously for 36 months during the war to be discharged, this would not be automatic. As the war with Russia has dragged on, Kyiv has found it increasingly difficult to find new soldiers to relieve its troops on the front lines. That has helped stoketensionbetween President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who warned in December that the military wanted to mobilise up to half a million people, and military chiefs. Lawmakers in the Verkhovna Rada last month refused to debate the mobilisation bill as fierce criticism from a war-weary public encouraged a wary approach. Although MPs gave the bill its first green light on Wednesday, it is clear that changes will be made before it is passed. The Ministry of Defence said it would closely cooperate with the appropriate parliamentary committee to ensure necessary amendments are made by the second reading. “This is not a final decision,” lawmaker Oleksiy Goncharenko said on Telegram. “There will be a second reading, amendments will be made to it.” Enacting the legislation is, therefore, still expected to take weeks. Kyiv has kept its military losses secret, but the latest US estimates published in August put the death toll at nearly 70,000 and the number of wounded at up to 120,000.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/7/ukraine-aims-to-bolster-troops-with-new-law
‘It’s healthy to be on war alert’: Sweden’s conscription push gathers pace,"As it prepares to join NATO with the Ukraine war yet raging, Sweden’s long-held neutrality will soon become a principle of the past.","Gotland, Sweden –Conscript Linus pokes his head out of the commander’s hatch, eases himself through the opening, and lifts himself atop the tank. Most of his days in the Swedish army are not so exciting, “but today, when we are shooting, it’s fun”, he says, holding an automatic rifle in his arms. At 18, he is part of a new generation of conscripts that is hoped to boost the armed forces andremilitarise Sweden. He is doing his service on Gotland, an island controlling the passage through the Baltic Sea, 275km (170 miles) from the Russian port of Kaliningrad. Gotland represents the challenges facing Sweden as a whole. The regiment here was disbanded militarily in 2005, when Russia was no longer seen as a threat. Now rearmament is taking place at pace, and the number of conscripts is tripling. “This is a very special time in Swedish history, both for the nation and the armed forces, coming from neutrality and non-alliance, and then shifting towards collective defence within NATO. It’s a big step,” said Colonel Dan Rasmussen, commander of the Gotland Regiment. He cast the situation as a societal awakening that began with Russia’s invasions of Georgia in 2008, Crimea in 2014, and finally the 2022 full-scale attack on Ukraine. “We needed that final push to realise that it isn’t getting better, and now we are preparing for the worst.” Cold War-era military service was dropped in 2010 as the country drastically reduced its armed forces. Its reintroduction in 2018 was accelerated by the war in Ukraine and Sweden’s NATO application. Conscription is up 30 percent this year, and the armed forces’ budget is up by 28 percent – giving them another $2.5bn. In early 2023, Bloomberg reported that Sweden plans todouble the number of conscripts to 10,000 by 2030. Earlier this year, Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said at the National Conference of Defence that Sweden “can’t sit around investigating things year after year. Now it’s important to get things done”. Former NATO director of policy planning, Fabrice Pothier, agrees, saying Sweden went “too far in neglecting Gotland”. “It is healthy to be on war alert and war readiness footing rather than in denial.” He said Sweden’s neutrality in recent times has endangered the country. However, a warning by Commander-in-Chief Michael Byden last month, that “all Swedes should mentally prepare for war”, stirred fears, especially among young people. “Many young people and parents are calling us, worried that their kids will be sent to do conscription. ‘Will our kids have to fight for NATO? Are we in war?’ That’s the kind of questions they have,” said Kerstin Bergea, president of the Swedish Peace and Arbitration Society. “Even our own armed forces say the risk of a military attack on Sweden is low. So to have such a huge build-up isn’t the right way to go. It doesn’t make Sweden or the world safer.” Behind conscript Linus another tank starts moving, muddying the ground on its way to the shooting field. Linus explains he wanted to follow in his father’s footsteps and be conscripted, but not all who are called up do it by choice. About 10 percent are there against their will. More than 100,000 teenagers born in 2006 are being sent their muster papers this year. Caspar Sperling is one of them, now waiting to see if he will be called. Petting the family’s cat, he shows the forms he had to fill out on his laptop. “It feels a bit scary that I might have to be away for nine months and not have a choice, risking going to jail if I don’t obey,” he said. “[But] it feels important to do this, to contribute during the situation that we have now,” he says, continuing: “The fact that Russia has started a war again is scary.” With Turkey having ratified Sweden’s application to NATO, the Nordic country is now waiting for only Hungary to do the same before it can become a full member of the alliance. Not everyone is happy with this new reality. “Sweden will leave 200 years of peace and enter a nuclear weapon alliance, NATO,” said Bergea. Back on Gotland, tank driver Julia, another conscript, stops to load up on more ammunition. “With the worldwide situation of today, I think it’s important,” she said. She left home to live on Gotland for a year. The island is usually known for long beaches and sunny days, but on this frigid February day, the harsh wind blows in from the sea as tanks fire live ammunition across the fields. Few truly believe these weapons will be needed for real. But Sweden is not taking any chances. In any case, these could be the last days of the country deciding its military direction – before NATO takes the reins.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/7/its-healthy-to-be-on-war-alert-swedens-conscription-push-gathers-pace

According to Mayor Vitalii Klitschko, 13 people were injured in Kyiv, including a pregnant woman. Apartment buildings caught fire in multiple Kyiv districts, he said. Oleksandr Senkevich, the mayor of Mykolaiv, said the attack had stripped roofs of 20 houses and damaged gas and water pipes in the port city, killing one man. In Kharkiv, in northeastern Ukraine, a 52-year-old woman was slightly injured in an S-300 missile attack, according to the regional governor, Oleh Syniehubov. Missiles hit as far away as the Lviv region of western Ukraine, where a fire broke out, officials said. The attacks in Kyiv sent Josep Borrell, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, into an air raid shelter in his hotel, the AFP news agency reported. Borrell is visiting to underline the bloc’s “unwavering support” to Ukraine as the war nears its third year. All 27 EU countries agreed on an additional50-billion-euro($54bn) aid package for Ukraine last week. Western help is desperately needed by Ukraine, which is struggling with ammunition and personnel shortages. Though the roughly 1,500km (900-mile) front line has barely budged in recent months, Russian forces have the upper hand in stocks of missiles and artillery ammunition used for long-range strikes. The latest barrage follows a pattern of attacks targeting civilians and critical infrastructure. Vadym Filashkin, the governor of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, said Russia was firing between 1,500 and 2,500 shells and missiles at the area every day. He said Russia had dropped 200 guided aerial bombs on the front-line town of Avdiivka over the past month and was “totally destroying it”. The town’s population has dropped from 32,000 before the war to fewer than 1,000, according to local officials.

US House rejects Israel-only bill; Ukraine-Israel-border bill shaky,Republicans harden positions as probable presidential candidate Donald Trump increases pressure.,"The United States House of Representatives has rejected a Republican-led bill to provide $17.6bn in assistance to Israel as a wider bipartisan bill that would also help Ukraine and ensure more money for border security looked to be in trouble as well. The Tuesday vote on the Israel bill, which needed a two-thirds majority to advance, was largely along party lines. Aid for Israel – one of the largest recipients of US foreign aid – has traditionally received strong bipartisan support. However, the bill’s opponents said it was a Republican ploy to distract from their opposition to the$118bn Senate billcombining an overhaul of US immigration policy and new funding for border security – measures Republicans had demanded – with billions of dollars in emergency aid for Ukraine, Israel and partners in the Asia Pacific. House Democratic leaders called the Israel bill a “nakedly obvious and cynical attempt” to undermine the larger package, hammered out at the weekend after months of negotiations by a bipartisan group of senators. Support for that bill has dwindled among Republicans with former President Donald Trump – who is likely to be the Republican candidate for November’s presidential election – pressuring them to avoid handing President Joe Biden, his probable Democrat rival, a legislative victory ahead of the poll. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said the Senate bill was “dead on arrival” in the chamber even before it was introduced. Senate Republican leaders said on Tuesday they did not think the measure would receive enough votes to pass. “It looks to me and to most of our members that we have no real chance here to make a law,” Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters. Biden, who supports the Senate bill, had promised to veto the House’s Israel-only measure if it were passed. On Tuesday, he urged lawmakers to back the wider bill, saying the clock was “ticking” for Ukraine two years since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered afull-scale invasionof his country’s neighbour. He called on them to “show some spine” and stand up to Trump. Out of funds, the Pentagon is sending no more arms shipments to Kyiv even as Ukraine is struggling with ammunition and personnel shortages as Russia mounts relentless attacks. “Every week, every month that passes without new aid to Ukraine means fewer artillery shells, fewer air defence systems, fewer tools for Ukraine to defend itself against this Russian onslaught,” Biden said. “We can’t walk away now. That’s what Putin’s betting on,” Biden said. “Supporting this bill is standing up to Putin. Opposing this bill is playing into his hands.” The immigration portion of the legislation, Biden added, included the “toughest set of reforms to secure the border ever”. The Israel bill’s supporters insisted it was not a political stunt, saying it was important to move quickly to support the country, which launched anoffensive on Gazaafter members of the Hamas armed group launched an unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people and taking dozens captive. At least 27,585 Palestinians have been killed in theIsraeli onslaught, with thousands more injured. “This bill simply provides necessary resources to our closest ally in the region and our own military,” said Republican Ken Calvert, who introduced the measure. Some Democrats also condemned the House bill for failing to provide humanitarian assistance for Palestinian civilians. Members of Congress have been struggling for months to reach an agreement on sending security assistance overseas, particularly to Ukraine. Biden has twice sent Congress requests for emergency spending bills, most recently in October. The Republican-majority House passed an Israel-only bill in November but it was never taken up in the Democratic-led Senate. Negotiators had worked on Biden’s request for a broader emergency security package and Republican demands that any security assistance be combined with changes in immigration policy and security at the border with Mexico. The failed Israel House vote was the second in quick succession for Johnson’s Republican majority on Tuesday. It came immediately after the chamber voted against impeaching Biden’s top border official, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/7/us-republican-led-israel-only-bill-fails-ukraine-israel-border-bill-shaky

Russian court orders arrest of novelist Boris Akunin,The 67-year-old was charged in December with ‘justifying terrorism’ after expressing support for Ukraine in a prank call made to him.,"A Moscow court has ordered the arrest in absentia of best-selling detective writerBoris Akuninas part of an ongoing crackdown on critics of itswar in Ukraine. Moscow’s Basmanny District Court ordered the arrest of Akunin, the pen name of Grigory Chkhartishvili, on Tuesday. The 67-year-old was charged in December with “justifying terrorism” after expressing support for Ukraine in a prank call staged by pro-Kremlin activists. Akunin, who currently resides in London, is to be detained and taken into custody if he sets foot in Russia. The pranksters, known as Vovan and Lexus, posed as Ukrainian officials in their call last December, one of them pretending to be Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. A criminal case was opened against Akunin for “discrediting the army” — specifically for “justifying terrorism” and spreading “fake news” about the Russian military. Moscow made disparagement of its military illegal weeks after launching its full-scale assault on Ukraine in February 2022, and has detained thousands of people for criticising the war. Many prominent cultural figures have since fled the country. Akunin, best known for his historical detective novels, is one of Russia’s most widely read contemporary authors. A long-standing critic of the Kremlin, he denounced Moscow’s assault on Ukraine as “absurd” shortly after the offensive began in February 2022. Prior to this, he had already been labelled a “foreign agent” by Moscow. One of Russia’s leading publishers, AST, responded by announcing it was suspending the printing and sale of Akunin’s books. In an online statement, Akunin described his publisher’s move as “an important milestone”, saying that Russian writers had not been accused of terrorism since Soviet leader Josef Stalin’s purges.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/6/russian-court-orders-arrest-of-novelist-boris-akunin

Hungary’s ruling party boycotts parliament session on Sweden’s NATO bid,Hungary is the only NATO member yet to approve Sweden’s accession to the military alliance.,"Lawmakers from Hungary’s ruling party have boycotted an emergency parliament session in which a vote on Sweden’s bid to join NATO was on the agenda. At Monday’s session, which was supported by six opposition parties, Fidesz lawmakers didn’t attend, scuttling the attempt to place a vote on the National Assembly’s schedule. Turkey’s parliamentvotedto approve Sweden’s accession in January, making Hungary the last of the world’s largest military alliance’s 31 members not to do so. Sweden had pursued a policy of military non-alignment since the Cold War. However,Russia’s full-scale invasionof its neighbour Ukraine in 2022 caused upheaval in geopolitical calculations, and Stockholm applied to become a NATO member that same year. Hungary has maintained close ties with Russia since its invasion of Ukraine, and while it has said it supports the Swedish bid in principle, Budapest has been dragging its feet for months. Prime Minister Viktor Orban told NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg last month that he would urge his Fidesz party to ratify the bid “at the first possible opportunity”. On Friday, the United States embassy reminded Orban in a statement that he promised to act “at the first opportunity” and “Monday’s session provides him with one”. Several ambassadors from NATO member countries attended Monday’s proceedings, including US Ambassador David Pressman. In brief comments to the media after the session, Pressman said the US looks forward to “watching this closely and to Hungary acting expeditiously”. “Sweden’s NATO accession is an issue that directly affects the United States’s national security and affects the security of our alliance as a whole,” he said, reminding Orban of his pledge. Orban is delaying the vote due to his “personal vanity”, Agnes Vadai from the biggest opposition party told the Agence France-Presse news agency. She accused the prime minister of seeking to “make headlines in the international press while making a gesture to Russian President Vladimir Putin by undermining the unity of NATO and the EU”. In a separate statement, US senator Ben Cardin, a Maryland Democrat and chairperson of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, raised the prospect of imposing sanctions on Hungary for its conduct and called Orban “the least reliable member of NATO”. Hungarian officials have indicated that Fidesz lawmakers won’t support holding a vote on Sweden’s NATO bid until Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson accepts an invitation by Orban to visit Budapest to negotiate the matter. Kristerssonsaid he will make the trip but only after Hungary approves his country’s NATO membership. Fidesz said in a statement on Monday that ratification of Sweden’s NATO accession can take place during a regular session of parliament, “but we are expecting the Swedish prime minister to visit Hungary first.” “If this is an important issue for the Swedes, the Swedish prime minister will obviously come to Budapest,” the party said. Hungary’s National Assembly is scheduled to reconvene on February 26, and ratification could take place quickly once it has received Orban’s approval.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/5/hungarys-ruling-party-boycotts-parliament-session-on-swedens-nato-bid
Ukraine’s president confirms plans for military shake-up,Speculation over the future of army chief Valery Zaluzhny has been rife as war’s second anniversary nears.,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he plans to reshuffle Ukraine’s military and political leadership. The comments, on Italian RAI TV in an interview broadcast late on Sunday, follow weeks of speculation that Zelenskyy intends to dismissValery Zaluzhny, commander-in-chief of Ukraine’s military. “A reset, a new beginning is necessary” and it is “not about a single person but about the direction of the country’s leadership”, Zelenskyy said. “I’m thinking about this replacement,” he said, “but you can’t say here we replaced a single person.” Zaluzhny, who was appointed by Zelenskyy months before Russia invaded in February 2022, is popular with troops and the wider population. He has denied speculation that he has political ambitions. He and the president have been at odds for some time over the conduct of the war, as the country grapples with low ammunition, personnel shortages after a failed counteroffensive, and the need for more troops. Zelenskyy sought to downplay the implications during his comments on the reshuffle. “When we talk about this, I mean a replacement of a series of state leaders, not just in a single sector like the military,” he said. “If we want to win, we must all push in the same direction, convinced of victory; we cannot be discouraged, let our arms fall; we must have the right positive energy,” the president continued as he spoke of Kyiv’s struggle to oust Russian forces following the 2014 annexation of Crimea, the occupation of parts of the Donbas, and the invasion of February 2022. Ukrainian news outlet Ukrainska Pravda reported the same day that Zelenskyy is also considering removing General Staff Chief Serhii Shaptala. Zaluzhny, meanwhile, congratulated Shaptala on his birthday and posted a picture of them together on Facebook. Speculation has gripped Ukraine for weeks over Zaluzhny’s position and relationship with the president as the war against the Russian invasion nears its second anniversary. At the end of last year, Zelenskyy said he had rejected a request by the military to mobilise up to 500,000 people and demanded to know how it would be organised and paid for. Tensions between the two men were also publicised last year after the general told The Economist in an interview that the war had entered a stalemate. The claim earned a furious denial from Zelenskyy. Unconfirmed media reports last week said that the general had refused a presidential request for his resignation. Oleksandr Syrsky, commander of land forces, and Kyrylo Budanov, head of the Ukrainian defence ministry’s intelligence directorate, are the two leading candidates to replace Zaluzhny as commander-in-chief, according to speculation.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/5/ukraines-president-confirms-plans-for-military-shake-up
Russian authorities cast doubt on antiwar hopeful’s election bid,Russian officials accused Boris Nadezhdin to have submitted invalid signatures to run against President Putin in March.,"The  Central Election Commission (CEC) of Russia has found flaws in documents backing Boris Nadezhdin’s bid to run in next month’s presidential vote, he has said. The CEC informed the aspiring antiwar candidate on Monday that it had found 15 percent of the signatures hesubmitted to access the electoral raceto be invalid, Nadezhdin said. The commission could now block his bid to enter the election. The municipal councillor, a prominent critic of President Vladimir Putin, has caught the attention of Russia’s small opposition forces with promises to end thewar in Ukraine. He has virtually no chance of unseating Putin, but it is thought that authorities would not welcome a candidate who would introduce antiwar rhetoric in the race for the March 15 election. Nadezhdin, running on the ticket of the small centre-right Civic Initiative party, last week submitted the 100,000 signatures required to register. However, the CEC does not tolerate more than a 5 percent error. “The CEC working group reported 15 percent of defects in the signatures that I have submitted on January 31,” Nadezhdin said on his Telegram channel. Such a level of invalid signatures would provide grounds for the CEC to disqualify him from running. “If the Central Electoral Commission refuses to register me I will appeal the decision to the Supreme Court,” Nadezhdin said. The CEC’s final ruling on the matter is expected on Wednesday, a spokesperson for Nadezhdin said. Putin will be running as an independent, rather than as the candidate of the governing United Russia party, meaning he needs 300,000 signatures to support his candidacy. He has already collected more than 3.5 million, according to his supporters. It is thought virtually certain that Putin will win re-election to extend his rule over Russia for at least another six years.    Officials had already expressed doubt over the validity of 60-year-old Nadezhdin’s bid on Friday. “When we see dozens of people who are no longer on this earth and they add a signature, that poses questions about the ethical standards being used … including by the person collecting them,” Nikolay Bulayev, CEC’s deputy chairman, said. Nadezhdin denied the accusations, posting photographs on Telegram of people queueing to submit signatures. Nobody expects Nadezhdin to win even if he is allowed to participate, given Putin’s long dominance and control of the state. The Kremlin chief is almost certain to win his fifth term as president, extending his 24-year leadership of Russia, including eight years as prime minister. But Nadezhdin’s campaign has captured people’s attention because of his strong opposition to what the Kremlin calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine. He says Putin made a “fatal mistake” by launching the conflict and has pledged to end it via negotiation. Nadezhdin – born in Soviet-ruled Uzbekistan to a Jewish mother who was a music teacher and a physicist father – has spent the last 30 years in Russian politics, working as a councillor in the town of Dolgoprudny outside Moscow. His bid raises the question of just how far the Kremlin would let him go at a time when speaking out against the conflict is politically fraught, often landing critics in prison. Putin has not allowed real electoral opposition in his 24-year rule, with rivals such as opposition leaderAlexey Navalnybehind bars. Navalny’s wife Yuliya signed her name in support of Nadezhdin in a symbolic photo posted by the jailed critic’s ally.

Russia says at least 28 killed in Ukraine shelling of bakery in Lysychansk,Russia says at least 28 people were killed after Ukrainian forces shelled a bakery in Lysychansk city.,"Russia says at least 28 people have been killed after Ukrainian forces shelled a bakery in the city of Lysychansk in the occupied eastern region of Luhansk, with the Ministry of Civil Defence, Emergencies and Disaster Relief saying at least one child was among the deceased. Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Maria Zakharova said on Sunday that “dozens of civilians” were inside the building when Ukraine hit it using the US-supplied High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS). The Emergencies Ministry had released a video late on Saturday of first responders finding dead bodies and taking away bloodied people on stretchers out of the ruins of the one-storey building that appeared to be destroyed. The building appeared to have housed a restaurant named Adriatic, which local authorities said was known to offer fresh bread during the weekends, attracting many Russians. Foreign Ministry’s Zakharova also said Moscow expects “quick and unconditional condemnation” from international organisations. Ukraine has not officially commented on the incident. Almost two years into the war, the front in eastern Ukraine where Luhansk is located has barely moved in months, but battles continue to rage, with both sides launching deadly attacks during the winter. Lysychansk had a population of about 110,000 before Moscow’s offensive. The city fell to Russian forces after a deadly battle in 2022.

People detained at Russia protest calling for troops to return from Ukraine,Reports say journalists were briefly held at protest by wives of Russian soldiers calling for their return from Ukraine.,"About two dozen people, mostly journalists, were briefly detained at a protest in central Moscow, as wives and other relatives of Russian servicemen mobilised to fight in Ukraine called for their return, according to media reports. The soldiers’ relatives gathered on Saturday to lay flowers at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, just outside the Kremlin walls. They marked 500 days since Russian President Vladimir Putin in September 2022 ordered a “partial mobilisation” of up to 300,000 reservists in Moscow’s war against Ukraine. The call-up was widely unpopular and wives and relatives of some of the reservists have campaigned for them to be discharged and replaced with contract soldiers. Saturday’s demonstration was organised by one such campaign group, The Way Home, that on Friday posted on Telegram calling on “wives, mothers, sisters and children” of reservists from across Russia to come to Moscow to “demonstrate [their] unity”. “We want our husbands back alive,” one of the protesters, who only gave her name as Antonina for fear of reprisals, is heard saying in a video published by independent Russian news outlet SOTAvision. Antonina insisted she does not want compensation from the Russian government if her husband is killed, and said she would instead “either go to a convent or follow him”.    Saturday’s demonstration was the ninth and largest of similar weekly gatherings organised by The Way Home. One popular Russian Telegram news channel estimated that some 200 people turned out. The Reuters news agency reported that about 20 people were detained and then released at the protest, including a Reuters journalist who was covering the story and an AFP video journalist. According to OVD-Info, an independent website that monitors political arrests in Russia, police detained 27 people during the protest, mostly journalists. Police had detained the group of Russian and foreign reporters – all men – outside Red Square and took them to a police station. According to SOTA, most were later released, although a male protester was still in detention on Saturday evening. Additionally, a number of people were also detained at other locations in central Moscow, also protesting against the mobilisation, OVD-Info said. Allies of jailed Kremlin foe Alexey Navalny and Russian opposition politician Maksim Kats voiced support for the protest on Friday, while the Moscow prosecutor’s office early on Saturday warned Russians not to participate in “unauthorised mass events”.    Calls from wives and relatives to bring mobilised Russian reservists home have been ignored by the state-controlled media, and some pro-Kremlin politicians have sought to cast them as Western stooges. Protesters on Saturday angrily rejected the accusation. Maria Andreyeva, whose husband and brother are fighting in Ukraine, told SOTAvision that she saw the fighting in Ukraine as “a great tragedy that happened between two brotherly peoples”. “Almost every Russian has relatives in Ukraine, close and distant, so … this is a situation that has struck us to the core. After the second world war, it seemed to us that our grandfathers died so that there would never be another [conflict],” Andreyeva said. Saturday’s protest came weeks before the Russian presidential election, scheduled to take place in March, that Putin is all but assured to win. After Andreyeva and others laid flowers at the monument, they headed to Putin’s campaign headquarters to present their demands to him. Last month, another Russian presidential hopeful met with Andreyeva and other soldiers’ relatives campaigning for their return. Former local legislator Boris Nadezhdin, who openly opposes the war in Ukraine, criticised the Kremlin’s decision to keep them in the ranks as long as the fighting continues. “We want [the authorities] to treat people who are doing their duty in a decent way,” Nadezhdin said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/3/people-detained-at-russia-protest-calling-for-troops-to-return-from-ukraine

ICJ rules that it will hear part of Ukraine-Russia genocide case,UN’s top court will not address aspects of case accusing Russia of violating Genocide Convention by falsely alleging genocide.,"The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has ruled that parts of Ukraine’s case against Russia arguing that Moscow baselessly accused Kyiv of genocide to justify the 2022 invasion can move forward. However, the ICJ ruled on Friday that it will not addresswhether Russiaviolated the 1948 Genocide Convention by using what Ukraine says were trumped-up genocide charges as a pretext for the war, even if the invasion may have violated international law broadly. Instead, the case will proceed to assess whether Ukraine committed genocide in the eastern parts of the country, as Russia claims – a matter where judges ruled that they have jurisdiction. When Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion on February 24, 2022, part of his argument was that pro-Russian people in eastern Ukraine had been “subjected to bullying and genocide by the Kyiv regime”. Ukraine filed a suit at the ICJ, “emphatically denying” this and arguing that Russia’s use of “genocide” as a pretext for invasion went against the Genocide Convention. “In the present case, even if the Russian Federation had, in bad faith, alleged that Ukraine committed genocide and taken certain measures against it under such a pretext, which the respondent [Ukraine] contends, this would not in itself constitute a violation of obligations” under the genocide convention, the ICJ said in the ruling read out by its president, Joan Donoghue on Friday. The ICJ, known asthe World Court, said it did not have jurisdiction to rule on whether Russia’s invasion violated the Genocide Convention, or on whether Moscow’s recognition of Donetsk and Luhansk, two breakaway republics in eastern Ukraine, amounted to a breach of the convention. But the judges said they would allow Ukraine’s request for the court to rule that there was no “credible evidence that Ukraine is committing genocide in violation of the Genocide Convention” in eastern Ukraine. Kyiv is seeking a declaration from the ICJ that it did not commit genocide. A final, legally binding decision is likely still years away.    Before Russia’s all-outinvasion of Ukrainein 2022, Ukraine had been battling Russian-backed separatist forces in the east of the country since 2014. But Kyiv insists that there was no risk of genocide there. As well as citing an alleged “genocide” against the Russian-speaking residents of Donetsk and Luhansk to justify its invasion, Moscow also invoked NATO’s eastwardexpansionas one of the reasons behind the conflict. Triestino Mariniello, a law professor at Liverpool John Moores University, said Friday’s ruling is important because it moves the case to the merits stage. “It has confirmed that there is a dispute between Russia and Ukraine in relation to the application, interpretation and fulfilment of the Genocide Convention, and that the court has jurisdiction in particular in establishing in the merits case that Ukraine has not committed genocide in this specific areas of Luhansk and Donetsk in Ukrainian territory,” Mariniello told Al Jazeera. Last month, the ICJ dismissedlarge partsof a Ukraine petition accusing Russia of “terrorism”. In March 2022, shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine, the UN’s top court ordered Moscow to halt its military offensive. But while the court’s decisions are legally binding, it lacks an enforcement mechanism. “It’s upon individual states – in this case Russia – or international organisations like the [UN] Security Council to implement such decisions or judgements,” Mariniello said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/2/icj-rules-that-it-will-hear-part-of-ukraine-russia-genocide-case
"Russia, Ukraine clash over bodies of military plane crash victims","There has been no official confirmation on who downed the plane, but Russia accuses Ukraine.","Russia and Ukraine are locked in a dispute about the bodies of people killed in the crash of a Russian military transport plane who Moscow says were Ukrainian prisoners of war. A Ukrainian intelligence official said in televised remarks late on Thursday that Kyiv has urged Moscow to hand over the bodies of those killed in theJanuary 24 crash, which Russia has blamed on Ukraine. He said Moscow has refused. Andrii Yusov, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s military intelligence, reiterated Kyiv’scall for an international investigationinto the crash over the Russian region of Belgorod to determine whether the cargo plane carried weapons or passengers along with the crew. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the state RIA Novosti news agency on Friday that the Kremlin hadn’t received a Ukrainian request to hand over the bodies. Russia would not only welcome but also “insist” on an international inquiry into the plane’s downing,Putin saidthis week as he described the crash as a “crime” by Ukraine. Ukraine has neither confirmed nor denied that its forces downed the Ilyushin Il-76 plane that Russia says was carrying 65 Ukrainian POWs. Russia’s claim about the prisoners couldn’t be independently verified. Russia’s Investigative Committee, its main state criminal investigation agency, said the plane was brought down by the US-made Patriot missile defence system, which Western allies have supplied to Kyiv for thewar against Russia. The committee said it has recovered 116 fragments of two missiles that were fired from a Patriot system near the village of Lyptsi in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region, which sits on the other side of the border from Belgorod. It had a video that purported to show some missile fragments lying in the snow with markings said to prove their origin. It also said it has identified all the crash victims. Russian officials said there were 74 people on board – 65 Ukrainian POWs, six crew members and three Russian servicemen – all of whom were killed. Despite the crash, the two countriescompleted a prisoner exchangeon Wednesday, each swapping 195 POWs. The war between Russia and Ukraine, which is nearing its two-year mark, continues to rage, with Russia carrying out long-range strikes on Ukraine with missiles and drones. Ukraine on Thursday said it used sea drones toattack and destroy a Russian warshipin the Black Sea near the Russian-annexed Crimean Peninsula. In Kryvyi Rih, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s hometown, a drone strike damaged an energy facility, leaving 100,000 recipients without electricity and 113 coal miners stranded underground in two mines. Oleksandr Vilkul, the head of the central city’s defence council, said all the miners were brought to safety after power was partially restored.

What do Ukrainian refugees make of Israel’s war on Gaza?,"While some who have fled Russia’s invasion side with Israel, others say the conflict is more complex than they thought.","Glasgow, United Kingdom –Civilians have been bombed, killed and injured in their thousands. Infrastructure has been shelled – and millions displaced. Today, these images of conflict evoke Gaza, but 120 days ago were more associated with Ukraine following the Russian invasion of the former Soviet republic in February 2022. For months, the millions of Ukrainians forced to flee their homes for countries across Europe have championed the cause of their besieged nation-state from afar. However, after the deadly Hamas attack on southern Israel on October 7 last year, and the brutal campaign of Israeli air strikes that followed and has killed 27,000 Palestinians, some Ukrainian refugees fear that Kyiv’s struggle against Vladimir Putin’s Russia – once the Western world’s primary focus – has been overshadowed. “The support for Ukraine and the attention from the media and people regarding the war in Ukraine is losing momentum, which saddens me and all Ukrainian citizens,” said Ukrainian refugee Maria Pankova, who lives in Scotland. “For instance, my Scottish friends, who never shared fundraisers or news on social media to support Ukraine, are now actively doing so to support Gaza.” More than 250,000 UK visas have been issued to Ukrainian refugees since the start of the conflict in Eastern Europe. Scattered across Britain’s four constituent nations of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, most have taken solace in their host country’s political support for Ukraine. But despite Thursday’s agreement by the European Union to supply Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy with a 50-billion-euro ($54bn) aid package, many refugees share Pankova’s fear that, with another major conflict vying for global attention, Ukraine’s push to repel and ultimately defeat Russia has got much harder. “As a Ukrainian, I think a lot about the amount of [international] resources and attention which are now divided in two directions,” said Yana, who withheld her surname. Yana’s greatest fear is that more global instability could lead to the eruption of another world war. She lives in southeast England having fled in May 2022 with her son, who she said suffers from mental anguish following the Russian invasion. The idea that Israel’s onslaught on Gaza has muddied Western efforts to support Ukraine has also been raised by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who relies heavily on military aid from the West, most notably from the United States. Quick to condemn the Hamas attack on Israel in October, he has said competing with a fresh war in the Middle East for international attention was detrimental to his cause. In December, he lamented the distracting nature of the Israeli offensive: “You see, attention equals help. No attention will mean no help. We fight for every bit of attention.” At the end of last year, the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) published a poll on Israel’s war on Gaza, which indicated that 69 percent of Ukrainians sided with Israel over the Palestinians. Iliya Kusa, a Kyiv-based author and analyst of international relations with the Ukrainian Institute for the Future,wrotelast year that for most Ukrainians, the Arab world is seen as “something distant and foreign” while there are many sociocultural and business ties between Ukraine and Israel. “Israel is broadly seen as a good example of a state that has successfully repelled attacks from aggressors for decades and at the same time is prosperous and technologically advanced: everything that Ukrainians would like their own country to be,” he wrote. Olena Hich, now in England after fleeing Ukraine with her daughter nearly two years ago, told Al Jazeera that her sympathy lay with Israel. “War is always bad for both sides. Most civilians are innocent, but Hamas is a terrorist [group] that needs to be destroyed and Israel has the right to defend its territory and its people,” said Hich, who is from Zaporizhzhia, southeastern Ukraine. Yana explained that she also feels more affinity with Israel and said that, growing up in Ukraine, she was not exposed to any information about Palestine. Other Ukrainian refugees in the United Kingdom have, however, taken time to examine Israel’s war on Gaza in more detail. Masters graduates Anastasiia and Vadym live in the Scottish capital, Edinburgh. The couple, from the port city of Odesa, spoke of their shock after learning of the Hamas attack on Israel, during which 1,139 people were killed – but later explored the context of the assault. “In less than a month, and when we saw what was happening in Gaza, we thought, ‘Okay, this is not black and white at all’,” Anastasiia said. Vadym said “it was crucial to highlight the deaths of civilians” in the Palestinian enclave, despite his main focus being on the fortunes of his own native land. Despite the International Court of Justice in The Hague last month ordering Israel to take “all measures within its power” to prevent genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, the devastation wreaked on the enclave by the US-supplied Israeli military continues unabated. “We Ukrainians were not ready for [our war], although our hidden conflict with Russia has lasted for centuries,” Irina Tyazhkorob, another Ukrainian refugee living in England, told Al Jazeera. “Our only difference is that the people of Gaza lived with the expectation of open confrontation, and probably could have foreseen it.  Although, to be honest, no one can be mentally prepared for war.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/2/ukrainian-refugees-divided-on-israels-war-on-gaza-but-feel-for-civilians
Ukraine says ‘destroyed’ Russian ship in underwater drone attack off Crimea,Military intelligence releases nighttime video showing sinking of ship it said was the missile boat Ivanovets.,"Ukraine has said it used sea drones to attack and destroy a Russian warship in the Black Sea near the Russian-annexed Crimean peninsula. The military intelligence agency, known by its Ukrainian acronym GUR, published a video on Thursday that it said depicted a naval drone attack on the missile-armed corvette Ivanovets the night before. The grainy footage, running about 2 and a half minutes and accompanied by a dramatic soundtrack, showed a number of explosions, and the ship eventually listing to one side. It ended with the vessel sinking stern-first into the sea. “As a result of a number of direct hits to the hull, the Russian ship suffered damage incompatible with further movement,” the intelligence agency said in a statement accompanying the video, apparently made up of live feeds from the drones. #працюєГУР 🔥 «Івановєц» на дні ― внаслідок спецоперації ГУР МО знищено ракетний корабель ворога 🔗https://t.co/b8MQb3KJrkpic.twitter.com/Tu6uuaF2rt — Defence intelligence of Ukraine (@DI_Ukraine)February 1, 2024 The GUR said the attack had been carried out by its Group 13 unit and took place while the Ivanovets was on patrol on Lake Donuzlav in western Crimea. The lake was connected to the Black Sea by a channel in 1961. There was no official response from Russia whose Black Sea Fleet has come under attack by Ukraine before, most notably with thesinkingof the flagship Moskva in April 2022. On that occasion, Moscow eventually acknowledged the loss of the ship and said the Moskva sank as it was being towed to port after “detonation of ammunition” caused a fire. Ukraine said it had sunk the Soviet-era ship with a cruise missile, and the United States backed up the claim. It was not possible to verify the sinking of the Ivanovets, but Russian military bloggers reported the area had come under attack from naval drones during the night, and that the Ivanovets had been hit. Disinformation has become a key feature of thewar, which marks its second anniversary on February 24, and it was not possible to independently verify the footage or claims. The private security firm Ambrey said Ukraine has used up to six sea drones, each of which usually carry 300 kilogrammes (660 pounds) of explosives, in the attack. A Western official also backed the Ukrainian account, telling the Associated Press news agency that it was “highly likely that uncrewed surface vessels were responsible for the strike on the Ivanovets”. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence. The Ukrainian navy said the loss of the Ivanovets, thought to have a crew of about 40 sailors, would be “significant” because Russia has only three ships of the same class in its Black Sea Fleet. Crimea, which was invaded and annexed by Moscow in 2014, has come under increasing attack by Ukrainian drones and missiles. On Thursday, Russia said it had destroyed 20 Ukrainian missiles over the area.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/2/ukraine-says-destroyed-russian-ship-in-underwater-drone-attack-off-crimea

"In a sign of commitment, EU unlocks aid for Ukraine as it fights off Russia","The deal will help Ukraine cover its massive wartime deficit, but experts question what concessions were made to assure its passage.","European Union leaders have overcome objections fromHungaryto approve a50 billion euro ($54bn) planto support Ukraine for the next four years. The unanimous decision came on Thursday, as Ukrainecontinues its struggleto repel a full-scale Russian invasion that began nearly two years ago. Lawmakers and experts hailed the deal as an important buttress for the continued stability of the war-torn Eastern European country, whose economy is heavily reliant on Western aid. “The EU showed commitment to the continuous support of Ukraine under difficult geopolitical and internal circumstances … and despite alleged public impatience with this support,” European Institute lecturer George Tzogopoulos told Al Jazeera. Thursday’s deal, known as the “Ukraine Facility“, consists of 17 billion euros ($18.5bn) in grants and 33 billion euros ($35.8bn) in loans, designed to help Ukraine rebuild and recover from the war. The funding is also expected to help Ukraine make reforms on its path to eventual EU membership. EU leaders officially invited Ukraine to become amemberin December, but around the same time,Hungary vetoed the aid package, saying Ukraine funding should not be grafted onto the EU multi-annual budget. The aid’s eventual passage on Thursday was met with cheers fromUkrainian officials. Deputy Prime Minister Yuliya Svyrydenko wrote on Facebook that, with the funding, Ukraine had “come one step closer to economic stability for the next four years”. Ukraine faces a $43bn budget deficit this year and expects the EU aid will cover just under half of it. EU leaders, meanwhile, hailed the aid package asa means of ensuring stabilityand democracy in Eastern Europe. “This locks in steadfast, long-term, predictable funding forUkraine. EU is taking leadership & responsibility in support for Ukraine; we know what is at stake,” European Council President Charles Michelwroteon the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen likewisecalledit “a good day for Europe”. Thursday’s agreement also marked a moment of relative unity for EU members, some of whom, like the Baltic states, are rearming againstRussia. Others, like Italy, have been more wary of alienating Russia. “The EU stands behind you long-term, until victory,”wroteEstonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas. “Ukraine’s security is Europe’s security,” Italian prime minister Roberta Metsolaechoedon social media. Leaders also agreed on an addition to the EU budget of two billion euros ($2.17bn) for border security, 7.6 billion euros ($8.26bn) for regional aid and 1.5 billion euros ($1.6bn) for the European Defence Fund, an initiative to ensure cooperation among member countries’ armed forces. Key aspects of the Ukraine aid deal, however, remained murky. It was not clear if EU leaders had also approved a separate military aid fund for Ukraine worth 20 billion euros ($21.7bn), proposed last July. Nor was it clear if they would move forward with the five billion euros ($5.43bn) in military aid proposed by Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign policy chief. Questions also linger over what concessions were made to Hungary in order to lift its veto of the Ukraine funding package. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has consistently questioned the continued support for Ukraine, downplaying the threat Russia poses and calling for an annual review of any expenditures. “We need to closely monitor the details of the compromise because the EU does not need to show that it accepted Orban’s demands, given how sensitive an issue the rule of law remains,” Tzogopoulos, the European Institute lecturer, said. Hungary was indeed offered some concessions in exchange for its support, in the form of an opportunity to veto the spending deal next year if Ukraine fails to live up to its conditions. Those conditions require Ukraine to uphold “effective democratic mechanisms”, such as multi-party parliamentary democracy, the rule of law and respect for minorities. In the days leading up to Thursday’s deal, though, tensions between Hungary and EU leaders had reached a boiling point. Earlier this week, media reports emerged that the European Commission threatened to “sabotage” Hungary’s economy if it persisted in vetoing Ukraine aid. There has also been backlash against what critics consider Hungary’s democratic backsliding. EU leaders hadsuspended20 billion euros ($21.7bn) in support funds to Hungary over concerns about media freedom and the rule of law in Hungary. They also suspended 10 billion euros ($10.8bn) due to concerns about judicial independence, but released those last December. The European Parliament wants EU leaders to reconsider that decision. The impasse over Ukraine funding has been further exacerbated by ethnic tensions with Hungary, its neighbour to the west. An estimated 150,000 ethnic Hungarians live in western Ukraine. But in 2017 and 2019, Ukraine passed laws forbidding the teaching of minority languages in schools and their use in local government, leading to outcry in the Hungarian community. “It was, of course, directed against the Russian language but … all minorities suffered,” Katalin Miklossy, an expert on Eastern Europe at the University of Helsinki, told Al Jazeera. Hungarian Prime Minister Orban decried the measures as impinging on Hungarian rights in Ukraine, a factor that contributed to his decision to veto military aid for the country. For its part, Ukraine attempted to quell any concerns with reforms to the laws, as it sought membership in the EU. “Ukraine in 2023 backed off the minority laws as a favour to Hungary, to facilitate its application to the EU,” said Miklossy. “They reframed the law so that it was again possible to study minority rights in schools.” Romania also protested the language laws: More than 100,000 ethnic Romanians live in Ukraine. But experts say that Romania’s overall reaction to Ukraine has served as a counterpoint to Hungary’s. It has been a major export route for Ukrainian grain, both by sea and through the Danube River. Whereas Hungary has refused to contribute weapons or allow Ukrainian forces to pass through its territory, Romania has sent arms to Ukraine and been a conduit. Hungary has long been considered a fly in the ointment for EU foreign policy. In early 2003, for instance — shortly after it secured EU membership — it publicly backed the US’s war in Iraq, breaking from EU consensus at the time. Individual EU members retain the right to veto budgetary and foreign policy decisions, which require unanimity. Attempts to introduce qualified majority voting failed at an EU summit in 2002, as well as in French and Dutch referendums in 2005. Hungary’s decision, however, to ultimately lift its veto on Thursday has come at a pivotal time for Ukraine. The country is nearing the second anniversary of Russia’s invasion on February 24. In the first year of the invasion alone, Ukraine’s gross domestic product (GDP) dropped by an estimated 30 percent — its largest decline since the country achieved independence. Experts have predicted Ukraine’s economy will rebound in the coming years, but the long slog of war has depleted its finances, making it increasingly dependent on foreign aid. The longevity of that aid, however, is far from guaranteed. While the EU successfully reached an aid deal on Thursday, the US hasstruggledto cobble together its own congressional aid package, amid staunch opposition fromRepublicans. The news of the EU funding agreement came just as Ukraine — desperate to show that Western money is helping to win its war with Russia — scored a new victory in theBlack Sea. Footage released by Ukrainian armed forces showedsurface dronesrepeatedly striking the Ivanovets, a 480-tonne missile corvette, crippling it and then destroying it completely. Video sent by drones as they approached the ship revealed gaping holes in its hull from previous attacks. The footage included a wide-angle shot of a massive explosion as missiles were fired at the Ivanovets, and a later shot captured the bow of the ship sticking out of the water, confirming it sank stern-first. Ukraine has been attacking Russia’s Black Sea Fleet since the beginning of the war, and more intensively since last year, to protect a safe corridor through which it exports grain. Agricultural goods brought Ukraine more than $23bn last year, its agriculture ministry said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/1/in-a-sign-of-commitment-eu-unlocks-aid-for-ukraine-as-it-fights-off-russia
Russian court extends detention of US journalist Kurmasheva until April,Russian-American journalist is accused of failing to register as a ‘foreign agent’ and spreading ‘false information’.,"A court in Russia has extended the pre-trial detention of Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva, who has been in custody since October. On Thursday, the court in the city of Kazan ruled thatKurmashevamust stay behind bars until April 5. The Prague-based editor has been charged with failing to register as a “foreign agent” and spreading “false information” aboutRussia’s military campaign in Ukraine, said her employer, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). Funded by the United States Congress, RFE/RL is designated by Russia as a foreign agent, a charge levelled on the basis that it receives foreign funding for activity deemed to be political. RFE/RL has reported that Kurmasheva could face a maximum combined sentence of15 yearsin prison as it has called her detention unjust and politically motivated. Kurmasheva, who has both US and Russian passports, entered Russia in May to deal with a family emergency. She was initially detained on June 2 at an airport while awaiting her return flight, and her passports were confiscated. According to court documents, the journalist was fined 10,000 roubles ($103) in October for failing to register her US passport with Russian authorities. She was subsequently slapped with the “foreign agent” charges and has been in custody since October 18. In December, a state-affiliated media outlet said Russian investigators had opened a new case against Kurmasheva, accusing her of spreading false information about the Russian army. Her husband, Pavel Butorin, who also works for RFE/RL, said that charge related to a book that she had edited. While not unexpected, today’s unmerciful ruling by Judge Sergei Aptulin of Kazan’s Sovietsky District Court to extend#Alsu’s detention for another two months stands to prove once again that the spurious criminal charges brought against my wife are merely a pretext for Russia to…pic.twitter.com/gdjcPFzlfd — Pavel Butorin (@PashaButorin)February 1, 2024  He posted on X that while Thursday’s “unmerciful” ruling was “not unexpected”, it showed that “the spurious criminal charges brought against my wife are merely a pretext for Russia to continue holding her hostage as an American”. Kurmasheva is the second US journalist to be arrested and charged in Russia since its invasion of Ukraine two years ago. Evan Gershkovich, a reporter with The Wall Street Journal, was detained in March and is awaiting trial on spying charges that he, his newspaper and the US government strongly deny. This week, a court in Moscow extended the pretrial detention of Gershkovich until the end of March, meaning the journalist will spend at least a year behind bars in Russia. Gershkovich andPaul Whelan, an American convicted of spying in 2020 and jailed in Russia for 16 years, have been designated by the US government as “wrongfully detained”. The designation means Washington considers the charges against them bogus and is committed to working for their release. Kurmasheva’s supporters have been lobbying Washington for the same status for her.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/1/russian-court-extends-detention-of-us-journalist-kurmasheva-until-april
European Union agrees on new $54bn aid package for Ukraine,Hungary previously vetoed the measure and criticised the bloc’s military support for Ukraine.,"All 27 European Union countries have agreed on an additional 50-billion-euro ($54bn) aid package for Ukraine, despite threats from Hungary to veto the move. “We have a deal,” European Council President Charles Michel said in a post on X on Thursday, just an hour into a special summit of EU leaders in Brussels. Michel said the move “locks in steadfast, long-term, predictable funding for Ukraine” and demonstrates that the “EU is taking leadership and responsibility in support for Ukraine; we know what isat stake“. We have a deal.#Unity All 27 leaders agreed on an additional €50 billion support package for Ukraine within the EU budget. This locks in steadfast, long-term, predictable funding for#Ukraine. EU is taking leadership & responsibility in support for Ukraine; we know what is… — Charles Michel (@CharlesMichel)February 1, 2024  Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the EU’s approval of the aid package would strengthen long-term economic and financial stability as the war with Russia approaches its third year. “It is very important that the decision was made by all 27 leaders, which once again proves strong EU unity,” he posted on X. Ukraine has become increasingly desperate to secure funding from Western countries in recent months, with political delays to both US and EU aid bolstering Russian confidence amid the bogged-down war. Grateful to@CharlesMicheland EU leaders for establishing the €50 billion Ukraine Facility for 2024-2027. It is very important that the decision was made by all 27 leaders, which once again proves strong EU unity. Continued EU financial support for Ukraine will strengthen… — Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa)February 1, 2024  In December, the bloc agreed on the latest aid package, which would run through to 2027, and decided to make Ukraine a candidate for EU membership, which Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban reluctantly accepted. But Orban, who has close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, was angry at the European Commission’s decision to block his government’s access to some of the bloc’s funds, which they did over concerns about possible threats to the EU budget by Hungary. In response to the lack of access, Orban vetoed several issues at the EU.    “I don’t want to use the word blackmail, but I don’t know what other better word” might fit, Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas told reporters as she arrived for Thursday’s crunch meeting. “Hungary needs Europe,” she said. “He should also look into what it is in it for Hungary, being in Europe,” added Kallas, referring to Orban. After the deal was sealed, Kallas noted that it was an “important signal to Ukraine that the EU stands behind you long-term, until victory”. Latvia’s Prime Minister Evika Silina also posted on X that the agreement was “excellent news for the security of Latvia and all of Europe”. Ukraine expects to receive the first tranche of 4.5 billion euros ($4.9bn) from the EU facility in March, the Ministry of Economy said on Thursday. Reporting from Kyiv, Al Jazeera’s Rob McBride said there was “a great sense of relief” in Ukraine after the announcement of the deal. “This guarantees funding for four years, so it gives a longer-term sense of security. There’s also a lot of talk here about some of these funds going into an investment fund to try to attract private sector investment,” he added. Orban said that he had received guarantees about billions of euros in suspended EU aid in return for lifting Hungary’s veto. “We finally negotiated a control mechanism to guarantee that the money would be used sensibly, and we received a guarantee that Hungary’s money would not end up in Ukraine” he said. Reporting from Brussels, Al Jazeera’s Natacha Butler said the EU were keen to send a message of unity. It was important for the EU “to send the message to Moscow that they are united when it comes to Ukraine, particularly in a difficult year in which we have the US elections – they know there is a lot of uncertainty ahead”, she added. The EU funding is especially significant as a similaraid package from the UScontinues to be blocked due to internal political disputes and is further complicated by the presidential election in November. “US funding to Ukraine became a hostage of domestic US politics,” Hlib Vyshlinsky, executive director of the Centre for Economic Strategy, told Al Jazeera. “It was very hard for Ukraine to do anything with it in a year of presidential elections in the United States.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/1/european-union-agrees-on-new-54bn-aid-package-for-ukraine
"Ukraine, Russia fight from the skies as Kyiv’s EU aid hangs in the balance","As a key summit focuses on aid, Russia says it will increase air defence missile production as air wars are fought over Ukraine.","The European Union is gripped by acrucial summiton Thursday that will be dominated by a second attempt to pass a 50-billion-euro ($54bn) amendment to the bloc’s budget that will help finance Ukraine over the next four years. That amendment was vetoed by Hungary at last December’s regular summit, along with 20 billion euros ($22bn) in military aid to Ukraine for 2024. The EU’s executive, the European Commission, was reportedly hoping to bring Hungary on board by offering Prime Minister Viktor Orban an opportunity to block a continuation of the support next year, when the EU would re-evaluate whether Ukraine still meets the requirements to receive the money. That tenor of conciliation changed by Sunday, when the Financial Times reported the EU also had a plan to sabotage Hungary’s economy if it refused to cooperate. Details of the plan were secret, but the EU has leverage. Its internal market buys roughly 90 percent of Hungary’s exports, and the EU is withholding 30 billion euros ($32bn) in aid to Hungary, of which it promised to release 10 billion euros ($11bn) last December in return for Orban walking out of the room where the remaining 26heads of government votedto give Ukraine and Moldova official candidate status to the EU. Orban’s political director said Hungary was ready to consider cooperating on Monday and Orban reportedly confirmed that in remarks to Le Point on Tuesday. But EU officials said a deal was still uncertain. Meanwhile, a $60bn US aid package to Ukraine remained stalled in the US Senate, where Republicans loyal to presidential hopeful Donald Trump were reportedly holding out for a deal with the administration of President Joe Biden on border security with Mexico. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said the bloc was close to agreeing to a 5-billion-euro ($5.4bn) emergency funding stopgap from its European Peace Facility. “The moment has not come to weaken our support to Ukraine … we need on the contrary to do more and faster with financial resources, with military equipment, by training soldiers,” Borrell said. The EU established the EPF in 2021 to help finance global military operations. EU aid is crucial to Ukraine, which faces a $43bn budgetdeficitthis year, and expects to cover $41bn from international aid. Ukraine said a Russian winter offensive to recapture lost territory inKharkivand Luhansk, and to complete the conquest of Donetsk, was ongoing. But most of the action was in the air – some of it focused on the line of contact as part of a Russian effort to hobble Ukraine’s defences. In a rare appearance touring defence industries, Russia’s Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said he hoped to increase the production of air defence missiles, used to intercept drones, missiles and planes. He said air defence missile production had already doubled during the Ukraine war, but that was not enough. “There are some key issues we need to address … There is the question of engines, and there is the question of the establishment of launcher production,” Shoigu said in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg. Shoigu’s comments came as Ukraine seemed to have scored a new hit against a Russian target. Geolocated footage showed a fire at the Rosneft oil refinery in Tuapse, on the east coast of the Black Sea, on January 24. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) claimed responsibility for the attack. Local residents reported several explosions, and footage showed drones had been operating in the area. The SBU has been developing long-distance surface and air drones, and used them successfully to attack Russia’s Black Sea Fleet and targets in Crimea. This year, it has focused on energy infrastructure. On January 21, it struck a Novatek gas condensate processing plant near Saint Petersburg. Russian authorities said they had downed 21 Ukrainian drones launched against Crimea on January 30.    Russia, too, continued waves of missile and drone strikes against Ukraine, which it has sharply stepped up since December 29. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia had launched 330 missiles and 600 drones this year. On January 25, Ukraine shot down 10 out of 14 Shahed drones launched by Russia. Four S-300 missiles got through. Three days later, Ukraine shot down four out of eight Shahed drones launched by Russia and a Kh-59 cruise missile. Two Iskander missiles and three S-300 missiles got through. Ukraine said it downed all eight Shahed drones launched the following day, but six S-300 missiles got through. The biggest barrage came on January 30, when Ukraine shot down 15 out of 35 drones along with two S-300 missiles. Ukraine’s military intelligence said it scored a big cyber-victory in Russia’s far east. Its cyberattack against the Russian “Planet” Scientific Research Centre of Space Hydrometeorology’s far east branch destroyed the centre’s 280 servers. Ukraine estimated it had destroyed 2 petabytes worth of “unique research developed over the years”. Ukraine’s military intelligence (GUR) said the centre received satellite data and provided information to at least 50 Russian government agencies, including the  Ministry of Defence (MoD), which in turn passed it on to defence contractors. “Dozens of strategic companies of the Russian Federation, which work for ‘defence’ and play a key role in supporting the Russian occupation forces, will remain without critically important information and services for a long time,” GUR said. GUR estimated it had done $10m of structural damage through lost servers and software, which cannot be replaced under sanctions. Russia has proven quite adept at circumventing sanctions so far. Bloomberg News cited classified Russian customs service data showing that Russia had imported $1bn worth of US and European microchips last year despite sanctions – down from $2.5bn in 2022 but still sizeable. Russia was active in the information sphere. Geolocated footage posted on January 24 showed a Russian Ilyushin-76 transport plane crashing in Belgorod, a Russian region bordering Ukraine. The Russian MoD said Ukraine had shot the plane down using two air defence missiles tracked by Russian radar, killing its six crew, three military personnel and 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war intended for an exchange. “The Ukrainian leadership knew very well that, according to established practice, today Ukrainian military personnel would be transported by military transport aircraft to the Belgorod airfield for exchange,” Russia’s MoD said. “According to the previously reached agreement, this event was to take place in the afternoon at the Kolotilovka checkpoint on the Russian-Ukrainian border.” Ukraine shot the plane down regardless, Moscow said, “pursuing the goal of blaming Russia for the destruction of the Ukrainian military”. Russian President Vladimir Putin repeated the allegations two days later. Ukraine’s military intelligence confirmed a prisoner exchange was to take place and said it was investigating the circumstances of the crash. Russia might have had a motive for an information campaign in which it accused Ukraine of “terrorism”. The top court of the United Nations, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), will rule on Friday whether Russia violated international law by invading Ukraine. Ukraine brought the case to the ICJ days after the February 2022 invasion, arguing that Russia broke international law by falsely claiming genocide against ethnic Russians living in Ukraine as a basis. Russia unsuccessfully tried to have the case thrown out. If the ICJ rules against Russia, it will be its second high-profile condemnation after convicting Putin in March last year as personally responsible for organising the kidnapping of Ukrainian children.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/1/vital-ukraine-aid-hangs-in-the-balance-as-eu-leaders-round-on-hungary
Thailand deports dissident Russian rockers to Israel,Human rights advocates warned against sending Bi-2 to Russia where they could be persecuted for opposing Ukraine war.,"Thailand has deported members of a dissident Russian-Belarusian rock band critical of Moscow’s war in Ukraine to Israel after they were detained for performing without a permit. Members ofBi-2left “safely” for Tel Aviv on Wednesday night, they said on theirFacebookpage. Human rights advocates had warned the group would face severe persecution for speaking out againstRussia’s war in Ukraineif they were sent back to Russia. Thai authorities had detained the members of Bi-2 for working at the resort island of Phuket without a permit. The fate of the band provoked an international outcry, leading Thai immigration officials to give the band the choice of being deported to another destination if they felt unsafe to return to Russia. Thailand’s National Security Council, chaired by Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin, took charge of the case on Wednesday. Several members of the self-exiled group, which had been based in Israel in the 1990s, have dual nationalities, including Israeli and Australian. Deputy Police Chief Surachate Hakparn confirmed the band had requested to be deported to Israel. The band was detained last week after they played a gig on Phuket, a southern island popular with Russian holidaymakers. Thai officials said they were held for performing without the correct work permits and transferred to an immigration detention centre in Bangkok. VPI Event, the organisers of the band’s Thailand concerts – which also included a show in Pattaya – said all the necessary permits were obtained, but the band had been issued tourist visas in error. VPI accused the Russian consulate of having waged a campaign to cancel the concerts since December and said they had faced “unprecedented pressure” as they sought the band’s release. Bi-2, which was founded in Minsk, Belarus, is popular in Russia. Russia’s Ministry of Justice labelled lead singer Yegor Bortnick a “foreign agent” after he criticised President Vladimir Putin online last year. One of the band’s founders has openly denounced the Putin government, saying it makes him feel “only disgust” and accusing the long-serving leader of having “destroyed” Russia. Several of their concerts were cancelled in 2022 after they refused to play at a venue with banners supporting the war in Ukraine, after which they left Russia. “Even though they [are] all safe, we still want Thai authorities to respect arrest procedures strictly,” human rights lawyer Pornpen Khongkachonkiet told the AFP news agency. “It could [have] happened to me, you, and others without international attention as this case got.” Phil Robertson, the deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch (HRW), said Thailand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs had recognised “the importance of upholding human rights principles” by not sending the band to “face persecution” in Russia.

ICJ rejects most of Ukraine’s ‘terrorism’ case against Russia,Kyiv had accused Moscow of being a ‘terrorist’ state and claimed it funded separatists in eastern Ukraine.,"The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has rejected much of a case filed by Ukraine that accused Russia of funding separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine a decade ago, saying only that Moscow had failed to investigate alleged breaches. Kyiv had accused Moscow of being a “terrorist state” whose support for pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine was a harbinger of thefull-fledged2022 invasion. Ukraine also wanted Russia to compensate all civilians caught up in the conflict, as well as victims from Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, which was shot down over eastern Ukraine on July 17, 2014. The top United Nations court declined to rule specifically on alleged Russian responsibility for the shooting down of the plane. The ICJ tossed out most of Ukraine’s pleas, ruling only that Russia was “failing to take measures to investigate facts … regarding persons who have allegedly committed an offence”. The court added that only cash transfers could be considered as support for alleged “terrorist” groups under the terms of the international convention on terrorism financing. This “does not include the means used to commit acts of terrorism, including weapons or training camps”, the court ruled on Wednesday. “Consequently, the alleged supply of weapons to various armed groups operating in Ukraine … fall outside the material scope of the ICSFT” convention, the ICJ said. The 16-judge panel once again ordered Russia to investigate any plausible allegations of “terrorism” financing. Russia was also in the dock for alleged breaches of an international convention on racial discrimination due to its treatment of the Tatar minority and Ukrainian speakers in occupied Crimea. Here the court found that Russia had not taken sufficient measures to enable education in Ukrainian. During hearings on the case, Alexander Shulgin, Russia’s ambassador to the Netherlands, accused Ukraine of “blatant lies and false accusations … even to this court”. Top Ukrainian diplomat Anton Korynevych retorted that Russia was trying to “wipe us off the map”. “Beginning in 2014, Russia illegally occupied Crimea and then engaged in a campaign of cultural erasure, taking aim at ethnic Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars,” said Korynevych. On Friday, the ICJ will rule in another case in which Kyiv has accused Moscow of falsely applying the UN’s 1948 Genocide Convention to justify its February 24, 2022, invasion of Ukraine. The court’s judgements are final and without appeal but it has no way to enforce its rulings.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/31/icj-rejects-most-of-ukraines-terrorism-case-against-russia
Is Zelenskyy planning to fire Ukraine’s popular top army commander?,Valerii Zaluzhnyi has been blamed for last year’s anticlimactic counteroffensive against Russian troops.,"Kyiv, Ukraine –Rumours and allegations have swirled in recent weeks over the dismissal of Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine’s army chief. Last week, several lawmakers and insiders claimed the taciturn and immensely popular 50-year-old four-star general was dismissed and set to lead Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy decided to fire him in early December after Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin visited Kyiv, the Ukrainska Pravda newspaper reported, citing an unnamed source. But on Monday, Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said: “This is not true.” Even though the ministry does not hold sway over Zaluzhnyi, in the case of a potential firing, it would have to submit a “recommendation” for his dismissal to Zelenskyy, Ukraine’s nominal commander-in-chief. “There’s nothing to talk about. There was no dismissal. I have nothing to add,” Zelenskyy’s spokesperson Serhiy Nikiforov said in televised remarks on Monday. But several observers have doubts. “There was an attempt to convince Zaluzhnyi to switch to another job voluntarily, on his own. The attempt wasn’t very successful, so the matter has been postponed,” Kyiv-based analyst Volodymyr Fesenko told Al Jazeera. But the dismissal “is a matter of time and circumstances”, he said. There is “psychological tension” between Zaluzhnyi and the president, who remains dissatisfied with thefailures of last year’s counterattack, Fesenko said. Several counterstrikes in late 2022 liberated almost half of Russia-occupied areas and assured the Ukrainian public that the 2023 summer campaign in the east and south would succeed. But Russia used a lull in hostilities to build multilayer defence installations along the 1,000km-long (621-mile) front line and deployed hundreds of thousands of newly mobilised servicemen to man them. Zaluzhnyi’s months-long counterattackmorphedinto a World War I-like trench war as his forces gained, lost and regained tiny patches of land amid harrowing losses of soldiers and Western-supplied weaponry. Even the failed mutiny and disbandment of the Wagner mercenary group, which spearheaded Russia’s advance,didn’t helpthe Ukrainian counterattacks. The failure was variously blamed on Zaluzhnyi’s tactical mistakes and delays in the supply of Western weaponry such as fighter jets and missiles. As Zaluzhnyi has not come up with a new action plan for 2024, Zelenskyy has occasionally bypassed him in managing the armed forces, Fesenko said. But Zaluzhnyi’s authority among the top brass and servicemen remains sky high. In early 2022, as Ukrainian politicians were adamant that Russian President Vladimir Putin was bluffing and would not dare invade,Zaluzhnyi, who has headed the armed forces since July 2021, worked hard to prepare. “In the political sphere, there were different views, but the military with him at the helm tried hard to get ready, and he demonstrated success,” Lieutenant General Ihor Romanenko, former deputy chief of Ukraine’s General Staff, told Al Jazeera. Once a little-known figure, Zaluzhnyi rarely speaks to the press and shuns publicity. He is by far the most trusted person in wartime Ukraine. He is more popular than Zelenskyy – an astronomical 88 percent of Ukrainians trust him, a recent poll found, while 62 percent trust the president. Seventy-two percent said they are against his dismissal while 2 percent would support it, according to the survey by the Kyiv International Sociology Institute conducted in early December. But popularity won’t necessarily translate into political success. Ukraine’s elites and public do not typically view the military and law enforcement agencies as a source of political and presidential material. Ukraine’s second president, Leonid Kuchma, appointed former intelligence chief Evhen Marchuk as prime minister in 1995 but soon fired him for “trying to form his own political image”. Another wannabe president, former Interior Minister Yuri Kravchenko, died in 2005 of two gunshots to the head that were officially deemed suicide. Former intelligence chief Ihor Smeshko and ex-Defence Minister Anatoly Hritsenko formed their own political parties but gained minimal support in their attempts to run for president. In Ukraine, the army is “not a political institution with a special vision of development like in Latin America”, Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kuschch told Al Jazeera. So should Zaluzhnyi choose to leave the military for politics, he would be a “good sparring partner” for Zelenskyy but would not be elected president, said Igar Tyshkevich of the Ukrainian Institute for the Future, a think-tank in Kyiv. “But it’s almost guaranteed that he would head one of the largest fractions in the Verkhovna Rada,” Ukraine’s lower house of parliament, Tyshkevich told Al Jazeera. He dismissed concerns that protests might erupt if Zaluzhnyi is fired. Media leaks have named two generals who may replace Zaluzhnyi. One is Kyrylo Budanov, a 38-year-old who led small intelligence groups that landed in annexed Crimea before the war and now heads the Main Directorate of Intelligence in the Ministry of Defence. His agency sent helicopters to aid Ukrainian servicemen fighting in the besieged Azovstal plant in Mariupol in 2022. It has conducted drone attacks on bombers, warships, air defence systems and military bases deep inside Russia and annexed Crimea. Budanov’s men have assassinated pro-Russian strongmen and disloyal Ukrainian politicians in separatist-held and Russia-occupied areas. Another possible replacement for Zaluzhnyi is Oleksandr Syrsky, a seasoned military veteran who defended Kyiv in early 2022 and kicked Russian forces out of the eastern region ofKharkivlater that year. If either fills Zaluzhnyi’s shoes, there is sure to be bitter public feelings towards Zelenskyy, but if an upcoming counteroffensive is successful, they would “dissolve within months”, Tyshkevich said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/31/is-zelenskyy-planning-to-fire-ukraines-popular-top-army-commander
Russia and Ukraine complete first prisoner exchange since plane crash,The crash of a plane carrying prisoners of war had cast doubt on the future of prisoner exchanges.,"Russia and Ukraine have exchanged hundreds of prisoners of war, in the first prisoner swap since thecrashlast week of a Russian military transport plane that Moscow says was carrying 65 Ukrainian soldiers. The Russian Ministry of Defence said that each side got 195 soldiers back and that its soldiers would be flown to Moscow to receive medical and psychological treatment. “On January 31, as a result of the negotiation process, 195 Russian servicemen who were in mortal danger in captivity were returned from territory controlled by the Kyiv regime. In return, exactly 195 prisoners from the armed forces of Ukraine were handed over,” the Defence Ministry said in a statement. It was cited by the RIA state news agency as saying that the United Arab Emirates had played a role in brokering the deal. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on his official account on X that it was one of the biggest swaps so far. He gave a slightly higher number for the number of Ukrainians returned. “Our people are back. 207 of them. We return them home no matter what,” said Zelenskyy. Ukraine’s governmental body in charge of POWs said that this was the 50th prisoner exchange of its kind. It returned home soldiers involved in the defence of the cities of Mariupol and Kherson, as well as soldiers captured by Russia on Snake Island in the Black Sea. The body said marines and combat medics were among those handed back and that 36 of the returned Ukrainians had injuries or serious illnesses. The two countries have carried out periodic prisoner swaps via intermediaries since the war began nearly two years ago, despite the absence of any peace talks between them since the early months of the conflict. The latest and biggest exchange was on January 3, when they traded a total of 478 captives following mediation by the UAE. The crash on January 24 of a Russian Ilyushin Il-76 plane in a field before a similar planned swap had thrown doubt on the future of prisoner exchanges between the two sides. Moscow said Ukrainian soldiers being carried to a scheduled exchange were killed when the plane was shot down by Kyiv’s forces. Kyiv has not outright denied Moscow’s version of events but questioned whether captured Ukrainian soldiers were actually on board. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday said that a US-made Patriot missile was used to shoot down the military cargo plane. “The plane was shot down, it has already been established for certain, by an American Patriot system,” Putin said in a televised appearance.

Russia lawmakers pass bill to confiscate assets of those who discredit army,"It allows seizure of money, valuables, other assets of those convicted of spreading ‘false information’ about military.","Lawmakers in Russia’s lower house of parliament have approved a bill that will allow authorities to confiscate the assets of those convicted of spreading “deliberately false information” about the military. The State Duma passedthe measureon Wednesday and the bill is expected to be approved by the upper house before being signed by President Vladimir Putin. Once it becomes a law, the legislation will enable the government to seize money, valuables and other assets of thosecriticising the war in Ukraine. The new law would apply to those convicted of publicly inciting “extremist activities,” calling for actions that would hurt the security of the state or “discrediting” the armed forces. Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin said the bill targets “scoundrels and traitors, those who today spit on the backs of our soldiers, who have betrayed their homeland, who transfer money to the armed forces of a country that is at war with us”.    “Discrediting” the armed forces is a criminal offence under an existing law that was adopted as part of a sweeping government crackdown on dissent afterRussia invaded Ukrainein February 2022. It covers offences such as “justifying terrorism” and spreading “fake news” about the military, and has been used extensively to silence Putin’s critics. Thousands of activists, bloggers and other Russians have received long jail terms, or been detained or fined forspeaking out against the waramid an escalating crackdown on free speech and opposition to Putin. Popular writer Dmitry Glukhovsky was handed an eight-year jail term in absentia after a Moscow court found him guilty in August of deliberately spreading false information about Russia’s armed forces. Grigory Chkhartishvili, among the country’s bestselling novelists and known under the pen nameBoris Akunin, was charged under the law and added to the Russian register of “extremists and terrorists” in December. In November, a court in St Petersburg jailedSasha Skochilenko, an artist and musician, for seven years for swapping supermarket price tags with antiwar messages. The month before, Russian blogger Aleksandr Nozdrinov received an 8.5-year term for posting photos of destroyed buildings in Kyiv, along with a caption implying that Russian troops were responsible. Despite the crackdown on dissent, the Kremlin has repeatedly claimed that Russian society is united in backing the war.

Ukraine war critic submits bid to challenge Putin for Russia’s presidency,"Putin win seen as forgone conclusion, but Boris Nadezhdin’s opposition to Russia’s war in Ukraine has won him significant support.","Boris Nadezhdin, a prominent critic of the Kremlin, has submitted the documents needed to register as a candidate for Russia’s presidential elections in March. The 60-year-old local councillor, who has promised to end Russia’swar in Ukraine, said on Wednesday that he had collected more than 100,000 signatures of support across 40 regions and submitted them and other documents to the Central Election Commission (CEC), which is technically enough to challenge President Vladimir Putin. Election officials will next check the authenticity of the signatures submitted by Nadezhdin and other potential candidates and announce next month who will join Putin on the ballot for the March 15-17 elections. The electoral body has in the past uncovered what it claimed wereirregularitiesin signatures or documents collected by some candidates and disqualified them. Putin, who will be running as an independent rather than as the candidate of the ruling United Russia party, needs 300,000 signatures but has already collected more than 3.5 million, according to his supporters. InDecember, the 71-year-old incumbent announced his decision to seek to extend his rule. He is almost certain to win a fifth term as president, extending his 24-year leadership of Russia, including eight years as prime minister.    Nadezhdin, who has criticised the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 as a “fatal mistake”, was born in Soviet-ruled Uzbekistan to a Jewish mother who was a music teacher and a physicist father. He has spent the last 30 years in Russian politics, working as a councillor in the town of Dolgoprudny outside Moscow. He will be standing as a candidate for the Civic Initiative party. He shot to fame with his calls to end the war, bringing out crowds of Russians across the country eager to add their signatures to his bid to get on the ballot. After a series of heating outages across Russia during an unusually cold winter, Nadezhdin said earlier this month that the country would be able to afford to spend more on its citizens if it was not pouring so much money into the military.    He described the war as “catastrophic” in an interview with the AFP news agency, and said he wanted to “free political prisoners” in Russia. “This is my pride,” he said of the signatures collected, as he thanked his supporters in a statement posted on his official Telegram account. “The work of thousands of people going without sleep over many days. The result of the queues you stood in, in the cold, is in the boxes. It will be very difficult for the CEC and the authorities to say: ‘I didn’t notice the elephant in the room’!” He also posted a video from the CEC’s headquarters showing papers containing the signatures piled up on tables ready to be checked by officials, describing which region each stack had come from. Nadezhdin’s bid raises the question of just how far the Kremlin would let him go, at a time when speaking out against the conflict is politically fraught, often landing critics in prison. Putin has not allowed real electoral opposition in his 24-year rule, with rivals such as opposition leaderAlexei Navalnybehind bars. Navalny’s wife Yuliya signed her name in support of Nadezhdin in a symbolic photo posted by the jailed critic’s ally.

Russian rock band critical of Ukraine war faces deportation from Thailand,"Bi-2 members, held for performing without permits, have criticised Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and President Vladimir Putin.","Members of a dissident Russian-Belarusian rock band critical of Moscow’s war in Ukraine have been jailed in Thailand, with growing calls to not deport them to Russia. Progressive rock group Bi-2’s members remained locked up on Wednesday after being detained for performing without work permits in Thailand. The group has spoken out againstRussia’s invasion of Ukraineand Russian President Vladimir Putin. The group was detained last week after it played a gig in Phuket, a southern Thai island popular with foreign tourists including many Russians. Human Rights Watch (HRW) said Bi-2 will face “persecution” if returned to Russia, and referred to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson accusing the band of “sponsoring terrorism”. A post on the seven-member band’s official Telegram channel on Wednesday said singer Yegor Bortnik, known by his stage name Lyova, had left Thailand. “Lyova Bi-2 flew to Israel, the rest of the group members are still in a migration prison in a cramped cell for 80 people,” the post read. The detained musicians “include Russian citizens as well as dual nationals of Russia and other countries, including Israel and Australia,” HRW said in a statement on Tuesday. Those holding only Russian citizenship are thought to be most at risk. Thai officials confirmed the band’s arrest last week and said they now face possible deportation. “This usually results in deportation to their country of origin but there is some discretion [about the destination],” said Kriangkrai Ariyaying, the superintendent of Phuket’s Immigration Bureau. The country’s National Security Council “is looking into the matter, seeing what are details including the band members’ names and nationalities,” Foreign Minister Parnpree Bahiddha-Nukara told reporters on Wednesday. VPI Event, which organises concerts in Thailand, said all the necessary permits were obtained, but the band had been given tourist visas in error. “Typically, in such cases, migration services contact the organiser of the event to apply appropriate sanctions. But in this case, the attention of the migration services was focused exclusively on the artists,” VPI said, adding that the Russian consulate had attempted to cancel Bi-2’s concerts in December. HRW said Thailand has an international legal obligation to not forcibly return anyone who faces the threat of torture if returned. “Under no circumstances should they be deported to Russia, where they could face arrest or worse for their outspoken criticisms” of Putin and the war, said Elaine Pearson, HRW’s Asia director. HRW also said that “amid repression in Russia reaching new heights, Russian authorities have used transnational repression – abuses committed against nationals beyond a government’s jurisdiction – to target activists and government critics abroad with violence and other unlawful actions”. Bi-2 is popular in Russia. Several of its concerts were cancelled in 2022 after the band refused to play at a venue with banners supporting the war in Ukraine, following which the group left Russia. One of the band’s founders has openly denounced the Putin government, saying it makes him feel “only disgust” and accusing the leader of having “destroyed” Russia. Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya urged Thailand to “find a solution” to the band’s visa issue. I'm worried about the 🇹🇭 situation involving the Belarus-born rock band Bi-2. It's now absolutely clear that Russia is behind the operation to deport the band.

‘We are obliged to end the war’: A new Russian unit fights for Ukraine,The Siberian Battalion features a diverse set of fighters who risk Russia’s wrath by joining the ‘enemy’.,"Kyiv, Ukraine –When Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, 32-year-old Johnny, from St Petersburg, set himself a goal. He wanted to overthrow Vladimir Putin’s administration. In fact, he would have liked to kill the Russian president with his own hands, he told Al Jazeera in a cafe at a remote petrol station on the outskirts of Ukraine’s capital. In October, Johnny joined otherRussians fighting for Ukraineand against their homeland as part of the Siberian Battalion, a unit formed last summer by the Civic Council, a Russian opposition group based in Poland. “We want to democratise Russia. And it won’t be possible in the current state. Russia must fall apart into smaller pieces. I don’t care if it’s going to be small like Belgium … Places like Yakutia and Chechnya and other regions should be able to secede if they choose to,” Johnny said. According to Denis Sokolov, 54, the group’s coordinator, 50 fighters from the unit are currently in training or battling in Ukraine. Another 40 are being checked over by Ukraine’s security services as they wait to cross the border. He said there are thousands of other Russians willing to join the fight against Moscow, boasting that the Civic Council receives up to 10 applications per day. Those who want to sign up must first depart for a third country for safety reasons. And from there, it takes months to process an application. “Ukrainians do not trust Russians, and there are reasons for this. But this war was unleashed by the regime in our name, and we are obliged to end it,” Sokolov said. At the time of publishing, neither Polish nor Ukrainian authorities had responded to Al Jazeera’s request for comment on the Civil Council and Siberian Battalion.  Since the onset of the war, hundreds of Russians have turned on their country and bolstered Ukraine’s forces. According to the International Crisis Group, their motives are diverse. “Most of the recruits from the Russian Federation hail from the North Caucasus – majority-Muslim regions that have a long history of advocating for separation from the central government,” the group said in October. “There are also, however, ethnic Russians fighting on behalf of Ukraine. Some are simply sympathetic to the Ukrainian cause or see joining it as a part of their own struggle against Russian President Vladimir Putin. “Others, however, are far-right activists who hope the war will end with not just the collapse of Putin’s government but also the creation of a new, ethnically homogeneous Russian state.” The far-right fighters, the think tank said, are the “most battle-ready” of the Russian units. Russian troops are officially part of Ukraine’s international legion, fighting with the permission of its defence ministry, and using Ukraine’s weaponry. According to Russian law, the definition of high treason was extended in April to include fighting for enemies – a crime that could result in life imprisonment. In contrast, the Kremlin has reportedly offered citizenship to foreigners who choose to fight alongside Russian forces. Johnny, which is a nom de guerre he adopted after joining the unit, waited for seven months to enter Ukraine. He contacted the Civic Council in March when the group was helping recruit fighters for the Russian Volunteer Corps, a far-right unit behind incursions into Russia inMarchandMay. The two groups have since parted ways. The Civic Council decided to form a new, more inclusive unit that would accept non-white and non-Christian Russian citizens. The Siberian Battalion is made up of an array of people and groups, including anarchists, Muslims and members of the Free Ingria Movement fighting for the liberation of the St Petersburg region. “People are different. We are of different ages. Our values differ. But we all want to defeat Russia. And we believe that this is possible only by armed means,” said Johnny, who has not told his family about his fighting or whereabouts. The Siberian Battalion was named after the vast Russian region rich in natural resources, stretching from the Ural Mountains in the west to the Pacific Ocean in the east. “We understand that all of Moscow’s wealth comes from Siberia and that Moscow – and the rest of Russia – live off of Siberian money,” Sokolov said. “Taking these resources away from the regime is important because, first, without them the empire will be less aggressive. Secondly, the peoples of Siberia have the right to manage their resources independently, not just Indigenous peoples, but everyone who lives in Siberia.” The Siberian Battalion accepts people from other regions too, like 26-year-old Siziy, the unit’s medic-in-training who was born in Moscow. The former customs official, who also ran his own business, arrived in Ukraine on the same day as Johnny and heard about the Civic Council when the organisation was recruiting for the Russian Volunteer Corps. But Siziy, which is a nom de guerre meaning “grey blue” in Russian, does not associate with far-right nationalism. In April 2022, he converted to Islam. His parents found out about his decision when he was already in Ukraine. He has cut contact with everyone he knew in Russia. While it was not easy to accept that her only child went to war, Siziy said, his mother has not protested against his decision. “Everyone makes decisions for themselves. I realised that there is something more important than material wealth in this life,” Siziy said. “If there’s one thing to die for, it is freedom. And Ukraine is fighting for existence.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/30/we-are-obliged-to-end-the-war-a-new-russian-battalion-fights-for-ukraine

"Ukraine funding, Orban’s opposition set to dominate crucial EU summit",Resistance to further aid for Kyiv is growing ahead of meeting that comes almost two years into Russia’s war in Ukraine.,"European Union leaders are preparing for a crucial meeting that will be dominated by a second attempt at passing a 50-billion-euro ($54bn) amendment to the EU budget that will help finance Ukraine over the next four years. That amendment was vetoed by Hungary at December’s regular summit along with 20 billion euros ($21.7bn) in military aid to Ukraine for 2024. The EU’s executive, the European Commission, is reportedly hoping to bring Hungary on board at Thursday’s meeting by offering Prime Minister Viktor Orban an opportunity to block a continuation of the support next year when the EU would evaluate whether Ukraine still needs the money and meets requirements to receive it. EU support has been key to Ukraine’s war effort. The bloc has spent more than 40 billion euros ($43bn) to support Ukraine’s budget and 27 billion euros ($29bn) in military aid since the war began almost two years ago in addition to 17 billion euros ($18.4bn) supporting millions of Ukrainian refugees in Europe. This year, Ukraine’s budget faces a $48 billion shortfall. There is a more coercive approach. This month, the European Parliament condemned Orban’s December veto and asked the European Council of EU government leaders to investigate Hungary for “serious and persistent breaches of EU values”. That obliges the council, which still wields ultimate power in the EU, to invoke proceedings that could ultimately suspend Hungary’s voting rights and deprive it of its veto. But Europe initiated such proceedings, known as Article 7, against Hungary in 2018, and they failed because the system requires unanimity in the council and Poland supported Hungary. Poland has a new, centre-left government that is friendly to Ukraine and no longer aligned with Orban, but Slovakia last year brought Robert Fico’s Smer Party to power to Orban’s undisguised delight. Both men are Eurosceptics and share an adversarial relationship with Brussels. Fico immediately ceased supplying military aid to Ukraine upon taking office and this month voiced his support for Orban. “I will never agree that a country should be punished for fighting for its sovereignty. I will never agree with such an attack on Hungary,” he said in a joint press conference with Orban. “Article 7 would need a consensus that every member state would support it, but Slovakia won’t, and almost certainly the Netherlands won’t. So I would argue that it won’t go through,” University of Helsinki lecturer in Eastern European studies Katalin Miklossy told Al Jazeera. The top vote-getter in Dutch parliamentary elections last year was the party of far-right leader Gert Wilders, who has yet to form a government but has also said aid to Ukraine should be cut. EU members could continue to provide aid through a special vehicle that lies outside their regular budget, something Orban has said he would not oppose, or by allowing member states to help Ukraine bilaterally. These approaches have disadvantages. They are more expensive and deprive the EU of a single voice in foreign policy, making it appear weak as war rages on European soil. They fail to address problems in Hungary itself, which the European Parliament described as an “electoral autocracy” that defies EU values. It has already seen 30 billion euros ($32.5bn) in EU aid suspended for manipulating the judiciary and suppressing free speech and minority rights. Most importantly from a practical point of view, these approaches do not lock in the aid at a time when the EU is mostly comprised of governments and a European legislature willing to help Ukraine. Many observers expect European Parliament elections in June to produce a legislature less well-disposed towards Kyiv – and that could be what Orban is banking on. “Victor Orban reads the cards right, unfortunately,” Miklossy said. “He understands the wind in the EU is changing. There are more and more voices in the EU that want the Ukrainians to just sit down at the table and negotiate peace with the Russians because we cannot afford to support Ukraine forever.” In this view, Orban lies in wait for a Eurosceptic government in Austria this autumn, where the far-right Freedom Party has led polls for a year, and in Germany next year, where the far-right Alternative for Germany has doubled its following in the past 18 months and now comes second in polls to the Christian Democratic Union. Orban may be right about European trends, according to a poll the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) published this month. It found that climate change, pandemics, immigration and fears of global financial instability all trounced Ukraine as existential fears in nine European countries polled. “Our worry was that there will be politicians that would surely try to follow the trend and would be outspoken about the need to stop supporting Ukraine because they believe this is the way the trend is going and where they can find future voters,” the ECFR’s Pawel Zerka told Al Jazeera. Orban, Fico and Wilders have all posed as peacemakers. In a May 2022 poll, the ECFR found a larger group of Europeans in favour of peace at the cost of partitioning Ukraine than in favour of justice whereby Ukraine would fight to regain all its lands. In March last year, the justice camp beat the peace camp 38-29. The ECFR attributed this to Ukraine’s battlefield successes, unity of the left and right on Ukraine, and the strength of US leadership. Now the pendulum appears to be swinging back in the peace camp’s favour, Zerka said, because two of those factors, the US role and battlefield success, “have started to evaporate”. Like the EU, the US has delayed approving military aid for Ukraine this year. British historian Mark Galeotti agreed that the US factor is key. “I think that if the Americans start to genuinely scale down their support for Ukraine, it will be an excuse for a lot of European countries to say, ‘Well, there’s nothing much we can do,’ rather than thinking, ‘We should actually rise to the challenge. This is, after all, our continent,’” Galeotti recently told the podcast Futucast. Hungary has made different choices For Hungary, at least, opposition to Ukraine is about more than picking up votes. Hungary has been wooing Chinese and Russian investment since Orban came to power in 2010. In 2013, Hungary became the first country other than China to sell a renminbi-denominated bond on the international market. Four years later, it became the first Eastern European country to sell a renminbi bond in China itself. Placing itself in financial parlance with China paid dividends, Jens Bastian, a fellow with the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, told Al Jazeera. “[Hungary and Serbia] are the leading recipients of Chinese foreign direct investment in 2023 in Central and Eastern Europe,” Bastian said. China is building and partly financing a Budapest-Belgrade high-speed railway. Chinese electrical vehicle battery manufacturer CATL is investing $7.6bn in the Hungarian city of Debrecen for the construction of a battery plant. “It would be Europe’s largest electrical battery facility. It would be CATL’s single-largest overseas investment and its second facility in Hungary,” Bastian said. As it invests in a manufacturing economy, Hungary seeks cheap energy, Miklossy said, and is one of a group of landlocked EU members (with Slovakia, Austria and the Czech Republic) that successfully fought for exemptions from a 2022 ban on Russian oil imports. Some of these countries, Bastian said, amount to “an axis of the unwilling among EU and NATO members who are in effect doing Putin’s bidding”. For example, in addition to vetoing Ukraine aid, last month Orban also forced Bulgaria to lift transit fees on Russian gas bound for Serbia and Hungary. But what looks like economic interests also has political importance, Bastian said. “They are showing the EU, multilateral organisations like the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Monetary Fund, the European Investment Bank, ‘We are looking for and are successfully finding alternatives.’” Why? Because “Orban and Fico want to see a very different EU … not based on rule of law,” Tymofiy Mylovanov, director of the Kyiv School of Economics, told Al Jazeera. “It’s … a collection of countries with authoritarian populist leaders. They don’t want to exit the EU. They want to change the rules. They don’t want to play by the Brussels rules.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/29/eu-seeks-to-goad-persuade-or-bypass-hungary-in-a-crucial-summit
Russia and Ukraine bicker over tiny front-line village,The dispute illustrates how bogged down the front line has become in the conflict.,"Russia has claimed its forces have taken control of the village of Tabaivka in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region, but Kyiv has denied the claim. Moscow claimed it had taken the tiny village on Monday in a defence ministry statement. However, Ukrainian officials quickly asserted on national TV that Kyiv remains in control. The disagreement illustrates the state of the bogged-down and muddled front line in conflict, which has now been ongoing fornearly two years. The Russian army said it has “liberated” Tabaivka, but Volodymyr Fityo, head of communications for Ukraine’s ground forces, said: “This does not correspond to reality. There are battles taking place near this locality.” Fityo added that Moscow nevertheless was “trying to advance in all directions”. The village of Tabaivka lies near the border with the Luhansk region and had a population of 34 people before Moscow’s invasion.    Both the Kremlin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy have denied the conflict has reached a deadlock, despite the sprawling front line barely moving in months. Russia has for months been trying to advance into the Kharkiv region, hitting its main city several times and killing 11 people in an attack last week. Ukraine’s major counteroffensive in the summer failed to push the invading Russian forces back significantly. Kyiv is now seeking additional soldiers for the front, in contrast to during the early days of the war in 2022 when droves of patriotic volunteers were seen. With the front line largely at a standstill, the two foes have concentrated in recent weeks on air strikes, with cities and infrastructure in Ukraine and Russia targeted. Moscow hit large swathes of Ukraine with drone and missile attacks, Kyiv’s Air Force said on Sunday. The Russian Air Force said Moscow attacked the central Poltava region with two missiles fired from its Iskander ballistic missile system. It also launched three surface-to-air missiles over the Donetsk region in the east.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/29/russia-and-ukraine-in-spat-over-control-of-village-in-ukraines-kharkiv
‘Kharkiv is their priority’: Deadly Russian attacks hit Ukraine’s northeast,"Ukrainians mourn, rebuild, and rebrand a street named after Pushkin as Russian forces intensify their bombing campaign.","Kharkiv, Ukraine –Like an enormous scalpel out of a surreal horror movie, a Russian missile sliced off an entire section of a five-storey apartment building, killing 10 people and wounding 60. After putting out the fire in last week’s predawn attack, rescue workers found the victims buried in the rubble that used to be the walls, ceilings and furniture of their apartments. “We dug out a guy, alive, but his family – a wife and an eight-year-old daughter – were dead,” one of the distressed rescue workers, with his hands and uniform black from the soot and dust, told Al Jazeera on Wednesday. The strike hit Building 7 on Proskury Street in northern Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city that sits only 40km (25 miles) from the Russian border. Ukrainian officials said Kharkiv was targeted by 15 Russian missiles of three types in one of the largest attacks on the city since the war began 23 months ago. There were remodelled S-300 missiles, parts of air defence systems that intercept and destroy other missiles midair, and X-22 hypersonic missiles designed to destroy warships. The largest and most lethal weapons were Iskanders, 7-metre-long monsters that cost $3m, weigh almost 4 tonnes and carry up to 480kg (1,058 pounds) of explosives – or a nuclear warhead. Ukrainian officials have not yet specified what missile type hit Building 7, but a military expert said Russia “most likely” used an S-300 missile. “They’re not precise, this is moral and psychological pressure to destroy the city further,” Lieutenant-General Ihor Romanenko, former deputy chief of Ukraine’s General Staff of the Armed Forces, told Al Jazeera. “Kharkiv is their priority, because [President Vladimir] Putin can’t forgive the fact that a Russian-speaking city didn’t want to become part of the Russian world,” he said. Moscow habitually denies it targeted civilians. Russia “doesn’t hit civilian infrastructure and residential areas, unlike the Kyiv regime”, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. The Itar Tass news agency reported that Russia delivered “pinpointed strikes on the quarters for mercenaries”. The city with a pre-war population of 1.5 million is Ukraine’s most vulnerable urban centre. Russia lies north and east of it, and the border of Moscow-annexed Luhansk region is about 150km (90 miles) to the southeast. Almost 5,000 windows in 222 buildings were broken by the blasts and shockwaves throughout the region on January 23, officials said. In Building 7, communal workers, working quickly and efficiently, yanked out razor-sharp glass shards and covered each gaping hole with yellow, honeycomb-like rectangles of strand board to keep the biting cold away. They checked each apartment for natural gas leaks, fixed damaged entrance doors and started removing bricks the blast broke in half, pieces of glass, plastic and other debris. It was business as usual on the verge of exhaustion. “Their salaries are 5,400 hryvnia [$145] a month, but the amount of work is colossal – to collect it all, load [onto trucks] and take away,” district head of communal services Vera Fyodorovna told Al Jazeera. Two excavators were fumbling for the debris near Building 7, just 30 metres (about 100 feet) away from where another Russian bomb landed in April 2022. Since day one of the full-scale invasion, Russian forces have tried to seize Kharkiv, dispatching armed personnel carriers almost to the city centre. Moscow has deployed strategic bombers, ballistic or cruise missiles, and Iranian or Russian-made drones that only take minutes to reach the city from across the border. Unlike the capital, Kyiv, which received advanced Western air defence systems within months, Kharkiv remains almost defenceless. Residents and authorities have had to adapt quickly as any delays mean lost lives. The city’s subway system served as a 24/7 bomb shelter – and some stations occasionally became classrooms for the schoolchildren waiting out the air raids. Public gatherings, museum exhibitions and even classes in community centres were banned. Gyms and swimming pools warn their patrons about each air raid, but let them decide whether to leave or stay. Daring Ukrainian missile and drone attacks forced Moscow to relocate the strategic bombers to airfields hundreds of kilometres away from the border. They do not cross into Ukrainian airspace any more, but their speed gives an additional boost to the missiles they launch. Each time satellites spot their takeoff, Kharkiv residents receive warnings and information on possible trajectories via Telegram or Viber channels. Old-fashioned air raid sirens also begin howling – but many residents are so used to their high-pitched sound that they simply do not wake up. That is why Tamara Karnaukhova woke up only when her balcony door fell on her bed. The retired 76-year-old did not know whether to stay in her modest one-bedroom apartment in Building 7 or run away. The shockwave crumbled most of the windows and damaged the front door. “I wasn’t scared, I was confused,” she told Al Jazeera. After the blast, she ran downstairs as smoke gushed from broken windows and glass cracked under her feet. While she was at her neighbour’s, marauders sneaked into her apartment, rummaging in the kitchen but taking no valuables. Karnaukhova still cannot fathom why Russia invaded. “Do they need land? Resources?” she wondered aloud. “They already have it all.” When the war began, Valerii Ivakhno joined a volunteer group that rides around in a minivan and hands out hot drinks, snacks and porridge to shelling victims. His 85-year-old mother’s apartment in central Kharkiv was heavily damaged in 2022, and he spent all of his savings to renovate it. But on Tuesday morning, the brand-new windows were knocked out. Luckily, his mother knew the “be between two walls” rule and rushed to the corridor seconds before the shards of glass showered her bed. Ivakhno said he is glad his father did not live to see the invasion. He was buried on February 23, 2022, one day before it began. “Dear God took him away so that he wouldn’t see this shame and horror,” Ivakhno said while pouring porridge into a paper cup and handing it to a rescue worker in central Kharkiv. Each visit to yet another shelled location is a recurring nightmare for his team. “I’ve lost count of how many times we have done it, how many people we’ve helped,” his colleague Svtlana Stetsenko said, standing next to a historic building of a law school damaged by Tuesday’s attack and the resulting fire. The street they were on was named after Alexander Pushkin, Russia’s most celebrated 19th-century poet whose cult is seen by most Ukrainians as “cultural imperialism”. On that very day of the attack, Kharkiv authorities decided to rename the street and the nearby subway station after Ukrainian philosopher and educator Hrigory Skovoroda.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/29/kharkiv-ukraine-intensified-shelling

Ukraine says it uncovers $40m arms corruption scheme,"The Security Service of Ukraine says five charged over plot to embezzle funds earmarked to buy 100,000 mortar shells.","Employees from a Ukrainian arms firm conspired with Ministry of Defence officials to embezzle almost $40m earmarked to buy 100,000 mortar shells for the war with Russia, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has reported. The SBU said late Saturday that five people have been charged, with one person detained while trying to cross the Ukrainian border. If found guilty, they face up to 12 years in prison. The announcement, which was confirmed by Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence, will have a deep impact on a country beleaguered byRussia’s nearly two-year-old invasion. The SBU said an investigation had “exposed officials of the Ministry of Defence and managers of arms supplier Lviv Arsenal, who stole nearly 1.5 billion hryvnias [$40m] in the purchase of shells.” “According to the investigation, former and current high-ranking officials of the Ministry of Defence and heads of affiliated companies are involved in the embezzlement,” the SBU said. The deal involved the purchase of 100,000 mortar shells for the military, with a contract secured in August 2022 and payment made in advance. But no arms were ever provided, the SBU statement said, with some funds then moved to other foreign accounts.    Five people have been given “notices of suspicion” – the first stage in Ukrainian legal proceedings – both in the ministry and the arms supplier, according to the security service’s statement. One suspect, the SBU said, was detained while trying to cross the Ukrainian border. Officials accused of participating in the scheme include the current and former heads of the defence ministry’s Department of Military and Technical Policy, Development of Armaments and Military Equipment, as well as the head of Lviv Arsenal. According to Ukraine’s prosecutor general, the stolen funds have been seized and will be returned to the defence budget. Corruption within Kyiv’s military has been a thorny issue both as it tries to maintain wartime public morale and present itscase to join the European Union. Last September, Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov was dismissed amid various corruption cases. The announcement came as Russia launched drone and missile attacks hitting both civilian and critical infrastructure across Ukraine, Kyiv’s Air Force said on Sunday. The Air Force said Moscow attacked the central Poltava region with two ballistic missiles fired from its Iskander ballistic missile system. It also launched three surface-to-air missiles over the Donetsk region in the east. In the southeast Zaporizhia region, Governor Yuri Malashko said an infrastructure site had been hit in a drone attack. Filip Pronin, governor of the Poltava region, wrote on Telegram that the attack there hit an industrial site in the city of Kremenchuk, igniting a fire. There were no preliminary reports of casualties, Kyiv said.   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/28/ukraine-unearths-40-million-embezzlement-scheme-involving-its-military

Russia’s Putin says ‘obvious’ Ukraine shot down plane over Belgorod,"Moscow and Kyiv trade blame after Ilyushin Il-76 plane crashed, reportedly killing 65 Ukrainian POWs said to be on board.","Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that Ukrainian air defences shot down the Russian military plane that crashed near its border with Ukraine this week. In his first comments about Wednesday’s crash, Putin said that the results of Moscow’s investigation would be published in two to three days, but preliminary results suggested that the missiles that hit the plane were either American or French. Putin also accused Ukraine of knowing that the Ilyushin Il-76 plane was carrying 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war. “I don’t know if they did it on purpose or by mistake, but it is obvious that they did it,” Putin said in televised comments on Friday. “In any case, what happened is a crime. Either through negligence or on purpose, but in any case, it is a crime.” The Russian defence ministry said six Russian crew members and three Russian soldiers were also on board the flight to undertake the latest prisoner swap with Ukraine. Ukraine has not confirmed nor denied whether it shot down the plane and has challenged Moscow’s account of who was on board and what occurred. Kyiv has refuted Moscow’s claim that it was warned that a plane carrying Ukrainian POWs would be flying over Russia’s Belgorod region at that time. It also said there were discrepancies in a list of names published by Russian media of the 65 Ukrainians who were reportedly on board. However, Putin said the plane could not have been brought down by Russian “friendly fire” since its air defence systems have safeguards in place to prevent them from attacking their aircraft. “There are ‘friend or foe’ systems there, and no matter how much the operator presses the button, our air defence systems would not work,” he said.    On Thursday, Ukraine called for an internationalinvestigationinto the blast. “Regarding an international investigation, I believe that we will do our part to make it happen. But I am convinced that … the Russians will make loud statements but will not allow anyone in,” Dmytro Lubinets, the Ukrainian parliament commissioner for human rights, told national television, adding he would send letters to the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross. “They will not hand over any materials for analysis and will simply blame Ukraine,” he added. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also called for an emergency session of the UN Security Council to discuss the downed plane on Thursday. At the session, Moscow and Kyiv both sought to pin the blame on the other. “All of the information that we have today shows that we are dealing with a premeditated, thought-through crime,” said Russia’s deputy ambassador to the UN, Dmitry Polyanskiy, adding that Ukraine’s leaders “knew the route very well, knew about the way the soldiers were going to be transported to the place of exchange”. He accused Kyiv of sacrificing its own troops “to Western geopolitical interests”. Ukraine’s Deputy Ambassador Khrystyna Hayovyshyn in turn rejected the accusation, saying that “Ukraine was not informed about the number of vehicles, roads and means of transportation of the captives”. “This alone may constitute intentional actions by Russia to endanger the lives and safety of the prisoners,” she said.

"‘Propaganda, provocation’: Did Ukraine down a plane with its POWs aboard?","Confusion abounds days after a Russian military jet crashed near the Ukrainian border, reportedly killing dozens of people.","Kyiv, Ukraine –Two days after a Russian military cargo planewas shot downnear the Ukrainian border, unanswered questions loom as Moscow and Kyiv offer starkly conflicting versions – and insufficient proof. Moscow claimed the Il-76, with 65 Ukrainian war prisoners on board, was about to land in the western city of Belgorod on Wednesday in advance of a swap later that day. It purported that Ukrainian air defence forces in the nearby Kharkiv region shot the plane down with two missiles. Russian lawmaker Andrey Kartapolov claimed three missiles were shot either from a US-made Patriot air defence complex or from a German-made Iris T system. “Ukrainian leaders knew very well about the swap, were informed how they prisoners would be delivered, but the Il-76 plane was shot down by three missiles,” he reportedly said. Moscow alleged that all the Ukrainian prisoners, three Russian guards that escorted them, and six crew members had been killed when the plane crashed near the village of Yablonova. The Ukrainska Pravda news website quoted an unnamed military official saying that the downed plane was “their job”, but the laconic report was soon removed. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy did not say who or what could have downed the plane, but called for an internal investigation and accused Russia of “playing with the lives of Ukrainian prisoners”. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov retorted by saying that “if [Zelenksyy] means an international investigation into the criminal actions of the Kyiv regime – then one is indeed needed”. Margarita Simonyan, one of the main Kremlin backers who heads the media network Russia Today, posted the alleged list of 65 POWs on her Telegram channel. Kyiv said that it had planned a prisoner exchange that day, It did not confirm the authenticity of the list shared by Simonyan, but said that one person on it had already been swapped earlier this month. Ukraine insisted Russia provided no information about the plane that in fact had been carrying missiles for S-300 air defence systems. Mobile phone videos presumably shot near the crash site showed the burning plane and traces of smoke allegedly left by a Ukrainian missile. Anothervideoof the plane’s alleged debris showed no traces of bodies. Meanwhile, allegations abounded that Russia would kill captured Ukrainian servicemen kept in Russian prisons and place their remnants in the downed plane’s debris to “provide” proof of Kyiv’s war crime. “They have the prisoners on the ground and would have to kill them, mess up their bodies and mix the remnants with the plane’s debris,” a Ukrainian military official told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity. A top Ukrainian military expert agreed. “To prove their point, Russians may go very far, including the liquidation of these war prisoners and the dismemberment of their bodies,” Lieutenant General Ihor Romanenko, former deputy chief of Ukraine’s general staff of armed forces, told Al Jazeera. He said that there is a “high probability” that Ukrainian air defence forces downed the plane, but there was too little evidence to prove it – and to say for sure who and what was on board the plane before it was shot down. But Romanenko, who spent decades in in air defence forces, said that he had personally seen how two missiles from an S-200 or S-300 complex can fit into an Il-76 cargo plane, a seasoned Soviet warhorse that can carry up to 40 tonnes. He said that Moscow staged a “provocation” with the plane and will hardly agree to conduct an independent investigation. The incident reminded him of the July 17, 2014, downing of the Malaysian MH-17 plane with 298 passengers and crew on board by pro-Moscow separatists in the Donbas region. The separatists and pro-Russian residents in the area said days after the disaster that the CIA “loaded” hundreds of dead and “pre-frozen” bodies onto the plane to “frame” Moscow. An international investigation based on the analysis of wreckage and intercepted phone calls concluded that the plane was destroyed by the Russia-supplied BUK surface-to-air missile. Investigatorssaidlater that there were “strong indications” that Russian President Vladimir Putin approved the delivery of the BUK complex to the separatists. Another Ukrainian analyst said that after losing the plane this week, Russia decided to start a propaganda “campaign” while hiding evidence of what really had happened. “What we see is Russian propaganda statements, an obvious information-psychological campaign against Ukraine and a lack of proof of the Russian version,” Volodymyr Fesenko, head of the Penta think tank in Kyiv, told Al Jazeera. Russia did not present the bodies of the 65 POWs, and Ukrainian intelligence official Andiry Yusov said that only five bodies had been delivered to the Belgorod morgue. Moscow also said that only three guards escorted five dozen war prisoners, something that contradicts information about earlier prisoner swaps when each Russian guard escorted three or four Ukrainians. “There are way too many inconsistencies,” Fesenko said. To him and other observers, Russia’s claim were reminiscent of the July 2022 incident in the Olinivka camp for war prisoners near the Moscow-occupied city of Donetsk. Moscow claimed that Ukraine launched a US-made HIMARS missile that hit the camp killing 62 and wounding 130 Ukrainians. Pro-Kremlin media claimed that Kyiv deliberately killed the POWs who could have testified about the war crimes they had allegedly committed during the 2022 siege of Mariupol. But Moscow refused to allow finding missions sent by the United Nations and the International Red Cross to enter the facility. Meanwhile, media analyses based on satellite imagery and post-explosion photos and videos of the prison indicated that Russia’s claims were fabricated and the building was destroyed by a bomb blown up inside the building. However, an international observer offered a sobering explanation of how the latest disaster could have been caused by a dire lack of coordination between Ukrainian military agencies. “One military agency was preparing the usually-secret prisoner swap. Another military agency in a no-less-secret mode moved a Patriot or something similar to the Russian border because it knew that something big and heavy was flying beyond it,” Nikolay Mitrokhin of Germany’s Bremen University told Al Jazeera. “And as soon as they saw [the Il-76 plane] on their monitors, it didn’t occur to anyone to call Kyiv and ask whether a prisoner swap was in the works and could [the prisoners] be on that plane,” he said. Meanwhile, a Russian lawmaker claimed that some of the Ukrainian war prisoners on the plane had lambasted Kyiv’s war policies, and that Kyiv deliberately destroyed the plane to warn Ukrainian servicemen not to surrender. “Ukraine created the provocation deliberately so that its nationals don’t surrender,” Russian lawmaker Aleksey Zhuravlyov reportedly said on Wednesday.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/26/propaganda-provocation-did-ukraine-down-a-plane-with-servicemen-aboard

Russian court jails woman for 27 years over killing of pro-Kremlin blogger,"Darya Trepova was found guilty of killing Vladlen Tatarsky, who died in a blast at a St Petersburg cafe in April 2023.","A Russian court has sentenced antiwar activist Darya Trepova to 27 years in prison for killing a prominent ultra-nationalist blogger in an attack that Moscow said was orchestrated by Ukraine. In April last year, Vladlen Tatarskywas killed in a St Petersburg cafeafter Trepova gave him a miniature statue rigged with explosives. As he accepted the gift, the outspoken commentator was killed on the spot. The court in St Petersburg convicted Trepova on “terrorism” charges on Thursday. The 26-year-old defended herself saying she did not purposefully kill Tatarsky, whose real name is Maxim Fomin, but was induced to believe the object she handed him was a secret listening device. Earlier this week, the activist told the court she was acting under orders from a man in Ukraine whom she knew as “Gestalt” (German for “Shape”), who had been sending her money and instructions for several months. “I feel great pain and shame that my gullibility and my naivety led to such catastrophic consequences. I didn’t want to hurt anyone,” Trepova said. Her decision to collaborate with Ukrainians was motivated by her opposition toRussia’s military offensive in Ukraine, she said. More than 30 other people were injured in the blast, which tore off the facade of the St Petersburg cafe. Tremova told the court she had explicitly asked her handler in Ukraine if the statue was a bomb. “I was very scared and asked Gestalt: ‘Isn’t this the same as with Daria Dugina?’” she said, referring to the daughter of an influential pro-war Russian nationalistwho was assassinatedin a car bombing attack in the Russian capital in 2022. Tatarsky was an influential military blogger, one of the most prominent among a group of hardline correspondents that have gained a huge following since Russia launched its offensive in Ukraine in February 2022. They publish exclusive information about the campaign from front-line sources and occasionally criticise Moscow’s military tactics, pushing for a more aggressive assault. Born in eastern Ukraine, Tatarsky was a convicted bank robber who escaped from prison to fight with Russian-backed separatists against Ukraine’s armed forces when the conflict in the east first broke out in 2014. He advocated for a much more aggressive military campaign against Ukraine. Putin posthumously bestowed a top award, the Order of Courage, on Tatarsky, citing his “courage and bravery shown during professional duty”. After his murder, Russian authorities accused Ukraine of orchestrating the killing. Senior Ukrainian officials have neither claimed responsibility nor denied involvement, with presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak describing it as “internal terrorism”. Moscow has accused Ukraine of staging several attacks and assassinations inside Russia, including the killing of Dugina and the failed car bombing attack against pro-Kremlin writer Zakhar Prilepin.

Swedish PM Kristersson agrees to meet Hungary’s Orban for talks on NATO bid,"After ratification by Turkey, Hungary is the only country left effectively holding up Sweden’s NATO membership.","Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson has agreed to meet his counterpart from Hungary, the only NATO member yet to ratify his country’smembership in the military alliance. Swedish public television on Thursday published a letter Kristersson penned to Prime Minister Viktor Orban in which he said he accepted an invitation received this week to meet in Budapest “at a time convenient for both of us”. “The completion of the ratification process of Sweden’s NATO membership in the Hungarian parliament will create a solid foundation to move ahead in our bilateral relationship, and to reinforce mutual understanding and trust,” Kristersson said in the letter. He added that “a more intensive dialogue between our countries would be beneficial”, noting they would also have the opportunity to speak in Brussels on February 1 at a meeting of the European Council. The publication of the letter comes a day after Turkey’s parliamentapprovedSweden’s NATO membership. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is expected to add his signature in the coming days. Kristersson said after the vote in Ankara that Sweden was “one step closer” to joining the alliance. In a post on X on the same day, Orban wrote that his country supports Sweden’s membership and said he would urge lawmakers to approve its accession quickly.

Moreover, I do not think there is an extraordinary situation,” Kover said. Finland became the 31st memberof the alliance in April, which doubled the length of NATO’s border with Russia. It also  strengthened the defences of three small Baltic countries that joined the bloc after the collapse of the Soviet Union more than three decades ago. Sweden and Finland both had a lengthy history of military non-alignment harkening back to the Cold War. However,Russia’s invasionof Ukraine rocked ties on the continent and changed their policy.

Russia jails nationalist critic Igor Girkin for four years over ‘extremism’,Igor Girkin has accused President Vladimir Putin and the army top brass of not pursuing the Ukraine war effectively enough.,"A court in Russia has convicted prominent nationalist and former rebel commander Igor Girkin of “inciting extremism” and sentenced him to four years in a penal colony. Girkin has repeatedly criticised the Kremlin for its war strategy in Ukraine after Russia’s invasion in February 2022. The Moscow City Court on Thursdaysaid Girkin was guiltyof “public calls to carry out extremist activities”. Also known as Igor Strelkov, Girkin has accused President Vladimir Putin and army top brass of not pursuing theUkraine wareffectively enough. “I serve the Fatherland!” Girkin shouted after the verdict was read out. His followers had gathered outside the court and three of them were detained by police, the AFP news agency reported. “The accusation is absolutely absurd,” said his wife Miroslava Reginskaya. His lawyer Alexander Molokhov called the sentence “an ugly judicial act” that would be appealed immediately. Girkin’s case has been closely watched as an indication of how far the Kremlin would tolerate aggressive criticism of its war effort in Ukraine. Since the start of the conflict, described by Russia as a “special military operation”, the Kremlin has focused on persecuting antiwar activists. He was remanded in custody in July last year after setting up the “Club of Angry Patriots” to save Russia from what he said was the danger of systemic turmoil due to military failures in Ukraine and jostling in the elite to eventually succeed Putin. In one of his most outspoken rants in a post on July 18 on his Telegram channel, followed by more than 760,000 people, Girkin hurled personal insults at Putin and urged him to pass power “to someone truly capable and responsible”. A former officer for Russia’s FSB security service and battlefield commander, Girkin helped Russia to annexCrimea in 2014and, soon after, to organise pro-Russian militias who wrested part of eastern Ukraine out of Kyiv’s control – events that started the current conflict. He was handed a life sentence in absentia by a Dutch court in 2022 for his alleged role in the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flightMH17over eastern Ukraine in 2014, in which all 298 passengers and crew were killed.

Ukraine to probe Belgorod crash as Russia questions future prisoner swaps,"Russia claims Ukraine shot down military transport plane in Belgorod, killing 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war on board.","Ukraine has opened a criminal investigation into the downing of a Russian military transport plane that Moscow said killed 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) as the Kremlin raised questions about future prisoner exchanges. On Thursday, the Kremlin said that nobody could say how the IL-76 Russian Air Force plane crash in the Belgorod region would affect prisoner swaps shortly after Ukraine’s PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyaccused Russia of “playing with the lives” of prisoners. Ukraine has not said whether its captured soldiers were killed – or if it was involved – in Wednesday’s shooting down of the plane. In launching the probe, its SBU security service on Thursday said it was “currently taking a range of measures to clarify all the circumstances of the downing”. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called the incident a “monstrous act”. “Nobody can tell you how it would affect the prospects for extending this [exchange] process,” he was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. Russia hasaccused Ukraineof deliberately shooting down the aircraft carrying 65 POWs, six Russian crew members and three Russian soldiers as it travelled to Belgorod, near the border with Ukraine, on Wednesday. While Zelenskyy did not confirm or deny Russia’s claims in his Wednesday address, he said it had been a “very difficult day”. He also called for an international inquiry. “We need to establish all the clear facts. As much as possible, given that the downing of the plane occurred on Russian territory, which is beyond our control,” he said. Al Jazeera’s Rob McBride, reporting from Kyiv, said: “Establishing the truth has been made harder by the secrecy surrounding the highly sensitive exchanges of Russian and Ukrainian prisoners.” A video posted on Telegram by Baza, a channel linked to Russian security services, showed a large aircraft falling and exploding in a vast fireball. According to the Russian Ministry of Defence, the plane was hit as it was travelling from Moscow to Belgorod. Located 40km (25 miles) north of the border with Ukraine,Belgorod has been targetedin recent weeks by Ukrainian air strikes. The ministry claimed, without offering evidence, that radars had detected the launch of two Ukrainian missiles. Russian rescue services cited by the RIA Novosti news agency reported that both black boxes had been recovered from the plane. Russia’s claims were immediately treated with deep suspicion by Ukraine, which accuses it of conducting longstanding disinformation campaigns, said McBride. “Officially Ukraine says it has no evidence of its prisoners of war being on the plane, but a statement by military intelligence has hinted that if they were on board, Russia is responsible for their safety,” he added. “Kyiv also blamed Moscow for not informing it of transport arrangements for [the] prisoner swap and for flying POWs so close to an active war zone,” McBride reported. Ukraine’s GUR military intelligence agency had confirmed a swap was meant to take place, but said it had not been told of how Russia would bring the prisoners to the handover point and said Ukraine had not been asked to ensure airspace security around Belgorod. “On this basis, we may be talking about planned and deliberate actions by Russia to destabilise the situation in Ukraine and weaken international support for our state,” GUR said in a statement on Telegram. This month Russia and Ukraineexchanged hundreds of POWsin the biggest single release of captives since Russia’s invasion began in February 2022. Ukrainian officials said that 230 of its prisoners were released while Russia said 248 of its soldiers were returned after mediation by the United Arab Emirates. While the two sides have gone through several exchanges during the war, swap deals stalled in the latter half of last year. The latest exchange was the first in almost five months. Russian lawmaker Andrei Kartapolov on Thursday toned down the Kremlin’s statement on prisoner swaps, saying that Russia would talk with “even the devil” to bring back its captured soldiers, according to Interfax.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/25/ukraine-probes-plane-crash-accuses-russia-of-playing-with-lives-of-pows

Russian lawmakers approve bill to seize property from army critics,"The State Duma, parliament’s lower house, approved the bill by a 395-3 vote in the first of three required readings.","Russian lawmakers have approved a bill to confiscate properties, money and valuables of anyone convicted of spreading criticism of the Russian army. The State Duma, parliament’s lower house, passed the bill with 395 votes for and three against on Wednesday in the first of three required readings. Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin, who co-authoredthe bill, told lawmakers that the measure was “not enough” to stop the army’s critics. “They live comfortably, renting out property, continuing to receive royalties at the expense of Russian citizens. They use these funds to support the Nazi regime,” Volodin said. “The decision adopted should stop those who commit crimes against the security of our country, who consider it possible to insult our citizens, soldiers and officers, and who support the Nazis,” he added. Since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Moscow has banned any criticism of its military operation and detained thousands of Russians opposing the war. The current charge of spreading “false information” about the army carries ajail sentenceof up to 15 years. Information about the war in Ukraine that does not come from an official source may be deemed “false”. Several writers and activists have received long sentences due to the law, and some have been added to a list of “extremists and terrorists”. But the latest measure aims to further penalise those who speak up about the army and could affect Russians who have fled the country. Russian officials had for months been calling for stricter laws on those who speak critically about the situation in Ukraine, denouncing them as “traitors”. “We are showing goodwill that we are doing this only two years in,” said Andrey Lugovoy, a deputy from Russia’s right-wing Liberal Democratic Party of Russia. Lawmakers also decided to adopt a resolution condemning France for having “mercenaries” in Ukraine after days of tension between the two countries. Last week, Moscow summoned the French ambassador over what it said was Paris’s “growing involvement in the Ukraine conflict”. However, France has denied the allegation and said it has no mercenaries in the war or “anywhere else” and that the claims were part of a disinformation campaign.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/24/russian-lawmakers-approve-bill-to-seize-property-from-army-critics
Drones attack deep in Russia as Medvedev threatens Ukraine’s ‘existence’,"Ukraine attacks military and energy infrastructure in at least three cities deep inside Russia, showing new drone capabilities.","Russia and Ukraine traded deadly aerial attacks on civilian centres in the past week of the war, but Ukraine also scored hits on military and economic infrastructure deep in the Russian heartland, extending its reach to St Petersburg for the first time. Ukrainian military intelligence said it had struck an unspecified military target in St Petersburg on Thursday, using drones launched from Ukrainian soil. Ukrainian strategic industries minister Oleksandr Kamyshin confirmed the attack, telling theWorld Economic Forum in Davosthat the attack was carried out by a Ukrainian-built drone that had travelled 1,250km (780 miles) from Ukrainian soil. Russia’s defence ministry said three drones had been launched and it had downed all three over the Gulf of Finland that day, one near an oil terminal. On Sunday, Ukraine attacked again in several locations, and this time, the evidence of its success was clear. Russian gas producer Novatek said it was suspending operations at a plant and loading terminal in the port of Ust-Luga near St Petersburg, following a fire, which Ukrainian media credited to due to a drone attack, citing Security Service (SBU) sources. Novatek said it had resumed loading on Wednesday, but plant operations could take weeks or months to return to normal, analysts said. This meant the company would lose money, exporting low-value gas condensate rather than processed naphtha, jet fuel and gasoil. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said aerial defences were being strengthened following the attack. Ukraine also claimed to have attacked the Shcheglovsky Val plant in Tula, 150km (93 miles) south of Moscow, which reportedly manufactures the Pantsir-S and Pantsir-S1 air defence systems. Geolocated footage also showed smoke rising from the city of Smolensk, near the Russian border with Belarus, suggesting a possible third attack that day. Ukraine has been developing its own long-range aerial and surface drones at least since the middle of last year, when it attacked several military targets in Crimea and the Black Sea. Unlike donated Western weapons, they do not carry restrictions about their use on Russian soil. Ukrainian National Defence and Security Council Secretary Oleksiy Danilov claimed that Ukraine was among the top three drone manufacturers in the world. Ukraine is suspected of being responsible for the shelling of Donetsk city in its occupied east, which killedat least 27 peopleon Sunday, although it did not claim the attack. Russia has routinely targeted Ukrainian cities, and did so again with deadly results. Kharkiv bore the heaviest toll. Russian missiles killed 18 people and injured an estimated 130 in various cities on Tuesday, but eight of the dead were in Kharkiv, said its mayor, which suffered three waves of attacks. At least 100 high-rise blocks had been hit in the city. Ukraine defended its airspace from the repeated attacks. It shot down 19 out of 20 Shahed drones last Wednesday, 22 out of 33 drones on Thursday, and four out of seven drones on Saturday. In each case, Russia also used a small number of missiles, as it has been doing for months, copying a Ukrainian tactic designed to overload air defence systems. A Pentagon official said these were probing attacks as Russia looked for weaknesses in defences. “They’ve not succeeded so far. Ukrainians have a lot of experience over the last few years on how to cope with these kinds of Russian assaults,” Celeste Wallander, an assistant secretary of defense, told reporters. What made Tuesday’s attack different was that Russia used no drones. It launched 44 missiles of various types, half of which Ukraine intercepted, mostly over Kyiv. Ukraine’s Western allies continued to pledge weapons and ammunition, forecasting a third year of war, as defiant Russian rhetoric left little hope of negotiations any time soon. “The existence of Ukraine is mortally dangerous for Ukrainians,” wrote Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia’s powerful Security Council, on the Telegram messaging app. “The presence of an independent state on historical Russian territories will now be a constant reason for the resumption of hostilities,” he said, elucidating an irredentist policy towards all of Ukraine. “There is a 100 percent probability of a new conflict,” Medvedev said, even if Ukraine entered the EU and NATO. “This could happen in ten or fifty years.” Some in Europe took Russia at its word. “We hear threats from the Kremlin almost every day … so we have to take into account that Vladimir Putin might even attack a NATO country one day,” German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius told Tagesspiegel. “Our experts expect a period of five to eight years in which this could be possible,” Pistorius said. It was the latest in a series of ominous warnings. NATO’s military committeechief calledfor a “warfighting transformation” of NATO two weeks ago. And the commander-in-chief of Sweden, which came a step closer to NATO membership when Turkey’s parliament ratified its bid on Tuesday, last week told Swedes to prepare for war. Even Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who as recently as last September was saying Russia was ready for talks, said Russia “will achieve the goals of its ‘special military operation’ consistently and persistently.” Accordingly, Western governments have been stepping up ammunition production. Varying estimates give Russia an advantage of between 5:1 and 10:1 in artillery shells. There is concern that disparity could harm Ukraine’s stout defence. During the past week, for example, Ukraine has retreated some hundreds of yards in Kharkiv, where Russia has been assaulting the front lines relentlessly.    European internal market commissioner Thierry Breton said on Saturday that EU defence industries would be capable of producing a million artillery shells a year by April, up to 1.4 million by the end of the year and more next year. Defence industries have complained that they cannot increase production unless governments provide long-term contracts, and NATO on Tuesday made up for some of this shortfall with a $1.2bn contract to two manufacturers for 200,000 rounds of artillery ammunition. The NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA) struck the deal on behalf of allies who will either pass on the shells to Ukraine or use them to stock up their own depleted inventories. Polandbecame the latest EU member to sign a bilateral 2024 defence agreement with Ukraine on Monday, following Germany, Estonia and Latvia. Germany announced it would provide six Sea King helicopters to monitor coastal waters. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he expected a number of “strong” defence packages for Ukraine to be signed “on specific dates” this month and next These bilateral agreements have ignored a Hungarian veto to a four-year, 50-billion-euro EU financial support plan for Ukraine, and a 20-billion-euro defence support plan this year that would reimburse members for some of their donations. European lawmakers also took a step towards depriving Hungary of its voting rights in the EU last Thursday [January 18] when they asked the European Council of government leaders to look into whether Hungary had “committed serious and persistent breaches of EU values”. Suspending a member’s vote is possible under Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union, but it has never been invoked before.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/24/drones-strike-deep-in-russia-as-medvedev-threatens-ukraines-existence
Zelenskyy says Russia ‘playing with lives’ of Ukrainian POWs after crash,"Comments come after Russia accused Ukraine of shooting down transport plane, killing 65 Ukrainian POWs on board.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused Russia of “playing with the lives of Ukrainian prisoners” over the crash of a military transport plane that Moscow blamed on Ukraine. The Ilyushin Il-76 came down in the Russian border region of Belgorod on Wednesday, killing everyone on board. The Russian Ministry of Defence said 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) were on the plane in preparation for a prisoner swap, as well as six Russian crew and three Russian soldiers. “It is obvious that the Russians are playing with the lives of Ukrainian prisoners, with the feelings of their relatives and with the emotions of our society,” Zelenskyy said in his Wednesday evening address. He did not confirm or deny Russia’s claims, but said it had been a “very difficult day”. “We need to establish all the clear facts. As much as possible, given that the downing of the plane occurred on Russian territory, which is beyond our control,” he said. According to the Russian Ministry of Defence, the plane was hit as it was travelling from a military aerodrome near Moscow to Belgorod. Close to the border with Ukraine, Belgorod has been targeted in recent weeks by Ukrainian air strikes. The ministry claimed, without offering evidence, that radars had detected the launch of two Ukrainian missiles.    “On board were 65 captured Ukrainian army servicemen being transported to the Belgorod region for exchange, six crew members and three escorts,” state news agency RIA Novosti quoted the defence ministry as saying. It did not provide any evidence for the claim. A few hours afterwards, the Ukrainian military said it had noticed more Russian military transport aircraft landing in Belgorod, something it linked to continued Russian missile strikes on Kharkiv and other Ukrainian cities. “Ukraine has the right to defend itself and destroy the means of the aggressors’ aerial attack,” said Air Force Commander Mykola Oleshchuk. The Kremlin told reporters that it was investigating the reports on the plane, as Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called for an urgent meeting of the United Nations Security Council, saying Russia aimed to establish “the reasons behind the Ukrainian criminal act”. A French spokesperson at the UN said the meeting would be held at 5pm (22:00 GMT) on Thursday. Zelenskyy also called for an international investigation into the crash. Ukraine’s intelligence agency said in a statement it had no “reliable or comprehensive information” on who was on board the plane or in what number”. Andriy Yusov, a representative of the Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence, said that an exchange of prisoners between Russia and Ukraine had been prepared for Wednesday, Ukraine’s state broadcaster Suspilne reported, citing Radio Free Europe, a media outlet based in the Czech Republic. Yusov added that the prisoner exchange would not be going ahead. Military intelligence also said that Ukraine had not been asked to ensure airspace security around Belgorod in contrast to previous swaps and had not been informed about what means of transport would be used and which routes. “On this basis, we may be talking about planned and deliberate actions by Russia to destabilise the situation in Ukraine and weaken international support for our state,” it said in a statement on Telegram. A video posted on Telegram by Baza, a channel linked to Russian security services, showed a large aircraft falling and exploding in a fireball. Regional Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on social media that investigators and emergency workers had already arrived at a site in the Korochansky, a district in Belgorod Oblast. “The plane fell in a field near a populated area. Everyone on board died,” Gladkov said on his Telegram channel. The Il-76 is designed to airlift troops, cargo, military equipment and weapons. It usually has a crew of five and can carry as many as 90 passengers.  Kharkiv and Kyiv came under Russian aerial assault on Tuesday,killing at least 18 people. In December, Russia accused Ukraine of carrying out a “terrorist attack” on civilians in the city of Belgorod, after25 peoplewere killed. Last week, the Kremlin accused Kyiv ofkilling 27 peoplein an attack on the Russian-occupied Ukrainian city of Donetsk.

At least 18 killed in wave of Russian missile attacks on Ukraine,Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy promises strong response as rescuers scour rubble for survivors in sub-zero temperatures.,"At least 18 people have been killed and more than 130 injured after Russia hit Ukraine’s biggest cities with waves of missiles. Speaking in a sombre evening address, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia had launched some 40 missiles of varying types. More than 200 sites were hit, including 139 homes, with many deaths in “an ordinary high-rise apartment building”, Zelenskyy said. “Ordinary people lived there.” He promised a strong response. “The Russian war will inevitably be brought back home, back to where this evil came from, where it must be quelled,” he said. The northeastern city of Kharkiv suffered three waves of attacks. There were also attacks on the capital Kyiv and in central Ukraine while the southern region of Kherson was subject to constant shelling. Oleksandra Terekhovich ran into the corridor of her home in Kharkiv when she heard the first explosion. The second blast hit the building next door, shattering her windows and door, she said. “There are no more tears. Our country has been going through what has been happening for two years now. We live with horror inside of us,” she told the AFP news agency. The relentless Russian bombardment has kept Ukrainians on edge while the 1,500km (930 mile) front line, where soldiers are engaged in trench and artillery warfare, has barely moved. Analysts say Russia stockpiled missiles at the end of last year in preparation for the latest campaign that a US official said was an attempt to probe the weaknesses in Ukraine’s air defences. Kharkiv regional Governor Oleh Syniehubov said more than 100 high-rise apartment blocks had been damaged in the first two attacks on the city, with Russia using S-300, Kh-32 and hypersonic Iskander missiles. An attack later on Tuesday evening also hit a residential building and other infrastructure, causing more injuries. The city’s mayor, Ihor Terekhov, said people were trapped in the rubble with temperatures at -7C (19.4F). In Kyiv, emergency services said the destruction spread across four districts. At one site, rescuers tended to dazed and groaning residents as workers swept away debris and broken glass. “There was a very loud bang, and my mother was already running outside, shouting that we need to leave. We all went to the corridor,” 21-year-old Daniel Boliukh told the Reuters news agency. “Then, we went on the balcony to have a look and saw all these buildings were on fire.” Emergency services said apartment buildings as well as medical and educational institutions were damaged in the capital. Some of the damage occurred next to the United Nations office, resident coordinator Denise Brown said in a statement. Pavlohrad, an industrial city in the eastern Dnipro region, also came under attack. One person was killed and two schools and eight high-rise buildings were damaged, according to the presidential office. Ukraine’s General Staff said the country’s armed forces had destroyed 22 of the missiles with nearly 20 shot down over Kyiv, the city’s military administration said. The recent Russian attacks represent “an alarming reversal” of a trend last year, which saw a drop in civilian casualties from Kremlin attacks, according to the UN. More than 10,000 civilians have been killed and nearly 20,000 injured since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, the UN said. The Kremlin denied it targeted civilians in Wednesday’s bombardment. The Russian defence ministry said the raids had struck companies producing missiles, explosives and ammunition.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/24/at-least-18-killed-in-wave-of-russian-missile-attacks-on-ukraine

Ukraine war ‘a battle of ammo’ says NATO as it agrees huge arms deal,Alliance seeks to bulk up Ukraine’s dwindling arsenal as Russia ramps up attacks.,"NATO has signed a large ammunition deal that it says would help it supply Ukraine with desperately needed stocks. The military alliance announced on Tuesday that it has signed a deal worth 1.1 billion euros ($1.2bn) to buy artillery shells. The move comes amid intensified exchanges of fire between Russia and Ukraine since the end of last year, which have depleted the latter’s weapons stockpiles. NATO greenlit the purchase of 220,000 rounds of 155mm ammunition, the most widely sought-after artillery shell, noting that bulk buying for member states should ensure lower prices. Sources said the ammunition would be supplied by French arms maker Nexter and Germany’s Junghans. “This is important to defend our own territory, to build up our own stocks, but also to continue to support Ukraine,” said NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. “The war in Ukraine has become a battle of ammunition,” he told reporters. “We cannot allow President [Vladimir] Putin to win in Ukraine … That would be a tragedy for the Ukrainians and dangerous for all of us.” As progress on the front line has stalled in recent months, Russia and Ukraine have doubled down on exchanges of fire using artillery, missiles and drones. However, Russia’s arms industry far outweighs Ukraine’s and Kyiv isstruggling to secureboth financing and weapons supplies from its Western allies needed to continue competing with Moscow’s firepower. According to European Union estimates, Ukraine was firing approximately 4,000 to 7,000 artillery shells each day last summer, while Russia was launching more than 20,000 shells daily in its neighbour’s territory. Drawing on its deep stockpiles, Russia has in recent weeksconcentrated on air raidsin a bid to drain Ukraine’s air defence systems. Officials in Kyiv say Russia launched 500 drones and missiles between December 29 and January 2. Ukraine and its allies are scrambling to keep up. Kyiv has said it intends to produce one million drones in 2024. Although the European Union fell short of its pledge to supply one million artillery rounds in 2023, officials have said that they expect the European defence industry to raise production by the end of this year. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Monday was the latest foreign leader to visit the country, announcing a loan to buy larger weapons and commitments on joint manufacturing. However, NATO noted that the shells bought under the new deal will not arrive for two to three years. And the United States, Ukraine’s main supplier, is currently unable to send Ukraine any ammunition or weapons as it waits for approval from Congress on budgetary needs. Russia launched its latest air assault against Ukraine on Tuesday, killing at least seven people, according to the UN and Ukrainian authorities. Ukraine said that the air raids included more than 40 ballistic, cruise, antiaircraft and guided missiles, in what the United Nations said appeared to be the heaviest bombardment since early January, when hundreds of Ukrainian civilians were killed. The recent Russian bombardment was “an alarming reversal” of a trend last year that saw a drop in civilian casualties from Kremlin attacks, the UN said. More than 10,000 civilians have been killed and nearly 20,000 injured since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, the UN said. Tuesday’s onslaught in Kharkiv, in northeastern Ukraine, killed six people and injured 57, including eight children, the UN said. The missiles damaged about 30 residential buildings and shattered hundreds of windows in icy weather, regional governor Oleh Syniehubov said. Russia used S-300, Kh-32 and hypersonic Iskander missiles in the attack, he said. A five-storey apartment building appeared to have been directly hit by several missiles around dawn, the UN Human Rights Mission in Ukraine said in a statement. An unknown number of people were trapped in the rubble with the temperature falling to minus seven degrees Celsius (19 degrees Fahrenheit), said Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov. Kharkiv, about 30 kilometres (18 miles) from the border, has often felt the brunt of Russia’s winter campaign of long-range attacks that often hit civilian areas. Four districts of Kyiv came under an attack that injured at least 20 people, including a 13-year-old boy, according to Mayor Vitalii Klitschko. Officials corrected initial reports that a civilian had been killed in the capital, saying the wounded person was hospitalised on life support. UN staff visited a Kyiv neighbourhood with a damaged residential building, a school, a sports centre and a kindergarten. A missile also killed a 43-year-old woman and damaged two schools and eight high-rise buildings in Pavlohrad, an industrial city in the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region, the country’s presidential office said. In Balakliya, in the Kharkiv region, an 88-year-old man and a 78-year-old woman were rescued from the rubble of a house after Russian shelling, it said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/23/nato-head-warns-war-in-ukraine-a-battle-of

Russian lawmakers consider bill to seize property of Ukraine war critics,The bill would allow the state to seize property from Russians who might have left the country and criticised the war in Ukraine.,"Russia’s parliament has begun considering abillthat would give the state the power to seize the property of those convicted of defamation of the security forces. “The State Duma has introduced amendments to the Criminal and Criminal Procedure Codes on the confiscation of property for public calls for activities directed against the security of the state, for discrediting the army and a number of other articles,” a statement by the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, said on Monday. The statement said multiple officials, including Vyacheslav Volodin, the speaker of the State Duma, co-authored the bill. The bill would allow the state to seize property from Russians who might have left the country and have criticised the war in Ukraine but still rely on revenue from renting out their houses or apartments in Russia. Since the beginning of the war in February 2022, criticising what Moscow calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine has effectively become a crime. Still, the new bill aims to make penalties harsher. Volodin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, has called the new bill “the scoundrel law”. “Everyone who tries to destroy Russia, betrays it, must suffer the deserved punishment and compensate for the damage inflicted on the country at the cost of their property,” Volodin said. He added that under the law, those found guilty of “discrediting” the army also face being stripped of honorary titles. The existing law against “discrediting” the Russian military, which covers offences such as “justifying terrorism” and spreading “fake news” about the army, is regularly used to target Putin’s critics. Multiple activists, bloggers and other Russians have received lengthy jail terms due to the law. Last month, Russian state media reported that one of the country’s best-selling novelists, Boris Akunin, had been charged under the law and added to a register of “extremists and terrorists”. Another famous writer, Dmitry Glukhovsky, was given an eight-year sentence in absentia after a Moscow court found him guilty of spreading false information about the army in August.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/22/russian-lawmakers-consider-bill-to-seize-property-of-ukraine-war-critics
Poland’s Tusk says Ukraine-Russia war a fight ‘between good and evil’,Donald Tusk meets President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv as Ukraine’s war with Russia nears two years.,"Poland’s Prime Minister Donald Tusk has promised to keep supporting Ukraine against Russia’s invasion and to resolve differences between Warsaw and Kyiv over grain shipments and trucking that soured ties between the neighbours. “Poland will do everything to increase Ukraine’s chances of victory in this war,” Tusk said at a joint media briefing with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv on Monday. “I am not ashamed to use these big words: it is here, in Ukraine, that the world front between good and evil runs,” he added. Tusk and Zelenskyy also hailed plans between their countries for joint arms production. On the social media platform X, Zelenskyy said that they had discussed “a new form of cooperation aimed at larger-scale arms purchases for Ukrainian needs.” Today, we had very productive talks in Kyiv with@DonaldTuskabout all aspects of Ukrainian-Polish bilateral relations. We appreciate Poland's unwavering support and the new military aid package for Ukraine, as well as a new form of cooperation aimed at larger-scale arms…pic.twitter.com/m5QCm67acD — Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa)January 22, 2024  Warsaw has emerged as a key ally for Kyiv as it defends itself against Russia and seeks more financial and military support from Western partners. Poland has also taken in more than one million Ukrainian refugees. Relations between the two had deteriorated last year as economic competition from Ukrainian food producers and truckers angered Poles who said their livelihoods were under threat. Polish farmers and truckers blocked border crossings, causing backups and threatening the flow of some aid to Ukraine. Polish farmers complained that imports of Ukrainian foods had caused prices to fall, hurting their incomes, while truckers said they were being undercut by their Ukrainian counterparts. The issue surfaced during the war as Ukrainian ports were blocked and food producers turned to road routes through Europe to get their products to market. The Polish truckersagreed last weekto suspend protests, which had been aimed at revoking Ukrainian truckers’ permit-free access to the European Union, until March 1. “There are some conflicts of interest, we know it well, and we will talk about them, but not only in the spirit of friendship, which is obvious, but with the attitude to solve these problems as soon as possible, not to maintain or multiply them,” Tusk said, according to comments released by his office. Tusk’s visit coincides with Ukraine’s Unity Day holiday, which celebrates the unification of western and eastern Ukraine in 1919. The visit also came as Zelenskyy announced draft legislation that could pave the way for foreigners fighting against Russia in his country to receive Ukrainian citizenship. The bill would formally allow Ukrainians to gain dual citizenship, with the exception of Russia. Thousands of foreigners rushed at the beginning of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to help fend off Moscow’s forces trying to wrest control of the country and topple Ukraine’s leadership. Meanwhile, the Kremlin on Monday blamed Ukraine for anattackthat started a fire over the weekend at a gas terminal at the Baltic port of Ust-Luga, more than 850km (530 miles) from the Ukraine border.    The gas facility belonging to Novatek, Russia’s largest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG), was set ablaze on Sunday in the western port town, close to Russia’s border with Estonia. “The Kyiv regime continues to show its bestial face. They are striking civil infrastructure, people,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday when asked about the incident. Tusk’s visit came a day after Moscow-installed officials in eastern Ukraine reported that Ukrainian shellingkilled at least 27 peopleon the outskirts of a Russian-occupied city. Peskov called the shelling outside Donetsk a “monstrous terrorist act”. The Ukrainian military denied it had anything to do with the attack. The two sides’ claims could not immediately be verified. Ukraine’s allies have in recent weeks sought to reassure the country that they are committed to its long-term defence against the Kremlin’s forces amid concerns that Western support could be sagging. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and France’s new Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne also travelled to Kyiv recently.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/22/poland-pm-visits-ukraine-in-latest-show-of-solidarity-in-war-against-russia

Since the invasion of Ukraine, he has seen his homeland as a villainous state bound to follow the path of Nazi Germany, a country with no future and one he wanted nothing to do with. But even in Tbilisi, Georgia’s capital and his adopted home, Russia kept haunting him. His passport and language identify him as a citizen of an aggressor state – someone who preferred to leave than confront the government. He has also been seen as someone who did not react when Russia was becoming the country it is now. “I understand perfectly well the general hatred for Russians and for everything Russian. I accept and understand it because what Russia is doing is wrong,” Kosgorov told Al Jazeera. “Every time I want to say that it’s difficult for the Russians who left, something inside me protests, because Ukrainians have it more difficult than us.” According to estimates, up to one million out of some 144 million Russians left the country in 2022 and 2023 in what has been the largest brain drain since the collapse of the Soviet Union. In a newstudy, based on several rounds of interviews with close to 10,000 Russian political exiles, Russian researchers Ivetta Sergeeva and Emil Kamalov found that 49 percent of respondents felt strong guilt for the war, while 59 percent felt strongly responsible for it. As the research suggests, most Russians left because of their opposition to the war in Ukraine and the ever-present narratives that portrayed Russia as a noble country fighting against Ukrainian “fascists”. They also expected further army mobilisation drives, further internal repressions, and a potential economic crisis. The research was conducted in waves, in March 2022, September 2022 and in May–July 2023. The department of political and social sciences at the European University Institute in Florence provided funding for preliminary work. Many decided to settle in countries from the former Soviet bloc, which continue having favourable regulations for Russians to live and work. Countries like Georgia, Armenia and Kazakhstan have already felt the economic and demographic effects of the mass influx of Russians, including rising prices. To many locals, it also brought back memories of Russia’s colonial past. But as the study suggests, fleeing Russia was not enough to escape its long shadow, as Kosgorov has found out. After a few months in Tbilisi, he opened UGallery, a bar with an art space where he hosts antiwar-themed exhibitions and organises fundraisers for Ukraine. But he has struggled to find peace. “I no longer have a country, I no longer have a homeland,” Kosgorov said. “This is a trivial, simple thing. But what I want is to feel the ground under my feet, and to understand what tomorrow will bring.” He donates his revenues to NGOs supporting Ukrainian refugees and has gathered a large community of like-minded people, but he knows that not everyone in Georgia welcomes the Russian arrivals; anti-Russian messages can be found graffitied on walls all around Tbilisi. But Kosgorov does not complain, because he does not feel he has a right to. He does acknowledge, however, that some of the criticism Russian exiles receive abroad is ill-founded. One of the arguments that he often hears is that they should all return home and dethrone President Vladimir Putin in a mass revolution. “If you look at the history, peaceful protests seldom brought autocracies down, contrary to military coups. Putin will not disappear from the simple fact that all these migrants who had left go back to Russia and stage a protest. Russia would simply have more political prisoners,” Kosgorov said. Sergey, a 40-year-old from Moscow who requested to withhold his full name, also feels guilty and hopeless at times. He left Russia in October 2022 with the help of his friends, who lent him money for a plane ticket to Yerevan, Armenia’s capital. “I certainly feel personal responsibility for what is going on. Russia has turned into a machine for destroying people’s lives. Both abroad and inside the country,” Sergey said. “And this did not happen overnight on February 24 [2022].” He managed to keep his job and now works remotely from Yerevan while feeling that nothing in his life is certain. What helps him deal with his emotional state is writing letters to Russian political prisoners he knew back in Moscow. “There are people who are worse off than me, who were imprisoned unfairly based on trumped-up charges,” he said. “Everyone is depressed. I don’t know how many Russian exiles are on antidepressants, but I am. There is an understanding that there are no clear prospects for us and that we must take each day as it comes.” According to Margarita Zavadskaya, a Finland-based political scientist who researches Russian political exiles, the latest wave of migration from Russia differs from previous instances in that it is more politicised. People trust each other more and form stronger communities, they are not afraid to speak up, and they get involved in activism, she said, which helps them regain dignity and a sense of purpose. “People feel depressed. They feel guilt, shame, sometimes anger. And they are trying to find themselves and reinvent themselves in the new circumstances,” she told Al Jazeera. “The irony of the situation is that the guilt is being felt by those who are against the regime and understand the scale of the tragedy.” Unlike previous migration waves, the new voluntary exiles are also more privileged, if not financially, then when it comes to resources they have at their disposal – knowledge, education, and creativity. They can survive and thrive outside of Russia, she said, and are also unlikely to go back home. When asked if they would like to return to Russia, both Evgeniy Kosgorov and Sergey took time to reply. Their answers were similar. They might return one day when the war is over, if and when Russia pays reparations to Ukraine, and when Putin’s administration is gone. Neither believes any of these events will happen in the foreseeable future.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/22/russian-exiles-unlikely-to-return
Russia hands down criminal charges following rare large protest,"Activists in Bashkortostan face 15 years in prison on charges of organising ‘mass riots’, assaulting public officials.","Russian authorities have laid serious criminal charges against four people following a large protest in the central region of Bashkortostan. Security forces in the city of Ufa, in the Urals mountains, arrested the fourth suspect on Sunday evening, local media reported. The charges follow protests by thousands last week over the jailing of an Indigenous rights activist. Police were swift to crack down on what was arare large showing of dissentin Russia since Moscow’s war against Ukraine started. Dim Davletkildin was detained after being summoned by police in the town of Baymak, the scene of the rally, which was sparked by the sentencing on Wednesday of Fail Alsynov to four years in a penal colony. Among the charges faced by Alsynov’s fellow activists are organisation of “mass riots” and assault of public officials, reported the OVN-Info monitoring group. The charges carry a potential sentence of 15 years. OVD-Info added that authorities have already opened dozens of lesser administrative cases, accusing demonstrators of joining unsanctioned rallies. The same court in Baymak, 1,400km (870 miles) east of Moscow, that last week sentenced Alsynov for inciting ethnic hatred has jailed several people for eight to 15 days for taking part in the protest, which saw police pelted with snowballs. The authorities responded with tear gas. The charges against Alsynov followed a speech he delivered last year as locals opposed plans for the development of a gold mine. The regional governor said the activist had made racist comments about people from Central Asia and the Caucasus. Alsynov claims that his words were mistranslated from the Bashkir language. The protesters said the verdict was delayed revenge for his role in protests years prior, when activists successfully blocked plans to mine for soda on a hill considered sacred by locals.    Large protests are rare in Russia due to the risks of arrests. Thousands of people have been detained in the past two years for opposingthe war. Often coming from regions with few economic prospects, Indigenous peoples from across Russia have been actively courted by recruitment officials and heavily represented in the ranks that Russia has sent to the front line in Ukraine. Alsynov was fined last year for criticising the invasion online, saying the war was not in Bashkortostan’s interests. He heads Bashkort, a grassroots movement working to preserve the culture, language and ethnic identity of the region’s people that was banned as an “extremist organisation” in 2020. Bashkortostan is an oil-producing region of 4.1 million people and is one of more than 80 entities that make up the Russian Federation. The Bashkir ethnic minority are among Russia’s 260,000 people who are recognised as Indigenous to Russia. Indigenous peoples living in Russia have long fought for their rights and to protect their traditional territory, which is often located in areas that are used for natural resource extraction, such as mining.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/22/russia-hands-down-criminal-charges-following-rare-large-protest

Russia says at least 27 killed in blast at Donetsk market,Authorities in Russian-occupied Donetsk accuse Ukraine of shelling a market on outskirts of city.,"At least 27 people have been killed and 25 injured after a market on the outskirts of the Russian-occupied city of Donetsk was shelled, local authorities said. Denis Pushilin, the head of the Moscow-installed authorities in Donetsk, blamed the attack on the suburb of Tekstilshchik on the Ukrainian military. Pushilin said that the area had been hit by 155mm calibre and 152mm calibre artillery and that the shells had been fired from the direction of Kurakhove and Krasnohorivka to the west. He announced a day of mourning on Monday. “These terrorist attacks by the Kyiv regime clearly demonstrate its lack of political will towards achieving peace and the settlement of this conflict by diplomatic means,” Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. There was no immediate comment from Ukraine. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres “strongly condemns all attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure, including today’s shelling of the city of Donetsk in Ukraine”, according to a UN spokesperson, adding that all such attacks were prohibited under international humanitarian law. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy did not address Tekstilshchik in his nightly video address but said that in a single day, Russia had shelled more than 100 cities, towns and villages in nine regions of Ukraine, and that the attacks in Donetsk region had been “particularly severe”. Ukraine’s forces in the Tavria, or southern zone, said in a Facebook post that soldiers under its command were not responsible for the market shelling. “Donetsk is Ukraine!” it said. “Russia will have to answer for taking lives of Ukrainians.” Moscow-backed separatists have controlled the southeastern Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, known collectively as the Donbas, since 2014. Russian President Vladimir Putin “recognised” them as separate republics shortly before launching his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and they were among four Ukrainian regionsRussia annexedin September 2022, in a movecondemnedas illegal at the United Nations General Assembly. Separately on Sunday, Russia’s Ministry of Defence said the country’s forces had taken control of the village of Krokhmalne in Ukraine’s northeastern Kharkiv region. Volodymyr Fityo, the spokesperson for the Ukrainian Ground Forces Command, told reporters that Kyiv’s forces had withdrawn from the area. Fityo said that Krokhmalne had a population of roughly 45 people before the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Reporting from Kyiv, Al Jazeea’s Rob McBride said Ukrainian authorities played down the significance of the withdrawal. “They [Ukrainians] say this was a small village and they gave up only a couple of kilometres to the Russians… they say it was of little consequence for the overall situation,” Al Jazeera’s McBride said. As Russia’s war in Ukraine nears its two-year mark, both Moscow and Kyiv’s forces have continued to fight from largely static positions along the roughly 1,500km (930-mile) front line throughout the winter. Recent Russian attacks have also tried to find gaps in Ukraine’s defences by using large numbers of various types of missiles in an apparent effort to saturate air defence systems.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/21/russia-says-at-least-25-killed-in-blast-at-donetsk-market

Russian lawmakers to debate seizing property of those who ‘discredit’ army,A bill to be voted on next week aims to confiscate assets of Russians spreading ‘deliberately false’ information amid Ukraine war.,"Russia’s parliament will consider a law allowing for the confiscation of money, valuables and other property from those deemed to spread “deliberately false information” about Moscow’s military actions, a senior lawmaker has said. Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the State Duma, wrote in a Telegram post on Saturday that a bill has been developed in an attempt to punish “scoundrels” who “pour mud” on Russia and its soldiers participating in thewar in Ukraine, which is approaching its two-year mark. He said the bill will be submitted to the Duma, which is Russia’s lower house of parliament, on Monday. The proposed measure would apply to those publicly inciting “extremist activities” or calling for the introduction ofsanctions against Russia, the speaker explained. It would also be applicable to those “discrediting” the armed forces, a criminal offence under a law adopted as part ofMoscow’s crackdown on dissentafter it sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022. Those found guilty also face being stripped of any honorary titles. “Everyone who tries to destroy Russia, betrays it, must suffer the deserved punishment and compensate for the damage inflicted on the country, at the cost of their property,” Volodin said. The existing law against “discrediting” the Russian military, which covers offences such as “justifying terrorism” and spreading “fake news” about the armed forces, is regularly used to silence critics of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Multiple activists, bloggers and general Russian citizens have received long jail terms under the existing law. Popular writerDmitry Glukhovskywas handed an eight-year jail term in absentia after a Moscow court found him guilty in August of deliberately spreading false information about Russia’s armed forces. One of the country’s bestselling novelists, known under the pen nameBoris Akunin, was charged under the law and added to the Russian register of “extremists and terrorists”. In November, a court in St Petersburg jailed Sasha Skochilenko, an artist and musician, for seven years for swapping supermarket price tags with antiwar messages. The month before, Russian blogger Aleksandr Nozdrinov received an 8.5-year term for posting photos of destroyed buildings in Kyiv, along with a caption implying that Russian troops were responsible. Meanwhile, attacks on the ground continue. On Saturday, Russian forces shelled the southern Ukrainian town of Huliaipole, local governor Yuriy Malashko wrote on Telegram. Earlier, regional Ukrainian officials reported that one person was killed when Russian forces shelled the southern Kherson region overnight. In southern Russia, close to the Ukrainian border, an exploding drone hit a gas pipeline on the outskirts of the city of Belgorod, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov reported on Telegram, blaming Ukraine for the attack. The European Union said it will drastically increase ammunition production this year in response to Ukraine’s growing pleas for support. It also aimed to impose a new round of sanctions on Russia next month to mark the second anniversary of Moscow’s invasion, adding to its previous 12 rounds of sanctions.

Palestinians in Ukraine decry ‘double standard’ as Kyiv supports Israel,"Ukraine has supported Israel throughout the latest conflict, upsetting Palestinians as war ravages Gaza.","Names marked with an asterisk* have been changed to protect identities. When Russia launched a full-scale war on Ukraine on February 24, 2022, Amer Aroggi, a 30-year-old journalist based in the Gaza Strip, felt compelled to report on the European conflict. Having lived through the Israeli occupation, he felt he could relate to the plight of the Ukrainians. The move was seamless, especially because his older brother had lived in Ukraine for many years. Aroggi quickly secured a new role for himself as a correspondent for a prominent news channel. Less than two years later, war broke out again in his homeland with the latest escalation of the Israel-Palestine conflict. To some observers, there were parallels between Russia and Israel and Ukraine and the Palestinians. But in a swift and unequivocal response to the outbreak of the war in Gaza, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy threw his support behind Israel, like much of theUkrainian population, and almost all Western leaders. “I saw a double standard. … The world helped the Ukrainians, and no one helped us. No one even helped me evacuate my mother and sister out of Gaza,” Aroggi told Al Jazeera. Ukrainians were the “victims of massive propaganda” during the first stages of the war, which is why they often supported Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, according to Aroggi. He said he would like to leave but is unable to because he has a Palestinian passport. He spends his days glued to the TV, fearing for his family in Gaza. “My mother asks me, ‘Are you OK? Is there a Russian bombing?’ I say to her, ‘Are you OK? Is there an Israeli bombing?'”    The latest escalation of the Israel-Palestine conflict began on October 7 when Hamas attacked southern Israel, killing 1,139 people and triggering a violent response. At this point in the war, at least 24,762 Palestinians had been reported killed by Israeli forces in Gaza. While Israel has said it aims to wipe out Hamas, which governs the besieged enclave, the toll on civilians and its conduct have been heavily criticised. Ukrainian first lady Olena Zelenska said on October 7 that Ukrainians understand and “share the pain” of the Israeli people as billboards across Kyiv lit up the capital with Israeli flags. Hashem*, a medical professional from Gaza who relocated to Ukraine nine years ago, remained resolute in his allegiance to his adopted home when Russia invaded Ukraine. Yet the Ukrainian reaction to Israel’s offensive in Gaza left him grappling with conflicting emotions in the initial months of the war, particularly since “Ukraine suffers from occupation like Palestine”, he said. The prevailing narrative in the national media favours Israel and influences public sentiment, he said. Hashem also suffered personally. He said he received threats and discriminatory messages full of hate from individuals who learned he was from Gaza but residing in Ukraine. Even so, he plans to stay in Ukraine. Now more than three months into the Middle East war, Hashem and Aroggi said they have witnessed some changes in public opinion. The constant stream of images of death and destruction in Gaza has had an impact, leading some Ukrainians to start openly criticising their government’s position. In November, more than 300 Ukrainian scholars, activists and artists expressed their solidarity with Palestinians in anopen letter. The letter emphasised the right of Palestinians to self-determination and resistance against Israel’s occupation, drawing parallels to Ukrainians resisting the Russian invasion. Hashem said some Ukrainians came to view the “Israeli narrative” as both “false and unfair” and he “began to feel moral support” for himself and the Palestinian people. Mounting pressure from pro-Palestinian segments of society eventually forced a gradual shift in the Ukrainian government’s position, he believes. He pointed to Ukraine’s backing of a UN resolution on November 12, urging the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to provide an opinion on the legal consequences of Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories. However, Ukraine chose to abstain from voting on a recent resolution advocating for a humanitarian ceasefire in war-torn Gaza. Yuliia Kishchuk, a researcher who signed the open letter, told Al Jazeera that Israel enjoys significant support from Ukrainian political liberals who view Israel as a democratic and progressive nation. “Israel is portrayed in Ukrainian media as this very democratic state that is defending itself against the autocracy of other Middle Eastern countries,” she said, adding that crucially “there is no Palestine in this narrative.” Kishchuk said the level of knowledge about Palestine, its history and the ongoing Israeli occupation has begun to increase. Leading Ukrainian opinion makers and intellectuals specialising in the Middle East have gained traction in the media, providing context about Ukraine’s historical support of Palestine. Kyiv had previously consistently backed UN resolutions denouncing Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories. Meanwhile, images depicting the “horrors” of Israel’s bombardment of Gaza have created a sense of empathy among Ukrainians who now are unable to ignore the parallels with their own experiences of war, she said. Kishchuk has also been buoyed by a change of tone among government officials in recent months. In December, in something of a shift, Zelenskyy said Ukraine recognises the independence of both the Israeli and Palestinian people.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/19/palestinians-in-ukraine-decry-double-standard-as-kyiv-supports-israel
France denies Russian claim of mercenaries in Ukraine,Moscow said on Wednesday that its forces had carried out a strike on a building housing ‘foreign fighters’ in Kharkiv.,"France has denied Russia’s claim that there were French mercenaries in Ukraine after Russia’s Ministry of Defence said its troops had killed “foreign fighters” earlier this week. “France helps Ukraine with supplies of military material and military training, in full compliance with international law, in order to help Ukraine in its fight to defend its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity,” France’s Ministry for Foreign Affairs said on Thursday. “France has no mercenaries, neither in Ukraine nor elsewhere, unlike certain others,” it added. On Thursday, Russia also summoned French ambassador to Moscow, Pierre Levy, to its foreign ministry regarding the alleged French mercenaries, Russian state news agency TASS reported. “In connection with the destruction by the Russian armed forces of a temporary deployment point of foreign fighters in Kharkiv, among whom were several dozen Frenchmen, the French ambassador has been summoned to the Foreign Ministry,” Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova was cited as saying. Moscow said on Wednesday that its forces had carried out a strike a day earlier on a building in Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv. “On the evening of 16 January, the armed forces of the Russian Federation carried out a precision strike on a temporary deployment point of foreign militants in the city of Kharkiv, the core of which were French mercenaries,” Russia’s Ministry of Defence said in a statement. It said the building was destroyed and more than 60 people were killed, though it did not provide evidence for the claim. After Tuesday’s strike on the Ukrainian city, Kharkiv region governor Oleh Syniehubov said there were no military targets in the area that Russia hit. Local authorities said that 17 civilians werewoundedin the attack. On Thursday, the chief of NATO’s military committee, Dutch Admiral Rob Bauer, criticised Russia’s recent attacks in Ukraine. “While Russia’s most recent attacks are devastating, they are not militarily effective,” he said. Bauer added that the war had reached a relative stalemate, and the conflict was in a phase where it was “not moving a lot”. “We should not expect a miracle happening on either side,” he added. Ukraine also warned on Thursday that the country was facing an ammunition shortage as its war with Russia nears the two-year mark. “A shortage of ammunition is a very real and pressing problem that our armed forces are facing,” Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said on the social media platform X. “The artillery coalition is aimed at solving this issue,” he said after speaking by video link to the Ramstein contact group, which gathers more than 50 countries supporting Ukraine. “We need to strengthen Ukrainian defence capabilities to protect the free world against Russian evil,” he added. The meeting came as Russia claimed its forces had pushed Ukrainian troops out of Vesele, a village near the city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine.

Ukraine’s harsh winter a memory but new Russian tactics sow destruction,"Ukraine’s latest winter hardly resembles the brutal cold season of 2022 that was beset by blackouts, but Russian shelling persists.","Kyiv, Ukraine –Artem Honcharuk turns off the lights and switches on two halogen lamps to illuminate the black plastic letters on his shop’s wall that read “copy centre” in Ukrainian. More than a year ago, he tinkered with these lamps so they could run on batteries and light up his print shop in an underground shopping mall in central Kyiv. “That’s the light I was working under,” the 31-year-old told Al Jazeera, standing next to a desktop computer, copy machines and printers. “I already forgot how it was.” In the winter of late 2022 and early 2023, Moscow rained hell on Ukraine, targeting civilian infrastructure to deprive residents of power, central heating, water – and the will to fight back. Andriy Kostin, the prosecutor general of Ukraine, called it “terrorism and war crimes” at the time. Each air raid began with dozens of slow, noisy, Iranian-made Shahed drones laden with up to 50kg (110 pounds) of explosives.  Experienced shooters took many down, but the drones were followed by ballistic missiles, and in some cases, supersonic cruise missiles launched from strategic bombers midair in western Russia. Bombing intensified after Russian forces withdrew from around Kyiv, northern Ukraine, and several areas in the east and south, losing tens of thousands of servicemen and faith in President Vladimir Putin’s blitzkrieg. Between October 10, 2022 and March 9, 2023, the shelling took place every single day, often lasting hours, killing and wounding hundreds and keepingmillions awakeand horrified. After depleting its stashes, Moscow struck less frequently – but would amass the missiles and drones to make each new onemore lethal. Many strikes succeeded – fully or partly – destroying power, transmission and central heating stations all over Ukraine, as well as apartment buildings and hospitals. The damage led to blackouts, disruptions of central heating, and water supply when entire districts went black, and cold, for several days. An average Ukrainian household went through five cumulative weeks without power in the winter of 2022-23, the United Nations said. Russia hit Ukrainian energy infrastructure 271 times, Herman Halushchenko, Ukraine’s energy minister, said in July 2023, adding that the overall damage was estimated at $11bn. What his ministry did not estimate is the damage to tens of thousands of small businesses, such as Honcharuk’s. Ukraine had been preparing for a similarly harsh winter, as Russia resumed the shelling in the autumn. Energy infrastructure was covered with sandbags, concrete slabs and metal cages or moved underground. Power supply to nine million people was restored. Kyiv now also has two Patriots, the most advanced US-made air defence systems that can intercept the hypersonic Kinzhal cruise missiles that Putin casts as “indestructible”. But each Patriot missile costs $4m, and the United States recently warned that there would be a shortage of supplies. Washington also supplied Hawks, the decades-old predecessors of Patriots, and Gepart antiaircraft tanks. Ukraine has US-made National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMs), too, just like the ones that protect the White House, as well as similar, German-made IRIS-T systems. Some analysts say the effectiveness of Russian strikes on Kyiv is minimal; there has not been a single blackout in Honcharuk’s shop and apartment building this winter. Even so, the shopkeeper got used to the deafening blasts of air defence missiles that guard his residential area. “Even if the missiles fly around loudly, I just turn and go back to sleep,” said Honcharuk. “There’s no more fear now, absolutely.” But the Kremlin has not given up on strikes and “looks for ways to improve effectiveness” by using various combinations of drones and missiles, a military expert said. Russians invent complicated routes for cruise missiles to zigzag over Ukraine bypassing areas covered by air defence and hitting their targets from unexpected directions, said Lieutenant-General Ihor Romanenko, the former deputy chief of Ukraine’s General Staff of the Armed Forces. Realising that Western air defence systems in Kyiv shoot down almost all of their missiles and drones, Russians focus on other urban areas such as the eastern cities of Dnipro and Kryvyi Rih, he said. “The morning of December 29 was horrendous,” Ihor Kolesnichenko, an engineer from Dnipro, told Al Jazeera, describing the air raid that killed six, wounded three dozen and damaged a maternity hospital. That day, Russia used 110 missiles and 36 drones to hit 18 cities and towns, killing 58 and wounding 158 in what became the most lethal attack of 2023, Ukrainian officials said. Russians started painting some drones black for night-time attacks, and replaced their propellers with jet engines so that they fly at 500kmph (310mph), Romanenko said. On December 30, theystarted launching short-range missilesallegedly made in North Korea. “They strike to pressure our citizens morally, psychologically so that they urge our leaders to start peace talks, to stop hostilities, which means the legalisation of occupation” in eastern and southern Ukraine, Romanenko said. Starting in late 2022, blackouts plunged Honcharuk’s print shop into darkness while prices for consumables such as printer ink surged three to four times. The cold was often paralysing with no central heating. But Honcharuk turned lemons into lemonade. Since his shop was underground, he did not have to close down during air raids, and people sitting them out would drop by to copy a document, get a printout or take a photo. He spent about $1,000 on a power generator, lamps and other accessories but did not raise prices because the mall’s owner gave him a discount on rent. “The most difficult part was to take people’s pictures in darkness. The flash blinds me and them, and I don’t see the second shot,” Honcharuk said. Two metres of soil and asphalt above his shop, the Western defence system near his apartment building in southwestern Kyiv, made him feel safe from the shelling, but not from the cold. Millions of Ukrainians had to sleep fully clothed with sweaters, coats and two pairs of socks. They stocked up on power banks, candles, flashlights and thermoses, and meticulously charged every gadget when electricity was back on, sometimes just for a couple of hours a day.    The winter sun set before 6pm, snow and ice turned dark streets into ice rinks, and only mobile phone flashlights saved people from falling. “It was the worst winter of our lives,” said Kateryna Ivanenko, a tax lawyer and mother-of-two whose six-year-old son Ihor barely survived pneumonia in February. “I want all Russians to live through a winter like that, that’s the very least they deserve.” During the blackouts, Ukrainians flocked to subway stations, shopping malls, or cafes that had power generators and often offered power sockets free of charge. They exchanged lifehacks on how to preserve food, such as hanging it in bags outside their windows or placing plastic bottles with water in their freezers. This winter, Honcharuk “expected the same”. “What kept me warm was that I was ready,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/18/ukraine-winter-shelling
Russia’s Lavrov rejects US proposal to resume nuclear arms talks,The foreign minister also warned that Ukraine must end its push to join NATO before any peace discussions can proceed.,"Russia’s top diplomat has rejected a United States proposal to resume a dialogue on nuclear arms control, saying that it is impossible while Washington offers military support to Ukraine. Speaking at a news conference on Thursday, Sergey Lavrov accused the West of fuelling global security risks by encouraging Ukraine to ramp up strikes on Russian territory and warned that Moscow will achieve its goals in the conflict regardless ofWestern supportfor Kyiv. Commenting on a US proposal to resume contacts in the sphere of nuclear arms control, Lavrov said that Moscow has rejected the offer. He said that for such talks to be held, Washington first needs to revise its current policy towards Russia. Lavrov charged that Washington’s push for the revival of nuclear talks has been driven by a desire to resume inspections of Russia’s nuclear weapons sites. He described such US demands as “indecent” in view of Ukraine’s attacks on Russian nuclear-capable bomber bases during the conflict. “Amid a ‘hybrid war’ waged by Washington against Russia, we aren’t seeing any basis, not only for any additional joint measures in the sphere of arms control and reduction of strategic risks, but for any discussion of strategic stability issues with the US,” he said. “We firmly link such possibility to the West fully renouncing its malicious course aimed at undermining Russia’s security and interests.” The minister said Washington’s push for restarting nuclear arms talks is rooted in a desire to “try to establish control over our nuclear arsenal and minimise nuclear risks for itself” but added that “those risks are emerging as a result of forceful pressure on our country.” He accused the West of blocking any talks on ending the conflict and inciting the ramping up of attacks on Russia. “Such encouragement and the transfer of relevant weapons shows that the West doesn’t want any constructive solution,” Lavrov said. “The West is pushing toward the escalation of the Ukrainian crisis, and that raises new strategic risks.” He reaffirmed that Russia will pursue what it calls the “special military operation” regardless of Western pressure. “We will consistently and persistently press the goals of the special military operation and we will achieve them,” he said. “They should have no hope that Russia could be defeated in any way. Those in the West who fantasise about it have failed to learn history lessons.”    The foreign minister’s comments come as tensions in thenearly two-year conflictshow no signs of abating, with Ukraine claiming the same day it struck an oil terminal in Saint Petersburg. A Russian-appointed official in occupied southeastern Ukraine earlier disputed this, saying that Ukraine had tried and failed to target a Russian Baltic Sea oil terminal with a drone overnight. Ukraine’s offensive lies on the heels of its continuous push to join NATO, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy most againcalling for membership at Davos, the World Economic Forum’s annual summit. NATO’s chief Jens Stoltenberg said at the summit that Kyiv is “closer to NATO than ever before”. During his press conference, Lavrov said that Ukraine must end its push to join NATO before any discussion of peace takes place.

EU rearms Ukraine as calls mount for higher defence spending,EU members weren’t letting Hungary’s objections stall bilateral military aid for Ukraine.,"As roughly $137bn in military and financial aid to Ukraine remained stalled in Washington and Brussels, individual European allies began to make bilateral pledges worth billions to ensure that Ukraine will remain capable of resisting Russia this year. That resistance remained in place during the past week, with ground troops holding a 1,000km (621-mile) line against Russian assaults in what their commander called an “active defence”, and Ukraine’s Air Force seizing an opportunity to destroy one of only a handful of Russian reconnaissance planes. Ukraine destroyed the Beriev A-50 on Monday somewhere over the Sea of Azov, killing all of its crew, its commander in chief said. An Ilyushin-22 command aircraft was also effectively destroyed, though it managed to land. Ukraine’s southern command said the A-50 was one of only three operational such aircraft and helped direct missile attacks. Russia had fired 40 drones and missiles into Ukraine two days earlier. Ukrainian defenders shot down eight missiles and said they disabled another 20 or so with electronic jamming. As if to prove missile capability after the downing of the A-50, Russia attacked again on Wednesday, wounding 17 people in central Kharkiv. Events in the air were perhaps the most kinetic in a week of static front lines. Ukrainian commander of ground forces Oleksandr Syrskiy said his troops were on “active defence” as Russia pressed for full control of the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk and the reconquest of Kharkiv and Kherson. “Our goals remain unchanged: holding our positions … exhausting the enemy by inflicting maximum losses,” Syrskiy said. Syrskiy’s remarks appeared to confirm that Russia had taken the initiative in attacking. “The initiative is completely in the hands of the Russian armed forces,” Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a meeting with local government leaders on Tuesday. “If [this] continues, Ukrainian statehood may suffer an irreparable, very serious blow,” Putin said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reacted to those remarks the following day as he addressed theWorld Economic Forum in Switzerland, saying Putin would never give up his maximalist goals in Ukraine. “If we have to fight Putin together, years in advance, isn’t it better to end him now, while our brave men and women are already doing it? They are the world’s chance,” Zelenskyy said. As the two leaders’ defiant positions suggested another year of bitter war in Ukraine and conflict persisted in Gaza and the Red Sea, rearmament was becoming a theme for Europe as well as Ukraine. “We need a warfighting transformation of NATO,” its Military Committee chief, Dutch Admiral Rob Bauer, said as he opened a two-day meeting of defence ministers in Brussels on Wednesday. NATO members were living in “an era in which anything can happen at any time, an era in which we need to expect the unexpected, an era in which we need to focus on effectiveness in order to be fully effective”, he said. That thinking was reflected in the European Commission, as well. Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton said last week that he would propose a 100-billion-euro ($109bn) European Defence Investment Programme next month, to expand capacity in European defence industries. Last March, the EU pledged a million artillery shells to Ukraine within a year. By November, they had delivered less than a third of that, but Breton confirmed they would fulfil their pledge by early this year, and the European Commission confirmed that EU production capacity would reach a million shells a year by early this year, matching US production capacity. Russian shell production capacity matched the US and EU combined, said the deputy head of Ukraine’s military intelligence Vadym Skibitskyi. Russia’s covert mobilisation had also enlisted half a million men last year, meaning that it had been able to overcome attrition to field 462,000 soldiers in Ukraine. Given these Russian capacities, Ukraine’s rearmament was an urgent matter, Zelenskyy said. Some $61bn in aid for 2024 remained stuck in Congressional deliberations in Washington due to Republican opposition, and two packages of 50 billion euros and 20 billion euros ($54bn to $22bn) were stalled in Brussels due to Hungarian opposition. US National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said the US had suspended security assistance to Ukraine as a result of the impasse. In Europe, individual countries chose to move ahead bilaterally. Estonian President Alar Karis said last week that Estonia would provide 1.2 billion euros ($1.3bn) in aid including howitzers and ammunition over the next four years. Estonia was committing 0.25 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) to Ukraine’s defence over the next four years, Prime Minister Kaja Kallas had said days earlier. A staunch Ukraine ally which also shares a border with Russia, Estonia last November said it was raising defence spending to 3 percent of GDP and urged other European nations to double their expenditure. Latvia on the same day pledged howitzers, shells, drones and helicopters, among other things. On Friday, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunaksignedan agreement with Kyiv to help develop Ukraine’s drone production capacity, and said he would spend $3.2bn in defence of Ukraine this year. French President Emmanuel Macron was due in Kyiv to make his own pledges next month. He told a news conference that long-range SCALP missiles would be included in defence deliveries already under way. “We are going to deliver a lot more equipment and help Ukraine with what it needs to defend its skies,” he said. Germany last month said it would double its military aid to Ukraine in 2024 to eight billion euros ($9bn). “Russia’s war in Ukraine, as a political issue, is slipping from the mainstream, and is now largely a preoccupation for those situated near Europe’s eastern border,” said the European Council on Foreign Relations. Though still well-resourced, Russia was not without its problems. Skibitskyi said it was having trouble building certain types of missiles due to sanctions. And secretive Russian enlistment of naturalised citizens – suspected to have begun in 2023 – may have contributed to a massive fire that destroyed a seven-hectare warehouse of online retailer Wildberries, in St Petersburg last week. Russian sources said the fire was preceded by a fight among migrant workers there, and a raid by authorities who pressed workers into service with the military.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/17/eu-rearms-ukraine-as-calls-mount-for-higher-defence-spending
Ukraine says controlling skies ‘priority’ in war against Russia,Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba says whoever controls the skies will define ‘when and how the war will end’.,"Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has said his country’s priority for 2024 is to gain control over its skies as Russia’s invasion nears its third year. Whoevercontrols the skieswill define “when and how the war will end”, Kuleba said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Ukraine has long called on the West to deliver advanced fighter jets tosupport its troopsentrenched in the south and the east of the country. “We are fighting a powerful enemy, a very big enemy that doesn’t sleep. It takes time,” Kuleba said. “We defeated them on the land in 2022. We defeated them in the sea in 2023 and we are completely focused on defeating them in the air in 2024.” Various NATO countries are currently training Ukrainian pilots on US-made F-16 fighter jets. Denmark said this month it will transfer 19 F-16s in the second quarter of this year. The United States had previously resisted allowing the jet transfers for fear of being deemed by Russia to be a direct belligerent in theUkraine war. The conflict has ground to a deadlock over the last year as Ukraine’s long-awaited counteroffensive failed to push back Russian forces. Kuleba also called for patience from his country’s key Western backers and insisted that, with the right support, Ukraine could be victorious. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed confidence on Wednesday that all European Union member states will agree to jointly extendmore financial aidto Ukraine. I am proud that our Union has answered Ukraine’s call. Ukraine’s democratic institutions are delivering on our recommendations and on the aspirations of their people. We will now start the screening process ↓pic.twitter.com/GQHjaASZHq — Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen)January 17, 2024  “I am proud that our union has answered Ukraine’s call,” she told the European Parliament. EU leaders last month agreed to start accession talks with Ukraine but Hungary vetoed granting 50 billion euros ($54bn) in aid for Kyiv through 2027. Hungary has resisted agreement on an aid package, raising the possibility of the other 26 countries giving funds to Ukraine under separate bilateral deals with Kyiv. The bloc’s 27 leaders will meet in Brussels on February 1 to try to agree on providing more financial assistance to Kyiv. At least17 people were injured, two of them seriously, after Russian missiles hit residential buildings in the city of Kharkiv overnight. Regional Governor Oleh Syniehubov said two S-300 missiles hit buildings in the centre of Ukraine’s second-biggest city on Tuesday night, and 14 people were sent to hospital. Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said the missiles struck “precisely where there is no military infrastructure and precisely where there are in fact residences”. “There are at least 10 damaged buildings. Rescue teams are continuing to go through the rubble,” he wrote on Telegram. “And there is plenty of rubble.” In the southern port city of Odesa, at least three people were injured, and residential buildings were damaged in the overnight drone attacks, according to Ukrainian authorities. The Ukrainian military said the Russian attack targeted Odesa and other southern regions for at least three hours. Meanwhile, Russia’s Ministry of Defence on Wednesday said its air defence forces destroyed seven Vilkha surface-to-air missiles and four drones over the Russian region of Belgorod.

At least 17 injured after Russian missiles hit Ukraine’s Kharkiv,Rescuers search rubble after two S-300 missiles hit the centre of Ukraine’s second-biggest city.,"At least 17 people have been injured, two of them seriously, after Russian missiles hit residential buildings in the city of Kharkiv. Regional Governor Oleh Syniehubov said that two S-300 missiles hit buildings in the centre of Ukraine’s second-biggest city late on Tuesday night, and 14 people had been sent to hospital. “Two women are in a serious condition,” he said in a post on Telegram. Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said the missiles struck “precisely where there is no military infrastructure and precisely where there are in fact residences”. “There are at least 10 damaged buildings. Rescue teams are continuing to go through the rubble,” he wrote on Telegram. “And there is plenty of rubble.” Ukraine’s Emergency Services said one of the missiles hit a three-storey building that had previously housed a medical centre. Kharkiv lies just 30km (19 miles) from the border with Russia in Ukraine’s northeast and has come under frequent bombardment since Moscow launched itsfull-scale invasionof the country in February 2022. There was no immediate comment from Moscow on the attack on Kharkiv but the Defence Ministry said its air defences destroyed seven Ukrainian missiles and four drones over Russia’s Belgorod region about 80km (50 miles) from Kharkiv.

Ukraine’s Zelenskyy urges Western allies to step up pressure on Russia,The Ukrainian leader says Western hesitation in backing Kyiv is costing time and lives and could prolong the fighting for years.,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urged the West to tighten sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin and step up its support for Kyiv to ensure that Moscow does not succeed in its war. Western hesitation in supporting Ukraine and fears of an escalation in the war with Russia are costing time and lives and could prolong the fighting by years, Zelenskyy said on Tuesday in an emotional speech at theWorld Economic Forumin Davos, Switzerland. With the West’s once-staunch wartimesupport for Kyiv now waveringamid political wrangling in Washington and Brussels, Zelenskyy said Europeans need to understand that Putin’s plans go beyond the war in Ukraine. “In fact, Putin embodies war. … He will not change. … We must change. We all must change to the extent that the madness that resides in this man’s head or any other aggressor’s head will not prevail,” the president said. Nearly two years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion, Zelenskyy said he strongly opposes freezing the conflict along its current lines. “Putin is a predator who is not satisfied with frozen products,” he said. He said sanctions on Moscow need to be enforced properly and the lack of sanctions on Russia’s nuclear sector are an illustration of the West’s weakness. European Union and NATO leaders echoed Zelenskyy’s concerns, telling the forum the West could not let up supplying  Ukraine with weapons and money if it wants Kyiv to prevail. “Ukrainians need predictable financing throughout 2024 and beyond. They need a sufficient and sustained supply of weapons to defend Ukraine and regain its rightful territory,” European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen advised. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, also speaking at Davos, said support for Ukraine was not charity but an investment in the alliance’s own security. “We just have to stand by Ukraine. At some stage, Russia will understand that they are paying too high a price and sit down and agree to some kind of just peace – but we need to stand by Ukraine,” he stated.    The forum is being held as Kyiv’s troops are going onto a more defensive footing after amajor counteroffensivelast year was unable to break through Russian defensive lines in Ukraine’s occupied south and east. Speaking hours after the Ukrainian president, Putin insisted his forces have the upper hand. “Not only has their counteroffensive failed, but the initiative is entirely in the hands of the Russian armed forces,” the Russian leader said in televised remarks. “If this continues, Ukraine’s statehood could be dealt an irreparable, very serious blow,” he added. Putin also shot down the possibility of peace talks with Ukraine, saying the country had advanced “prohibitive formulas for the peace process”.    Kyiv is now focused ontrying to secure Western assistanceheld up in the United States Congress and Brussels as it reforms its conscription effort to replenish manpower and addresses artillery shortages at the front. In a question-and-answer session after his speech, Zelenskyy said he had received “positive signals” about the unlocking of financial support from the EU. He said he hoped that the US would approve further aid within weeks. To drive home his point about the need to support Kyiv, he asked rhetorically what other European nation could provide a combat-ready army that could hold back Russian forces. “If anyone thinks this is only about Ukraine, they’re fundamentally mistaken. Possible directions and even timeline of a new Russian aggression beyond Ukraine become more and more obvious.” Zelenskyy met senior officials on the sidelines of the forum, including US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, Stoltenberg and international investors, such as executives from JPMorgan Chase.

Polish truckers agree to suspend border protest until March,"Truck drivers had blocked border since November, demanding restrictions be reintroduced for Ukrainian hauliers.","Polish truckers have agreed to suspend a protest that had blocked some border crossings with Ukraine sinceNovember, the infrastructure minister says. The hauliers confirmed the suspension until March but warned they would return to the border if their demands are not met. “We’ve signed an agreement. The outcome of the agreement will be the discontinuation of protests at road border crossings in three towns: Korczowa, Hrebenne, Dorohusk,” Infrastructure Minister Dariusz Klimczak said on Tuesday. He said that while drivers have agreed to stop protesting for nearly two months, talks were still ongoing. Truckers are demanding that the European Union reinstate a system for Ukrainian companies requiring a permit to operate in the bloc. The truckers also want empty trucks from the EU to be excluded from an electronic queueing system in Ukraine. The bloc waived the permit system after Russia mounted a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, but Polish hauliers said the move created unfair competition from Ukraine and took a toll on their earnings. Their protests created kilometres-long lines of trucks at the border as they tried to cross from Poland to Ukraine. Protest co-organiser Rafal Mekler confirmed the agreement to suspend the border protest. “The government is undertaking several commitments within the specific timeframe that are intended to fulfil the protest demands,” he said on X, formerly Twitter. “If we don’t manage to reach a solution, we will return to the border. … This is not capitulation but a strategic pause.” The agreement, which Mekler posted on X, sets out several actions the government committed to, including launching talks with the European Commission towards securing financial support for Polish hauliers. Another one of the organisers in Dorohusk, Edyta Ozygala, also warned that the action could be renewed at any time. “If the effects are unsatisfactory, we will come back,” she said. Ukraine says the protests have caused the country economic losses and affected its war efforts. It said cross-border transportation has increased because of the war and because its main export and import routes across the Black Sea have been blocked. “The key reason for the growth in the number of transportations by Ukrainian hauliers is the response to the consequences of the Russian armed aggression,” Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said on social media on Monday. “Transportations of fuel, humanitarian and military cargo take up about 20% of total traffic.” The main points of the agreement include monitoring of solutions worked out jointly by Poland and Ukraine to ease the situation of EU-registered drivers in Ukraine, talks with the EU on its agreement with Ukraine and talks with the European Commission on financial support for Polish haulage companies. The deal will provide more road checks to stop Ukrainian truckers from providing services not offered under the EU-Ukraine agreement.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/16/polish-truckers-agree-to-suspend-border-protest-until-march
"EU, US urge sustained support for Ukraine in war against Russia","European Commission chief warns West must not let up supplying Ukraine with weapons, money if it wants Kyiv to succeed.","The European Union and the United States have urged allies of Ukraine to keep up with their funding as the war with Russia nears the two-year mark, with no resolution to the fighting in sight. Secretary of State Antony Blinken promised sustained US support for Ukraine in a meeting on Tuesday withPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyydespite a row in the US Congress on approving new funding. “We are determined to sustain our support for Ukraine and we’re working very closely with Congress in order to work to do that. I know our European colleagues will do the same thing,” Blinken told Zelenskyy at theWorld Economic Forum in Davos. Jake Sullivan, US President Joe Biden’s national security adviser, joined the meeting and told Zelenskyy that the US and its allies were determined “to ensure that Russia fails and Ukraine wins”. Zelenskyy thanked the Biden administration and the “bipartisan support” in the US Congress. “We really count on your support – continuing your huge support,” he said.    The Ukrainian leader, who had addressed the Switzerland forum by video link in the past two years, showed up in person, as he faces increasing war fatigue in EU capitals and the US. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned on Tuesday that the West must not let up supplying Ukraine with weapons and money if it wants Kyiv to succeed. “Ukraine can prevail in this war but we must continue to empower their resistance,” she told business leaders at Davos. “Ukrainians need predictable financing throughout 2024 and beyond. They need a sufficient and sustained supply of weapons to defend Ukraine and regain its rightful territory.” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who also met Zelenskyy at the summit, said Ukraine “was closer to NATO than ever before”. It will be seen as an encouraging sign for Ukraine, which has long sought to join the military alliance and begundeveloping a reform planas part of its potential ascension. Stoltenberg also said there is “cause for optimism” in Ukraine’s two-year battle against Russia, despite a “serious battlefield situation”. As world leaders gathered in Davos to discuss how to rein in wars and embrace artificial intelligence,a state of emergencywas declared in the southern Russian city of Voronezh on Tuesday following a Ukrainian drone attack. Russia’s Ministry of Defence said five Ukrainian drones were destroyed by air defences over the Voronezh region. Yelena Fedyainova, whose six-year-old son was injured in one of the attacks, said the drones first struck at about 2:30am on Tuesday (23:30 GMT, Monday) and blew out the window of her apartment. “I grabbed the child – there were shards everywhere and smoke,” Fedyainova told journalists, the Reuters news agency reported. A girl was injured in the same attack, officials said. Voronezh, a city of more than one million people, lies some 250km (155 miles) from the border with Ukraine. The city’s mayor, Vadim Kstenin, said a state of emergency had been declared in the area to deal with the effect of the attack. Meanwhile, authorities in the northeastern Ukrainian region of Kharkiv urged residents of more than two dozen villages near the front line to evacuate, citing Russian attacks in the area. Russian forces captured swaths of the region shortly after invading Ukraine in February 2022 and have kept up efforts to wrest the region despite losing ground there. “Given the security situation, we are introducing mandatory evacuation of the population from the Kindrashivska and Kurylivska communities of the Kupyansk district,” the Kharkiv regional governor announced on social media. Governor Oleg Synegubov said the order would affect some 3,043 people in the settlements, including 279 children.

Ukraine says shot down two Russian command aircraft in blow to Moscow,The A-50 and IL-22 play a central role in orchestrating Russian battlefield movements in Ukraine.,"Ukraine has said it shot down an A-50 Russian reconnaissance plane and an Il-22 airborne command post in a potentially significant blow to the Kremlin’s forces. Ukrainian army chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi announced the aircraft had been hit on the Telegram messenger on Monday, posting a video of a tracking map suggesting the planes were struck over the Sea of Azov, which lies to the east of the Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula. “I am grateful to the air force for the excellently planned and conducted operation in Azov region!” Zaluzhnyi wrote. Hours after Zaluzhnyi’s statement, a Russian military blog posted an image of the shrapnel-riddled tail section of an Il-22 standing on the tarmac and lauded the crew as “real heroes”. Kyiv’s Air Force spokesman Yuriy Ignat reposted the image, saying the plane appeared to have made it to the Russian town of Anapa but that it was beyond repair as it had been on fire. He added that the A-50 had been Kyiv’s priority target. The A-50 is a Russian reconnaissance plane, equivalent to the AWACS (Airborne Warning and Control System) plane, used by NATO. Topped with a large radar, it typically has a crew of 15 and can scan an area of several hundred kilometres for enemy aircraft, ships and missiles. The Russian Air Force is thought to have nine of the planes in its fleet. Natalia Humeniuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern military command, told a briefing that Russia had used the plane extensively to prepare for and conduct long-rangemissile strikes on Ukraine. “We expect such a strike [on the A-50] to be fairly painful and, at least, to delay powerful missile strikes,” she said. The Il-22, meanwhile, oversees military operations and sends radio signals to troops on the front line. The Russian Air Force reportedly has a dozen such planes. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters he had “no information” on the attacks and that further questions should be directed to the Defence Ministry. Russia has largely maintained air dominance since launching afull-scale invasionof its neighbour nearly two years ago. The A-50 and IL-22 play a central role in orchestrating Russian battlefield movements in Ukraine. Their loss would be a landmark feat for Kyiv as well as a major blow to Moscow with fighting along the front line largely bogged down in trench and artillery warfare. Russian military bloggers with close army links did report an incident over the Azov Sea. “It will be another dark day for the Russian Aerospace Forces and Air Defense,” wrote Rybar, a blogger with nearly 1.2 million subscribers who supports and provides running commentary on Russia’s war in Ukraine. “There are not many A-50s. And the specialists operating them are generally rare. If an aircraft of this type is hit, the crew will not be able to escape.” Telegram channel WarGonzo acknowledged that the A-50 had been destroyed. “Unfortunately war is never without tragedies, and the death of our fighters always hurts. We express our condolences to the families and close ones of the crew,” it said. It too reported that the Il-22 was able to make it back to base. “According to reports, the pilots were able to land the damaged machine,” it said. A February 2023 drone attack at an airfield in Belarus damaged a parked A-50  but Russian and Belarusian officials described the damage as minor.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/16/ukraine-says-shot-down-two-russian-command-aircraft-in-blow-to-moscow

Russia dismisses Davos discussion on Ukrainian president’s peace plan,"Zelenskyy’s proposal, discussed by 83 delegations, calls for Russia to pull its troops back and face up to war crimes.","Russia has dismissed discussions on a peace plan proposed by Ukraine at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos in Switzerland as pointless. The talks in the Swiss mountain resort will achieve nothing without Moscow’s participation, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, insisted on Monday. Organisers said 83 delegations had been present at the meeting to discuss the plan the previous day. Put forward by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the 10-point peace plan, designed to end the war sparked by Russia’s invasion of its neighbour in February 2022, calls for the withdrawal of Russian troops, restoration of Ukraine’s state borders, and Russian accountability for war crimes. The proposal was discussed at a summit of national security advisers at the annual WEF meeting on Sunday. Zelenskyy’s plan has previously been discussed at three such gatherings. Andriy Yermak, the Ukrainian president’s chief of staff, called it a “good sign” that the number of participants in the string of conferences is expanding. While nearly half of the delegations present on Sunday were from Europe, there were 18 from Asia and 12 from Africa. “Countries from the Global South are increasingly getting involved in our work. It shows understanding that this European conflict is in fact a challenge for all humanity,” he wrote. However, Ukraine insists that it will not discuss the plan with Russia. Zelenskyy has decreed that any talks with Russia are illegal. That has motivated Russia, which controls a little less than a fifth of Ukrainian territory, to dismiss the idea as absurd. “This is simply talking for the sake of talking,” Peskov said. “This process cannot be aimed at achieving any specific results for the obvious reason – we are not participating. Without our participation, any discussions are devoid of any prospect of any results.” Ignazio Cassis, the Swiss foreign minister who co-hosted the peace plan discussion in Davos, said the meeting was part of a process aimed eventually at securing Russian participation, although he admitted that Moscow is far from ready to cooperate.  Zelenskyy also praised the discussion for including representatives from Latin America, Africa, and Asia. He arrived in Davos on Monday afternoon on a trip during which he will bid to rally support for Ukraineamid signs of fatiguein the United States and the European Union. He claimed that work on security guarantees and new support packages is progressing. “There are much-needed agreements on the joint production of weapons and shells, a particularly sensitive issue is drones. There will be more drones. We are preparing more good news on air defence. We keep in mind both missiles and electronic warfare – there will be more of them,” he said. With the war bogged down in tranches across the front line in eastern Ukraine, air attacks featuring planes, missiles and drones have intensified. Russian air defence systems destroyed three missiles launched by Ukraine over the southwest Kursk region early on Monday, the Russian Ministry of Defence said on its channel on Telegram messaging app. Ukraine, meanwhile, reported that it had downed two Russian military command aircraft over the Sea of Azov. The intensified air war has prompted Ukraine to press harder on Western allies for donations of missiles and air defence equipment. Meanwhile, Russia has been criticised for breaking international sanctions as it sources weapons from North Korea. Moscow and Pyongyang have denied arms deals but have declared deepening cooperation across the board. On Monday, Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov welcomed his North Korean counterpart, Choe Son-hui, as she arrived in Moscow on an official visit.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/15/russia-dismisses-davos-discussion-of-ukrainian-presidents-peace-plan

Ukraine says Russia launched barrage of missile attacks nationwide,Mass onslaught took place before France’s new foreign minister’s visit to Kyiv.,"Russia launched dozens of attacks acrossUkraineovernight, the Ukrainian air force said, as Kyiv continued its diplomatic efforts to ratchet up support and military aid. “A total of 40 means of enemy air attack were recorded,” the air force said on Saturday, adding that it destroyed eight missiles. “More than 20 devices” failed to reach their targets due to “active measures by means of electronic warfare”. Russia said it destroyed all targets in a barrage of attacks on facilities producing ammunition and drones in Ukraine. The defence ministry in Moscow said its armed forces “carried out a group strike … against facilities of the Ukrainian military-industrial complex”. It said it was targeting places producing shells, gunpowder and unmanned aerial vehicles. “All designated facilities were hit,” it added. No fatalities were reported so far, but Ukrainian authorities said a civilian was wounded in the northeastern Sumy region. According to the Ukrainian air force, Russia fired Kinzhal missiles, perhaps the toughest conventional Russian missile to shoot down, moving at several times the speed of sound. The missiles were shot down in at least five regions across Ukraine, according to local officials from those provinces. Police in the northern region of Chernihiv posted a picture of a large crater made by a downed missile. “As a result of being hit by the debris of an enemy missile, several private homes and non-residential buildings were damaged, one building was practically destroyed,” the police wrote, adding that a dog had been killed but no people were hurt. The air force in Ukraine’s neighbour Poland said it had briefly activated air defence systems due to the increased level of threat. The attacks took place as France’s newly appointed foreign minister, Stephane Sejourne, arrived in Kyiv on Saturday for his first official trip abroad, in a sign of support as the Russian invasion of Ukraine nears its second year. Speaking at a news conference in Kyiv, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba praised Sejourne for not “being intimidated by Russia’s latest large-scale missile attack” and reaching the Ukrainian capital so soon after his appointment on Thursday, which he said “says a lot about the priorities of France’s foreign policy”. Sejourne confirmed his visit was a “message to the Ukrainians”. “Ukraine is and will remain France’s priority,” he said. “Our resolve is intact and so is our admiration for the courage of the Ukrainian people during this difficult time.” He added that he would work in the coming days and weeks to fix European Union and bilateral legal issues to help French companies set up more military production facilities in Ukraine, without saying what these legal issues were. Sejourne also encouraged French companies to invest in Ukraine, mentioning the transport, energy, telecoms and water sectors. The visit follows that of British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Friday, where he unveiled new military funding for Ukraine and reassured the country that the West is still providing support. Sunak and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed abilateral security agreementfor the next 10 years. It will remain in effect until Ukraine acquires its hoped-for NATO membership, Zelenskyy said.

Putin waged a trade war long before bombing Ukraine. Which side is winning?,"Putin used tariffs, a naval blockade and bombed ports to target Ukrainian agricultural competition, but none worked.","Last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced he was shutting down the Black Sea to Ukrainian agricultural exports. The reason, ostensibly, was Ukraine’s second attempt to cripple the Kerch Bridge, Russia’s main artery to the Crimean Peninsula and key to its ammunition logistics. A massive explosion caught on camera in the small hours of July 17 left a section of road deck hanging askew over the Black Sea. In December, the head of Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU), Vasyl Malyuk, confirmed the SBU had developed the Sea Baby drones used in the operation. In retaliation, Russia said it was withdrawing from an agreement allowing the shipment of Ukrainian grain out of the Black Sea,brokereda year earlier by the United Nations and Turkey to prevent hunger among the world’s poorest. Marking its withdrawal, Moscow launched an overnight missile attack on Ukraine’s Odesa and Chernomorsk, two of the three ports authorised to export grain under the initiative, destroying grain silos, fuel oil and loading equipment. Two days later, Putin revealed the real reason for his change in strategy. In a staged conversation with his agriculture minister, Dmitry Patrushev, Putin said Russian farmers had lost $1.2bn and Russian fertiliser manufacturers $1.6bn, roughly half their profit margins, due to high costs for shipping, spare parts and financial transactions. Ukraine, too, has suffered from higher shipping costs stemming from Putin’s war and the conflict in Gaza, which has forced commercial shipping to detour around Africa. But Putin and Patrushev blamed the increase solely on Western sanctions. According to Putin, Russia showed “miracles of endurance and patience” hoping that its foreign colleagues would finally begin to “fully comply with the agreed and approved parameters and conditions”. Instead, Russia reaped “arrogance and impudence, promises and empty chatter”, he said. Although the West never sanctioned Russian grain or fertiliser, Putin’s argument was that sanctions on Russian banks and machinery imports effectively sanctioned agricultural industries. He also believed 200,000 tonnes of Russian fertiliser were being unofficially blocked in European ports. Russia sought to leverage Black Sea security to overturn Kyiv’s sanctions, as well. “He wants the fertiliser pipeline through Odesa to be reopened,” Kyiv School of Economics Director Tymofiy Mylovanov told Al Jazeera, referring to a pipeline built in 1981, when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union, to carry ammonia from the TogliattiAzot plant 500km (311 miles) east of Moscow to Odesa for export. A blast disabled the defunct pipeline last June. Russia accused Ukraine of sabotage. “There is no way Ukraine will reopen any kind of transit through Ukraine of any kind of Russian products,” Mylovanov said. “Russia is in a full-scale war with us and they want to trade through us. This is just not possible.” Russia’s very reason for agreeing to the grain initiative was to slow down Ukrainian exports, believed Mylovanov. Under the initiative Russia was entitled to inspect grain ships, but average daily inspections had fallen from 11 to five by early last year, said the UN, causing Ukrainian exports to fall from 4.3 million tonnes in October to 1.3 million tonnes in May. This was merely the latest tactic in a trade war that long predated Russia’s ground war, said Mylovanov. “Putin started placing … barriers to trade on Ukrainian agricultural products from grain to dairy as early as 2012,” he said. Russia “would impose certain tariffs and they would abandon them arbitrarily”. In doing this, Putin was weaponising uncertainty “to paralyse decision-making in agricultural companies and to deny investment in the capacity,” Mylovanov said. The construction of the Kerch Bridge may have been part of this trade war. The bridge “basically denied high-volume tankers [access] so Azov Sea ports became unavailable to Ukraine in 2016-2019. We had to rebuild our railroad routes to pass through Odesa, so farmers in the east were hurt by this”, he said. None of Putin’s tactics seemed to work. Ukraine’s goods, mainly agricultural, were becoming ever-more competitive with Russia’s. Exports rose from $33.5bn in 2016 to $63.1bn in 2021, World Bank data showed. Only the full-scale invasion changed that. Putin’s war cost the Ukrainian economy 29 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and 14 percent of its population. Its goods exports plummeted to $40.1bn. But Ukraine’s agriculture is now bouncing back, with a record harvest of 80 million tonnes – 58 million tonnes of it was grain. Russia harvested more than twice as much grain – 123 million tonnes – but its landmass is 28 times greater than Ukraine’s and its population five times greater. Ukraine is punching way above Russia’s weight. That is important because rising agricultural exports may now represent Ukraine’s best hope of prosecuting the war. Kyiv faces a gaping budget deficit of $43bn this year, which financial aid will only partly address and faces political hurdles in Brussels and Washington. Kyiv needs to maximise export revenues, and Russia is trying to starve it. “Ukraine, as today’s events show, cannot rely only on international grants and loans. You have to earn money yourself,” Odesa newspaper editor Oleg Suslov told Al Jazeera. “Russia understands this, too. Its desire to destroy the port infrastructure is aimed at reducing the flow of export earnings to Ukraine in the hope that this will destabilise the domestic economic situation and sow panic among the population,” he said. The longer-term strategy is geopolitical, said Mylovanov. “They want to get Ukraine off the market so … they can get monopoly positions and they can later weaponise or politicise them. For the Middle East, a lot of concerns are food security … If your major trading partner is just Russia, then they have some leverage.” In addition to attacking Ukraine’s Black Sea ports, Russia sent drones and missiles to destroy cranes and silos at Ukraine’s Danubian ports of Reni, Izmail and Vylkove, and damaged trucks at the ferry crossing of Orlivka. “In this way, Russia tried to demonstrate that it did not agree with the opening of a new grain corridor without its participation,” said Suslov. According to estimates by the Ukrainian government, from August to the end of 2023, Russia completely or partially destroyed about 180 port infrastructure facilities and 300,000 tonnes of grain. “To top it all off, Russia began to mine the sea channel [from Ukraine’s ports to Romania] with adjustable aerial bombs,” said Suslov. Russia also tried coercion. It fired warning shots at the Palau-flagged Sukru Okan, a merchant vessel, on August 14, as it tried to approach the Romanian port of Sulina – a major offloading point for freight floating down the Danube. When that did not work, it boarded it using a Ka-29 helicopter. With its financial lifeline at stake, Ukraine pushed back against Russia’s embargo with astounding success. On August 4, its naval drones attacked the Olenegorsky Gornyak, a Ropucha-class landing ship, just outside Novorossyisk harbour, supposedly a safe port to which Russia had relocated much of its Sevastopol-based fleet after Ukraine sank its Black Sea flagship in May. Daylight footage showed the Olenegorsky Gornyak listing severely to port as it was towed into harbour. The following night, Ukraine put a hole in the engine room of a Russian fuel tanker just south of the Kerch Bridge. Since both of these attacks happened off Russia’s Black Sea coast, they proved Ukraine’s claim that it could bottle up Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, deny Russia access to its territorial waters and provide a safe corridor for freight shipping until it reached NATO territorial waters off Romania and Bulgaria. When a German container ship, the Joseph Schulte, along with four other merchant ships, travelled safely from Ukrainian ports to Istanbul on August 15-17, Ukraine hailed it as proof of the naval operation’s success.    By the end of 2023, Ukraine had exported 15 million tonnes of goods through the corridor, two-thirds of them agricultural, in the six months since the deal with Russia collapsed, compared with 33 million tonnes for the entire year that the deal was in place. In other words, Russia’s departure from the Black Sea grain initiative has had virtually no impact. And Ukraine has not relied on the Black Sea alone. Last August, it opened a new border crossing to Romania along the Tisa River, with more to follow. In October, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced a new export route via rail through Moldova and Romania. Since its NATO airspace was immune to Russian attacks, Romania also suggested offloading grain at its Danubian ports of Braila and Galati onto barges that would take it to the port of Constanta on the Black Sea, where it can be reloaded onto ocean-going ships. Constanta’s port authority said it had reached its highest grain exports last year thanks to Ukrainian grain. Russia did not admit defeat. It attacked ships with missiles to drive up freight rates. One such attack on a Liberian-flagged tanker last November killed a sailor and raised rates by $20 a tonne overnight. The United Kingdom came to the rescue, negotiating with 14 shipping insurance companies a special mechanism to discount war risk insurance. Ukraine still isn’t out of the cornfield. Its truck convoys to European Union ports have encountered local opposition from farmers and truckers, who face competition from cheaper Ukrainian goods and services. Ukraine’s success in exporting grains has allowed world prices to drop, making it a victim of its own success. Ukraine’s wheat farmers were operating at a loss of $36 a tonne, Ukraine’s agriculture ministry said. And the onset of winter may bring mechanical and weather-related problems to export capacity. Still, Ukraine’s increasing share of the global market means it is winning against Russia’s trade war despite the embargo. Ukraine’s agriculture ministry said its overall exports last year were 7 percent higher in value compared with 2022, reaching $23bn, and its grain exports increased from 37 million tonnes to 43 million tonnes. “[Ukraine] has become a competitive player and if you look at the evolution of the share of global exports, Ukraine used to have 1-2 percent, and now in the top five grains it has 5, 8 sometimes 13 percent,” said Mylovanov. The results may affect Ukrainian optimism. “Many thought that the war would end in 2023,” said Suslov. “However, there is hope. Ukrainians believe in their Armed Forces, they believe in air defence. They believe in the support of partners. And they hope that the losses in manpower and military equipment that Russia received by the end of the second year of the war will finally reach those critical values that will force the aggressor to come to their senses and stop the massacre.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/12/long-before-bombing-ukraine-putin-waged-a-trade-war-he-is-still-losing-it
"Ukraine, Britain announce security agreement during Kyiv visit by PM Sunak",British prime minister also confirms 2.5 billion pounds ($3.2bn) in new aid for Ukraine for the next financial year.,"British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has signed a new security agreement with Ukraine’s president and announced an increase in military funding for the war-wracked country during a visit to Kyiv. Britain, one of Ukraine’s closest allies during the Russian invasion, will increase its support in the next financial year to 2.5 billion pounds ($3.2bn), an increase of 200 million pounds ($255m) on the previous two years, Sunak said on Friday. The funding would cover long-range missiles, air defence, artillery ammunition and maritime security. “Our opponents around the world believe that we have neither the patience nor resources for long wars, so waver now, and we embolden not just [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, but his allies in North Korea, Iran and elsewhere,” Sunak told a press conference. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukraine and Britain also signed an “unprecedented security agreement” on Friday, an accord that would remain in effect until Ukraine joins the NATO military alliance. “This is not simply a declaration. This is a reality that will come to fruition as a result of our cooperation, including security commitments from a major global power, the United Kingdom. If the UK and other countries had provided such a level of guarantees after 1991, there would have been no Russian aggression at all,” Zelenskyy wrote on the social media platform X. He added that the common goal was to ensure that an attack on Ukraine “will never happen again” once the war ends. I am glad to welcome@RishiSunakin Ukraine. Today marks a watershed moment in European history. Ukraine and the United Kingdom signed a new, unprecedented security agreement. This is not simply a declaration. This is a reality that will come to fruition as a result of our…pic.twitter.com/hRs9G1IM1P — Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa)January 12, 2024  During the press conference, Sunak urged his Western allies to maintain their support for Ukraine and warned that a Russian victory would encourage other authoritarian countries. “If Putin wins in Ukraine, he will not stop there,” Sunak said. Zelenskyy also told reporters that Ukraine was more positive now than in December about securing aid from the United States. Britain is the second-biggest donor of military aid to Ukraine after the US, giving a total of 4.6 billion pounds ($3.3bn) in 2022 and 2023. “I am here today with one message: The UK will also not falter,” Sunak said. “We will stand with Ukraine in their darkest hours and in the better times to come,” he added in his initial remarks after his arrival in the capital.    Sunak first visited Ukraine in November 2022, soon after he became prime minister. Britain has been one of Ukraine’s most vocal backers. Ahead of his visit, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev had warned that any move by Britain to deploy troops to Ukraine would be a “declaration of war against our country”. Both Ukraine and Russia are scrambling to replenish their weapons after 22 months of fighting and the potential for a protracted conflict. The roughly 1,500km (930-mile) front line has been largely static during winter, and both warring sides require artillery shells, missiles and drones that enable long-range strikes. Kyiv saysMoscow is receivingartillery shells and missiles from North Korea and drones from Iran. On January 4, the White House cited US intelligence officials as saying that Russia acquired ballistic missiles from North Korea and is seeking them from Iran. Zelenskyy is pushing his country’s Western allies to provide Ukraine with more support on top of the billions of dollars in military aid it has already received. This week he visited the Baltic countries Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia to rally support against Russia and search for new pledges. The Eastern European countries, which are also among Kyiv’s staunchest supporters, promised more missiles, drones, howitzers and artillery shells. Zelenskyy has warned that Ukraine particularly needs air defence systems to fend off recent Russian aerial barrages. More than 500 drones and missiles were fired at Ukraine from December 29 to January 2, according to officials in Kyiv. Sunak said the UK recognises that Ukrainian security “is our security”. “Today we are going further – increasing our military aid, delivering thousands of cutting-edge drones and signing a historic new security agreement to provide Ukraine with the assurances it needs for the long term,” he said. Elsewhere, however, support for Ukraine’s war effort is sputtering. A plan by US President Joe Biden’s administration to send $60bn in new funding to Kyiv is being held up in Congress. Europe’s pledge in March to provide 1 million artillery shells within 12 months has also fallen short with only about 300,000 delivered by the end of last year.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/12/uk-to-increase-military-funding-for-ukraine-as-pm-sunak-visits-kyiv
US imposes sanctions over transfer of North Korean missiles to Russia,"Measures target three Russian entities, one individual. US State Department says missiles for use in Ukraine war.","The United States has imposed sanctions on three Russian entities and one individual allegedly involved in the transfer and testing of North Korea’s ballistic missiles for alleged use by Moscow in itswar against Ukraine. The move comes after Washington and its allies criticisedthe exchangeof arms between North Korea and Russia. The US government denounced Russia’s acquisition of North Korean ballistic missiles and specified they were deployed against Ukraine on December 30 and January 2. “The DPRK’s transfer of ballistic missiles to Russia supports Russia’s war of aggression, increases the suffering of the Ukrainian people, and undermines the global nonproliferation regime,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said ina statementon Thursday, using the official acronym for North Korea, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. “We will not hesitate to take further actions,” he said. Since the start of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022, Moscow and Pyongyang have developed closer ties but have denied engaging in any arms deals. In September, North Korean leaderKim Jong Unheld a meeting with President Vladimir Putin in Russia’s Far East. High-ranking Russian officials have undertaken multiple visits to Pyongyang. Last week, the White House said Russia had used short-range ballistic missiles sourced from North Korea to conduct multiple strikes against Ukraine, citing newly declassified intelligence that was subsequently corroborated by a senior Ukrainian official. North Korea has been under a United Nations arms embargo since it first tested a nuclear bomb in 2006. UN Security Council resolutions, approved with Russian support, ban countries from trading weapons or other military equipment with North Korea.

"Russia doubles down on fast, cheap, unguided bombs to attack Ukraine","Russia produces more ballistic missiles, glide bombs and drones as Ukraine targets Russian military installations from afar.","Russia appears to be doubling down on glide bombs and ballistic missiles – unsophisticated, inexpensive bombs difficult to intercept – as well as drones, as its strategy for inflicting a new wave of destruction on Ukraine’s cities and infrastructure. Since December 29, Russia has launched almost daily barrages of drones and missiles of various types at Ukraine to probe for weaknesses in its aerial defences. Ukraine has been downing almost all of the drones and an impressive ratio of missiles. That changed on Monday, when Ukraine intercepted only 18 of a cocktail of 51 missiles Russia fired at the regions of Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhia and Khmelnytskyi. Those that got through killed at least four civilians. Part of Russia’s success appeared to be the use of six Iskander and eight Kinzhal ballistic missiles. These travel atterminal speedsof 9,000-12,000km/h (5,600 to 7,500mph) and are very difficult to intercept. Unlike cruise missiles, they can also be rendered immune to electronic warfare that interferes with GPS guidance because they carry inertial guidance systems that navigate by dead reckoning. Another reason for Russia’s success appeared to be that it had mapped weaknesses in Ukraine’s air defence over days of attacks. Ukrainian Air Force spokesman Yuri Ignat told reporters these two reasons explained the low kill rate on Monday. “The explanation is simple: they were flying on a ballistic trajectory, and into the regions where we can’t shoot them down,” Ignat said. Short-range ballistic missiles “appear to be more effective at penetrating or avoiding Ukrainian air defences,” said the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank. “Ukrainian air defences have intercepted 149 of a reported 166 Russian cruise missiles in intensified attacks since December 29, but have only intercepted a handful of the ballistic missiles that Russia has launched at Ukraine in the same period,” it said. Russia can only produce about 42 Iskander missiles and four Kinzhal missiles a month, said theISW, and was enlisting the production capabilities of Iran and North Korea to overwhelm Ukraine with firepower. US national security spokesman John Kirby told a White House briefing on January 4 Russia had used North Korean ballistic missiles against Ukraine on December 30 and January 2. Ukraine agreed. “There is no longer any disguise … as part of its outright genocidal war, the Russian Federation for the first time struck at the territory of Ukraine with missiles received from … North Korea,” said Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. A weapons expert told Reuters that the missile appeared to be a North Korean KN-23. “We are deeply concerned about the security implications that this cooperation has in Europe, on the Korean Peninsula, across the Indo-Pacific region, and around the world,” said a joint statement signed by the United States, United Kingdom, the European Union, Australia, Germany, Canada and nearly 40 other partner nations. There was further concern “that Russian negotiations to acquire close-range ballistic missiles from Iran are actively advancing”, Kirby told journalists. Such missiles could be traded for Russian long-range, nuclear-capable ballistic missile technology, Russia said last October. North Korea has also expressed interest in the technology. Russia has also experimented with glide bombs against Ukrainian front lines in the past few months with considerable success. These are air-launched free-fall bombs fitted with adjustable fins that enable them to fly further and navigate – but they are far cheaper to produce than guided missiles and are also immune to jamming. Glide bombs’ weakness is that aircraft must bring them to within about 25km (16 miles) of their target, exposing them to enemy fire. Ukraine seized such opportunities to down four Russian Sukhoi-34 bombers in the last week of December. But Russia evidently considers the bombs a success worth developing. On Wednesday, the state-owned TASS news agency said Russia would put a new glide bomb into production, without specifying its capabilities, suggesting that it has engineered improvements. The Drel glide bombs are to enter active service this year and may present a new challenge to Ukrainian defenders. Russia also said it will invest $7.7bn in almost tripling domestic drone production by 2030, said First Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov on January 6. “The annual production volume of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) – excluding educational UAVs – is planned at 32,500 units,” Belousov told TASS. “This is almost three times higher than current production volumes.” Put together, the three technologies – glide bombs, ballistic missiles and drones – could overwhelm Ukraine’s ability to intercept them. “It is clear that there is a shortage of anti-aircraft guided missiles, no one hides it,” Ukrainian Air Force spokesman Yuri Ignat told a news conference on Tuesday, after Russia had launched about 500 missiles and drones over several days, consuming intercept missiles. NATO’s Support and Procurement Agency said this week it would spend $5.5bn to support the procurement of 1,000 Patriot missiles for members and create a Patriot production plant in Germany, but it was not clear that any of the new missiles would go to Ukraine. To economise on Patriot missiles, Ukraine has increased its kill rate of Shahed drones using mobile air defence units carried on pick-up trucks. Sometimes, these are sophisticated man-portable air defence surface-to-air guided missiles. Sometimes, they are nothing more than World War II-era MG42 heavy machine guns. Ukraine also targeted Russian military installations from afar, setting its sights in particular on the Saky airfield on the Crimean Peninsula. Russia claimed to have fended off a large wave of Ukrainian drones and missiles targeting Saky on Friday. Ukraine claimed success in Saky on Saturday, when Ukraine’s defence intelligence and air force said they led an operation to take out Russian radar positions around the Saky airfield. Russian sources said up to four Storm Shadow cruise missiles struck an administrative building at the Saky airfield on the same day. The defence intelligence operation also destroyed an ammunition depot at the village of Hryshyne. There were other attempts to attack targets in Crimea during the week, some successful. Ukraine claimed to have destroyed a communications centre in the Crimean city of Yevpatoria, which co-ordinated Crimean air defence. Ukrainian missiles also struck a Russian command post near the Crimean port of Sevastopol on January 3. But much more damage was clearly intended. Russia claimed to have shot down 10 Ukrainian missiles over Crimea on January 3, another 36 Ukrainian drones over Crimea and a Neptune missile over the Black Sea on Friday, and another five drones and 10 missiles on January 6. Ukraine’s most important success of the week may have been destroying a bridge Russia was building to better supply its forces in southern Ukraine, disrupting a major intended logistics artery. “The Ukrainians … set back almost a half-year of serious Russian supply planning,” wrote Stefan Korsha, a senior defence correspondent at Kyiv Post. Petro Andriushchenko, adviser to the mayor of Mariupol, said, “Now the launch of a direct railway from Russia is closed for a long time.” Ukraine also scored successes in Russia itself. On January 4, a Ukrainian defence intelligence operation destroyed a Sukhoi-34 bomber on the Shagol airfield in Chelyabinsk, 1,500km (932 miles) east of Moscow, Ukraine said. The next day Ukraine’s defence intelligence said one of its units destroyed two Pantsir-S1 air defence units in the Russian region of Belgorod, north of Ukraine. And on Monday Russian media reported a blast on a section of railway near the city of Nizhny Tagil, 1,400km (870 miles) east of Moscow. Russia claimed to have shot down 10 airborne targets over the city of Belgorod on January 4.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/11/russia-doubles-down-on-fast-cheap-unguided-bombs-to-strike-ukraine
"NATO allies Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria sign deal to clear Black Sea mines","Initiative limited to three nations aims to make shipping safer, including for vessels transporting grain from Ukraine.","Turkey, Romania and Bulgaria have signed an agreement to clear mines drifting in the Black Sea that have posed a threat to shipping since the start ofRussia’s war in Ukraine. On Thursday, Turkish Defence Minister Yasar Guler said the deal establishes a Mine Countermeasures Task Group among the three NATO allies to deal with the mines as he met in Istanbul with his Romanian counterpart, Angel Tilvar, and Bulgarian Deputy Defence Minister Atanas Zapryanov. Zapryanov said mines pose a “danger to ports, communication networks and key water infrastructure” while Tilvar added that Russia’s “disdain for the norms of international law and its aggression in the Black Sea is not only a regional problem but also a problem with global consequences”. Sea mines have posed a threat to Ukraine’s Black Sea export routes since Russia’s invasion in February 2022, and several commercial ships have been hit, including a bulk carrier heading to a Danube River port to load grain in December. Ukraine has two main ports on the Danube – Reni and Izmail – which have become central to the country’s grain exports since Russia’s blockade of Ukraine’s Black Sea ports andMoscow’s withdrawalin July from a United Nations-backed agreement that had allowed grain shipments safe passage across the Black Sea. Three minehunting ships from each country and one command-control ship will be assigned to the initiative, a Turkish Ministry of National Defence official said. The initiative is open to only the three countries, whose naval commanders will form a committee to run the operation, Guler said, adding that it might include other Black Sea states after the war ends. Last week, Turkey said it would not allow two minehunter vessels donated toUkraine by Britainto transit its waters en route to the Black Sea because it would violate the 1936 Montreux Convention, an international pact concerning wartime passage of the Bosphorus and Dardanelles strait. At the start of the Ukraine war, Turkey enacted the convention to block the passage of Russian or Ukrainian ships through the two straits and also told non-Black Sea states not to send warships.

Zelenskyy says Western hesitation on aid emboldens Putin,President Zelenskyy says air defences must be strengthened and ammunition replenished during visit to Lithuania.,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned that Western hesitation on aid is emboldening Russia – comments he made during a visit to Lithuania as he embarked on a previously unannounced tour of three Baltic states. On Wednesday, Zelenskyy told his Lithuanian counterpart that Ukraine must strengthen its air defences and replenish its ammunition supplies as Russia intensifies its missile and drone attacks in its nearly two-year war on Ukraine. “We have proven that Russia can be stopped, that deterrence is possible,” he said after talks with Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda. “Sometimes, the insecurity of partners regarding financial and military aid to Ukraine only increases Russia’s courage and strength,” he said. “He [Russian President Vladimir Putin] won’t finish this [war] until we all finish him together,” Zelenskyy said, adding, “Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Moldova may be next.” The Ukrainian leader also thanked Lithuania for its military assistance and goodwill. “We know how tiring this long-running war is, and we are interested in Ukraine’s complete victory in it as soon as possible,” Nauseda told reporters.  He said Vilnius would send M577 armoured vehicles to Kyiv next month, part of a previously announced 200-million-euro ($220m) package of military aid. Announcing his arrival on social media on Wednesday, Zelenskyy said he would go on to Latvia and Estonia in the coming days. “Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are our reliable friends and principled partners. Today, I arrived in Vilnius before going to Tallinn and Riga,” Zelenskyy wrote on X. “Security, EU and NATO integration, cooperation on electronic warfare and drones, and further coordination of European support are all on the agenda.” Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are our reliable friends and principled partners.Today, I arrived in Vilnius before going to Tallinn and Riga.I will hold talks with the President, Prime Minister, Speaker of the Seimas, as well as meet with politicians, the media, and the… — Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa)January 10, 2024  In Estonia, Prime Minister Kaja Kallas reiterated the country’s support for Ukraine. “These are crucial times, and we need to keep our focus,” she said. Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said that Tallinn was ready “to allocate 0.25 percent of its GDP to military aid to Ukraine” over the next four years. “It’s way cheaper to support Ukraine now compared to the price the international community would have to pay if Russia would reach the goals of this merciless aggression,” said Tsahkna. The countries on the Baltic Sea are among Ukraine’s staunchest political, financial and military supporters. Zelenskyy’s visit comes ahead of the second anniversary of Russia’s February 2022 full-scaleinvasion of Ukraine. With the prospects of a protracted war growing, Ukraine has been appealing to its Western allies for more financial and military assistance. Ukraine has come under intenseRussian shellingin recent weeks and retaliated with strikes on Russia’s border city ofBelgorod. A European Union aid package worth 50 billion euros ($55bn) has been in limbo following a veto by Hungary, while the United States Congress remains divided on sending additional aid to Kyiv.

"US, Ukraine, dozens more condemn alleged Russia-North Korea arms transfers",Foreign ministers of nearly 50 countries say such activities breach UN sanctions on North Korea.,"Dozens of countries have joined Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States in condemning alleged ballistic missile transfers between North Korea and Russia, which they said were in breach of United Nations sanctions. In a joint statement, European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the foreign ministers from some 47 countries including Argentina, Australia, Guatemala, Japan and South Korea, condemned the alleged arms transfers in the “strongest possible terms”, saying the weapons had been used against Ukraine onDecember 30 and January 2. “The transfer of these weapons increases the suffering of the Ukrainian people, supports Russia’s war of aggression and undermines the global non-proliferation regime,” Wednesday’s statement said, noting such cooperation would also provide technical and military insights to North Korea. “We are deeply concerned about the security implications that this cooperation has in Europe, on the Korean Peninsula, across the Indo-Pacific region, and around the world,” it said. In a briefing earlier, US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Russia had since used more North Korean weapons in Ukraine, including one that landed in Kharkiv, the country’s second biggest city. The US and its allies plan to raise the issue with the UN Security Council (UNSC) on Wednesday, he added. The statement added that weapons procurement and supply between Pyongyang and Moscow was in breach of multiple UNSC resolutions imposed from 2006 in response to North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment when asked about the alleged weapons transfers. Reports emerged as early as 2022 that Russia was planning to buy weapons from North Korea for use in its invasion of Ukraine. In August last year, the US’s United Nations envoy Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the organisation that Moscow was negotiating “potential deals for significant quantities and multiple types of munitions”. Speculation intensified when the countries’ two leaders held a summit the following month at the Vostochny Cosmodrome, Russia’s most important satellite launch centre. Over some five hours, Vladimir Putin showed Kim Jong Un around the site in eastern Russia and said Moscow would help Pyongyang build satellites. Kim promised support for what he said was Russia’s “just fight”, in a comment that was viewed as being a reference to Ukraine. Kim later toured Russian weapons factories and was shown the country’s latest military equipment. Just two months later, North Korea announced the successful launch of its first military spy satellite, following the failure of two earlier attempts in May and August. It has said it plans to launchthree more this year. North Korea’s state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported on Tuesday that Kim was this week visiting arms factories where he emphasised the “strategic importance of the production of major weapons”. Kim also said the time has come to define South Korea as a state “most hostile” towards his country, according to the KCNA. He accused Seoul of inciting confrontation and an arms buildup while urging his country to step up its military capabilities for self-defence and its nuclear war deterrent. He described worsening relations on the divided peninsula as a “new phase of change” and “unavoidable reality”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/10/us-ukraine-dozens-more-condemn-alleged-russia-north-korea-arms-transfers

Russia begins city evacuation as it swaps cross-border strikes with Ukraine,Residents of Belgorod are moved away from the border while Ukraine deflects another barrage of drones and missiles.,"Russia has partially evacuated Belgorod and has requests for further removals following Ukrainian air strikes on the border city. About 300 residents from the city have been temporarily moved to safety further from the border, Belgorod region’s Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Monday. The evacuation comes as Russia and Ukraine increasingly trade drone and missile strikes. “Some 300 residents of Belgorod, who decided to temporarily evacuate, are at the moment being housed in temporary shelter centres in Stary Oskol, Gubkin and the Korochansky district,” which are further from the border, Gladkov said in a video posted on Telegram. Meanwhile, Ukraine reported on Monday that at least four people were killed as Russia launched more than 50 missiles and drones in the early hours. With the war on the front line in eastern Ukraine bogged down in winter trenches, Russia has concentrated on air strikes against Ukraine’s infrastructure, and what it says are military targets. However, civilian areas have been regularly hit. In response, Kyiv has begun sending its own drones and missiles at targets in the occupied east, as well as inside Russia itself. On December 30, 25 people were killed in Belgorod. It was the deadliest civilian toll in Russia since Moscow invaded its neighbour in February 2022. Ukraine has launchedfurther attackssince, spreading panic in the city, which sits about 30km (19 miles) from the border. The governor offered residents the option of evacuation on Friday. “Over the past 24 hours, we received 1,300 requests to send Belgorod children to school camps away from the city, in other regions,” Gladkov said.    Meanwhile, Russia continued its attacks on Ukraine on Monday, hitting residential areas and commercial sites as it launched more than 50 missiles and drones. At least four civilians were killed and some 30 injured, authorities reported, in the attacks in central and western parts of the country, as well as near the front lines. Ukraine’s air force said it had shot down 18 out of 51 projectiles overnight, including 32 cruise missiles and eight Iranian-made Shahed drones. “Critical infrastructure facilities, industrial civilian and military facilities were attacked,” the air force said. A shopping centre and more than two dozen private buildings were damaged in the southern city of Kryvyi Rih, Governor Serhiy Lysak reported, with one killed. “The mad enemy once again struck civilians,” Lysak wrote on the Telegram messaging app. “Directed missiles at people.” In the eastern city of Kharkiv, an industrial site and an educational facility were damaged in at least four missile strikes, Governor Oleh Synyehubov said. Four people were wounded in the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia, where Governor Yuriy Malashko reported five explosions and said residential areas had been hit. Officials in the western Khmelnytskyi region reported at least six blasts but gave no immediate details of the damage. A senior presidential adviser said one person had been killed, according to the Reuters news agency. All of Ukraine was under air raid alert for more than three hours on Monday.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/8/russia-says-300-evacuated-from-city-of-belgorod-over-ukraine-attacks

Putin praises Russian ‘defenders’ as Ukraine deflects another barrage,The Russian leader marked the eve of Orthodox Christmas with a call for ‘justice’ as drones and missiles struck Ukraine.,"Celebrating Orthodox Christmas, President Vladimir Putin has pledged to support soldiers defending Russia as his army sent another barrage of drones and missiles at Ukraine overnight. Speaking on the eve of Sunday’s Orthodox Christmas, the Kremlin chief promised military families that his government would offer increased backing to “Russian warriors” engaged in the invasion of Ukraine, launched in February 2022. Unlike last year, Putin did not call this year for a ceasefire. “Many of our men, our courageous, heroic guys, Russian warriors, even now, on this holiday, defend the interests of our country with arms in hand,” he said as he met bereaved families of Russian soldiers who have died in Ukraine. However, anger persists in some quarters over Russia’s treatment of its soldiers in the “meatgrinder” of Ukraine. In particular, following a mobilisation drive in September 2022, a lack of training and equipment was criticised. On Saturday, the wives of Russians mobilised to fight in Ukraine demanded the return of their husbands from the front. Many of those soldiers were spending Christmas in trenches, with the front-line war largely bogged down. Amid the stalemate, air raids have increased in frequency and intensity. Ukraine’s air force reported on Telegram on Sunday that it had shot down 21 out of 28 drones launched by Russia overnight, largely in the south and east of the country. Three cruise missiles also targeted the country, it said, without offering further details. “The enemy is shifting the focus of attack to the frontline territories – Kherson and Dnipropetrovsk regions were attacked by drones,” Air Force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat told national television. The drones were predominantly destroyed by mobile teams, saving “scarce” air defence missiles, he added. Dnipropetrovsk regional authorities said on Telegram that 12 people were injured in a drone attack in the city of Dnipro. The previous day, the Ukrainian authorities said a Russian missile attack killed 11 people and injured 10 in the eastern city of Pokrovsk. A Russian-installed official accused Kyiv of shelling parts of Donetsk now under Moscow’s control. Orthodox Christmas celebrations were cancelled in the Russia border city of Belgorod, where 25 people were killed on December 30 in Ukraine’s deadliest cross-border attack of the war. The city has come under further sporadic rocket attacks within the past week. In a separate greeting issued on the Kremlin’s website, Putin called on Russians to follow the “unshakable” values of “goodness, mercy and justice” and on the Russian Orthodox Church to help strengthen “the institution of families” and patriotism. Facing a presidential election in March, Putin has sought to further extol “traditional values”. The Orthodox Church has long been a reliable pillar of his regime and has helped stoke support for the invasion of Russia’s neighbour. Ukraine is also Orthodox, but this year it changed its tradition of joining Russia in celebrating Christmas on January 7. Instead, it officiallymarked the December 25 holidayfor the first time as part of an ongoing effort to remove Russian influence from the country. The change was enacted in a law signed by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in July, reflecting both the Ukrainians’ dismay with the 23-month-old Russian invasion and their assertion of anational identity.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/7/putin-praises-russian-defenders-as-ukraine-deflects-another-barrage

Ukraine says Russian missile attack kills 11 in eastern town,"Eight people were wounded after Russian forces hit the town of Pokrovsk with S-300 missiles, the regional governor said.","At least 11 people, including five children, have been killed by a Russian missile attack in and around the eastern Ukrainian town of Pokrovsk, according to the regional governor. Eight people were also wounded when Russian missiles hit the area, Vadym Filashkin, the governor of the Ukrainian-controlled part of the Donetsk region, said on Saturday. “The main blow was dealt to Pokrovsk and Rivne in the community of Myrnograd,” he wrote on the Telegram messaging app. He said S-300 missiles had been used in a series of attacks and one hit a house of a family of six. Filashkin released photographs showing rescuers working through the debris in the aftermath of the bombardment. He said the attack showed Russian forces were “trying to inflict as much grief as possible on our land”. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in his nightly video address, expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and accused Russia of once again deliberately targeting civilian objects. “And Russia must feel – feel every time – that none of these attacks will end without consequences for the terrorist state,” Zelenskyy said. The town of Pokrovsk, about 50km (30 miles) from the front line of the fighting, had already been hit by adeadly bombardment last August, which left at least eight people dead and 82 injured. Earlier on Saturday, Ukraine’s military claimed it successfully attacked the Saki military air base in the west of the Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula. “Saki airfield! All targets were hit!” Air Force commander Mykola Oleshchuk wrote on Telegram. Russian officials did not comment on the alleged attack but Russia’s Defence Ministry said in the early hours of Saturday that it had successfully downed four Ukrainian missiles over the peninsula overnight. Later on Saturday, the ministry reported that its air defence forces had shot down six anti-ship missiles over the Black Sea. Ukraine has targeted Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014, since the start of Moscow’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Meanwhile, as Russia’s nearly two-year-long war in Ukraine continues, the Kharkiv region prosecutor’s office provided evidence on Saturday that Russia attacked Ukraine with missiles supplied by North Korea, showcasing the fragments. Russia attacked Kharkiv with several missiles this week, killing two people and injuring more than 60 in one of its biggest missile and drone raids since the start of the war. “The production method is not very modern. There are deviations from standard Iskander missiles, which we previously saw during strikes on Kharkiv. This missile is similar to one of the North Korean missiles,” Dmytro Chubenko, the spokesperson for the prosecutor’s office, told media as he displayed the remnants. He said the missile was slightly bigger in diameter than the Russian Iskander missile, while its nozzle, internal electrical windings and rear parts were also different. On Friday, theUnited States saidRussia was using ballistic missiles from North Korea and seeking close-range ballistic missiles from Iran. In apost on Xon Friday, United Kingdom Defence Minister Grant Shapps warned, “The world has turned its back on Russia, forcing Putin into the humiliation of going cap in hand to North Korea to keep his illegal invasion going. In doing so, Russia has broken multiple UNSC resolutions and put the security of another world region at risk.” United Nations Security Council resolutions – approved with Russian support – ban countries from trading weapons or other military equipment with North Korea. While the Kremlin has not yet commented on the recent evidence, relations between Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un have warmed in recent months, with the two leaders also meeting in person in Russia last September.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/6/ukraine-says-russian-missile-attack-kills-11-in-eastern-town
"Russia used North Korean missiles in Ukraine, US says",The United States also expressed concerns that Russia is seeking close-range ballistic missiles from Iran.,"The United States has said that Russia is using ballistic missiles from North Korea and is seeking close-range ballistic missiles from Iran. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said on Thursday that recently declassified intelligence found that North Korea had provided Moscow with the weapons, at least one of which was fired into Ukraine on December 30, landing in an open field in the Zaporizhia region. Russia also launched “multiple” of the North Korean missiles onTuesdayduring an overnight attack, he added. Kirby also said that a Russia-Iran deal had not been completed but that the US “is concerned that Russia’s negotiations to acquire close-range ballistic missiles from Iran are actively advancing”. He said Washington and its allies will now raise the matter at the United Nations Security Council as it signals a breach of US sanctions against North Korea. The Biden administration has repeatedly looked to make the case that the Kremlin has become dependent on North Korea and Iran for the weapons it needs to continue its military operation in Ukraine and has disclosed findings it says prove that. So far, North Korea and Iran are largely isolated on the international stage for their nuclear programmes and human rights records. In October, the White House said that North Korea had delivered more than 1,000 containers of military equipment and munitions to Moscow. Britain on Thursday condemned Russia’s use of North Korean missiles in recent attacks against Ukraine. “We urge North Korea to cease its arms supply to Russia,” the UK’s Foreign Office spokesperson said in a statement. Earlier on Thursday, Ukraine announced that its air force had conducted a raid on a Russian command post near the occupied city of Sevastopol and hit a military unit in a separate attack on the Crimean Peninsula. Air Force Commander Mykola Oleshchuk posted a video on the Telegram app showing smoke rising from an explosion near Sevastopol, a Crimean port that serves as the main headquarters of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet. “Thanks again to the Air Force pilots and everyone who planned the operation for perfect combat work,” he said. The Moscow-installed governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhayev, described the attack as “the most massive in recent times”. He said one person was hospitalised after a piece of shrapnel struck. Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had foiled a Ukrainian attack, destroying 10 incoming missiles over the peninsula.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/4/russia-used-north-korean-missiles-in-ukraine-us-says

"Russia, Ukraine exchange hundreds of prisoners in largest release of war",More than 470 prisoners of war return home on both sides after the swap deals stalled in the latter half of 2023.,"Russia and Ukraine have exchanged hundreds of prisoners of war in the biggest single release of captives since Russia’s invasion began in February 2022. Ukrainian officials said on Wednesday that 230 of its prisoners were released while Russia said 248 of its soldiers were returned after mediation by the United Arab Emirates. While the two sides have gone through several exchanges during the war, swap deals stalled in the latter half of last year. The latest exchange was the first in almost five months. “More than 200 of our soldiers and civilians have been returned from Russian captivity,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced in a post on the Telegram messaging app that included a video of uniformed men celebrating. Ukraine’s human rights ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, said 230 Ukrainian prisoners, including six civilians, had been released, marking what he said was the 49th exchange between the two sides. Kyiv said this was the largest documented swap of troops so far. Some of the Ukrainians had been held since 2022. Among them were some who fought in milestone battles for Ukraine’s Snake Island and port city of Mariupol. The Russian Ministry of Defence said 248 of its soldiers had been returned after “complex” negotiations by the UAE. Russian officials offered no other details of the exchange. Also onWednesday, Russia said it shot down 12 missiles fired at one of its southern regions bordering Ukraine. The governor of Russia’s Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said the situation “continues to remain tense” after Ukraine launched repeated missile and drone attacks. While there have been no reports on casualty numbers from the latest attack, Gladkov said authorities were evacuating residents near possibly unexploded munitions with bomb disposal units called in to evaluate the danger. Defence Ministry technicians were working on disposing of an unexploded projectile, and about 600 residents from 323 houses within a 500-metre (550-yard) radius had been evacuated, he said. Gladkov added that several other villages also came under fire in Wednesday’s attack and a power line was knocked out. Russia’s Defence Ministry said Ukraine fired six Tochka-U ballistic missiles and six guided missiles from a Vilkha heavy multiple rocket launcher. Ukraine has escalated its attacks on Belgorod over the New Year period after Russia launched some of its most significant attacks on Ukraine since the war began. On Tuesday, Kyiv said Moscow had launched more than 300 attack drones and missiles of various kinds across Ukraine since Friday. Russian President Vladimir Putin has promised that Kyiv’s attacks on Belgorod would “not go unpunished”.

Ukrainian missiles target Russian border regions in retaliatory strikes,Recent escalation sees both sides deploying urban warfare tactics as renewed fighting erupts to the east in Bakhmut.,"Ukraine has launched air attacks on regions in Russia and occupied east Ukraine as the recent escalation of the war between the two countries continued. Russian officials reported on Wednesday that Ukrainian missiles targeted Belgorod and Kursk in southern Russia, as well as the Crimean Peninsula, annexed in 2014, in the latest in a series of deadly tit-for-tat attacks that began last week and have killed dozens of civilians. The overnight assault came a day after Russia struck Ukraine’s two largest cities, Kyiv and Kharkiv, with several dozen missiles and drones, killing five. Russia’s Ministry of Defence reported on Telegram that it had destroyed 12 Ukrainian missiles – six Tochka-U ballistic missiles and six guided missiles – over the Belgorod region. A Ukrainian attack the previous day had killed one person, said regional Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov. No casualties were reported from the latest attack, but the situation, he said, “continues to be tense”. Ukraine also hit the Kursk region, to the north of Belgorod, damaging infrastructure and causing power cuts, regional Governor Roman Starovoyt posted on Telegram. And, in occupied Crimea, the Russian-installed governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhaev, reported that a Ukrainian missile had been downed overnight. Ukraine rarely comments on its attacks on Russian soil. During the war, it has sporadically targeted border villages, launching missiles from an area blanketed by thick forests. As details on the Ukrainian strikes emerged, Yuriy Malashko, the head of Ukraine’s regional military administration, reported that the Zaporizhia region had been hit by 134 Russian strikes over the past 24 hours, killing two people. The spiral of tit-for-tat provocations started on Friday, when Russia launched one of its biggest attacks since the war started almost two years ago, its drones and missiles killing at least 31 people and damaging infrastructure. Despite insisting it only targets military infrastructure, Moscow appears to have shifted its focus to urban warfare, hitting civilians and destroying infrastructure, leaving many struggling to stay warm. Kyiv responded on Saturday, shelling Belgorod in an attack that killed more than two dozen people, according to Russia. President Vladimir Putin dubbed the assault a “terrorist” attack, saying it would “not go unpunished”. Ukraine said on Tuesday that Russia had launched more than 300 attack drones and missiles since the end of last year, including that day’s assault on Kyiv and Kharkiv. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pledged that Russia would have to “answer for every life taken away”. The spike in tensions comes against a backdrop of renewed fighting in eastern Ukraine, with the contested town of Bakhmut a hot point. Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander of the Ukrainian army’s ground forces, said on Telegram that Russia was on the offensive, striking the Lyman area with guided aerial bombs as its forces regroup. Amid the recent spate of attacks, Ukraine has been pressing to reinvigorate Western support, which has appeared to flag in recent months. Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski on Wednesday called for Western nations to supply Ukraine with long-range missiles to enable it to strike Russian launch sites and command centres. “We should respond to the latest onslaught on Ukraine in language that Putin understands: by tightening sanctions so that he cannot make new weapons with smuggled components,” he added. The Russian barrage of missiles and drones in recent days has drawn renewed condemnation from across Europe. Charles Michel, president of the European Council, reiterated the EU’s support for Ukraine, saying Russia’s air attacks showed it was not interested in peace talks. Norway announced it was clearing the direct sale of weapons to Ukraine. Norway’s Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said: “In the extraordinary security situation resulting from Russia’s war of aggression, it is crucial that we continue to support Ukraine.” The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) condemned the “continuing and intensifying aerial attacks by Russia in its war against Ukraine”. However, Russia’s permanent mission to the OSCE blasted the organisation, complaining that it had failed to condemn the “barbaric missile attacks in Belgorod”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/3/ukraine-targets-russian-border-regions-in-retaliatory-strikes

Russia continues to step up assault on Ukraine with missile barrage,Russia has escalated its attacks on Ukraine as its invasion enters a third calendar year.,"Russia has maintained its recent intensification of air attacks on Ukraine as it unleashed a huge overnight assault. Hundreds of Russian missiles and drones struck the capital, Kyiv, and Kharkiv on Tuesday. The intensified attack on the country’s two largest cities came just a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin pledged to exact “revenge” for adeadly assaulton the Russian city of Belgorod. However, the Russian strikes follow a trend that has seen itescalate its air attackson Ukraine in recent days. With the front line largely bogged down in trench warfare, Moscow has returned to its tactic from last winter, during which it targeted infrastructure, especially energy and heating, leaving millions of Ukrainians struggling to stay warm. That has seen a hike in civilian casualties amid numerous strikes in urban areas. Following Tuesday’s attacks, Russia’s Ministry of Defence claimed that it had destroyed all “military-industrial” installations targeted. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said four people had been killed and at least 92 injured in Tuesday’s attacks, noting that Russia had launched about 170 Shahed attack drones and dozens of different missiles at Ukraine since the last day of 2023. Russia, he said, would “answer for every life taken away”. Ukraine struck back shortly afterwards, sending four Alder MLRS missiles towards Belgorod. All were intercepted by Russian forces, according to regional Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov. Local authorities reported that one person had been hospitalised. “For the third day already, our air defenders are doing incredible work,” Zelenskyy said on Telegram messenger. “This is one of the most extensive strikes on the capital,” said Al Jazeera reporter Assed Baig from Kyiv. “We understand there are parts of the city without electricity and mobile connection.” The attacks on Kyiv came during peak hours. Sirens rang through the city as rescue services rushed to areas hit by debris from missiles downed by Ukraine’s air defence systems. Earlier, Ukraine’s air force said it had intercepted 35 drones that Russia launched after midnight, targeting several cities. Four strikes on Kharkiv killed at least one person and injured 41, according to Oleg Sinegubov, the governor of the Kharkiv region. The latest escalation in the war began late on Thursday, when Russia launched a drone and missile attack across Ukraine, killing at least 31 and injuring about 160 people. The Ukrainian forces said they had never seen so many locations attacked simultaneously. On Saturday, Ukraine shelled the border city of Belgorod. Russia said more than two dozen people had been killed, including five children, in the shelling. Ukraine’s officials have not accepted responsibility for a series of strikes on Russian territory. Describing the assault on Belgorod as a “terrorist attack”, Putin pledged to mete out punishment during a visit to a military hospital on Monday. By this point, Russia had already rung in the new year by launching a record 90 Shahed-style drones towards Ukraine. Most of the drones were downed by Ukrainian forces, but five people were reportedly killed and eight injured in the Black Sea port city of Odesa. In his New Year speech on Monday, Zelenskyy, who is struggling to secureincreased supportfrom the United States and the European Union, promised to raise Ukraine’s production of weapons. The country will build at least a million drones, he said, promising Russia will face the “wrath” of it. The increased intensity of the war could yet help Ukraine’s drive to convince its partners of the dangers posed by Russia and the need to send more funding and weapons. Following Tuesday’s attacks, Kyiv reiterated its desperate need. Ukraine’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement urging faster supplies of air defence systems, combat drones, and long-range missiles. Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called on European allies to cease contact with Russian diplomats and to transfer frozen Russian assets to serve Ukraine’s needs. Amid Tuesday’s barrage, Poland, which last weekreportedthat a Russian missile had briefly passed through its airspace, said it had mobilised two pairs of F-16 fighter jets and an air tanker. Later, the planes returned to the base, judging that the threat had diminished.

Putin vows to intensify strikes on Ukraine after deadly Belgorod attack,"At least five people are killed in New Year’s Day attacks on Odesa, southern Ukraine and Russian-occupied Donetsk.","Russian President Vladimir Putin has promised to intensify strikes on Ukraine after an unprecedented attack on the Russian city of Belgorod over the weekend. Saturday’s air attack killed at least 25 people and wounded more than 100, according to Russian officials. Russia has blamed Ukraine for the attack, which was one of the deadliest to take place on Russian soil since Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine started more than 22 months ago. “We’re going to intensify the strikes. No crime against civilians will rest unpunished – that’s for certain,” Putin said on Monday during a visit to a military hospital. He said Russia would continue hitting what he called “military installations”. “We are doing that today, and tomorrow, we will continue doing it,” Putin said. Putin previously called the destruction in Belgorod a “terrorist attack” and accused Ukrainian forces of targeting “the city centre, where people were walking before New Year’s Eve”. He said Ukraine was being used by the West to “settle its problems” and insisted the course of the war was changing in Russia’s favour. The Russian Ministry of Defence said Ukraine hit Belgorod with two missiles and several rockets. It said most of the weapons were shot down, but some debris fell on the city. Vyacheslav Gladkov, governor of the Belgorod region, said the attack damaged 30 apartment buildings and several houses and cars. Ukrainian officials rarely acknowledge responsibility for attacks on Russian territory. At least five people were killed inNew Year’s Day attackson southern Ukraine’s Odesa region and the Russian-occupied eastern city of Donetsk. A 15-year-old boy was killed and seven people were wounded when falling debris from one of 87 downed drones hit a residential building in the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa, the head of the region’s military administration, Oleh Kiper, said. In the western city of Lviv, Russian attacks severely damaged a museum dedicated to Roman Shukhevych, a Ukrainian nationalist and military commander who fought for Ukrainian independence during World War II. University buildings in the town of Dubliany were also damaged. Writing on social media, Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi described the strike as “symbolic and cynical”, adding, “This is a war for our history.” Four people were killed and 13 wounded in Ukrainian shelling of Russian-occupied areas of Donetsk, according to the region’s Kremlin-installed leader, Denis Pushilin. Russian state media reported that a journalist was among the victims but provided no details.

Denis Pushilin, the Russian-installed head of the broader Donetsk region, said four people had been killed in Donetsk, accusing Ukraine of “massive shelling from multiple launch rocket systems”. At least 14 people had been injured, he added. Oleh Kiper, the governor of the Odesa region, meanwhile, said one person had been killed after a Russian air raid on Odesa. Kiper said that Ukraine’s air defence systems were engaged in repelling the drone attack, but the falling debris caused several fires in residential buildings in different parts of the city, and at least three people had been injured. A social media video, posted by Odesa Mayor Henadii Trukhanov, showed him inspecting a damaged apartment with broken windows. “They say that how you welcome the New Year is how you will live the year,” Trukhanov said in the post. “Well, this year Ukraine will break this rule: We will persevere and we will win. Ukraine’s Air Force said that Russian air attacks also targeted the Mykolaiv and Dnipro regions, as well as the city of Lviv. Air attacks have escalated since Friday when Russia launched some 158 missiles and drones on Ukraine’s major cities in a barrage thatkilled at least 30people and injured more than 140. That was followed on Saturday by a Ukrainian attack on the Russian border town of Belgorod in which at least21 people were killed and 111 injured. With Moscow promising to retaliate, on Sunday it launched a new aerial bombardment of Ukraine, targeting Kharkiv, the country’s second biggest city, withsix missiles, as well as drones.

Russia targets Ukraine ‘military’ sites in retaliation for Belgorod attack,"Kharkiv, Kyiv and other cities attacked in the latest wave of attacks, while missile alert sounded in Russia’s Belgorod.","Russia says it has targeted Ukrainian military sites in the capital Kyiv and Kharkiv in a new wave of drone and missile attacks in days, in retaliation for a deadly attack a day earlier on the city of Belgorod. The Russian defence ministry said on Sunday it had struck “decision-making centres and military installations” in the northeastern city of Kharkhiv, after Kyiv said that residential buildings, a hotel and cafes had been hit. In the first wave of overnight attacks, at least six missiles hit Kharkiv, Ukraine’s National Police said on Sunday, injuring at least 22 people and hitting 12 apartment buildings, 13 residential houses and a kindergarten. Most drones were aimed at Ukraine’s first line of defence as well as at civilian, military and infrastructure in the Kharkiv, Kherson, Mykolaiv and Zaporizhia regions, the Ukrainian Air Force said, adding that it destroyed 21 out of 49 attack drones. Earlier, Ukrainian officials said that among those injured in Kharkiv were two boys aged 14 and 16 and a security adviser for a team of German journalists. Closer to midnight, as part of a wider bombardment of Ukraine that also targeted Kyiv, several waves of Russian drones hit residential buildings in Kharkiv’s centre, spouting fires, the mayor of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, said. “On the eve of the New Year, the Russians want to intimidate our city, but we are not scared – we are unbreakable and invincible!” Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. Russia accused Ukraine of carrying out a “terrorist attack” on Saturday on civilians in the city of Belgorod, including using controversial cluster munitions in strikes that killed at least 22 people and wounded dozens more. The governor of Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, called residents of the city of Belgorod to hide in shelters on Sunday as a missile threat alert was issued in the city, according to a post on his Telegram account. In his New Year’s Eve address on Sunday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia would “never back down” praising his country’s military personnel. “We have repeatedly proved that we are able to solve the most difficult tasks and will never retreat, because there is no force that can separate us,” Putin said. “To all those who are on duty, on the front line of the fight for truth and justice,” Putin said, “you are our heroes. Our hearts are with you. We are proud of you, we admire your courage.” Earlier, Moscow said the attack – which followed waves of rocket and drone strikes by Russian forces on Ukrainian cities – would “not go unpunished”. In an emergency meeting at the UN Security Council, demanded by Russia, envoy Vasily Nebenzya claimed Kyiv targeted a sports centre, an ice rink and a university. “[It was a] deliberate, indiscriminate attack against a civilian target,” Nebenzya said on Saturday. At least 40 people were killed on Friday in one of Russia’s biggest attacks on Ukraine since its invasion nearly two years ago. Nebenzya defended the attacks saying Moscow had targeted only military infrastructure and that Ukraine’s air defence systems were responsible for civilian casualties. Poland, a member of the NATO military alliance, on Fridaysaid a Russian missile briefly passed through its airspacebefore leaving, prompting concern from the country that borders Ukraine. Fighting between Russia and Ukraine has intensified over the past week amid speculations that the war has reached a stalemate. US President Joe Biden said on Saturday he would speak to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy after the latest attacks. Biden said on Friday that the assault demonstrates that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s goals in Ukraine “remain unchanged” nearly two years after Russia first launched its invasion. “He seeks to obliterate Ukraine and subjugate its people. He must be stopped,” Biden said in a statement. While support for Ukraine remains robust among Western countries, further military assistance has met growing pushback by conservative political forces in the US and Europe. The United States, Ukraine’s biggest single-country donor, has sent more than $40bn in aid since Russia’s invasion in February 2022. But right-wing congressional Republicans have expressed increasing scepticism towards approving more funds for Ukraine. The US Senate will vote on an aid package for Ukraine in 2024. But Congress could continue to hold up the money. The impasse over US aid to Kyiv is mirrored in the European Union, where Hungary is blocking a 50 billion euro ($55bn) aid package. The bloc is due to revisit the issue in January. The difficulties in securing the funds in Washington and Brussels have raised concerns in Kyiv that Western backers are experiencing “fatigue” with the drawn-out battle, as fighting on the front line becomes bogged down. Zelenskyy has noted that Kyiv’s “foreign policy will be active” with many international activities in January. “We make every effort to strengthen Ukraine and ensure that everyone is confident about the coming year, about military aid, macro-financial assistance, and political support,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/31/russia-targets-ukraine-military-sites-in-retaliation-for-belgorod-attack

Russia says 21 people killed in Ukrainian attack on Belgorod,"Moscow says it shot down 32 Ukrainian drones, a day after Russia launched one of its deadliest attacks on Ukraine since it began its invasion in 2022.","At least 21 people, including three children, have been killed and 111 more injured following a Ukrainian attack on the centre of the Russian provincial capital of Belgorod, according to the Russian Emergencies Ministry. Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Saturday that the attack on Belgorod, about 30km (19 miles) from the border with Ukraine, hit a residential area. In a Telegram post, he urged all residents to move to air raid shelters as sirens sounded. Belgorod borders Ukraine’s Luhansk, Sumy and Kharkiv regions, some of which were hit byRussian air raidson Ukraine on Friday in what was one of its deadliest attacks since Moscow began its full-scale invasion in February 2022. The death toll from those attacks, which damaged a maternity hospital, apartment blocks, and schools, has now risen to at least 41. Belgorod is about 600km (373 miles) from the Russian capital, Moscow, and has served as a vital base for the Kremlin’s forces to launch attacks towards Ukraine. Russia’s Defence Ministry said in a statement the attack would “not go unpunished”. The ministry said its anti-aircraft units had destroyed 13 Ukrainian rockets over the Belgorod region on Friday. Russian forces also shot down 32 Ukrainian drones across the country, Moscow officials said earlier on Saturday. Drones were seen in the skies over the Moscow, Bryansk, Oryol, and Kursk regions, the ministry said in a statement. All the drones had been destroyed by air defences, it added. Russia on Saturday requested a meeting of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) to discuss the deadly strike. It was “a terrorist attack by the Kyiv regime against a civilian city,” said Russia’s ambassador to the UN Vasily Nebenzya, claiming that Kyiv targeted a sports centre, an ice rink and a university. “[It was a] deliberate, indiscriminate attack against a civilian target.” Ukraine and its allies quickly retorted, saying Russia had started the war. “As long as this war, unleashed by the Kremlin dictator endures, the toll of death and suffering will continue to grow,” said Ukraine’s Ambassador to the UN Serhii Dvornyk. The United Kingdom’s envoy Thomas Phipps said the UK “deeply” regretted any civilian losses, but also noted it had been Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to start the war. “There are hundreds of thousands of Russian soldiers in Ukraine. There is not a single Ukrainian soldier in Russia,” he said. “If Russia wants someone to blame for the deaths of Russians in this war, it should start with President Putin.” Ukrainian officials never acknowledge responsibility for attacks on Russian territory or the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow seized and annexed from Ukraine in 2014. However, larger aerial attacks against Russia have previously followed heavy assaults on Ukrainian cities. Russia also rejects claims it targets civilians. Russian drone attacks against Ukraine continued on Saturday, with the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces reporting that 10 Iranian-made Shahed drones had been shot down across the Kherson, Khmelnytskyi, and Mykolaiv regions. On Friday, Moscow’s forces launched more than 100 missiles and dozens of drones across Ukraine, an onslaught described by a Ukrainian Air Force official as the biggest aerial barrage of the war. Rescuers continued to search through the rubble on Saturday. Relief operations in the aftermath of yesterday’s Russian attack continue. Almost 120 cities and villages have been affected, with hundreds of civilian objects damaged. I thank all of our State Emergency Service rescuers, municipal employees, police officers, and everyone who is…pic.twitter.com/bWFq2Wv0CU — Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa)December 30, 2023  “Relief operations in the aftermath of yesterday’s Russian attack continue. Almost 120 cities and villages have been affected, with hundreds of civilian objects damaged,” Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on X. January 1 will be declared a day of mourning in Kyiv, the capital, where at least 16 people were killed, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said. The UNSC criticised Russia for carrying out its huge air assault at a meeting on Friday. But Russia’s Nebenzya claimed Moscow had “exclusively only targeted military infrastructure in Ukraine”. Fighting along the front line is largely bogged down by winter weather after Ukraine’s summer counteroffensive failed to make a significant breakthrough along the roughly 1,000km (620-mile) front line. Russia’s continuing aerial attacks have also generated concern among Ukraine’s neighbours. Poland’s defence forces said on Friday that a Russian missile had brieflyentered its airspace, however, Russian sources said Warsaw had not given the Kremlin evidence of an airspace violation.

Poland says Russian missile briefly entered its airspace,NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg says organisation is ‘monitoring the situation’ as Poland says it has confirmed incident.,"Polish military authorities have said that a Russian missile briefly passed through the country’s airspace before leaving, prompting concern from the country thatborders Ukraineon the day Russia carried out attacks across several Ukrainian citieskilling at least 30 people. Poland, a member of the NATO military alliance, says that the object entered from the direction of Ukraine on Friday morning, entering about 40 kilometers (24 miles) before leaving after about three minutes. “Everything indicates that a Russian missile intruded in Poland’s airspace,” said Poland’s defence chief, General Wieslaw Kukula. “It was monitored by us on radars and left the airspace. We have confirmation of this on radars and from [NATO] allies.” The incident comes at a time of high tensions between Russia and European nations located near Ukraine, whichRussia invadedin February 2022. Spoke with President@AndrzejDudaabout the missile incident in#Poland.#NATOstands in solidarity with our valued Ally, is monitoring the situation & we will remain in contact as the facts are established. NATO remains vigilant. — Jens Stoltenberg (@jensstoltenberg)December 29, 2023  Polish officials say they are working to further verify their findings and rule out the possibility of a technical malfunction. The Russian news agency RIA quoted Russia’s charge d’affaires in the country, who was summoned by the Polish government, as stating that Poland had provided no proof of a border violation. In a social media post on Friday, NATO Secretary GeneralJens Stoltenbergsaid that the security alliance is monitoring the situation and communicating with Polish officials. “I spoke with President Andrzej Duda about the missile incident in Poland. NATO stands in solidarity with our valued ally, is monitoring the situation and we will remain in contact as the facts are established. NATO remains vigilant,” Stoltenberg said. Operational commander of the Polish army Maciej Klisz said that the country’s air defence network had been on high alert due to recent Russianmissile and drone attacksin Ukraine and that fighter jets were sent to intercept the missile before it left Polish territory. The military also said that a ground search was being carried out in the area where the missile disappeared off the radar. The White House on Friday said that US President Joe Biden was closely following the development in Poland. White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan “expressed the United States’ solidarity with Poland, our close NATO ally” and pledged technical assistance as needed in a call with Polish Secretary of State Jacek Siewiera, according to a statement from the White House.    The incident is not the first time that the war in Ukraine has threatened tospill overinto Polish territory. In November 2022, an errant Ukrainian airdefence missilekilled two civilians when it landed in the border village of Przewodow. Poland’s newly elected Prime MinisterDonald Tusk, who won the election with a bloc of pro-EU and pro-Ukraine parties that overthrew the country’s far-right government after eight years in power, has promised full support for Ukraine in its war against Russia. That war has ground on for nearly two years, with little end in sight as Ukraine fights to expel Russian forces that have established strong defences along the captured territory. While Ukraine still has substantial support from many Western governments, schisms havestarted to emergeover the provision of furthermilitary assistance, including in the US, which has provided more support than any other country. On Friday, the British defence ministry said that it would send 200 air defence missiles to Ukraine, which is currently under heavy bombardment from Russian forces. Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyysaid on Friday that he visited Avdiivka, an eastern town near the front line that has seen heavy fighting. “This is one of the most difficult areas of the front line,” he wrote on Telegram along with a video of him in front of a sign with the name of the town, giving medals to soldiers. “I thank all those who are at the first line [of fire] for their service, for this year during which the entire country survived thanks to its soldiers,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/29/poland-says-russian-missile-briefly-entered-its-airspace
Russian court hands Navalny ally long prison sentence,"Since the invasion of Ukraine, nearly all of the Kremlin’s critics have been jailed or gone into exile.","A Russian court has handed a nine-and-a-half-year prison sentence to an ally of Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny. Ksenia Fadeyeva, a lawyer and lawmaker in the Siberian city of Tomsk, was sent to prison for running an “extremist organisation”, her legal team said. She is the latest Russian opposition figure to be detained during the war in Ukraine. “The ‘judge’ Khudyakov has ordered a nine-year sentence against Ksenia Fadeyeva,” her supporters said on the social media site Telegram, adding that the sentence will be appealed. Russian authorities designated Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation “extremist” in 2021, effectively banning it and exposing its members to the risk of prosecution. Several have been hit with harsh penalties. Fadeyeva headed a local chapter of the organisation. In 2020, she was elected to the Tomsk municipal council in what was seen as a notable victory for opponents of President Vladimir Putin’s government, which has largely sought to bar challengers from elections. However, with the outlawing of the Anti-Corruption Foundation, she was banned from using the internet in December 2021 and has been under house arrest since October. The Kremlin has clamped down on the opposition since it launched its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and the majority of the Kremlin’s leading critics are now in exile or behind bars. Several regional heads of the Anti-Corruption Foundation have been jailed, including Lilia Chanysheva, Navalny’s ally in the central Bashkortostan Republic, who was handed seven and a half years in prison this summer. Navalny has been behind bars since January 2021 when he returned to Moscow after recuperating in Germany from nerve agent poisoning, which he blamed on the Kremlin. This month, his supporters reported they had lost contact with him. On Monday, it emerged that he had beenmoved to a remote Arctic prison. Before his arrest, Navalny had campaigned against corruption and organised major anti-Kremlin protests. He has since received three prison terms. In September, a court extended his sentence to19 yearson extremism charges and ruled that he be moved to a more secure, harsher prison. He has rejected all charges against him as politically motivated. Last week, former television journalist Yekaterina Duntsova, who had put her name forward as an independent candidate in Russia’s presidential election in March, wasbarred from running. The Central Electoral Commission rejected Duntsova’s application, filed on December 20, citing “mistakes in documents”. She had planned to run on a platform of ending thewar in Ukraineand freeingpolitical prisoners.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/29/russian-court-hands-navalny-ally-9-5-year-prison-sentence
Ukraine says at least 30 killed in massive Russian air assault,Cities across the country hit with Russian drones and missiles in one of the largest aerial barrages of the war.,"Ukrainian officials have said that at least 30 people have been killed and more than 140 wounded after Russia targeted cities across the war-torn country with a massive salvo of missiles and drones in one of the largest aerial assaults of the war. The Ukrainian military said on Friday that Russia has launched an estimated 158 missiles and drones in the wave of attacks, targeting cities such as Kyiv, Odesa, Kharkiv, Dnipro, and Lviv. Ukrainian officials say that most of the attacks have been intercepted. “Today, Russia hit us with almost everything it has in its arsenal,” President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said of the attacks. The assault illustrated Kyiv’s desperate need for additional defence capabilities, as residents sought shelter from the barrage of projectiles, which Air Force commander Mykola Oleshchuk called “the most massive aerial attack” since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. “There was an explosion, then flames,” Kateryna Ivanivna, a 72-year-old resident of the capital city of Kyiv, told The Associated Press. “I covered my head and got down in the street. Then, I ran into the subway station.” United States President Joe Biden said on Friday that the assault demonstrates that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s goals in Ukraine “remain unchanged” nearly two years after Russia first launched its invasion. “He seeks to obliterate Ukraine and subjugate its people. He must be stopped,” Biden said in a statement. While support for Ukraine remains robust among Western countries, further military assistance has met growing pushback by conservative political forces in the US and Europe. Biden has called on the US Congress to pass an additional assistance package for Ukraine, but that effort has been delayed until the new year as schisms emerge within the Republican Party over continued support. “Unless Congress takes urgent action in the new year, we will not be able to continue sending the weapons and vital air defense systems Ukraine needs to protect its people. Congress must step up and act without any further delay,” Biden’s statement reads. With the front line largely bogged down in trench warfare, Russia has in recent weeks returned to its tactic from last winter, during which it targeted infrastructure, especially energy and heating, leaving millions of Ukrainians struggling to stay warm. Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal noted that the barrage on Friday targeted critical infrastructure. The Ministry of Energy reported that four Ukrainian regions in the north and south were facing power cuts. Missiles and drones were also reported to have hit numerous civilian sites, including residential buildings. Falling debris caused fires in a residential building and a warehouse in Kyiv and blasts were heard in Lviv, officials said. A metro station building in Kyiv being used as a shelter was damaged, Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko said on the Telegram messaging app. Twenty-two Russian attacks were recorded in Kharkiv, damaging a hospital, residential buildings and an industrial facility, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. “We understand that four areas have been hit here in the capital, Kyiv,” Al Jazeera’s Assed Baig reported. Death and injuries were reported from Dnipro, Baig said, adding that two sites were hit in the western city of Lviv. Rescue teams were working through the damage, he said. Tensions also remain high in countries that border Ukraine, with Polish authorities reporting on Friday that aRussian missile had entered the country’s airspacefor several minutes before leaving. The surge in Russian attacks has been linked to a successful Ukrainian attack on a Russian warship in Crimea this week.    The Russian military confirmed on Friday that it had since launched dozens of attacks on Ukraine. “In the period from December 23 to 29, the armed forces of the Russian Federation carried out 50 group strikes and one massive strike … All targets were hit,” it said in a daily update. The Russian military claimed in that report that its attacks were aimed at military facilities. However, Kyiv pointed out the civilian deaths and damage caused by the barrage and said it illustrates its dire need for increased support from its Western allies, which has becomebogged downby political manoeuvring in Washington and Brussels. Hypersonic, cruise and ballistic missiles, including the X-22, which is hard to intercept, were used in the attacks, said Ukraine’s Air Force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat. “We have not had so many red enemy targets on our monitors for a long time.” “We are doing everything to strengthen our air shield, but the world needs to see that we need more support and strength to stop this terror,” presidential aide Andriy Yermak wrote on Telegram. Zelenskyythankedthe United States for releasing the last remaining package of weapons available for Ukraine under existing authorisation. But uncertainty surrounds further aid. The US, Ukraine’s biggest single-country donor, has sent more than $40bn since Russia’s invasion in February 2022, but right-wing Republicans are opposing President Joe Biden’s bid to win approval for additional spending. The impasse is mirrored in the European Union, where Hungary isblockinga 50-billion-euro ($55bn) aid package. The bloc is due to revisit the issue in January, but it is understood that it will be unable to uphold promises to send one million rounds of ammunition. Zelenskyy, meanwhile, continues to argue for the West to increase its support. “To defend freedom and security not only in Ukraine and Europe but also in the United States, we must continue to respond to ongoing Russian aggression,” he said. Western allies responded to the huge barrage on Friday by reiterating their support. The US ambassador to Kyiv wrote on X that the attacks showed “Ukraine needs funding now to continue to fight for freedom from such horror in 2024.” The European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell condemned Russia’s “cowardly and indiscriminate targeting” of civilians. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the assault illustrated that “Putin will stop at nothing to achieve his aim of eradicating freedom and democracy,” the UK’s defence ministry said on Friday that it was sending 200 air defence missiles to assist Ukraine. “We will not let him win,” added Sunak. “We must continue to stand with Ukraine – for as long as it takes.” The French Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs said in a statement, “Russia is continuing its strategy of terror aimed at destroying Ukrainian civilian infrastructure in order to undermine the resilience of the Ukrainian population.” “France will continue to support Ukraine and provide it with the necessary assistance to enable it to exercise its self-defence, in close coordination with its partners.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/29/ukraine-seeks-increased-support-amid-huge-russian-air-assault
"Ukraine drives Russia back at sea and in the air, but concedes land","Russia lost a landing ship and five planes this week, but took a flattened suburb.","Ukraine claimed anammunition-laden Russian shipand five Sukhoi fighters and bombers this week but made a tactical retreat in the east to preserve its fighting force. Ukrainian fighter planes launched cruise missiles against the Novocherkassk, a Ropucha-class landing ship at a port in Feodosia, on the eastern side of the Crimean peninsula, on the night of December 25-26. Ukrainian Air Force chief MykolaOleshchukposted video of a massive explosion that came after the initial impact of the missiles had set the ship alight, suggesting the Novocherkassk was laden with weapons or munitions that detonated. Russia’s defence ministry admitted only that the ship had been damaged, but daytime satellitepicturesshowed the burned ship half-submerged at its berth on December 27. “We can see how powerful the explosion was, what the detonation was like. After that, it’s very hard for a ship to survive, because this was not a rocket, this is the detonation of munitions,” Ukrainian Air Force spokesman Yuri Ignat told Radio Free Europe. Sergei Aksyonov, the Russian-installed governor of Crimea, said on Telegram that one person had been killed and the Russian RIA news agency said four people had been injured, but the death toll may have been as high as 80, theUkrainian navysaid, citing reports that 77 personnel were on board the ship at the time of the blast. The attack was an example of the success Ukraine has had this year in striking Russian assets at range, partly thanks to Storm Shadow and SCALP missiles it has received from Britain and France, and partly thanks to the aerial and surface drones it has been developing. On the day the Novocherkassk was hit, Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) unveiled the Mamai, a new surface drone with a top speed of 110km/h, claiming it was “the fastest object on the Black Sea to date”. Ukraine has already used Sea Baby drones successfully to damage Russian ships at Sevastopol and Novorossiysk ports, and to strike the Kerch Bridge. Ukraine also remained alert to opportunities to down Russian aircraft that stray too near the front. On December 23, Ukraine’s Air Force said it downed three Russian Sukhoi-34 bombers, two over Odesa and one in the direction of the Russian region of Bryansk. Air Force spokesman Ignat said the Russian pilots were caught unaware when they tried to fly close to Ukrainian combat lines to release glide bombs. “UAVs weighing 500kgs can fly 20–25 kilometres from the line of combat. When you need to strike further, you need to fly closer,” said Ignat. “But our defenders caught the invaders by surprise.” The following day Ukraine’s Air Force said it had downed a Russian Sukhoi-30 fighter and another Sukhoi-34 bomber, without specifying where or how. “What the Ukrainians used has not yet been confirmed, but the evidence points extremely strongly towards the use of Patriot anti-air missiles,” wrote strategy professor at St Andrews University Phillips O’Brien, citing an incident on May 12, when Ukraine shot down four Russian aircraft in Russian airspace. “What later emerged is that the Ukrainians had laid a trap for the Russians. They had secretly moved one of their new Patriot batteries [that had just become functional in Ukraine] very close to the Russian border in Kharkiv oblast. From there, the Ukrainians could reach into Russia itself and ambush the unsuspecting Russians.” If that assessment is accurate, it would explain why Moscow was so upset when Japan modified its laws to be able to export a Patriot system back to the United States. While it still refuses to export arms to an active war theatre, Japan’s move gives the US extra capacity in Patriot systems, allowing the US to ship the system to Ukraine. “It cannot be ruled out that under an already tested scheme Patriot missiles will end up in Ukraine,” Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova told a weekly briefing on December 27. Such a scenario would be “interpreted as unambiguously hostile actions against Russia and will lead to grave consequences for Japan”. Ukraine has also been doing extremely well in safeguarding its airspace from a nightly onslaught of Iranian-designed Shahed drones launched by Russia. During the week of December 21-27, it downed 154 drones of 177 launched by Russia, an 87 percent kill rate. The previous week it scored a 98 percent kill rate. Ignat recently said Ukraine has downed 2,900 out of 3,700 drones launched by Russia during the war. Both of the last two weekly scores were higher than the average kill rate of 78 percent, suggesting that Ukraine’s air defences are adapting. Ukraine is about to receive a boost to its air defences. “Today I informed President [Volodymyr] Zelenskyy of our government’s decision to prepare an initial 18 F-16 fighter aircraft for delivery to Ukraine,” Dutch caretaker prime minister Mark Rutte said in a post on social media platform X on December 22. It was not clear when the planes would be delivered, but a recent Estonian defence ministry strategy document said the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway and Belgium have already committed to donating F-16s to Ukraine “before the end of the year”. Ukrainian pilots have been training on F-16s in Britain, the US and Romania for much of this year. The ground war is where Ukraine faced difficulties. Russia claimed control ofMaryinka, a suburb of the occupied Donetsk city in the east, on December 24. “Our assault units … have today completely liberated the settlement of Maryinka,” Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu told Russian President Vladimir Putin in a televised meeting. “What is important is that we have quite significantly moved the work of artillery further from Donetsk to the west,” Shoigu said, offering Donetsk city a broader defensive envelope. Ukraine insisted it was still within the town’s administrative limits: Commander-in-Chief Valery Zaluzhny said a tactical decision had been made to give up most of Maryinka to save lives – except for a garrison left holding the north of the neighbourhood. “The method is absolutely the same as it was inBakhmut– our fighters are destroyed street by street, block by block – and after that we have what we have,” Zaluzhny said. Unlike in Bakhmut, Ukraine made a decision not to fight for every last square foot. Yet, as was the case in other cities Russia has taken –Mariupol, Bakhmut, Severdonetsk and Lysychansk – the fighting needed to capture Maryinka was so severe that nothing of the city remained. An aerialphotographcirculated by Anton Gerashchenko, a Ukrainian interior ministry adviser, showed the suburban Donetsk town, which had a pre-war population of 10,000, so destroyed that not a single building appeared habitable. One or two exterior walls were all that remained of most houses. In many cases, buildings had been bombed to their foundations. Russian leaders made much of this achievement. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu spoke of the difficulty of storming well-protected machine-gun positions connected by underground passages, and even aggrandised the event by pointing out that Maryinka was taken by the 150th motorised rifle Idritsa-Berlin Order of Kutuzov division, which seized the Reichstag building in 1945. Still, Maryinka is less than a kilometre from the pre-invasion front line of February 2022 and there are signs of Russian frustration at the glacial pace of its gains, despite Russia’s vastly greater resources. On the Left Bank of the Dnipro river in Kherson, where Ukrainian forces have established a small bridgehead during the autumn, neither Russian marines nor the newly formed 104th Air Assault Division have been able to dislodge them. In the 96th week of the war, Russia appears to have broken international law and used tear gas. Russia’s 810th Naval Infantry Brigade posted on December 23 that it had adopted a “radical change in tactics” near Krynky in Kherson, “dropping K-51 grenades from drones” onto Ukrainian positions. “K-51 aerosol grenades are filled with irritant CS gas, a type of tear gas used for riot control (also known as a Riot Control Agent [RCA]),” wrote the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War. “The Chemical Weapons Convention prohibits the use of RCAs as a method of warfare, and Russia has been a state party to the CWC since 1997,” it said. Ukraine is also suffering from fatigue in this war. Its parliament on December 25 posted a draft lawlowering the conscription agefrom 27 to 25. Zelenskyy had said in a recent press conference that the military wishes to raise 450,000-500,000 personnel next year to replenish losses, increase combat capacity and introduce rotation of front-line personnel. Russia wants to capture Avdiivka on the eastern front this year “at a minimum”, said Ukrainian Brigadier-General Oleksandr Tarnavskyi, who commands the Tavria group of forces, encompassing Avdiivka, Mariivka and Robotyne, in an interview with BBC Ukraine. “The enemy uses its strengths – manpower, minefields, prepared positions, as well as the readiness to mercilessly throw its personnel to [their] death,” he said. “I think that the next year will be, perhaps, even more difficult.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/29/ukraine-drives-russia-back-at-sea-and-in-the-air-but-concedes-land
Russian poets given long jail terms for reciting verses against Ukraine war,"Artyom Kamardin, 33, and Yegor Shtovba, 23, sentenced for ‘undermining national security’, ‘inciting hatred’.","A court in Moscow has sentenced two Russian men to several years in prison for reciting poetry against the war in Ukraine during an anti-mobilisation protest last year as the Kremlin presses on with its crackdown on dissent. Artyom Kamardin, 33, was sentenced to seven years in jail on Thursday after being convicted of making calls “undermining national security” and “inciting hatred”. The charges were linked to him reading his anti-war poems at the rally in Moscow in September 2022. The Tverskoy District Court also sentenced Yegor Shtovba, 23, to a five and a half year term on the same charges, after he participated in the event and recited Kamardin’s verses. The demonstration last year was held days after President Vladimir Putin ordered themobilisation of 300,000 reservistsamid Russia’s military setbacks in Ukraine. The widely unpopular move prompted hundreds of thousands to flee the country to avoid being recruited into the military. Kamardin read out his poem, “Kill me, militia man!”,  ending with the line, “Glory toKievan Rus, Novorossiya – suck!” – using the historic terms for Ukraine’s capital Kyiv and a term from days of the Russian Empire that Moscow uses for the area of southeastern Ukraine it is trying to annex, respectively. Days later, police stormed into the apartment Kamardin shared with his then-girlfriend, Alexandra Popova, and another activist. According to Amnesty International, Popova said police beat andviolated Kamardin with a dumbbellbefore forcing Popova to watch a video of the act. She also claimed that police super-glued stickers to her face and threatened to rape her. A clip later circulated on Telegram of the bruised and battered Kamardin apologising for his words. Authorities in Russia have detainedthousands of peopleunder wartime censorship laws for their simple acts of protest against theoffensive in Ukraine. Just before his sentencing, a smiling Kamardin recited a poem that refers to poetry as “gut-wrenching” and often disliked by “people accustomed to order”. Popova, now his wife, was escorted out of the courtroom by bailiffs after she shouted “Shame!” following the verdict. “It is a very harsh sentence. Seven years for poems, for a non-violent crime,” she told the AFP news agency, before being taken away by police officers. According to OVD-Info, a prominent rights group that monitors political arrests and provides legal aid, 19,834 Russians have been arrested between February 24, 2022, when Russia began its invasion, and late October 2023, for speaking out or demonstrating against the war.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/29/russian-poets-given-long-jail-terms-for-reciting-verses-against-ukraine-war
‘Almost naked’ celebrity party triggers backlash in wartime Russia,Rapper jailed and other partygoers under investigation amid conservative outrage over party at Moscow’s Mutabor nightclub.,"A rapper who partied at a Moscow nightclub wearing nothing but a strategically-placed sock has been jailed for 15 days, and several other Russian stars have issued public apologies after a celebrity party with the dress code “almost naked” triggered a storm of criticism and a slew of investigations. The crackdown came after pictures from the party, which took place on the night of December 20 and was organised by TV presenter and actress Anastasia Ivleeva, began circulating on social media. Amid the scantily-clad celebrities at the Mutabor nightclub was Vacio, the rapper, while Ivleeva was pictured flaunting an emerald-studded chain around her backside worth 23 million roubles ($251,000) at a time when some Russians are struggling to get by. Conservative legislators, bloggers and others were fiercely critical, contending the images were unseemly, even unpatriotic, for the country, which launched a full-scale invasion of neighbouring Ukraine in February 2022. The issue has dominated the headlines for days, pushing out stories about rising egg prices and other concerns. Maria Zakharova, a spokesperson for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that the event had “stained” those who took part, but that they now had a chance to work on themselves, the Ura.ru news outlet reported. Vacio, whose legal name is Nikolai Vasilyev, was jailed by a Moscow court for 15 days and fined 200,000 roubles ($2,182) under the LGBTQ “propaganda” law, which was toughened last year and bans positive information on lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender people. Ivleeva issued two public apology videos following the event, including one on Wednesday, where she said she regretted her actions and deserved everything she got but hoped she could be given “a second chance”. Her name has since disappeared as one of the public faces of major Russian mobile phone operator MTS, the tax authorities have opened an investigation that carries a potential five-year jail term, and a Moscow court has accepted a lawsuit from a group of more than 20 people demanding she pay out one billion roubles ($10.9m) for “moral suffering”. If successful, they want the money to go to a state fund that supports Russian veterans from the war in Ukraine. Russia’s flamboyant pop king Filipp Kirkorov also asked for forgiveness after footage circulated of him wearing a sparkling lace outfit with futuristic sunglasses. “In today’s difficult and heroic times, an artist of my calibre … cannot and should not be so irresponsible when participating in various events,” he said. Other partygoers have also recorded apologies, including journalist Ksenia Sobchak whose late father Anatoly was once a friend and boss of President Vladimir Putin. “To hold such events at a time when our guys are dying in the [Ukrainian] special military operation and many children are losing their fathers is cynical,” said Yekaterina Mizulina, director of Russia’s League for a Safe Internet, a body founded with the authorities’ support. Russia calls its invasion a “special military operation“. “Our soldiers on the front line are definitely not fighting for this.” The scandal comes when Putin, who is expected to comfortably win another six-year term in elections in March, has doubled down on social conservatism, repeatedly condemning Western countries for supposedly undermining “traditional values“. In November, Russia’s Supreme Court ruled that the “LGBT movement” should be designated as “extremists.” Standing outside the Bolshoi Theatre on Thursday, Nadezhda, one Moscow resident, told the Reuters news agency she was outraged and thought those who went to the party should be punished. “If you’re partying, at least don’t film it,” she said. “At such a difficult time [for Russia], they should at least be ashamed. Aren’t they ashamed before those who are fighting for us?”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/29/almost-naked-celebrity-party-triggers-backlash-in-wartime-russia

Ukraine welcomes latest US aid package as war nears two year mark,"The package, valued at $250m, will include air defence system components and artillery rounds.","Ukraine has welcomed the latest arms package from the United States to aid its fight against Russia as the war approaches the two-year mark. The package, valued at $250m and announced on Wednesday night, will include air defence system components, ammunition for HIMARS, 155mm and 105mm artillery rounds, stinger antiaircraft missiles, and medical equipment. “We are grateful to the American government and people for their unwavering support. Ukrainian people appreciate your leadership,” the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence said on X on Thursday. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said it would “cover Ukraine’s most pressing needs”. “US leadership in the coalition of over 50 countries providing Ukraine with military aid is critical to countering terror and aggression not only in Ukraine but around the world,” he said.

But Republicans are refusing to approve the package without an agreement by the Democrats to tighten security around the US-Mexico border. The White House has warned that without the additional appropriation, US aid forUkraine’s fightagainst Russia will run out by the end of the year. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Thursday the West’s strategic defeat on Moscow had “completely failed”. Lavrov told Russian state media that the Group of Seven countries intend to discuss the “peace formula” proposed by Zelenskyy, which they agreed on at a “secret summit” held about 10 days ago. Meanwhile, a bulk carrier headed to a River Danube port to load grain hit a Russian mine in the Black Sea on Wednesday, injuring two crew members, Ukrainian officials said on Thursday. “A Panama-flagged civilian vessel was blown up on an enemy sea mine in the Black Sea … The vessel lost its course and control and a fire broke out on the upper deck,” Ukraine’s southern military command said on Telegram. A captain, sailor and an Egyptian citizen were injured, with the latter taken to hospital in the city of Izmail, the head of the Odesa regional prosecutors office said. Moscow has ramped up its attack in the Black Sea since leaving the United Nations-brokeredgrain dealin mid-July, which allowed for the safe passage of Ukrainian grain shipments. Ukraine has pushed back Russian warships in the western part of the Black Sea to allow some cargo ships in and out along a maritime corridor.

Russia accuses US of threatening global energy security,Moscow slams Washington’s sanctions on a new LNG plant in the Arctic as ‘unacceptable’.,"Russia has claimed that US sanctions levied against the Arctic LNG 2 project undermine global energy security. The Russian foreign ministry’s spokeswoman hit out on Wednesday at Washington’s “unacceptable” move to clamp down on the massive Arctic LNG 2. The sanctions are just the latest measure implemented as the West seeks to limit Moscow’s financial ability to wage war in Ukraine. The remarks came after Washington announced sanctions against the new liquefied natural gas plant that is under development on the Gydan Peninsula in the Arctic last month. “We consider such actions unacceptable, especially in relation to such large international commercial projects as Arctic LNG 2, which affect the energy balance of many states,” said foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova. “The situation around Arctic LNG 2 once again confirms the destructive role for global economic security played by Washington, which speaks of the need to maintain this security but in fact, by pursuing its own selfish interests, tries to oust competitors and destroy global energy security.” Russia is the fourth-largest producer of sea-borne LNG behind the United States, Qatar and Australia. The Arctic LNG 2 project is a key element in Russia’s efforts to boost its share of the global market to a fifth by 2030-2035 from 8 percent now. However, the sanctions saw partners from China, Japan and France who hold a combined 40 percent of the project suspend participation last week. Project developer Novatek was also forced to declare force majeure over LNG supplies from the project, which was slated to start production in early 2024. Western countries, seeking to cripple Moscow’s military might, have imposed wide-ranging sanctions against Russian firms and individuals following the Kremlin’s decision to send tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February last year. However, Russia insists that Europe has been hit harder by the sanctions due to raised energy prices, while it has been successful in swiftly finding new markets in Asia. Almost all of Russia’s oil exports this year have been shipped to China and India, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said on Wednesday. Russia hopes that the income from Asian energy customers can continue to help drive its invasion, as it eyes Ukraine’sstruggleto access funds and weapons from Western partners. On Wednesday, Ukrainian authorities said two people were killed after Russian forces sent a wave of attack drones against the country in an overnight raid. The Ukrainian air force said that 32 of 46 Iranian-made drones deployed by Russia had been shot down. The air force said the military had destroyed drones over parts of central, southern and western Ukraine. Most of those that got through defences struck near the front line, mainly in the southern Kherson region. Oleh Kiper, the governor of Ukraine’s Odesa region, said that a 35-year-old man was killed by debris from a downed drone in a residential area. Another man died in the hospital from his injuries. Four others, including a 17-year-old boy, were injured, according to Kiper. More than 10,000 civilians have been killed in Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion, with about half of recent deaths occurring far behind the front lines, according to the UN Human Rights Office.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/27/russia-says-us-threatens-global-energy-security-with-arctic-lng-2-sanctions

Ukraine says at least one killed in Russian attack on Kherson rail station,Ukrainian authorities say Russian shelling of a train station kills a police officer and injures four others.,"Ukrainian officials say at least one person has been killed and four others injured in a Russian attack on a rail station in the southern city of Kherson, as Russia’s invasion continues to take aheavy tollon Ukrainian civilians. Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenk said the Russian shelling struck the rail station on Tuesday as about 140 people there were preparing for an evacuation, killing a policeman. “Thanks to the clear actions of the police, everyone was successfully taken to safe places,” Klymenko said on Telegram. “Unfortunately, a police lieutenant from the Kirovohrad region lost his life due to the shelling … Two more police officers are in the hospital with shrapnel wounds.”    The city was captured by Russian forces after they first invaded Ukraine in February 2022, but were pushed out of the city by aUkrainian counteroffensivein November of the same year. But Russian forces have continued to bombard the city. Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyreported the shelling attack earlier on Tuesday, and two civilians are being treated at a hospital for shrapnel wounds alongside the two wounded police officers. The Ukrainian railway company Ukrzaliznytsya said in a message on Telegram that a train and the station were damaged but that “the situation is under control and the railway is ready to continue functioning.” Roman Mrochko, the head of the Kherson military administration, had said earlier on Tuesday that the city has been targeted for the last day by persistent Russian attacks.    The war in Ukraine has continued to kill and injure many civilians, and the conflict has shown few signs of abating soon. Ukrainian fighters struck aRussian shipin the Black Sea on Tuesday, boosting the morale of Ukrainian forces that have faced difficult questions after a much-anticipatedcounteroffensivefailed to win back substantial territory from Russia over the summer. “This latest destruction of Putin’s navy demonstrates that those who believe there’s a stalemate in the Ukraine war are wrong!” UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps wrote in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/26/ukraine-says-at-least-one-killed-in-russian-attack-on-kherson-rail-station
"Ukraine’s allies fall short of Russia’s on arms help, raising 2024 risks","Europe is supplying Ukraine only a fraction of the shells it needs, while North Korea has stepped up for Russia. That, say analysts, raises challenges for Kyiv next year.","In March of this year, Ukraine asked its European allies for a quarter of a million shells a month. Its full battle plan, then-Defence minister Oleksiy Reznikov said, required at least 350,000. Ukraine was then rationing itself to just 110,000 a month and needed Europe to help make up the difference. The European Union pledged a million shells within a year – a third of what Ukraine had requested. By the end of November, it haddelivered300,000 from the stockpiles of European armies. It has four months to make up the difference, but further deliveries have to come from new production, said Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign policy chief. Astonishingly, after almost two years of war on European soil, the EU has not taken stock of continental production capacity. “We would like to know today where we are and what can be the rhythm of production for this second track,” said Borrell on November 14 at a gathering of EU defence ministers. Russia, too, has been firing more shells than it can produce, and in September reached out for help to North Korea. Within a month, North Korea haddelivered 1,000 containersworth of ammunition, said White House spokesperson John Kirby. Estonian military intelligence chief Col AntsKiviselgsaid that translated into 300,000-350,000 shells — the same amount as that delivered by the EU to Ukraine, but in one month instead of eight. A Washington Post analysis of satellite photography suggested the number was higher because ships had been plying the route between the North Korean free trade zone port of Rason to Russia’s port of Dunai since August. Russia may have received additional North Korean shells via rail. The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) said satellite imagery showing that rail traffic between North Korea and Russia had “dramatically” increased since Russian President Vladimir Putin met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in September. “To the West’s great surprise, Russia proved more adept at securing what it wanted from the outside, including from China,” Yiorgos Margaritis, professor emeritus of history at the Aristotelian University of Thessaloniki, who has been monitoring the balance of artillery, told Al Jazeera. “The quantity of shells North Korea promised – 10 million – is monstrous. And they’ve already provided a 10th of that.” “[Russia] is well supplied, it does not care for the amount of losses, and it has third-party support which is not in doubt. All of these three elements are not the same on the Ukrainian side,” Jens Bastian, a fellow with the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, told Al Jazeera. The EU has been left fumbling for an answer. Borrell has suggested its defence industry default on contracts to overseas clients, who are currently buying 40 percent of its production. The US response was quicker and more dynamic. In February it decided to increase artillery shell production sixfold – a level not seen since the Korean War – to replenish stocks sent to Ukraine, supply Ukraine with more, and build up stocks for future conflicts. According to a New York Times report, the US Army was buying 14,400 shells a month in September 2022, when it tripled that, and in January 2023 doubled it again, to 90,000. But it will still take US defence contractors until the end of next year to reach that production capacity. What is the matter with Europe? The EU says it will match the US’s orderbook of a roughly million rounds of artillery ammunition, including missiles, per year by spring. “I am responsible for the production capacity of ammunition, so I can confirm that the goal of producing more than a million ammunition rounds annually … can be achieved,” EU internal market commissioner Thierry Breton was reported to have said at an EU defence ministers’ meeting on November 14. For that to happen, governments must place orders, he said. “It is the member states who must place the order for this ammunition, who must produce it, and who must ensure that it is produced primarily for Ukraine. All this is in the hands of the member countries,” said Breton. Yet, by December 6, EU members had placed orders for only 60,000 of the one million shells they promised Ukraine, Reuters news agency reported. Orders take a long time to fulfil, making it doubtful that the EU will come through by March on even the limited ones that have been placed. For example, German steel and weapons manufacturer Rheinmetall said on December 3 it had received a 142-million-euro ($156mn) order for shells intended for Ukraine, but these would be delivered in 2025. The EU’s lamentable state of coordination on defence has many reasons, say experts. Unlike areas such as banking, the green energy transition and transport, where EU member states have closely coordinated policies led by Brussels, defence and foreign policy remain national competencies. “We do not have an integrated European defence industry and also an integrated European defence policy, and Ukraine has highlighted that for two years,” said Bastian. “Mr Borrell is making clear that the failure at the EU level is also a failure of individual countries who do not have … the capacity to produce at scale within a defined period of time,” he said. Lack of coordination in foreign policy is just as challenging. “We don’t have one defined, shared threat perception, and therefore the countries have different priorities,” said Minna Alander, a research fellow at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. “Not everyone shares the view that Russia is an existential threat to Europe,” she told Al Jazeera. Europe’s divestment from heavy industry, including metals production, which reached a climax during the COVID-19 pandemic, contributed to a slim supply of raw materials for weapons. “If you want to build a bridge, 80 percent of your steel is going to come from China, India and one or two other countries in the east. The same applies for weapons production,” said Margaritis. “If you want to increase steel production, you need to make enormous changes,” he said, including the provision of cheap energy and plentiful labour. If Europe does not maintain at least some self-sufficiency in heavy industry, it risks its own security, say experts. “Europe needs an epochal shift in political thinking, coupled with significantly higher defence spending and a determined effort to reset public perceptions of the need for strong defence,” Bastian Giegerich, director-general of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a London-based think tank, and Tim Lawrenson, a defence industry consultant, recently wrote. “None of these requirements currently looks assured. Unless they are met, however, NATO’s vaunted deterrent may falter. Russia may no longer perceive Europe as having credible defences and become tempted to attack a NATO member.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/26/ukraines-allies-fall-short-of-russias-on-arms-help-raising-2024-risks
Russia confirms Ukraine destroyed its warship in Crimea attack,"One person reported killed in attack that targeted the Novocherkassk, which Ukraine said was being used to transport Russian drones.","Russia has acknowledged a Ukrainian attack has damaged a warship in the occupied Crimean port of Feodosia in what Ukraine and its Western allies called a major setback for the Russian navy. Ukraine’s air force said earlier that it had “destroyed” the Novocherkassk landing ship, with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy joking on social media that the vessel had now joined “the Russian underwater Black Sea fleet”. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu informed President Vladimir Putin “about the damage to our large landing ship” in what a “very detailed report”, the president’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists. The Novocherkassk is a large landing ship that can be used for transporting soldiers as well as tanks and armoured vehicles, and Ukraine said it attacked the vessel at a base in the southern coast ofRussian-occupied Crimea.Kyiv said it suspected the ship was transportingIranian-made explosive dronesthat Russia has used regularly to attack Ukraine since it began itsfull scale invasionin February 2022. One person was killed and four were injured in the attack, the Moscow-installed governor of Crimea, Sergey Aksyonov, said, adding that six buildings had been damaged and their residents evacuated. Aksyonov said the strike triggered a fire that had been brought under control. Russia annexedCrimea from Ukrainein 2014 in a move Ukraine and the West condemned as illegal, and has not been internationally recognised. Feodosia, which has a population of about 69,000 people.    Ukrainian officials celebrated the attack, which comes amid fierce fighting on the front line in the country’s east. Ukrainian commander Mykola Oleshchuk shared a video of an explosion at the Feodosia naval base and wrote: “The fleet in Russia is getting smaller and smaller! Thanks to the Air Force pilots and everyone involved for the filigree work!” On Telegram,Zelenskyywrote: “I am grateful to our Air Force for the impressive replenishment of the Russian underwater Black Sea fleet with another vessel. The occupiers will not have a single peaceful place in Ukraine.” The Black Sea, which Ukraine needs to export its grain, has been a key battleground in the continuing war. Russia’s Black Sea Fleet is based in the port of Sevastopol and Moscow has used the fleet to fire missiles at Ukrainian cities and to blockade Ukraine’s coastline. Ukraine has stepped up attacks on Crimea, helping it win back limited control of the Black Sea and, at times, push Russian warships further east. Yuriy Ihnat, Ukrainian Air Force spokesperson, said he thought it would be hard for the Novocherkassk to re-enter service. “We can see how powerful the explosion was, what the detonation was like. After that, it’s very hard for a ship to survive, because this was not a rocket, this is the detonation of munitions,” he told Radio Free Europe. Ukraine and Russia have often exaggerated the losses they claim to have inflicted on the other since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. In recent days, Moscow has claimed to have taken control of the eastern city ofMaryinka, which Kyiv has denied. Ukraine and Russia have also each claimed success in shooting down the other’s fighter planes, with each side denying any losses. In April 2022, Ukrainesank cruiser Moskva, the Soviet-era flagship of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet. Moscow said “a detonation of ammunition” triggered a fire and forced the crew to evacuate, and the ship sank as it was being towed to port. Sergei Markov, a former Kremlin adviser, said on Telegram it was obvious that Russia would not release detailed information about the attack at a time of war, but that it needed to do more to protect its assets in Crimea. “It’s clear that Crimea’s air defence systems must be strengthened. And it is clear that it [Ukraine] needs to be deprived of the opportunity to hit Russia,” Markov said.

Ukraine proposes lowering age for military conscription from 27 to 25,Draft bill proposed as military looks for hundreds of thousands of new recruits in its fight to eject Russia.,"Ukraine has proposed reducing the age of those who can be mobilised into the armed forces from 27 to 25 after the military said it needed as many as 500,000 more soldiers in its now 22-month-long war against Russia. The age reduction was in the text of a draft law posted on the website of Ukraine’s parliament late on Monday. The text detailed which Ukrainian citizens would be subject to enrolment for militaryregistration of conscriptsand said it would apply to those “who have reached the age of 25”. An explanatory note signed by Defence Minister Rustem Umerov summarised key provisions of the draft law, saying they included the “change of conscription age from 27 to 25 years”. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy revealed earlier this month that the military had proposed mobilising between 450,000 and 500,000 more Ukrainians but that it was a “highly sensitive” issue that the military and government would discuss before deciding whether to send the proposal to parliament. Zelenskyy, who has yet to back the proposal publicly, said on December 19 that he wanted to hear more arguments for mobilising additional people. “This is a very serious number,” he said. Ukraine’s troop numbers are not known but in the past, it has been said the country has about 1 million people under arms. US officials estimate that hundreds of thousands have been killed and wounded since Russia began itsfull-scale invasionof Ukraine in February 2022. Neither Ukraine nor Russia publishes its casualty figures. David Arakhamia, the head of Zelenskyy’s party in parliament, said the government was working on the bill at the request of the military and that it was due to be introduced on Monday. “The military needs a solution to its problems,” he said in a post on the Telegram messaging app. “Society wants to hear answers to all sensitive questions.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/26/ukraine-proposes-lowering-age-for-military-conscription-from-27-to-25

Ukraine officially celebrates Christmas on December 25 for the first time,The change reflects Ukrainians’ dismay at the 22-month-old Russian invasion and their assertion of a national identity.,"Ukrainians have celebrated Christmas on December 25 for the first time, as part of an ongoing effort to remove Russian influence from their country. The change was enacted in a law signed by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in July, reflecting both the Ukrainians’ dismay with the 22-month-old Russian invasion and their assertion of anational identity. Ukraine previously marked Christmas in January as the Russians do. “It’s historical justice,” said Yevhen Konyk, a 44-year-old serviceman who, along with his family, participated in traditional celebrations at an open-air museum in Kyiv. “We need to move forward not only with the world but also with the traditions of our country and overcome the imperial remnants we had.”    Ukraine is largely Orthodox Christian but the faith is divided between two churches, one of which has a long affiliation with the Russian Orthodox Church. TheOrthodox Churchof Ukraine, which does not recognise the authority of the Russian church and had been regarded as schismatic, was granted full recognition in 2019 by the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, Orthodoxy’s top authority. The Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which had been a branch of the Russian church, announced in 2022 after the start of the Russia-Ukraine war that it wasbreaking tieswith Moscow and becoming autonomous. Its parishes, however, continue to follow the same liturgical calendar as the Russian church and will observe Christmas on January 7.  Many Ukrainians embraced the move to celebrate Christmas on the date aligned with the rest of Western Europe with enthusiasm. Oksana Poviakel, the director of the Pyrohiv Museum of Folk Architecture and Life of Ukraine, where Christmas celebrations took place, said celebrating on December 25 is “another important factor of self-identification”. “We are separating ourselves from the neighbour who is currently trying to destroy our state, who is killing our people, destroying our homes, and burning our land,” she said. Asia Landarenko, 63, said she prays every day for her son who is in the military. “The state of war affects everything, including the mood. The real celebration of Christmas will be after the victory, but as the saviour was born, so will be our victory,” she said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/25/ukraine-officially-celebrates-christmas-on-december-25-for-the-first-time
Russia says it seizes Ukrainian town of Maryinka; Kyiv denies the claim,Putin hails Moscow’s biggest military success since the capture of Bakhmut in May.,"Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu says Russian troops have gained full control of the eastern Ukrainian town of Maryinka, registering their first major success since the capture of the strategic city ofBakhmutin May. Shoigu told President Vladimir Putin on Monday about the capture of what has now become a ghost town just southwest of the Russian-held regional capital of Donetsk during a video exchange shared by a Kremlin journalist. “I want to congratulate you. This is a success,” Putin is seen telling Shoigu in the video, saying it gives Russian troops “the opportunity to move into a wider operational area”. Piles of rubble and gutted apartment buildings could be seen in drone images shown on Russian television that were said to be of Maryinka, which was once home to 10,000 people. Putin had offered to award soldiers who had distinguished themselves in the battle for Maryinka, The Moscow Times reported.    The Ukrainian military denied Russia’s claims of Maryinka’s capture, which came at a difficult time for Kyiv. It has been struggling to make gains in recent months, and waning Western support, particularly critical US funding, threatens its fight against Russia. “It’s not correct to talk about seizing Maryinka,” Ukrainian military spokesperson Oleksandr Shtupun told Ukrainian national television. “Our forces are within the city,” he said. Russia’s last major success, the capture of Bakhmut, spurredUkraine to launch a counteroffensivein June. But Kyiv’s forces have made little progress against what is nowentrenched Russian resistancein the 22-month-old conflict. Russian troops have been intensifying ground and air attacks on the nearby town of Avdiivka since mid-October as they focus on expanding their slow-moving push through eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s air force on Monday reported that it had shot down two Russian fighter jets during the night along with two cruise missiles and 28 Shahed-type kamikaze drones. The report said the attacks were aimed at southern and central regions of Ukraine but that no casualties were immediately known. It said 31 drones were launched in all, but details of what the three that weren’t intercepted may have struck weren’t given.

Ukraine secures desperately needed funds from World Bank,"With US and EU funding delayed, Kyiv said the money would stabilise its economy as it continues to repel Russian attacks.","Ukraine has received a vital $1.34bn in funds from the World Bank. The funding has been paid out to support non-security related financial and economic stability, Ukraine’s Ministry of Finance said on Monday. The cash boost will be welcomed by Kyiv, which warns that its ability to defend against the Russian invasion could soon be impacted by delays in funding from the United States and the European Union. In astatement, the ministry noted that the financing, which is the Sixth Additional Financing under its Public Expenditures for Administrative Capacity Endurance in Ukraine (PEACE) project, consisted of a $1.086bn loan from the World Bank, a $190m grant from Norway, a $50m grant from the United States and a $20m grant from Switzerland. The funds are expected to be used to partially compensate for non-security and defence-related expenditures of the Ukrainian state budget, including old-age social payments and payments to employees of the state emergency service, the ministry added. “International financial assistance is a significant contribution to maintaining Ukraine’s financial and economic stability and allows us to provide priority social expenditures during the war,” said Ukrainian Finance Minister Serhiy Marchenko. “Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, the governments of Japan, the United States, Norway and Switzerland have repeatedly demonstrated their unwavering support and solidarity for Ukraine. I am grateful to our partners for their willingness to cooperate and help us at a crucial time for Ukraine.” It has been nearly two years since Russia invaded Ukraine, and as the war continues to rage uncertainty is growing overWestern backing for Ukraine. Earlier this month, the White House warned the United States Congress that funds designated for providing aid to Ukraine would run out by the end of the year, amid Russia’s intensifying campaign to knock out the country’s energy infrastructure. The US, Ukraine’s biggest single-country donor, has sent more than $40bn in aid since Russia’s invasion in February 2022. But right-wing congressional Republicans have expressed increasing scepticism towards approving more funds for Ukraine. The United States Senate has said they will vote on anaid packagefor Ukraine in 2024. But Congress could continue to hold up the money. The impasse over US aid to Kyiv is mirrored in the European Union, where Hungary isblockinga 50 billion euro ($55bn) aid package. The bloc is due to revisit the issue in January. The difficulties in securing the funds in Washington and Brussels have raised concerns in Kyiv that Western backers are experiencing “fatigue” with the drawn-out battle, as fighting on the front line becomesbogged down. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has noted that Kyiv’s “foreign policy will be active” with many international activities in January. “We make every effort to strengthen Ukraine and ensure that everyone is confident about the coming year, about military aid, macro-financial assistance, and political support,” he said. We continue to work with partners in order to maintain unity in support for Ukraine.

On Monday, the Ukrainian military said that Russia launched 31 drones and two missiles from the annexed Crimean Peninsula overnight. The military said the attack mostly targeted the south of Ukraine. Kyiv’s air defences “destroyed 28 Shahed attack drones in Odesa, Kherson, Mykolaiv, Donetsk, Kirovohrad and Khmelnytskyi regions” and also destroyed the missiles, it said. Meanwhile, Russian-installed authorities reported one person killed in Ukrainian shelling of the Russian-occupied eastern town of Horlivka.

"Ukraine, Russia say six civilians killed in attacks on Kherson, Horlivka","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says in Christmas Eve address that ‘day by day, the darkness is losing’.","Russian attacks on Ukraine’s southern Kherson region have killed five people, according to Ukrainian officials, while Russian-installed authorities reported one person killed in Ukrainian shelling of the Russian-occupied eastern town of Horlivka. Ukrainian officials said the deaths in the attacks on Sunday include an 87-year-old man and his 81-year-old wife who were killed when their Kherson City apartment building was shelled. Oleksandr Tolokonnikov, the head of the press office of Kherson’s regional military administration, said nine other people, including a 15-year-old, were wounded and gas and water supplies were partially cut off in the attacks. “There are no holidays for the enemy,” Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian president’s office, said in a post on social media. “They do not exist for us as long as the enemy kills our people and remains on our land.” Russian forces have carried out repeated shelling of the city of Kherson since abandoning the administrative centre of the region more than a year ago.

Ukraine picks new Christmas date in break with Russian tradition,"For the first time in a century, Ukraine will celebrate the holiday on December 25 rather than January 7.","Ukraine will formally mark Christmas Day on December 25 this year, in a symbolic shift away from Russia, which celebrates the holiday on January 7. It will be the first time in more than a century that Ukraine observes the date in line with the Gregorian calendar, along with most of the world’s Christians. Ukraine’s government passed legislation in July making the date change, in what was viewed as a snub to Russia and the Russian Orthodox Church, which follows the Roman-era Julian calendar for religious occasions. The law signed by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that Ukrainians wanted to “live their own life with their own traditions and holidays”. It allows them to “abandon the Russian heritage of imposing Christmas celebrations on January 7”, it added. Christianity is the largest religion in Ukraine, with the Russian Orthodox Church historically dominating religious life. Ukraine’s date change is part of a series of moves since Russia’s invasion to dispel any traces of the Russian and Soviet empires, such as renaming streets and removing monuments. The Orthodox Church of Ukraine, a newly created independent church that held its first service in 2019, has also changed its Christmas date to December 25. It formally broke away from the Russian Orthodox Church over Moscow’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its support for separatists in eastern Ukraine. The political rift has seen priests and even entire parishes swap from one church to another, with the new Orthodox Church of Ukraine growing fast and taking over several Russia-linked church buildings in moves supported by the government. The historically Russia-linked Ukrainian Orthodox Church, meanwhile, is keeping the January 7 Christmas date. This church claims to have cut ties with Russia because of the war but many Ukrainians view this with scepticism. The country’s third Orthodox denomination, the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, will also hold Christmas services on December 25. Ukraine had been under Moscow’s spiritual leadership since the 17th century at the latest. Under the Soviet Union and its profession of atheism, Christmas traditions such as trees and gifts were shifted to New Year’s Eve, which became the main holiday and still is for many families. Ukrainian Christmas traditions include a dinner on Christmas Eve with 12 meatless dishes, including a sweet grain pudding called kutya, and people decorate homes with elaborate sheaves of wheat called didukhy. In some areas, children go from house to house singing carols called kolyadky and performing nativity scenes.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/24/ukraine-picks-new-christmas-date-in-break-with-russian-tradition
"Russia blasts US on frozen assets, missiles as Ukraine bombardment persists",Moscow warns of retaliation as war in Ukraine causes relations with the West to deteriorate.,"Russia has warned that it will react robustly to Western moves to seize its assets or deploy missiles. Moscow could sever diplomatic relations with the United States should it confiscate Russian assets frozen under sanctions, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said on Friday. Officials also said the Kremlin would respond to the deployment of missiles in Europe or Asia, even as Ukraine reported that Russia had unleashed another barrage of attack drones overnight. Ryabkov threatened that Moscow could cut diplomatic ties with Washington should it hand frozen Russian assets to Kyiv, which isdesperate for funds, according to the Russian state news agency Interfax. Western countries are discussing the confiscation of more than $1bn in Russian assets frozen due to sanctions over the war in Ukraine. The US “must not act under an illusion … that Russia is clinging with both hands to diplomatic relations with that country”, the official said. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov later said at a media briefing that countries who seize Russian assets would never be left in peace and Russia would look at what Western assets it could seize in retaliation. Some officials in US political circles have suggested that $300bn of funds from Russian Central Bank reserves frozen in February 2022 to put pressure on Moscow to withdraw from Ukraine be handed to Kyiv. Peskov said any such seizure would deal a serious blow to the international financial system and Russia would defend its rights in the courts and through other means. On Thursday, Russia promised to respond in kind should the European Union go ahead with a plan to ring-fence profits generated from frozen assets and hand them to Ukraine. Prosecutors in Germany said this week that they were applying to confiscate more than 720 million euros ($790m) from the Frankfurt bank account of a Russian financial institution. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called German leaders “a thieving lot” that have been taking lessons from Washington. “They used to be thieving in the political sense – breaking agreements, cheating someone – but now they are thieving in the direct sense,” he said. President Vladimir Putin this week ordered two European concerns, Wintershall Dea and OMV, be stripped of multibillion-dollar stakes in gas projects in the Russian Arctic. The West is seeking to tighten its sanctions against Russia as it continues to pummel Ukraine. US President Joe Biden will sign an executive order allowing Washington to impose sanctions on financial institutions that help Russia evade sanctions, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Friday. The measure will also allow Washington to ban products originating in Russia but processed in third countries, such as seafood and diamonds, Yellen said in a statement. “Today we are taking steps to level new and powerful tools against Russia’s war machine,” Yellen said. “And we will not hesitate to use the new tools provided by this authority to take decisive and surgical action against financial institutions that facilitate the supply of Russia’s war machine.” Russia’s concerns extend beyond the business and financial sectors. Ryabkov also threatened that Russia is ready to swiftly respond in kind to any deployment by the US of short- and medium-range missiles in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. Moscow is closely tracking Washington’s missile development and potential deployments and was ready to swiftly take the necessary political decisions to respond in kind, he stated. The official also lashed out at the US over problems regarding efforts to organise a prisoner swap, accusing Washington of leaking details of the “sensitive negotiations”. The US said this month that Russia had rejected proposals for the release of former US marine Paul Whelan and Wall Street Journal reporterEvan Gershkovich. Russian forces continued large-scale attacks against infrastructure and civilian sites in Ukraine overnight into Friday. Kyiv’s air force said on social media that it had shot down 24 of 28 Shahed attack drones launched from Russia. It was the sixth such attack on the Ukrainian capital so far in December and part of a larger drone swarm that also targeted other parts of central, southern and western Ukraine, the air force said. Air raid sirens were heard in Kyiv late on Thursday, and residents heard explosions. City hall initially said air defences were in action and called on people to stay in shelters. Russian missiles and drones have begun to frequently target the Ukrainian capital although they are usually shot down by air defence systems. “A residential building in Kyiv hit by a Shahed,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, wrote on Telegram. That attack affected the city’s Solomianskyi district, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram, reporting “flames on the upper floors” of the building. One man was hospitalised while another person was treated at the scene, he said. Kyiv’s military administration published photos on social media of apartment buildings with windows blown out, saying debris from a downed drone had caused the damage rather than a strike. Klitschko also said debris from another downed drone fell on a house in the Darnytskyi district in eastern Kyiv. In the Holosiivskyi district in the city’s south, a piece of shrapnel from a downed drone fell on a high-rise building without causing any casualties, the military administration said on Telegram.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/22/russia-may-sever-ties-respond-in-kind-over-seizure-of-its-assets

Roman Abramovich loses legal attempt to overturn EU sanctions,The EU imposed punishment on the oligarch in 2022 as part of measures targeting Russia and Putin’s close allies.,"Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich has lost a legal challenge aimed at overturning European Union sanctions imposed on him in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Abramovich had filed a lawsuit at the EU’s general court against the European Union Council, which imposed punitive sanctions on the 57-year-old in 2022 as part of measures targeting Russia and President Vladimir Putin’s close allies after Russia invaded Ukraine. The court in Brussels rejected the challenge and also dismissed his claims for compensation, noting his role in the Russian steel company Evraz and the fact that steel provided a major source of revenue to the Russian government. “The General Court dismisses the action brought by Mr Abramovich, thereby upholding the restrictive measures taken against him,” it said in its ruling on Wednesday. “The [European] Council did not in fact err in its assessment by deciding to include, then maintain, Mr Abramovich’s name on the lists at issue, in the light of his role in the Evraz group and, in particular, its parent company,” it added, referring to the sanctions lists. Abramovich, who also holds Israeli citizenship and is a former owner of Premier League football club Chelsea, became one of the world’s most powerful businessmen after the 1991 break-up of the Soviet Union. Forbes estimates his net worth at $9.2bn. In a statement issued on his behalf, Abramovich said he was disappointed by the ruling, which he can appeal. He said the court had not considered some of the arguments used by the EU Council, including the proposition that Abramovich had benefitted from the Russian government – which he said was a false suggestion. “Mr Abramovich does not have the ability to influence the decision-making of any government, including Russia, and has in no way benefited from the [Ukraine] war,” the statement said. “The court’s decision to maintain the sanctions against Mr Abramovich was based purely on the court defining Mr Abramovich as a ‘Russian businessman’ which under today’s very broad EU regulations is sufficient to remain sanctioned, even if you are just a passive shareholder in a business sector with no connection to the war.” The businessman has also been punished in the United Kingdom and had his assets frozen in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Abramovich wasforced to sell Chelseaafter being sanctioned by the British government for what it called his enabling of Putin’s “brutal and barbaric invasion” of Ukraine. The sale of the Premier League club for 2.5 billion pounds ($3.2bn) — then the highest price ever paid for a sports team — was completed by a consortium fronted by Los Angeles Dodgers part-owner Todd Boehly. It marked the end of the trophy-filled, 19-year tenure of Abramovich. The EU has imposed12 rounds of sanctionson Russia since Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine almost two years ago. The measures have targeted the energy sector, banks, companies and markets, and made more than 1,000 Russian officials subject to asset freezes and travel bans.

US aid debate pushed to 2024 as Ukraine continues to battle Russian drones,"US Senate debate on new aid will run into the new year, despite Kyiv push for urgency.","The United States Senate will not vote on an aid package for Ukraine this year, the chamber leaders have said. Democratic and Republican negotiators continue to seek a compromise on the delayed funding deal to support Kyiv as it defends against Russia’s invasion, a joint statement released on Tuesday said. Ukraine has become increasingly desperate to secure funding from the West in recent weeks, with political delays to both US and European Union aid bolstering Russian confidence amid the bogged-down conflict. Having already handed Ukraine about $100bn in aid since the February 2022 invasion, President Joe Biden has asked the lower house Congress to approve another $60bn. However, Republicans have blocked the move, using the issue to demand new immigration legislation. Meanwhile, work is continuing in the upper house Senate to reach a compromise. “As negotiators work through remaining issues, it is our hope that their efforts will allow the Senate to take swift action … early in the new year,” Democrat Chuck Schumer and Republican Mitch McConnell said in the statement. “Challenging issues remain,” the statement continued, referring to US interests in Ukraine, Israel, the Indo-Pacific and along its southern border with Mexico. “The Senate will not let these national security challenges go unanswered.” For the remainder of the year, negotiators would “continue to work in good faith toward finalising their agreement”, they added. However, it is not clear that any deal reached in the Democratic-majority Senate would win support in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, where a significant number of party hardliners oppose providing additional funding. The war in Ukraine, now in its 22nd month, risks being overshadowed by Israel’s war on Gaza that has been raging since October 7, aided by US financial support. The impasse over US aid to Kyiv is mirrored in the EU, where Hungary isblockinga 50 billion euro ($54bn) aid package. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urged both Washington and Brussels to unlock the funds, warning that Moscow was counting on Western unity to “collapse” and of a “dire need” for weapons. In a press conference on Tuesday he said he believed the US“will not betray”his besieged nation. The Kremlin has celebrated the gridlock, and ramped up pressure on the front lines, where the war has largely become bogged down in trenches. As winter approaches, Russia has continued to focus on destroying infrastructure and attacking cities. Overnight on Tuesday, new air attacks targeted Kyiv and other regions. Air defence systems destroyed 18 out of 19 drones, Ukrainian military officials said on Wednesday. “According to preliminary information, there were no casualties or destruction in the capital,” Serhiy Popko, head of Kyiv’s military administration, said on the Telegram messaging app. Kyiv on Wednesday also reported that it plans to build more than one million drones in 2024, as it seeks to raise its own weapons production to reduce dependence on foreign shipments, which are struggling to meet earlier commitments. The strategy is also seen as a potential boost to the economy. Under the scheme, Ukraine hopes to produce one million FPV (first-person-view) drones, widely in demand on the front line, and more than 11,000 medium and long-range attack drones next year, Ukraine’s minister for strategic industries said. The White House has warned that by the end of the year, US aid to Ukraine will be depleted, but has been unable to push the package past partisan political interests. Zelenskyy faced a sceptical reception from Republicans when he visited Washington last week. Speaking on Tuesday, the Ukrainian president also expressed concerns about how US policies towards Ukraine could change if Republican Donald Trump is elected US president in 2024. “If the policy of the next president, whoever it is, is different towards Ukraine, more cold or more economical, I think these signals will have a very strong impact on the course of the war,” Zelenskyy said. Since Russian tanks first rolled into Ukraine, the Kremlin has bet that Western military support would ebb. Russian President Vladimir Putin is believed to be eagerly watching for signs that later this year Trump could offer his campaign significantly eased conditions. On Wednesday, he again slammed Western support for Kyiv, calling for a “severe” response to foreign agents who aim to destabilise Russia by aiding Ukraine. “The Kyiv regime with direct support of foreign special services has taken the path of terrorist methods, practically state terrorism,” Putin said in a video address. “The attempts by foreign special agents to destabilise the political and social situation in Russia must be severely stopped.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/20/us-wont-approve-ukraine-aid-before-2024-as-russian-air-attacks-continue

Zelenskyy confident US will not ‘betray’ Ukraine,"Ukrainian president suggests his country could mobilise 500,000 more people in order to fight Russian invasion.","Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyhas expressed confidence that the United States and other Western countries will continue to support Ukraine in its battle to repel Russia’s invasion. Speaking during an end-of-year news conference on Tuesday, Zelenskyy said that financial assistance plays a crucial role in the country’s efforts to drive back Russian forces that poured over the border in February 2022. He also suggested that Ukraine could mobilise 500,000 more people in order to fight on. “We are working very hard on this, and I am certain the United States of America will not betray us, and that on which we agreed in the United States will be fulfilled completely,” Zelenskyy said. The address comes as support for Ukraine in Western countries comes under greater pressure, with conservatives in the United Statesexpressing doubtsabout continued assistance and stalling the passage of a substantial aid package. Leaders in the US Senate said on Tuesday that the package was not likely to move forward before the end of the year. Zelenskyy, who haspreviously warnedthat such delays benefit Russian PresidentVladimir Putin, said that a Trump victory in the 2024 US elections could have “a very strong impact on the course of the war” if he pursued a policy towards Ukraine that was “more cold or more economical”. The Ukrainian leader also said that he was sure that the European Union (EU) would move forward with a 50-billion-euro ($55bn) aid package of its own, despiteopposition from Hungary, whose right-wing government has raised objections to further assistance for Ukraine. “I’m confident that we have already achieved all this,” Zelenskyy said. “The question now is one of a certain matter of time.” However, support for Ukraine has become a divisive issue in Western countries after along-awaited counteroffensiveover the summer failed to win back substantial territory and the war grinds on. TheRussian invasion, which has been accused of including war crimes, has devastated Ukrainian cities, displaced millions of people, and killed at least 10,000 civilians, according to the United Nations. Zelenskyy said that he is weighing the possibility of mobilising an additional 500,000 troops, adding that he had asked the military for more details on this “very sensitive matter”. Speaking on Tuesday, Putin said that Russia was open to negotiations with Ukraine, the US, and Europe but added that Russia “will not give up what is ours”. “The West isn’t abandoning its strategy of containment of Russia and its aggressive goals in Ukraine,” Putin said. “Well, we also aren’t going to abandon the goals of the special military operation.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/19/zelenskyy-confident-us-will-not-betray-ukraine
Russia boosts nuclear forces amid ‘hybrid war’ with the West: Putin,President says Moscow’s strategic forces remain at the highest level of readiness as he meets top defence officials.,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that Moscow is upgrading its nuclear arsenal and keeping its strategic forces at the highest level of readiness as the West wages a “hybrid war” against it. Moscow would continue what it calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine, and all attempts to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia had crumbled, Putin told a conference of senior defence officials on Tuesday. The Russian leader also accused the United States of exploiting Europe for its own interests and said his country planned no war on Europe. Russia would be prepared to talk to Ukraine, the US and Europe about the future of Ukraine if they wanted to, but Moscow would defend its national interests, Putin said. “In Ukraine, those who are aggressive towards Russia, and in Europe and in the United States – do they want to negotiate? Let them. But we will do it based on our national interests,” he said. “We will not give up what is ours.” Russia would proceed from its own interests when dealing with Ukraine, regardless of Kyiv’s attempts to make any agreements, said Putin, who last week announced that his country’s goals in Ukraine remain unchanged and there will be no peace until they are achieved. Ukraine’s membership of the NATO military alliance “is not acceptable for Russia in 10 years, and not in 20”, he said. The president said Russia’s defence industry has reacted to the conflict in Ukraine faster than that of the West. Meanwhile, Minister of Defence Sergey Shoigu told the same meeting that Russia had increased tank production by 5.6 times since the start of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine last year, and had laid 7,000sq km (2,700sq miles) of minefields along the 2,000km (1,250-mile) front line. Moscow has demanded “denazification, demilitarisation and a neutral status” of Ukraine – which Putin has repeated sinceRussia invaded Ukrainein February 2022. Russia has alleged that Ukraine’s government is heavily influenced by “radical nationalist” and neo-Nazi groups, which Kyiv and the West dispute. The Russian government has also consistently demanded that Ukraine remain neutral and not join NATO. Putin announcedthat he will run in the March 2024 presidential election, in which the 71-year-old leader is almost certain to win a fifth term. He has been in power for 24 years, including his prime ministerial stint, and a victory next year will see him remain president until 2030.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/19/russia-boosts-nuclear-forces-amid-hybrid-war-with-the-west-putin
UN rights chief: ‘Extensive failure’ by Russia to protect Ukraine civilians,Volker Turk also says there are indications that Russian forces committed war crimes.,"The United Nations human rights chief has said there had been an “extensive failure” by Russia to take adequate measures to protect civilians in Ukraine and that there were indications that Russian forces had committed war crimes. Volker Turk, the UN high commissioner for human rights, said on Tuesday that his office’s monitoring indicated “gross violations of international human rights law, serious violations of international humanitarian law, and war crimes, primarily by the forces of the Russian Federation”. These included 142 cases of summary execution of civilians since Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year, as well as enforced disappearances, torture and ill-treatment of detainees, including through sexual violence. Russia has denied committing atrocities or targeting civilians in Ukraine. “The situation in Ukraine seems to have been added to a litany of continuous suffering, and the world’s attention seems jaded by the multiple crises that we face,” Turk told the Human Rights Council in Geneva. Russia has not taken “adequate measures to protect civilians” nor civilian infrastructure “against the effects of their attacks”, he said. The armed forces of both countries, particularly Russia, needed to abide by international human rights and humanitarian law, he added. “They must cease the use of explosive weapons with wide-area effects in populated areas, and scrupulously map the location of mines,” he said. On Tuesday, Russia’s Minister of Defence Sergei Shoigu said that since the start of what Moscow calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine, Russian forces had laid 7,000sq km (2,700sq miles) of minefields along the 2,000km (1,250-mile) front line. During a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin and senior defence officials, Shoigu also said that Russia had increased tank production by 5.6 times. Ukraine’s military has been feeling even more pressure on the front amid waveringsupport from the United Statesand some European countries. After weeks of effort torallymilitary and political backing with visits on both sides of the Atlantic, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy failed to convince the US Congress to approve $60bn in support while in Brussels, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban blocked some 50 billion euros ($55bn) in aid earmarked for Kyiv. Yet, the European Union invited Ukraine toopen membership talkslast week despite objections from Orban, who stood isolated in arguing that European Union financial resources should be saved for existing members. UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron voiced commitment to Ukraine on Tuesday, saying, “Britain and France have been staunch supporters of Ukraine and we will continue to be for as long as it takes. “I have no doubt that we can make sure [President Vladimir Putin] loses and it is essential he does lose,” Cameron said after talks in Paris with his French counterpart Catherine Colonna. Cameron said that Western countries must work together to muster the “economic strength and that commitment pay” as the allies “outmatch the Russian economy by 25 to one or more”. Neither Cameron nor Colonna announced new aid for Ukraine in their comments to reporters. “Hand in hand since the beginning, our two countries are working together to ensure that the Russian aggression is not rewarded, is a failure,” Colonna said. Zelenskyy’s visit with leaders of Nordic countries last week did yield some positive results with Norway promising additional aid worth $275m. And Denmark said it would seek parliamentary approval for $1.1bn in new funds. Zelenskyy is set to hold an end-of-year news conference later on Tuesday.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/19/the-un-and-eu-allies-reaffirm-support-for-ukraine-ahead-of-zelenskyy-speech

Russia designates author Boris Akunin ‘terrorist and extremist’,The popular novelist has criticised Russia’s war on Ukraine and previously called Vladimir Putin a ‘deranged dictator’.,"The Russian government has added the popular author Grigory Chkhartishvili – known by his pen name Boris Akunin – to a register of “terrorists and extremists” for his critical stance towards Russia’sinvasion of Ukraine. Rosfinmonitoring, Russia’s main financial intelligence body, announced that the detective novelist had been added to the registry on Monday. The 67-year-old is known for his historical detective novels and his longstanding criticism of President Vladimir Putin. “Terrorists declared me a terrorist,” Akunin, who lives in exile in London, wrote on Facebook. Separately, Russia’s Investigative Committee said it had opened a case against the Russian-Georgian author for allegedly “justifying terrorism and publicly spreading fake information” about the military. Russia adopted a law criminalising comments that discredit the armed forces following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The Kremlin has since wielded those powers tocrack downon critics. On the day Putin sent Russian troops into Ukraine, Akunin wrote on Facebook thatthe Russian leaderwas a “psychologically deranged dictator”. Speaking withAl Jazeerain March 2022, Akunin said that, even before the invasion of Ukraine, Putin had been “very methodically killing all the branches of democracy” in Russia. “We see what it has brought us to eventually: Russia, Ukraine, and now the whole world is seriously discussing the possibility of nuclear war in the 21st century,” he said. “This is all Putin’s doing.” One of Russia’s best-known publishing houses, AST, announced last week that it would no longer print or sell works by Akunin or Dmitry Bykov, another author critical of the war in Ukraine. The decision by AST followed the release of a prank call from the Russian prankster duo known as Vovan and Lexus, who spoke with the two authors posing as Ukrainian officials. Bykov told the duo that while he was saddened by the killing of Russian soldiers in the conflict, this was not something he blamed on Ukrainian officials.

‘Nonsense’: Putin rejects Biden claim that Russia plans to attack NATO,The Russian president says Moscow has ‘no interest … to fight with NATO countries’.,"The Russian president has dismissed the United States’s claims that Moscow could attack a NATO country in the future as “complete nonsense”, saying such a conflict would run counter to his country’s interests. Vladimir Putin made the statement in an interview with Russian state TV on Sunday, weeks after US President Joe Bidenwarnedthat if Putin achieved victory in Ukraine, he might be emboldened to attack a NATO ally, sparking a third world war. “It is complete nonsense – and I think President Biden understands that,” Putin told state television channel Rossiya. “Russia has no reason, no interest – no geopolitical interest, neither economic, political nor military – to fight with NATO countries.” Putin added that Biden may be trying to stoke such fears to justify his “erroneous policy” in the region. US-Russia relations have sunk to their lowest level in decades since Moscow invaded neighbouring Ukraine in February 2022. Throughout the 22-month war, the US has provided Ukraine with $111bn in weapons, equipment, and other aid, helping the Ukrainians fend off Russia’s advance and regain some territory. Biden favours sending even more support to war-torn Ukraine, which is running short on supplies as it grinds to a bloody winter stalemate. He has asked US Congress to approve $61.4bn in support for Ukraine as part of a larger $110bn package that includes more funds for Israel and other issues. However, there is waning appetite in the Congress for the lingering war. Some Republican lawmakers have blocked the aid package, demanding the White House first take action on border security. Biden on December 12saidright-wing lawmakers’ refusal to approve the package also risked handing President Putin a “Christmas gift” of victory. “Putin is banking on the United States failing to deliver for Ukraine,” Biden said during a news conference with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. “We must … prove him wrong.” While Putin dismissed the prospect of a direct NATO feud, he did address tensions with neighbouring Finland since it joined the alliance. Finland, which became a NATO member in April, on Fridayshut downits entire eastern border with Russia, which it accuses of orchestrating a migrant crisis on its border. Putin said he would respond to the deteriorating ties by opening up a military zone in its northwest. “They [the West] dragged Finland into NATO. Did we have any disputes with them? All disputes, including territorial ones in the mid-20th century, have long been solved,” Putin said. “There were no problems there. Now there will be [problems] because we will create the Leningrad military district and concentrate a certain amount of military units there.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/17/nonsense-putin-rejects-biden-claim-that-russia-plans-to-attack-nato
Has the Ukraine war made Europe politically mature — or more transactional?,"Even as the EU invited Ukraine for membership talks this week, deep divisions are now visible after a year of rare unity.","The European Union hailed its next phase ofexpansion as a political victorythis week when leaders invited Ukraine to open membership talks. That invitation, also issued to Moldova, delivered a message to Moscow that the EU would defend the right of former Soviet states to choose a Western orientation. Plunging the knife deep into the Caucasus, the European Council also recognised Georgia as a candidate country. These moves came over the objections of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who stood isolated in arguing that EU financial resources should be saved for existing members. Orban was persuaded to leave the room so the other 26 members could proceed with the expansion decision, but the stout Hungarian stood his ground in blocking approval of a 50 billion euro ($55bn) financial aid package to Ukraine over the next four years. A separate 20 billion euro ($22bn) military aid package for Ukraine also remains in limbo. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow was “impressed” by Hungary’s stance. “Hungary has its own interests. And Hungary, unlike many other EU countries, firmly defends its interests, which impresses us,” Peskov said. During its first year, the Ukraine war appeared to give the EU a long overdue dose of political maturity and unity. The EU froze $300bn in Russian financial assets, unanimously approved11 sanctions packagesagainst Russia, provided Ukraine with85 billion euros( $93bn) in military and financial aid, and accelerated its transition to renewable energy sources as it weaned itself off Russian oil and gas. Yet European unity and resolve appear to have faltered in the second year of the war, analysts told Al Jazeera. A 12th sanctions package languished in intricate negotiations before it was finally approved on December 14 — withRussian diamondimports a key target. The energy transition slowed from a 20 percent increase in solar and wind power in 2022 to a 12 percent rise in 2023, according to Ember, an energy think tank. And as the December summit demonstrated, disagreement remained over the disbursal of EU funds to Ukraine. Most noticeably, Europe made little progress towards a more robust Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), continuing to entrust its security to NATO. The EU works on a consensus basis on major issues, where a single member can block a decision. “We have the phenomenon of countries who want to define themselves as middle powers … who want to have agency in a policy area and refuse to be boxed into binary decision making,” Jens Bastian, a fellow with the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, told Al Jazeera. “This is not an example of maturity, it’s an example of increasing transactionalism,” he said. Hungary, for example, leveraged its veto power to argue for thereleaseof 10 billion euros ($11bn), a third of the funds the European Commission has withheld to press Hungary into scaling back political interference in the functioning of itsjudiciary. The EU’s sanctions packages have been rife with such transactionalism, said Bastian. The Czech Republic has requested an exemption from a ban on Russian steel imports, arguing it needs heavy steel plates to build bridges. “It has asked for an exemption not for one or two years, but until 2028. You’ve had two years [of war] to reconsider your steel manufacturing capacity,” said Bastian. It has taken until now for the EU to consider a ban on Russian diamonds because of concerns over how this will affect the Belgian economy. Some 90 percent of the world’s rough diamonds are cut in the Belgian city of Antwerp. And when the EU banned Russian oil imports a year ago, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic wereexemptedbecause they are landlocked and cannot receive crude oil from tankers. “I cannot remember the EU ever sanctioning one of its own members for sanctions-busting and one reason is the sheer amount of exemptions is so long,” said Bastian. The refusal to be inconvenienced has nowhere been clearer than in many EU members’ refusal to significantly raise their defence budgets. Germany grandly announced a 100-billion-euro ($110bn) increase in defence spending when the Ukraine war broke out. That money was supposed to have been spent two years into the war, but most of it has yet to be written into the budget. Last month Germany’s constitutional court told finance minister Christian Lindner he had to cut the 2024 budget by 60 billion euros ($66bn) earmarked for green initiatives. That’s because Germany has a constitutional obligation to limit its annual federal budget deficit to 0.35 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP), and spending on Ukraine, rebuilding national defence, subsidising household energy efficiency and expanding renewable energy are all clamouring for fiscal attention. That is a problem in a European Union looking to its biggest economy to lead the way in greater defence autonomy. “Germany has pledged a lot but it has yet to deliver,” Minna Alander, a research fellow at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs and a specialist on German foreign and security policy, told Al Jazeera. “It boils down to the question of, ‘Do we want to keep this constitutional [deficit] limit?… is there political willingness to change the thinking according to the needs that we have now,’ and we don’t see that right now … the sense of urgency is nowhere near there,” Alander said. She called it, “one of the biggest blows in the credibility problem Germany is facing”. Since World War II, Europe has not been – nor has it seen itself as – a major geopolitical force, ceding that status to Washington and Moscow during the Cold War. A series of efforts to introduce qualified majority voting in the European Council, making it impossible for any one member to veto a decision, faltered between 2002 and 2005. Had they succeeded, Europe would now be in a position to take foreign policy decisions by majority vote, and wouldn’t be hobbled by a single member, whether Hungary or anyone else. That in turn would enable it to posture as a “geopolitical union”, a phrase that European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen is particularly fond of. Qualified majorities are vital in a diverse bloc where threat perceptions differ greatly, said Alander. “European countries have such differing perspectives on what is the greatest threat to their national security,” she said. During the Ukraine war, the EU states surrounding the North and Baltic Seas have advocated most strongly for a common foreign and security policy that actively anticipates a Russian future threat. They have argued that if Russia should get its way in Ukraine, they might be targeted next, as Putin’s Russia attempts to claw former Warsaw Pact countries back into its orbit. A recent opinion poll by theEuropean Council on Foreign Relationsfound wildly differing majorities in favour of an expansion to include Ukraine – and even in Denmark and Poland, among Ukraine’s most ardent supporters, approval didn’t surpass 50 percent. “We have seen the birth of a geopolitical union – supporting Ukraine, standing up to Russia’s aggression, responding to an assertive China and investing in partnerships,” von der Leyen said in her lastState of the European Unionspeech in September. That, believes Alander, is now a necessity, as US support for European security begins to waver. “The most likely thing to happen … is that US support for Ukraine becomes more conditional and less secure,” said Alander. “Next year it may be that we have to play a bigger role.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/16/has-the-ukraine-war-made-europe-politically-mature-or-more
Hungary blocks $54bn EU financial aid for Ukraine,Veto came hours after the European Union agreed to open membership talks with Ukraine in a move Hungary opposed.,"Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has blocked 50 billion euros ($54bn) in European Union aid for Ukraine, hours after the groupagreedto formally open membership talks with Kyiv. Leaders meeting in Brussels said they would revisit the issue next month after Orban refused to back the additional funding for Ukraine’s government as itbattlesto remove Russian forces from its territory. “Summary of the nightshift: veto for the extra money to Ukraine,” Orban, the closest ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin in the EU, wrote on social media. The EU’s other leaders agreed to revisit the debate in January. “We still have some time, Ukraine is not out of money in the next few weeks,” Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told reporters as he left the talks. “We agreed with the 26 countries. Victor Orban, Hungary, were not yet able to do that. I am fairly confident we can get a deal early next year. We are thinking of late January.” Rutte said another summit would be convened to reach a deal. Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo stressed that the financial support was vital. “It is just as important that Ukraine has the means to continue the war and rebuild its country,” he said. Orban had promised to block the membership talks and the funding for weeks, and the decision was a blow to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who failed this week to persuadeRepublican lawmakersin the United States to approve an additional $61bn for Ukraine. Most EU leaders wanted this week’s summit to send a clear sign of solidarity with Ukraine amid perceptions, eagerly seized upon and repeated by Moscow, that allies’ support for Kyiv was waning. Critics have accused the Hungarian leader of holding Kyiv’s survival hostage in a bid to force Brussels to release billions of euros in EU fundsfrozenamid concerns about Budapest’s commitment to the rule of law. In what some saw as a last-minute concession, the European Commission, the EU’s executive, agreed on Wednesday to unblock 10 billion euros ($11bn) of the money. A further 21 billion euros ($23bn) remains out of Orban’s grasp, but he denied that there was any link to Hungary’s intransigence over Ukraine. “That’s not our style,” he said. Thewar in Ukrainehas become bogged down on the front lines in the country’s east, wherePutinon Thursday claimed his troops were making progress. The country currently has some 617,000 soldiers in Ukraine, he added, after launching its full-scale invasion in February 2022. Across Brussels, at NATO headquarters, the security alliance’s Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned that the West must continue supporting Ukraine in order to protect the rest of Europe. “If Putin wins in Ukraine, there is real risk that his aggression will not end there. Our support is not charity – it is an investment in our security,” Stoltenberg said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/15/hungary-blocks-54bn-eu-financial-aid-for-ukraine

Zelenskyy claims ‘victory’ as EU agrees to open Ukraine membership talks,Moment of celebration turns bittersweet as Hungary carries through on threats to block financial aid for Kyiv.,"President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has hailed a “victory” for Ukraine and Europe after European Union leaders agreed to openmembership talkswith Kyiv, but the mood was soured just hours later when Hungary carried through on threats to block crucial financial aid to Ukraine. European Council President Charles Michel, host of the summit in Brussels, announced Thursday’s agreement on membership talks in a social media post, calling it “a clear signal of hope for their people and for our continent”. Zelenskyy welcomed the decision as “a victory for Ukraine. A victory for all of Europe. A victory that motivates, inspires, and strengthens,” he said in a post on X. European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said it was “a strategic decision and a day that will remain engraved in the history of our union”. “These countries belong to the European family,” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said. The EU also agreed to open talks with Moldova and granted EU candidate status to Georgia. Michel said the block would also advance a membership bid by another hopeful – Bosnia and Herzegovina – once it reaches “the necessary degree of compliance” with criteria. But the mood changed early on Friday when Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orban, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, announced he hadblockeda proposal to revamp the EU budget to include 50 billion euros ($54bn) in financial aid to Kyiv as it battles to remove Russian troops from its territory. For weeks, Orban had been promising to block the membership deal and the funding, which he said were not in the interests of Hungary or the EU. While Orban had agreed not to be in the room for the membership vote – allowing it to pass – the other EU nations were unable to overcome his resistance to the budget proposal put forward by Michel. “We still have some time. Ukraine is not out of money in the next few weeks,” Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told reporters on leaving the talks. “I am fairly confident we can get a deal early next year, we are thinking of late January.” However, on Friday, Orban told Hungarians in an interview on state radio that Budapest could yet put a stop to Ukraine’s membership talks and he will not give a nod to the funding package unless Brussels releases billions of euros to Hungary that it has frozen due to rule of law concerns. It is widely believed that Orban has been complicating the EU’s efforts to help Ukraine not only because he is close to Putin but also as a way to force Brussels to release the frozen funds, which total more than 30 billion euros ($32.8bn). Stressing that membership talks would be long and complex, the Hungarian leader slammed the “bad decision” to invite Ukraine to launch the process. “Hungary bears no responsibility for this. We can halt this process later on, and if needed, we will pull the brakes, and the ultimate decision will be made by the Hungarian parliament,” he said. He also appeared to set out a clear quid pro quo regarding the funding. “I’ve always said that if someone wants to amend the budget law and they want to for several reasons, this is a great opportunity for Hungary to make it clear that it should get what it deserves – not half, then a quarter, but it must get the whole thing,” Orban said. While insisting that Hungary is not a pro-Russian country, the Kremlin on Friday praised Budapest for being prepared to defend its own interests. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov warned that Ukraine and Moldova could “destabilise” the EU should they join. “Negotiations to join the EU can last for years or decades. The EU has always had strict criteria for accession, and it is obvious that at the moment neither Ukraine nor Moldova meets these criteria,” he told reporters. “It is clear that this is an absolutely politicised decision, the EU’s desire to demonstrate support for these countries. But such new members could destabilise the EU, and since we live on the same continent as the EU, we, of course, are closely watching this.” Zelenskyy has been rallying allies’ support for his country as concerns grow that their backing might be waning. This week, he travelled tothe United States, where he hoped to persuade Republican lawmakers to approve billions of dollars in new funding that they have blocked in Congress. US President Joe Biden has argued that their refusal to back the new spending plays into Putin’s hands. Ukraine launched its bid to become part of the EU after Moscow began its full-scale invasion in February 2022 and was officially named a candidate to join in June last year. Fellow former Soviet republic and neighbourMoldovahad applied at the same time as Ukraine. Thewar in Ukrainehas breathed new life into the EU’s stalled push to take on new members as the bloc looks to keep Russian and Chinese influence at bay. In June 2022, the European Commission set Kyiv seven reform benchmarks to complete, including tackling corruption and curbing the power of its oligarchs, before talks should start. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmyhal said the EU’s decision on Thursday showed that it “highly appreciated the reforms we have made in recent years and the implementation of all the recommendations of the European Commission”. “A difficult path lies ahead. We are united and ready,” he said. EU treaties oblige members to help “by all means in their power” another EU country that is a victim of armed aggression on its territory. If Ukraine becomes an EU member while the war with Russia is continuing, EU countries would have to respect that. The EU would also acquire a long new border with Russia and Belarus with implications for security,migrationand defence.

Ireland’s prime minister urges EU leaders to call for Israel-Gaza ceasefire,Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar says there is ‘some truth’ to accusations that EU employs a double-standard on Gaza.,"A growing number of countries in the European Union have expressed support for a humanitarian ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war as Israel’s assault on Gaza plunges the Palestinian territory into a direhumanitarian crisis. In remarks on Tuesday at an EU summit focused largely on Ukraine, Irish Prime MinisterLeo Varadkarurged his colleagues to take a firmer stance and call for an end to the fighting between Israel and the Palestinian armed group Hamas in the besieged Gaza Strip. “I think the European Union has lost credibility because of our inability to take a stronger and more united position on Israel and Palestine,” Varadkar said. “We’ve lost credibility at the Global South, which actually is most of the world, because of what is perceived to be double standards. And there’s some truth in that, quite frankly.” Before the summit, Varadkar and the prime ministers of Spain, Belgium, and Malta wrote to European Council President Charles Michel asking him to host a “serious debate” about the Israel-Hamas war and the “humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in Gaza.” “We must call urgently for all the parties to declare a lasting humanitarian cease-fire that can lead to an end of hostilities,” the four leaders wrote.    The comments came several days after a large majority of nations represented at the United Nations General Assemblyvoted in favourof a resolution calling for a humanitarian ceasefire and the number of Palestinians killed in Israel’s assault on Gaza passed 18,000, most of them women and children. The resolution passed with 153 nations in support, 23 abstaining, and 10 voting against it. In Tuesday’s UN vote, 17 EU countries were among those that backed the call for a ceasefire. In October, only eight had backed a resolution calling for a truce. Varadkar insisted that a ceasefire could lead “to a new peace process and Palestinian statehood, which is the only way to secure justice and security for everyone living in the region.” Spanish Socialist leader Pedro Sánchez, whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the Council of the EU, backed his Irish colleague. “Europe has to speak out … in a clear, strong, firm and unified voice,” he said. The current round of fighting began on October 7 when Hamas launched an attack on southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took about 240 others captive. Israel responded with a devastating assault on Gaza, bombarding the territory and launching a ground offensive, claiming that it seeks to topple Hamas. The Hamas attack waswidely condemned, and Israel received strong international backing for its war against Hamas from the United States and several European countries. But as the Israeli assault continued, leading to dire humanitarian conditions and displacing more than 80 percent of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents, some allies have tempered their support with growing warnings about the toll on civilians. Western countries have also been accused of employing adouble-standard, chastising Russia for violations of international law during its invasion of Ukraine but relatively muted when faced with similar acts by Israel.    Speaking on Tuesday, US President Joe Biden said that Israel riskslosing supportdue to “indiscriminate bombing” in a rare moment of sharp criticism. But despite mountinginternational pressure, Israel has shown no signs of scaling down its fighting in Gaza, where UN officials have described conditions as “hell on earth”. On Thursday, Israeli Defence MinisterYoav Gallantsaid that the fighting in Gaza would last “more than several months”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/14/irelands-prime-minister-urges-eu-leaders-to-call-for-gaza-ceasefire
Russian court rejects appeal to release WSJ reporter Evan Gershkovich,President Vladimir Putin says he hopes for agreement with US on prisoner swap but admits ‘it’s not simple’.,"An American reporter jailed in Russia must stay behind bars into the new year as he awaits trial on espionage charges, a Russian court has ruled. Evan Gershkovich, a Moscow correspondent for The Wall Street Journal, has been in jail since March on accusations of spying – charges that he, his employer and the United States government reject. A Moscow city court on Thursday upheld aNovember rulingextending Gershkovich’s pre-trial detention to January 30, 2024, as it rejectedhis appeal to be released. Russian President Vladimir Putin, at his end-of-year news conference on Thursday, said he hoped an agreement could be reached with the US about a possible prisoner swap for Gershkovich as well as former US marine and security executive Paul Whelan, also jailed on espionage charges. While Russia had ongoing contacts with the US over the issue, Putin said:“It is not simple, I will not go into details now, but in general, it seems to me that we speak a language that is understandable to each other. I hope we will find a solution. But, I repeat, the American side must hear us and make an appropriate decision, one that suits the Russian side.” US ambassador Lynne Tracy, speaking outside the court, said: “Evan’s ordeal has now stretched on for over 250 days. His life has been put on hold for over eight months for a crime he didn’t commit.” “It is not acceptable that Russian authorities have chosen to use him as a political pawn.” Gershkovich was detained by Russian authorities on March 29 in the city of Yekaterinburg, some 2,000km (1,243 miles) east of Moscow, and accused of spying, making him the first Western reporter to be held on such charges in Russia since the Soviet era. Russia’s Federal Security Service claims the reporter was “caught red-handed” trying to obtain secret information about a Russian arms factory. He faces 20 years in prison if convicted. Gershkovich’s legal team and his supporters have dismissed the charges as baseless – and Russia has not publicly provided evidence. The US has declared Gershkovich to be “wrongfully detained” and accused Russia of using him for “hostage diplomacy”.    This month, Washington said Russia had rejected a“significant proposal”to release Gershkovich and Whelan. However, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said the setback would not “deter” the US government from “continuing to do everything we can to try and bring both of them home”. On Tuesday, Sullivan said Gershkovich’s release was a top priority for the White House. Gershkovich’s detention has unfolded amid heightened tensions between the US and Russia over thewar in Ukraineand what Russia’s critics say is an expansivecrackdownon independent media. The US is also looking into the detention of US-Russian dual citizenAlsu Kurmasheva, who was arrested in the central city of Kazan in October for failing to register as a “foreign agent”. Kurmasheva’s employer, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), this week denounced the new charges filed against her after reports that she has also been accused of violating rules against Ukraine war criticism. Russia and the US have agreed to several high-profile prisoner exchanges in recent years, includingswappingjailed US women’s basketball star Brittney Griner for Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout in December 2022. The Russian foreign ministry has said it would consider a swap for Gershkovich only after a verdict in his trial, which could last for more than a year.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/14/russian-court-rejects-appeal-to-release-wsj-reporter-evan-gershkovich
Ukraine’s Zelenskyy faces doubters and detractors in US and EU,"Republicans say there is no hope for funding approval this year, but Europe may be gearing up for an invitation.","Ukraine’s president spent the 94th week of Russia’s warrallying supporton both sides of the Atlantic, as his troops continued to defend against constant Russian assaults to the east and south of Ukraine. Although battle lines have hardly moved in weeks, Russia is trying to take the initiative after a Ukrainian summer counteroffensive put it on the defensive. Zelenskyy’s task was to ensure Ukraine gets the money and weapons it needs to continue the fight next year, but a trip to Washington, DC, on Tuesday went unrewarded when a meeting with congressional Republicans failed to convince them to release $61.4bn in military and financial aid. Meanwhile, the US Senate voted 51-49 against a $110.5bn measure brought forward by the Democrats. Even if it had passed in the Senate, the Ukraine measure would still have to meet with House approval, where Republicans also hold the majority and hold Ukraine funds hostage to a domestic agenda including abortion restrictions. “What the Biden administration seems to be asking for is billions of additional dollars with no appropriate oversight, no clear strategy to win and with none of the answers that I think the American people are owed,” House Speaker Mike Johnson said afterhis own meetingwith Zelenskyy. “(It) is practically impossible – even if we reach an agreement – to craft it, get it through the Senate, get to the House, before Christmas,” Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell told reporters in the United States Capitol. “Make no mistake, today’s vote is going to be long remembered. History is going to judge harshly those who turned their backs on freedom’s cause,” Biden said in remarks at the White House. Earlier, Biden told congressional Republicans what was at stake besides border security and abortions, as he stood beside Zelenskyy. “Ukraine will emerge from this war proud, free and firmly rooted in the West – unless we walk away. But without supplemental funding, we’re rapidly coming to the end of our ability to help Ukraine respond to the urgent operational demands that it has. Putin is banking on the US failing to deliver for Ukraine. We must, we must, we must prove him wrong,” Biden said. According to documents seen by Reuters, while he was in Washington, Zelenskyy asked for new weapons and armoury including F-18 Hornet fighter jets, Apache and Black Hawk attack helicopters. He also asked for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) air defence systems to supplement Ukraine’s existing umbrella of medium and low-range systems. As part of the effort to convince Republicans to help Ukraine, the US intelligence community released a report that revealed how much the country had achieved with the $111bn in aid the US has already provided. Ukraine had destroyed 90 percent of the forces that invaded it in February last year, the report said, costing Russia 315,000 dead and injured troops from an original force of 360,000, and destroying 2,200 out of 3,500 tanks and 4,400 out of 13,600 infantry fighting vehicles and armoured personnel carriers. Russia continues to suffer high losses in Avdiivka, a city it has been trying intensively to capture since early October. US National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson reportedly said Russian forces had suffered more than 13,000 casualties there in nine weeks. Ukrainian estimates run higher. The commander of Ukrainian ground forces, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said in November alone Ukrainian forces “destroyed” 11,000 Russian troops and 130 tanks in the east. To regain the initiative in the east, Russian forces were sending troops in en masse, he said. “In the east, the loss of Russian casualties is approximately eight times higher than the loss of the Ukrainian defence forces. Despite this, the Russian occupiers are betting on human resources,” he said. Zelenskyy did not go home from his overseas visit entirely empty-handed. The US Pentagon announced $200m in new weapons, including air-to-air missiles on December 6. Meanwhile, following a summit with leaders of Nordic countries on Wednesday, Norway has promised additional aid worth $275m. And Denmark said it would seek parliamentary approval for $1.1bn in new funds. The biggest package may have come from the United Kingdom, which together with Norway, announced a new maritime capability coalition to strengthen the Ukrainian navy. The UK will provide two Sandown-class minehunters from its own fleet to help protect Ukraine’s grain corridor in the Black Sea. Together with Norway, it is to provide 20 Viking amphibious vehicles and 23 landing craft. “Ukraine’s economy continues to be impacted by Putin’s blockade in the Black Sea, which has significantly reduced the country’s ability to move vital exports by sea,” the British government said in an announcement on Monday. On Wednesday, the European Court of Human Rights held a Grand Chamber hearing in the case of Ukraine v Russia, in which Ukraine has accused Russia of human rights abuses in Crimea. Russia, however, failed to attend. Ukraine has four cases pending at the court against Russia, including one which has been filed jointly with the Netherlands. Ukraine might have a political prize to collect this year in Europe, where government leaders have been working to issue Ukraine an official invitation to start membership talks when they hold a summit on Thursday and Friday. “The EU wants to send a message that it continues to be interested in Ukraine,” Greek conservative parliamentarian Angelos Syrigos told Al Jazeera citing sources in the European Commission and European Parliament. “It is highly likely that there will be a green light for the start of membership talks at the next European Council summit. It wants to send a political message to Russia,” Syrigos said. “There’s a feeling it’s going to happen, that there’s no going backwards,” agreed Socialist European parliamentarian Nikos Papandreou. “The whole community has been voting for Ukraine across party lines, except some people on the extreme left and the extreme right – the people who said Ukraine will only last a few weeks,” he said. “[Fellow MEPs] don’t think there will be another chance because we don’t know what the political powers will be [next year]. It’s now or never.” Europe will hold a parliamentary election next June. On Sunday, Zelenskyy had what he later described as a “frank” conversation with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has emerged as a possible deal breaker. That was on the day of the inauguration of Argentina’s President Javier Milei, which Zelenskyy attended in Buenos Aires, alongside the leaders of Paraguay, Uruguay and Ecuador, whom he also met. On Wednesday, Orban reaffirmed his opposition to inviting Ukraine to start membership talks with the EU. “Considering the numbers, economic analyses and taking it seriously that talks (with Ukraine) would aim to grant membership … then we must say that this thought at the moment is absurd, ridiculous and not serious,” Orban said. Leading EU members want the invitation to go out this week. Spain, which holds the six-month rotating presidency of the European Council, is set on getting it done. “I kicked off the Spanish presidency with a trip to Kyiv and I hope to close it with the opening of accession negotiations with this country,” Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez told a plenary session of the European Parliament. “I cannot imagine, I don’t even want to talk about the devastating consequences that will occur should the [European] Council fail to make this decision,” said Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba, calling it “the mother of all decisions”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/14/ukraines-zelenskyy-faces-doubters-and-detractors-in-us-and-eu
"Putin: Russia’s goals in Ukraine unchanged, no peace until they’re achieved",The Russian president holds first end-of-year news conference since the Ukraine war began.,"Russia’s goals in Ukraine remain unchanged and there will be no peace until they are achieved, President Vladimir Putin has said in his first end-of-year news conference since theoffensive began. The event on Thursday comes days afterPutin announcedthat he will run in the March 2024 presidential election, in which the 71-year-old leader is almost certain to win a fifth term. He has been in power for 24 years, including his prime ministerial stint, and a victory next year will see him remain president until 2030. Fielding questions from the public and the media in Moscow, the Russian leader said peace will be possible after “denazification, demilitarisation and a neutral status” of Ukraine – something he has repeated since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Russia alleges that Ukraine’s government is heavily influenced by “radical nationalist” and neo-Nazi groups, which Kyiv and the West dispute. Putin has also consistently demanded that Ukraine remain neutral and not join the NATO military alliance. “As for demilitarisation, they don’t want to negotiate, so we are then forced to take other measures, including military measures,” Putin said. “Either we agree or we need to resolve [the issue] by force,” he added. Putin said there are some 617,000 Russian soldiers currently in Ukraine, including about 244,000 who were called up to fight alongside professional Russian military forces. But there was no current need for a further mobilisation of reservists, he added. He said an estimated 486,000 people had so far signed up voluntarily as contract soldiers, on top of the 300,000 people called up last year, and “the flow is not diminishing”. Last December, in a break from tradition, Putincancelledthe event. It was the first time in a decade he did not hold the conference. This year, key themes of the conference were the fighting in Ukraine, payments to soldiers and their families and the economy. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Putin said Ukraine had lost some of its best troops in an attempt to secure a foothold on the east bank of the Dnipro in the Kherson region. “It is a tragedy, I believe, for them,” he said. As the war approaches the end of its second year, Ukraine has achieved only small gains from a counteroffensive that began in June. Russia, however, has also made no tangible progress since capturing the city of Bakhmut at heavy cost in May. It occupies about a sixth of Ukraine’s territory but does not fully control any of the four Ukrainian regions it claimed last year as part of Russia. On the ongoing war and relations with the West, Putin said: “The unbridled desire to creep towards our borders, taking Ukraine into NATO, all this led to this tragedy … They forced us into these actions.” Meanwhile on Russia’s relations with China, he said, “the level of our ties with China is at an all-time high”. Putin also said it was important that United Nations mechanisms, such as the veto power of permanent member states of the UN Security Council, remained in place. Asked by a Turkish journalist about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, he said he hoped to meet Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in early 2024. And commenting on new Argentinian PresidentJavier Milei’s planto dollarise his country’s economy, Putin said it risked jeopardising the country’s sovereignty. On the 2024Paris Summer Olympics, Putin said he was not against Russians competing, but that the country should ponder whether it should if the event is designed to portray Russian sport as “dying”. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) last week said qualifying athletes from Russia and Belarus – who had been banned from competing internationally following the invasion of Ukraine – could take part in the Games as neutrals without flags, emblems or anthems. “We still need to carefully analyse the conditions the IOC has put forward,” Putin said. “If the IOC’s artificial conditions are designed to cut off the best Russian athletes and portray at the Olympics that Russian sport is dying, then you need to decide whether to go there at all.”   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/14/russias-goals-in-ukraine-unchanged-putin-says

EU holds up billions in aid for Hungary amid tug-of-war over Ukraine,PM Viktor Orban promises to veto proposal on Kyiv’s EU membership as EU chief urges support for ‘strong’ Ukraine.,"The European Union’s executive will wait to unlock billions in development aid for Hungary from the bloc’s shared budget amid a deepening tug-of-war between the EU and Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s administration over support for Ukraine. The European Commission said on Wednesday that it is waiting for a final step from Hungary to unlock 10 billion euros ($10.8bn) that was frozen over concerns that Orban had damaged democratic checks and balances. The commission said Hungary’s latest judicial reforms must first be published in the country’s official journal to be fully enacted, which would then allow the executive body to unfreeze the funds. The EU was earlier expected to unlock the money to help sway Orban,who has threatened to vetoUkraine’s possible EU membership ambitions. But a senior Orban aide then demanded up to 30 billion euros ($32.4bn) in frozen aid be released,Bloombergreported. Orban told Hungary’s National Assembly on Wednesday that he would block a proposal to start talks on Ukraine’s EU membership at a summit in Brussels on Thursday and Friday. Ukraine’s bid for membership requires a unanimous decision by the leaders of all 27 EU nations. Orban, who boasts strong ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, told lawmakers that bringing Ukraine into the EU would have unforeseeable consequences. “We are interested in a peaceful and prosperous Ukraine, but this requires the establishment of peace as quickly as possible and a deliberate deepening of the strategic partnership,” Orban said. “Everything has its appointed time, but the time for Ukraine’s membership in the European Union has not yet come.” Distrust of Orban has been running high in Brussels after bitter run-ins during his 13 years in power over therights of gay peopleand migrants in Hungary as well as tightening state controls over academics, the courts and media Addressing members of the European Parliament on Wednesday, commission President Ursula von der Leyen urged leaders to back massive financial aid for Ukraine and Kyiv’s ambitions for membership talks. “We must give Ukraine what it needs to be strong today, so it can be stronger tomorrow at the table when it is negotiating a long lasting and just peace,” she said. Besides Ukraine’s EU bid, Hungary has also consistently signalled that it would veto a financial aid package for Kyiv worth 50 billion euros ($54bn), a position that has frustrated other EU partners who stressed that aid for Ukraine and its eventual membership are crucial for Europe’s security. Critics accused Orban of trying to blackmail Brussels to gain access to the billions of euros in EU funding. In a bid to overcome Hungary’s objections, it was expected that von der Leyen’s commission would unlock the 10 billion euros for Budapest ahead of the Brussels summit. The potential move sparked accusations that Brussels was backing down in its standoff over the rule of law with Orban, but the commission’s decision on Wednesday to wait further raises the stakes for Orban. The EU’s executive has proposed that the Brussels summit take a decision to start EU membership talks with Ukraine once Kyiv meets four outstanding conditions. Von der Leyen said laws Ukraine passed last week – including on national minorities, an issue raised by Hungary – cleared three of the remaining tasks, meaning only one was missing: a new lobbying law to rein in oligarchs. Orban, who says the rights of tens of thousands of ethnic Hungarians living in western Ukraine are being denied, disputed this interpretation. Orban is seen as Putin’s strongest ally in Europe, even after nearly two years of Russia’s war in Ukraine, and Hungary also relies on Russia for much of its energy supplies.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/13/eu-executive-holds-up-billions-for-hungary-amid-tug-of-war-over-ukraine
"Dozens hurt, children’s hospital damaged, in Russian missile attack on Kyiv",Officials warn number of injured could rise after second missile attack on Ukrainian capital this week.,"At least 53 people have been injured and a children’s hospital as well as homes damaged after Russia launched a missile attack on Kyiv in the early hours of Wednesday morning. People were woken by a series of loud explosions as air defence systems brought down 10 ballistic missiles aimed at the capital, with the debris falling on the eastern side of the Dnipro river that flows through the city. Ukraine’s national police said 53 people, including six children, were hurt in the attack with 18 people taken to hospital. Eighteen people have been hospitalised, it said in a social media post. “Just yesterday, (US) President (Joe) Biden and I agreed to work on increasing the number of air defence systems in Ukraine. The terrorist state demonstrated how important this decision is,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram, referring to Russia. The explosions blew out windows of residential apartment blocks as frightened residents ran onto the street. Falling missile debris left a vast crater in the ground and destroyed parked cars. “There was no air raid siren. At around 4am (02:00 GMT), I heard an explosion. We fled to the corridor, (the explosion wave) threw me into the doors,” Olena Ustinova, 45, a local administration clerk, told the Reuters news agency. “I regained consciousness and started to shake the doors but they were blocked. I shouted for help from my balcony and emergency workers came to help me.” Ukraine’s Armed Forces General Staff said Russia had fired Iskander-M ballistic missiles, as well as S-400s: extremely fast missiles intended for air defence, but which have also been used to hit ground targets. Windows and entrances at a children’s hospital in Kyiv’s Dniprovskyi district were shattered by the debris, but based on initial assessments, there were no casualties, according to Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko. “These (ballistic) missiles fly at a speed up to 8,000km per hour,” Klitschko told Reuters while visiting a site near one of the damaged buildings. Kyiv military administration chief Serhiy Popko said 17 people, including seven children, were evacuated from a residential building in the district after debris hit a building and nearby cars, causing a fire. On Monday, a Russian missile attack destroyed several homes on the outskirts of Kyiv injuring four people and cutting electricity to more than 100 households. The attack came after Zelenskyy was in the United States, urging right-wing Republicans to back billions of dollars in new military aid for his country. US President Joe Biden warned the lawmakers they would risk giving Russia a “Christmas gift” if they failed to approve the assistance.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/13/dozens-hurt-childrens-hospital-damaged-in-russian-missile-attack-on-kyiv
"Zelenskyy urges new Ukraine aid, as Biden warns funding delay helps Putin","Ukrainian president goes on diplomatic offensive in Washington, DC to try and win over sceptical right-wing Republicans.","US President Joe Biden has warned Russia was banking on the United States abandoning Ukraine as he promised visiting President Volodymyr Zelenskyy his full support and announced $200m in weaponry to help Kyiv push out Russian forces. The White House said the security package could be “one of the last” if Republicans did not approve the new military aid plan, which includes about $61.4bn for Ukraine as well as support for Israel and which iscurrently stuckin Congress. Biden said right-wing lawmakers’ refusal to approve the package also risked handing Russian President Vladimir Putin a “Christmas gift” of victory. “Putin is banking on the United States failing to deliver for Ukraine,” Biden said during a press conference with Zelenskyy after talks at the White House. “We must … prove him wrong.” Biden’s comments came as Zelenskyy went on the diplomatic offensive during his third visit to Washington, DC since Moscow began itsfull-scale invasionof Ukraine in February 2022. As well as meeting Biden, he aimed to appeal directly to Republican lawmakers, laying out the state of the war and Ukraine’s plans for victory in an effort to secure their support. Republicans have sought to link the spending to new measures on the US-Mexico border but also appear to be increasingly questioning the war itself. Zelenskyy stressed that supporting his country’s fight for its territorial integrity was about far more than Ukraine. “For nearly two years, we’ve been in a full-scale war – the biggest since World War II, fighting for freedom,” Zelenskyy said. “No matter what Putin tries he hasn’t won any victories. Thanks to Ukraine’s success – success in defence – other European nations are safe from the Russian aggression.” The Ukrainian president noted 600,000 troops were currently on the battlefield amid snow and freezing temperatures, and insisted there had been progress, notably against the Russian fleet in the Black Sea and establishing a new corridor for the safe export of Ukrainian grain. He said the goal in 2024 was to “take away Russia’s air superiority”. Following his more than one-hour meeting with lawmakers, he said that while the signals were “more than positive”, he would focus on action rather than words. Republicans, particularly those with the closest ties to former President Donald Trump, who is running again for election next year, appeared unmoved. Some questioned whether additional aid would really help Ukraine achieve a breakthrough. “I know everyone wants Ukraine to win. I just don’t see it in the cards,” said Republican Senator Ron Johnson. “What the Biden administration seems to be asking for is billions of additional dollars with no appropriate oversight, no clear strategy to win and with none of the answers that I think the American people are owed,” said House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson. Ahead of Zelenskyy’s meetings in the US, the Kremlin claimed that the aid already sent hadfailed to make a differenceon the battlefield and that further US support would not be able to turn the tide. Russia has stepped up drone and missile attacks on multiple regions of Ukraine, amid fears it will again target power infrastructure during the coldest months of the year, with troops engaged inintense battleson the front lines in the eastern and southern parts of the country. Tens of thousands of civilians have been killed since Russia invaded, with many Ukrainians fleeing overseas. The US has said that while Russia appears to “believe that a military deadlock through the winter will drain Western support for Ukraine”, it has paid a heavy price for its invasion. Some 315,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded in Ukraine since the war began, according to a declassified US intelligence assessment shared with Congress, amounting to about 90 percent of the personnel it had in February 2022. Ukraine has also inflicted heavy losses on Russia in recent fighting along the Avdiivka-Novopavlivka axis in the east — including 13,000 casualties and more than 220 combat vehicle losses, the report said. Zelenskyy was asked whether Ukraine might be willing to give up some of its land as part of a peace deal. He dismissed such suggestions. “How can Ukraine simply give away its territory? This is absolutely insane,” the Ukrainian president said. “Let’s be honest… Our people live there… our children. It’s a part of our society. We’re talking about people who live there.” Zelenskyy made his first visit to the US just days before Christmas a year ago. At that time, he received thunderous applause in Congress and many lawmakers wore Ukraine’s national colours of blue and yellow.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/13/zelenskyy-urges-new-ukraine-aid-as-biden-warns-funding-delay-helps-putin

US announces hundreds of new sanctions in push to isolate Russia,New sanctions target entities and individuals around the world in bid to isolate Russia as its war on Ukraine continues.,"The United States has announced hundreds of new sanctions targeting entities and individuals across the globe, seeking tofurther isolate Russiaas its war on Ukraine grinds on. The US Departments of State and the Treasury said on Tuesday that they had designated more than 250 individuals and entities in countries including Turkey, China, and the United Arab Emirates, cracking down on sanctions evasion, weapons procurement, and sectors such as energy and mining. “The Kremlin has steadily turned Russia into a wartime economy, but Putin’s war machine cannot survive on domestic production alone,” said Treasury SecretaryJanet Yellen. “Our sanctions today continue to tighten the vise on willing third-country suppliers and networks providing Russia the inputs it desperately needs to ramp up and sustain its military-industrial base.”    The US Treasury said that among those targeted by the recent round of sanctions are those involved in weapons procurement for Russia, including four entities and nine people in China, Russia, Hong Kong and Pakistan. The sanctions also target those with connections to Russia’s energy sector, a crucialsource of revenuefor the Kremlin. The sanctions include companies working to develop a large natural gas processing facility in northwestern Russia that would be operated by Gazprom. The announcement came as Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyvisited Washington, DC in an effort to secure further military aid from the US, where conservative lawmakers have called continued US support into question. Assistance for Ukraine, which is fighting to eject Russian forces from its territory, has facedmounting oppositionin the US and Europe, after a much-anticipated counteroffensive failed to produce substantial gains and the war continues with no end in sight. Russian officials have expressed confidence that they can outlast Western support for Ukraine, while Ukrainian officialshave arguedthat continued assistance is a necessity and brings benefits to its security partners.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/12/us-announces-hundreds-of-new-sanctions-in-push-to-isolate-russia
Ukraine’s Zelenskyy arrives in the US. What’s on the agenda?,The Ukrainian president is trying to help break a US domestic political deadlock that would deprive his country of war funding.,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hasarrived in the USas part of his efforts to convince US politicians to not block military aid to the war-torn country. Zelenskyy is expected to meet US President Joe Biden, a staunch supporter of Ukraine in its war with Russia. “[Russian president Vladimir Putin] thought he could break you … he was wrong. He continues to be wrong. Ukraine is unbroken, unbowed and unconquered, proving that nothing can dim the flame of liberty that burns in the heart of free people,” Biden said in late last September when Zelenskyy had again visited the White House. Zelenskyy’s key meeting in Washington was likely to be scheduled with Republican and Democratic senators. The Republican Party has so far refused to even schedule a vote on President Biden’s request for $50bn in military aid for Ukraine next year and to replace US weapons drawn down for Ukraine this year. Senate Republicans last weekblockedBiden’s $111bn bill, which includes military aid to Israel and humanitarian aid to Ukraine, from advancing to debate and a vote. They said the bill did not contain provisions to tighten border security with Mexico and restrict asylum and parole rights for refugees. JD Vance, the Ohio Republican senator,saidhe was “offended” by Zelenskyy’s visit to Washington this week, and it was “not the role of the United States here to hand out money to every beggar who comes into our country”. Asked whether he had any indications for a breakthrough in September, Biden had said, “I’m counting on the good judgment of the US Congress. There’s no alternative.” Biden has urged Congress to vote for Ukraine because it is both in the US interest and consistent with US values. “The entire world has a stake in making sure that no nation, no aggressor, has the power to take a neighbour’s territory by force,” he said in his meeting with Zelenskyy. “The American people will never waver in our commitment to those values.” Ukraine has witnessed anerosion in supporton both sides of the Atlantic after a carefully prepared counteroffensive this year failed to achieve its strategic objective of driving a wedge into the middle of the Russian front. Some politicians have called for Ukraine to negotiate with Russia, something Zelenskyy presently refuses to do. On Monday, Zelenskyy spoke with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban in Buenos Aires, during theinaugurationof Argentina’s President Javier Milei. Hungary has emerged as the European Union member most opposed to inviting Ukraine to start membership talks with the EU in this week’s summit or promising Ukraine $21.4bn (20 billion euros) in military aid next year. Zelenskyy has been coordinating strategies with the European Commission to break that impasse. “We are working to get an unconditional decision to start negotiations,” said Zelenskyy in a November 13 video address. “It is fundamental for Ukraine to implement all the recommendations of the European Commission.” But theUS military aid is key, because the US has donated more than three times what Europe has donated in military aid ($111bn so far, versus Europe’s $29bn), and it also has the largest stockpiles of deliverable weapons in the West’s arsenal. That, says a former Republican congressional candidate, is precisely why the US needs to step back. “Republicans are reflecting the sentiment of many Americans who believe Ukraine’s fight is just, but believe that an additional $61.2bn in aid is excessive given that the US has contributed more to the effort than all other nations combined, while domestic concerns have been ignored,” Demetries Andrew Grimes, who stood for Florida’s 15th House district in 2022, told Al Jazeera. Grimes, who has also supported ending birthright citizenship, whereby people born in the US have the right to US citizenship even if their parents were not legal migrants, says the situation is critical. “6.5 million unvetted and undocumented migrants have entered the US since Biden took office,” he said, adding that a record number of immigrant arrivals on the southern border will lead to “another 5 million illegal” migrants entering the US within the next year. Biden said Ukraine was to receive its first M1-Abrams tanks next week, along with Hawkeye missiles, launchers and interceptors to protect its airspace. Apart from President Biden and the full Senate, Zelenskyy was due to meet withUS House SpeakerMike Johnson. The Pentagon has started rationing its aid to Ukraine and has warned it could be stopped altogether by the end of the year. On December 4, the White House Office of Budget and Managementwroteto Congress, warning that “without congressional action, by the end of the year we will run out of resources to procure more weapons and equipment for Ukraine and to provide equipment from U.S. military stocks”. The result would be to “kneecap” Ukraine’s armed forces just as Russia is pushing to regain the initiative on the battlefield, wrote Shalanda D Young, who heads the Office. “If Ukraine’s economy collapses, they will not be able to keep fighting, full stop,” she said. “Putin understands this well, which is why Russia has made destroying Ukraine’s economy central to its strategy – which you can see in its attacks against Ukraine’s grain exports and energy infrastructure.” Some US commentators believe the Republican stance represents Putin’s best hope of hobbling Ukraine’s war effort – especially once theUS presidential electiongets under way next year. “What’s going to happen to the American election?… Trump and what the Republicans represent does not help Ukraine, and could potentially make things easier for Russia,” retired Colonel Seth Krummrich, now vice-president of Global Guardian, a security consultant, told Al Jazeera. The White House has told congressional Republicans that domestic politics should not come in the way of US support for Ukraine in its fight against Russia. Russian PresidentVladimir Putinhas already put his own military budget in place. On November 27, he signed a 70 percent increase ofdefence and securityspending next year, to a post-Cold War record $157.5bn – some 39 percent of the entire Russianbudget. “Zelensky is likely to depart Washington empty-handed, but with a commitment of assistance through authorized US weapons transfers from allies, backed by a US pledge to replenish allies for their contributions,” said Grimes. On Monday afternoon, Zelenskyy received a boost from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which said it would disburse another $900m under its Ukraine programme. The fund has granted $4.5bn under the$15.6bn programmeso far this year.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/12/ukraines-zelenskyy-arrives-in-the-us-whats-on-the-agenda
"Additional US military aid to Ukraine will be a ‘fiasco’, Kremlin says",Moscow is ‘very attentively’ watching as US President Joe Biden and Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy meet in Washington.,"Any further United States aid to Ukraine will be a “fiasco”, the Kremlin has said ahead of ameetingin Washington between US President Joe Biden and Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Moscow is also “very attentively” watching developments as the two leaders are set to meet on Tuesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Zelenskyy’s visit is part of a last-ditch plea to US lawmakers to keep military support flowing as he battles Russia. As the Ukrainian leader visits the White House and Capitol Hill, Biden’s request for billions in additional aid for Ukraine and Israel is at serious risk of collapse in Congress. “It is important for everyone to understand: The tens of billions of dollars pumped into Ukraine did not help it gain success on the battlefield,” Peskov said, speaking at a news conference in Moscow on Tuesday. “The tens of billions of dollars that Ukraine wants to be pumped with are also headed for the same fiasco.” The Kremlin spokesman said the outcome of the meeting would not change the situation on the front line in Ukraine, nor the progress of Russia’s “special military operation” in the country. He added that Zelenskyy’s authority was being undermined by his government’s “failures” in the ongoing war. On Monday, Zelenskyywarnedthat failing to maintain support for Ukraine would play into the hands of Russian President Vladimir Putin. “Let me be frank with you, friends. If there’s anyone inspired by unresolved issues on Capitol Hill, it’s just Putin and his sick clique,” he said, speaking to soldiers at the National Defense University in Washington, DC. Zelenskyy and Biden have argued that helping Ukraine resist Russia’s invasion, launched in February 2022, is in the mutual interests of both countries as support for Ukrainian aid hitspolitical snagsin the US. During their talks, the two plan to discuss a way to rally support for the military aid plan primarily focused on Ukraine and Israel. Last week,Republicans blockedthe plan after walking out of a classified briefing on Ukraine amid demands for US-Mexico border reforms. Some Republicans are opposed to giving a “blank cheque” for Ukraine. The US Congress has approved more than $110bn in security assistance for Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion but has not approved new funds since the Republican Party gained a majority in the House of Representatives in January. Biden has asked Congress to approve an additional $61.4bn in support for Ukraine as part of a larger $110bn package that includes more funds for Israel and other issues.

"As Gaza reels, Ukraine war feels suddenly distant in Global South nations","Everyday Indians are less likely to keep up with the news about Russia’s war, as analysts say Western response to Palestinian suffering underscores double standard.","Jaipur, India –Even though Ukraine lies 6,000km (3,728 miles), two seas and half a dozen national borders away from Ali Hussein’s hometown, the raven-haired 29-year-old tour guide still feels for the war-torn ex-Soviet nation. “India is close to Russia and we buy Russian weapons, [but] I am fully on Ukraine’s side,” he told Al Jazeera, standing next to one of the terracotta-coloured buildings that gave Jaipur, a megalopolis of 3 million people, its sobriquet of India’s “Pink City.” He was referencing New Delhi’s decades-old ties to Moscow dating back to India’s 1947 independence and the fact that over the past five years, India has gone on a $13bn spending spree on Russian-made weaponry. He also has personal ties to Ukraine. His cousin attended a medical school in the northeastern city of Kharkiv, like thousands of Indian students who brave harsh winters and a new language of instruction to get a degree at a much lower cost than at home or in the West. But Hussein is a rare exception. Dozens of Indians asked this reporter in 10 cities from Delhi to the Pakistani border a similar question: “Is the war over?”    Their lack of knowledge seems understandable. Europe’s bloodiest armed conflict since World War II is not top-of-the-hour or headline news any more. Since October, it has been eclipsed by the Israel-Palestine conflict. But the Middle East war has not only changed the news agenda in the Global South, a term meaning Latin America, Africa and much of Asia. It has also confirmed the worst fears of many in the region – that Western powers are far less likely to empathise with Palestinian suffering, compared with that of Ukrainians. “The confrontation between Israel and Hamas has not only boosted the Kremlin’s hopes of changing the mood around the war in Ukraine but also strengthened its belief that the Western-centric system of international relations is breaking down,” according to Nikita Smagin, an expert with the Russian International Affairs Council. The war in Gaza has also “nullified all the results of rapprochement between the West and the Global South, and in this context, the war benefits [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,” Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kushch told Al Jazeera. Ukraine is well aware of the trend. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s trip to Argentina last week is widely seen as an attempt to win the hearts and minds in Latin America. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with widely-reported war crimes, the shelling of civilian areas and, threats toEurope’s largest nuclear station, was met with global condemnation. While Western nations were quick to support Ukraine, a sovereign nation with its own national identity that stood up to Russia’s occupation attempts, their backing of Israel’s operation in Gaza has raised doubts and sparked cries of hypocrisy. “The typical comparison people make between Ukrainians and Palestinians is how the West is treating the former so differently than the latter,” said Seda Demiralp, a professor of political science at Istanbul’s Isik University. European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, for example, has consistently condemned what she has called Russian “acts of pure terror” on civilians in Ukraine, but failed to criticise Israel for its brutal campaign in the Gaza Strip, which has killed more than 18,000 people in just more than two months. The alleged double standards irk Global South nations. “People can argue endlessly about the reasons for the war in Ukraine, or Israel’s operation in Gaza, but for many the conclusion is obvious: the United States was critical of Russia when it killed innocent civilians in Ukraine and now it is silent when its ally Israel does the same thing in Gaza,” said Smagin. The latest episode of the Israel-Palestine conflict escalated after Hamas, which governs Gaza, attacked southern Israel, killing at least 1,200 people and taking more than 200 captive. Israel responded quickly, promising to crush Hamas with its relentless bombardment. Malaysia was quick to accuse the West of “ignoring Palestinians” while providing “swift” support to Ukraine. “Why are there two different approaches? For instance, in the Ukraine crisis, the Western powers swiftly provided support to Kyiv. Unfortunately, when it comes to Palestine, it is entirely disregarded,” Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi reportedly said. Another point of tension is rooted in perception. Western media outlets cover the killings of Israelis in more detail than those of Palestinians – a macabre “Orientalism” that pays little attention to mass deaths in places like Afghanistan or Iraq in comparison with Western nations, a United Kingdom analyst says. “This kind of Orientalism doesn’t want to equal the deaths of Israelis and Palestinians, ignoring the fact that there are dozens of times more victims among Palestinians,” Alisher Ilkhamov of Central Asia Due Diligence, a think tank in London, told Al Jazeera. “And considering the whole history of Palestine’s occupation – thousands times more.” Even though czarist Russia wanted to invade India, post-colonial New Delhi developed cordial ties with Communist Moscow. India’s nationalist premier, Narendra Modi, has not joined the international choir of critics lambasting the invasion of Ukraine and New Delhi abstained from condemning the aggression in the United Nations. These days, the Russian-Indian trade is conducted in rupees, which New Delhi sees as a chance to make its currency convertible and more useful in global trade. This year, New Delhi saved $2.7bn between January and October by buying 70 million tonnes of discounted Russian oil, the Reuters news agency reported in November. And the Kremlin’s narrative seems to be especially effective in India, where 46 percent of Indians believed the Ukrainian government was under the spell of neo-Nazi ideologues – a baseless claim Putin has used to justify the war – according to a poll by YouGov Cambridge, an international pollster, conducted in October 2023. Only 27 percent of those polled said Russia was to blame for the war, while 42 percent thought Ukraine was conducting mass murders and “genocide” of ethnic Russians. Meanwhile, some Indian observers saw Western sanctions on Russia as a new financial tool to keep controlling the global economy. “This led to fears that the dollar was being weaponised,” analysts Ashish Pandey and Garima Bora wrote in the Economic Times, an Indian online newspaper, in June. “Several countries were worried that the US could use the power of its currency to target them and hobble their growth,” they wrote.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/12/global-south-gaza-ukraine

The Ukrainian president’s trip comes just before a crucial vote in the US Congress on further security assistance. While the US initially helped rally Western countries in support of Ukraine, political schisms have started to emerge as the war drags on withfew signs of a breakthroughfor either side. Support remains substantial, but in bothEuropeand the US, some right-wing lawmakers have sought to restrict or cut off continued assistance. Ukraine’s supporters have alleged that such hesitancy only serves to strengthen Putin’s hand. “Despite his crimes and despite his isolation, Putin still believes that he can outlast Ukraine and that he can outlast America. But he is wrong,” US Defense SecretaryLloyd Austinsaid in remarks on Monday. “America’s commitments must be honoured,” he added.    The US Congress has approved more than $110bn in security assistance for Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion but has not approved new funds since the Republican Party gained a majority in the House of Representatives in January. Biden has asked Congress to approve an additional $61.4bn in support for Ukraine as part of a larger $110bn package that includes more funds for Israel and other issues. Republicans have used their leverage to push for greater restrictions on immigration on the USborder with Mexico, including reforms that would roll back access to asylum, in return for their votes.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/11/zelenskyy-says-delaying-aid-is-a-gift-to-putin-as-he-seeks-us-support
Allies say Russian opposition figure Alexey Navalny removed from prison,A spokesperson for the Russian opposition figure says that prison officials have refused to say where he was transferred.,"A spokesperson forAlexey Navalnyhas said that the Russian opposition leader has been removed from the prison where he was being held and that his whereabouts are unknown. In a social media post on Monday, spokesperson ​​Kira Yarmysh said that it has been nearly a week since she heard from Navalny and that officials will not say where he was transferred. TheUnited Stateshas also spoken out about the incident. “We’re deeply concerned by these reports that he’s now been gone for allegedly a week and neither his representatives or his family know where he is,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters. “We’re going to work with our embassy in Moscow to see how much more we can find out,” he added. Today, as on Friday, the lawyers tried to get to IK-6 and IK-7 —  two colonies in the Vladimir region where Alexey@navalnymight be. They have just been informed simultaneously in both colonies that he is not there. We still don't know where Alexey is. — Кира Ярмыш (@Kira_Yarmysh)December 11, 2023  The Russian opposition leader had been preparing for an expected transfer to a “special regime” high-security facility from Penal Colony Number 6, in the town of Melekhovo in the Vladimir region, about 230 kilometres (140 miles) east of Moscow. A Russian court handed the 43-year-old Navalny a 19-year prison sentence in August oncharges of “extremism”, which he maintains are politically motivated. That is on top of an 11-and-a-half-year sentence that he was already serving. In December, he also said that he had been informed ofnew chargesagainst him under a penal code that covers vandalism. “They really do initiate a new criminal case against me every three months,” he said in comments issued through his associates at the time. “Rarely does an inmate confined to a solitary cell for over a year have such a vibrant social and political existence.” The spokesperson Yarmysh told the news outlet Reuters that Navalny’s current location is not known. “We don’t know where he is right now. He can be in any colony of special regime and there are around 30 of them in Russia, all over Russia,” she said. “We will try to go to every colony there is and look for him”.    The disappearance comes as Russian PresidentVladimir Putinprepares for an election campaign, hoping to secure another six-year term at the country’s helm. The team for Navalny, by far the best-known figure in Russia’s opposition, is preparing an “anti-Putin” campaign and says that the leader’s disappearance will not halt their efforts.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/11/allies-say-russian-opposition-figure-alexey-navalny-removed-from-prison
Russia plans presidential vote in annexed Ukrainian regions,The decision raises logistical and security challenges for Moscow because of its limited control in the four regions.,"Russia plans to run next year’s presidential election in the four regions of Ukraine that it annexed in 2022. The Central Elections Commission said on Monday that voting would go ahead in Donetsk, Lugansk, Zaporizhia and Kherson regions, according to state news agency Interfax. The plan will test security because Moscow’s military does not control all of the regions, although it has stepped up efforts to extend its grip. Meanwhile, Ukraine has already said that any Russian vote in the regions will be null and void and that it will prosecute any observers sent to monitor voting. Moscow’s ability to hold the election in what it calls its “new territories” is politically important for the Kremlin, but it raises logistical and security challenges because of Russia’s limited control in the regions amid theongoing warsince February 2022. Russia’s annexation claim was rejected as illegal by Ukraine and most countries at the United Nations General Assembly. The areas controlled by Moscow have been placed under martial law. President Vladimir Putinconfirmedlast Friday, in comments to Russian soldiers who have fought in Ukraine, that he will run again for president in the March election, in which he faces no serious competition.    Amid a campaign that has become bogged down in trench warfare, it appears unlikely that Moscow will be able to significantly increase its control of the four regions ahead of the vote. However, it is clearly keen to try. The Ukrainian military reported on Monday that Russian forces had unleashed a massive new offensive on the city of Avdiivka, which sits just northwest of the city of Donetsk and is key to efforts to secure control of the wider Donbas region. “The enemy launched yesterday massive assault actions with the support of armoured vehicles in Avdiivka and Mariinka directions,” military spokesperson Oleksandr Stupun told Ukrainian TV. There was no immediate comment from Russia on the fighting in the area. The front lines in eastern Ukraine have barely shifted over the past several weeks, but the fighting has been intense, Stupun said, adding that there had been 610 artillery shellings reported near Avdiivka in just the last 24 hours. Russia is trying to encircle the small city, which now has only about 1,500 people left out of its pre-war population of some 32,000. Russia launched a renewed bid to capture Avdiivka more than two months ago and Moscow’s forces have been inching forward on the flanks to try to cut supply lines.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/11/russia-to-hold-presidential-election-in-annexed-ukrainian-regions-interfax
Russia claims arrest of Ukrainian assassin network,Russia says it has arrested 18 Ukrainian ‘agents and accomplices’ who plotted to assassinate pro-Russian figures.,"Russia says that it has arrested a network of Ukrainian assassins targeting pro-Russian figures in the annexed Crimea peninsula. Moscow’s Federal Security Service (FSB) said on Monday that it has arrested 18 “agents and accomplices” of Ukraine’s special services. Several pro-Russian figures in Crimea and the occupied east of Ukraine have been attacked since the Kremlin launched its invasion of its neighbour in February 2022. The FSB said it made the arrests after discovering a weapons cache. Moscow accuses the Ukrainian agents of plotting to kill several pro-Russian government figures, as well as attacking Russian energy and rail networks. Among those pro-Russian figures targeted was the Moscow-appointed head of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov. Oleg Tsaryov, a former member of the Ukrainian parliament, survived beingshot twicein October 2023, in an attack Russia blamed on Kyiv. Claims of sabotage are rife on both sides of the war, and such operations are thought to have killed or wounded hundreds of thousands of soldiers and damaged both countries’energyand transport infrastructure. On December 7, Russia said itarresteda foreign agent working for Ukraine’s secret services who blew up several Russian trains in Siberia believed to be carrying ordinances to the front lines. Russia’s claim that it has broken up the Ukrainian sabotage network comes amid fresh military strikes on Kyiv and fierce fighting in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine said on Monday that it had shot down eight ballistic missiles fired by Russia at Kyiv, in the first attack on the capital city in months. Four people were injured by shrapnel in the southeastern Darnitskyi district, police said. Meanwhile, Russian forces have reportedly stepped up their offensive on the eastern city of Avdiivka, which they have zeroed in on as part of their campaign to overtake the Donbas region. Ukraine said Russia’s military had launched “massive assault actions” on the city on Sunday, but that its defences held and the front lines hardly budged. The Russian military has focused on eastern Ukraine since abandoning an advance on Kyiv in the first days after the February 2022 invasion. Now, heading into the harsh winter, Ukrainians fear Russia will strike at their energy system for a second straight year. To shore up their defences, Ukrainian officials are pleading with Western partners for more military aid. However, there appears to begrowing reluctancein the US and Europe to dole out the funds. In the US, Ukraine’s top single-country donor, the White House is struggling to convince Congress to approve a mammoth military aid package that includes $60bn earmarked for Ukraine. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will travel to Washington on Tuesday to make the case for more aid to US lawmakers.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/11/russia-claims-to-bust-ukrainian-sabotage-network-strikes-at-kiev
UK sends minehunters to boost Ukraine’s Black Sea forces,Britain and Norway plan to help Ukraine bolster Black Sea security amid its war with Russia.,"The UK has transferred two minehunter ships to Ukraine as part of a new push to strengthen the country’s presence in the Black Sea amid Russia’s invasion. The UK’s Ministry of Defence (MoD) announced Ukraine’s procurement of the two Royal Navy vessels on Monday. The deal is part of a new Maritime Capability Coalition, led by Britain and Norway, aimed at providing long-term military support tobolster securityin the Black Sea. The focus on maritime operations has increased after nearly two years of war. Ukraine has targeted Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, which is based in the annexed Crimea peninsula, as it has sought to use ships to exportgrain. “As an island nation with a proud maritime history, the UK and Royal Navy are particularly well-placed to support this endeavour, which will form part of a series of new coalitions formed between allies to ensure an enduring military commitment in support of Ukraine,” UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said, explaining how the warships are an important first step. “These minehunters will deliver vital capability to Ukraine, which will help save lives at sea and open up vital export routes, which have been severely limited since [Russian President Vladimir] Putin launched his illegal full-scale invasion,” Shapps said. “This capability boost marks the beginning of a new dedicated effort by the UK, Norway and our allies to strengthen Ukraine’s maritime capabilities over the long term, enhancing their ability to operate in defending their sovereign waters and bolstering security in the Black Sea.” The coalition will also work with the Ukrainian navy to expand its forces in the Black Sea, develop a Ukrainian Marine Corps and enhance the use of river patrol craft to defend inland and coastal waterways, the ministry said. The UK and Ukraine made the deal for the two minehunters in June 2021, before Russia’s full-scale invasion. Ukrainian soldiers have been training on the ships since last year. London has also provided military training courses to around 20,000 Ukrainians over the past year. The UK is thesecond-largest providerof military aid to Ukraine, after the US. The two Sandown-class mine countermeasures vessels were procured by Ukraine through UK Export Finance.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/11/uk-to-send-2-mine-destroying-ships-to-ukraines-black-sea-coast
"Zelenskyy to meet US President Joe Biden, House Speaker as aid stumbles","Ukrainian president will travel to Washington, DC as right-wing Republicans baulk at providing more help to Ukraine in its fight against Russia’s invasion.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will travel to Washington, DC on Monday for meetings at the White House and the United States Capitol as right-wing US Republicans resist efforts to send more money to support Ukraine’s response to Russia’s full-scale invasion. In a statement on Sunday, the White House said US President Joe Biden had invited Zelenskyy to discuss the “vital importance” of continued US support for Ukraine’s defence and the “urgent needs” it faces. Zelenskyy is also expected to address US senators on Tuesday morning. An aide for US House of RepresentativesSpeaker Mike Johnsonsaid Zelenskyy would also hold a private meeting with Johnson who has been trying to link Ukraine aid to immigration reforms at the US’s southern border. The meetings come as Biden attempts to rally support for a $106bn military aid plan mostly for Ukraine and Israel, whichRepublicans blockedlast week after walking out of a classified briefing on Ukraine amid demands for border reforms. Zelenskyy’s office confirmed the planned meeting with Biden, adding that key areas of discussion would include defence cooperation between the US and Ukraine, “particularly through joint projects on the production of weapons and air defence systems, as well as the coordination of efforts between our countries in the coming year”. Biden has warned of the risk of weakening US support for Ukraine and Shalanda Young, head of the White House Office of Management and Budget, reiterated those concerns on CBS’s Face the Nation on Sunday. “What happens if Putin marches through Ukraine, what’s next? NATO countries, our sons and daughters, are at risk of being a part of a larger conflict,” she told the programme. Republicans remained sceptical, however, with Senator JD Vance, a close ally of former US President Donald Trump who is campaigning for election again in 2024, dismissing the idea that the Russian president would put other NATO countries at risk. He told CNN on Sunday that he was opposed to what he termed a “blank cheque” for Ukraine. “What’s in America’s best interest is to accept Ukraine is going to have to cede some territory to the Russians and we need to bring the war to a close,” Vance said. Russia occupies about a fifth of Ukrainian territory. The funding row comes amid signs of fraying Western resolve on Ukraine after Kyiv’s much-heralded June offensive failed to make significant headway and Russia deploys more troops and steps up aerial attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure as temperatures drop to freezing. On Monday, Ukraine’s Air Force said air defences shot down eight Russian missiles aimed at Kyiv early on Monday with the falling debris injuring at least two civilians. The White House said Biden’s meeting will come at a vital moment, “as Russia ramps up its missile and drone strikes against Ukraine”. The US State Department announced last week a stopgap $175m tranche of new aid for Ukraine on Wednesday, including HIMARS rockets, shells, missiles and ammunition. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken insisted on Sunday that “Ukraine has done an extraordinary job” defending itself. “The choice is very clear,” he said on ABC. “If we do this and help Ukraine sustain the achievements that it’s made, help ensure that Russia continues to suffer a strategic failure in Ukraine. That’s one route to go. “The other route to go is to do something that the only people who are rooting for it are in Moscow, and maybe in Tehran and Beijing, which is not to provide this assistance,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/11/zelenskyy-to-meet-us-president-joe-biden-house-speaker-as-aid-stumbles

Israel cannot carry out ‘collective punishment’ of people in Gaza: Lavrov,"Speaking at the Doha Forum, the Russian foreign minister calls for international monitoring of the situation in Gaza.","The Russian foreign minister says it is unacceptable that Israel is using Hamas’s October 7 offensive as justification for a collective punishment of Palestinians in Gaza and has called for international monitoring of the situation on the ground in the besieged enclave. Speaking virtually at the Doha Forum on Sunday, Sergey Lavrov told Al Jazeera’s diplomatic editor James Bays the unprecedented attack by Hamas inside the Israeli territory did not happen in a vacuum. It was due to “decades and decades of a blockade [in Gaza] and decades and decades of unfulfilled promises to the Palestinians that they would have a state, living side to side with Israel in security and good neighbourliness”, he said. At least 17,700 Palestinians have beenkilled in Gazasince October 7 – 70 percent of them women and children, prompting rights bodies and experts to call it a “genocide”. In Israel, the revised official death toll from the Hamas attack stands at about 1,147.    Addressing the Doha Forum, a two-day global meeting being held in the Qatari capital, Lavrov said the ongoing war in Gaza is about “cancel culture” – a recent phenomenon that refers to the mass withdrawal of support to public figures or celebrities who did things in the past that are no more acceptable today. “Whatever you don’t like in the events which lead to a situation, you cancel,” he said. Russian President Vladimir Putin has called Israel’s offensive in Gaza a failure of US diplomacy and suggested that Moscow could be a mediator in the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Moscow has also condemned this week’s US veto of a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza. Dmitry Polyanskiy, Russia’s representative at the UN,saidUS diplomacy was “leaving scorched earth in its wake”. Shortly after Lavrov spoke at the Doha Forum, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a telephone conversation with Putin, expressing his “displeasure” at Moscow’s positions against Israel at the UN and other global forums. “The prime minister emphasised that any country that would suffer a criminal terrorist attack such as Israel experienced would act with no less force than the one Israel is using,” read a statement from Netanyahu’s office.    Lavrov’s comments to Al Jazeera came as Russia’s war in Ukraine continues to rage. Since February 2022, Ukraine has faced a full-scale Russian invasion that has seen its eastern territories occupied. Lavrov, however, dubbed it a “hybrid war on Russia launched by the United States and NATO”, adding that the Ukraine conflict is also based on cancel culture. “It is not a war of choice [for Russia]. It is the operation which we could not avoid, given the years and years of the US and NATO preparing Ukraine to be an instrument to undermine Russia’s security,” he said. Lavrov said the Ukrainian government had passed legislation intended tocancel “everything Russian”, including language, media, culture and education. “This [law] is against people who for generations have been living in eastern and southern Ukraine … The only thing the Western media is being encouraged to say is that Russia invaded Ukraine,” he told Bays. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, however, insists it was Moscow that spurred the current phase of “de-Russification efforts” in the country. “You are doing it – in one generation’s lifetime and forever,” he said in a televised address in March last year. “You are doing your best so that our people abandon the Russian language, because Russian will be associated with you, only with you, with these explosions and killings, with your crimes.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/10/israel-cannot-carry-out-collective-punishment-of-people-in-gaza-lavrov
"Russians, Belarusians to compete as ‘neutrals’ at 2024 Paris Olympics: IOC",The athletes had initially been banned from competing internationally following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.,"The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has given the green light to the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes in the games next year as neutrals, drawing the ire of Ukrainian officials. Russian andBelarusianathletes who qualify in their sport for the Paris 2024 Olympics will be able to take part without flags, emblems or anthems, outside of team events and as long as they do not actively support the war in Ukraine, the IOC said on Friday. “The IOC essentially gave Russia the green light to weaponize the Olympics,” Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said in a social media post condemning the decision. “Because the Kremlin will use every Russian and Belarusian athlete as a weapon in its propaganda warfare. I urge all partners to strongly condemn this shameful decision, which undermines Olympic principles,” he added. The athletes had initially been banned from competing internationally following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but have since been gradually allowed back as neutral athletes in most sport. The IOC said eight Russians and three Belarusians are among 4,600 athletes worldwide who have so far qualified for the Summer Games, which open in July. They will only be allowed to compete in individual sports and no teams for the two countries will be allowed to participate in Paris. The IOC has also said that no state or government official from Russia or Belarus will be invited to or accredited for Paris 2024, but argue that athletes should not be held accountable for the actions of their governments. Russia’s Sports Minister Oleg Matytsin called the move “discriminatory”. More than 60 Ukrainian athletes have qualified for next year’s Paris Olympics. A total of about 11,000 athletes will take part in the games next year. Athletes and officials from Ukraine, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have repeatedly urged the IOC to exclude Russia and Belarus entirely. However, representatives of international sports federations and national Olympic committees hadcalledforRussian and Belarusian athletesto be admitted under a neutral flag “as soon as possible”. Ukraine’s Sport Minister Matviy Bidnyi told the AFP news agency in advance of the decision on Thursday that Kyiv was concerned the move gave the impression that the IOC “does not want to demonstrate the necessary leadership in the matter of Olympic fairness and justice”. “As aptly stated by President Volodymyr Zelensky: ‘Obviously, any neutral flag of Russian athletes is stained with blood,'” said Bidnyi. “When there is a war and one nation with its passports is destroying another nation, then ‘neutrality’ becomes irresponsibility,” he said, adding that giving up their Russian passport was “the only possible way today for an athlete to prove Olympic excellence is his first priority”. Earlier this year, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the IOC of using the games as a form of “ethnic discrimination”.

"Who is Ilya Ponomarev, the anti-war Russian renegade exiled in Ukraine?","Ponomarev, once a liberal parliamentarian, has likened himself to Charles de Gaulle. Does he really pose a threat to Putin?","Ilya Ponomarev was once a member of the Russian parliament, an unruly liberal tolerated by the leadership. These days, he’s on a mission to slay Vladimir Putin and his aides. “They should be terminated with an aspen stake through their hearts,” he wrote in his memoir, Does Putin Have to Die?: The Story of How Russia Becomes a Democracy after Losing to Ukraine. Exiled in Ukraine since 2016, Ponomarev is the political head of the Freedom of Russia Legion, a volunteer militia thought to include about 1,600 Russian dissidents and defectors using pinprick tactics to aggravate Russian troops with the aim of one day marching on Moscow. To some, he cuts a maverick, temptingly plausible figure. The 48-year-old compares himself to Charles de Gaulle, the French military leader who led his nation’s resistance to the Nazis from exile during World War II and later became president. Who is the man who has reportedly been giving Putin, the president who will run again next year, nightmares? A self-confessed “libertarian communist”, Ponomarev hails from an elite background, his mother having once sat in parliament, his grandfather a former Russian ambassador to Poland. Born in Moscow, the physics graduate started out as a tech entrepreneur, transferring his skills to the oil and gas industry. In his 20s, he worked with Yukos Oil, then chaired by Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the oligarch now exiled in London. As he recounts in his book, he later worked with a TV company, almost striking a business deal with CNN that was scuppered by Putin. Such was his frustration that he decided to enter politics. In 2007, at the age of 32, he entered the Duma, elected on the ticket of Just Russia, a social-democratic party within the Kremlin-approved “systemic opposition”. Even so, Ponomarev stuck his neck out, invoking the “crooks and thieves” epithet for the ruling party that had earlier been popularised by Alexey Navalny, the opposition leader now behind bars. In 2012, he and fellow party member Dmitry Gudkov played a prominent role in the “white ribbon” street protests against Putin, decrying the alleged rigging of the 2011 parliamentary and 2012 presidential elections. The following year, he refused to support a law banning “gay propaganda”. However, Ponomarev definitively crossed the Rubicon when he voted against the annexation of Crimea in 2014. He was captured on camera, refusing to stand and applaud when Putin referred to “national traitors” – a term used by Adolf Hitler in Mein Kampf – in a key speech. That image was printed on giant pro-government street banners that also featured Navalny; Boris Nemtsov, who would later be assassinated; and other dissidents with the words “Aliens among us” emblazoned below. By 2016, he went into exile in Ukraine. Since Russia’s invasion began in early 2022, he has positioned himself as the public face of pro-Ukraine Russians, speaking not only for the Freedom of Russia Legion (FRL) in Ukraine but also theNational Republican Army(NRA), a secretive network of partisans allegedly operating within Russia. Ponomarev also set up a wartime Russian-language opposition TV channel, calling it February Morning, in reference to when the war began. He used it as a platform to announce the NRA’s claim of responsibility for last year’s assassination ofDarya Dugina, the daughter of one of Putin’s close political allies, on the outskirts of Moscow. US intelligence had blamed the car bombing on Ukrainian forces. Still, within Russia, he remains relatively unknown. “Average Russians don’t know much about what Ponomarev is doing right now because there is heavy propaganda, and it’s not within Putin’s interests to popularise or advertise him,” said Natia Seskuria, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank. The FRL is one of two Russian groups working within Ukraine to bring down Putin’s government. The other one being theRussian Volunteer Corps(RVC). While both share the same aim, they are ideologically different. The RVC is commanded by a known Nazi close to the local Azov regiment, an ultra-nationalist volunteer military unit. Last May, the FRL and the RVC shocked the world with their joint cross-border raids on western Russia’s Belgorod region. It was the first time that partisans had entered Russia during the Ukraine war. Footage of the attacks showed a Russian officer lying face down in a pool of blood next to Russian passports at a border checkpoint in the town of Grayvoron. Ponomarev said Ukraine’s military intelligence is supporting his coup efforts. This year, he claimed a role in adrone attackon the Kremlin, saying his group had helped to smuggle the devices over the border. He also has suggested he was involved in the assassinations of war bloggerVladlen Tatarskyand pro-Kremlin novelistZakhar Prilepin. But many treat his claims with scepticism. “He’s got no kind of background in military or covert operations. He’s entirely dependent on the Ukrainians. Probably Ukraine’s quite happy for him to kind of try and claim credit,” said Roland Oliphant, senior foreign correspondent with The Telegraph who reported from Moscow for a decade. The FRL is steered by the Congress of People’s Deputies, a shadow parliament of sorts that Ponomarev helped to set up. Based in Poland with members inside and outside Russia, it is hoping for Putin’s government to collapse and is working on a transition plan and new constitution. Congress leaders include Mark Feygin, a former lawmaker and lawyer who represented thePussy Riotfeminist, anti-Putin punk band. But the body lacks big names, like Navalny and chess grandmaster-turned-political activist Garry Kasparov, who are not keen on the FRL’s violent tactics. Ponomarev hopes to build a force that can march on Moscow. Could he succeed whereWagner Group chief Yevgeny Prigozhinfailed? The late Russian mercenary chief, who led the onslaught on Ukraine but fell out with Russian army leaders, staged a spectacular mutiny against the Kremlin in June, taking control of Russia’s military headquarters in Rostov-on-Don. He quickly called off the revolt, relocating to Belarus before dying in a mysterious plane crash two months later. “The power of Prigozhin was that he had all these nationalist Russian credentials. He’d led a force in Ukraine. He was clearly pro-war. He was clearly not a national traitor. I think that’s quite important to Russians,” Oliphant said. Stationed on enemy territory, Ponomarev has a bit of a PR problem. As Oliphant pointed out, he lacks elite support to mount a coup, particularly within the security services. “Are any of those guys in the FSB [Federal Security Service] and FSO [Federal Protective Service] and a whole string of other agencies going to do a coup on behalf of this self-proclaimed liberal who fled to Ukraine?” According to Seskuria, the Kremlin has quickly buried memories of Prigozhin’s coup. “A lot of things have changed, and the regime has become more ruthless,” she said. “The stakes are so high that I don’t really think Russians are ready now to speak out or go out onto the streets and protest.” Now on Russia’s “terror” list, Ponomarev has turned himself into a highly visible target.  But it doesn’t look like he’ll be sticking his “aspen stake” into the regime’s heart any time soon. “Maybe he thinks that he’s going to ride into Moscow on the back of an American or Ukrainian tank,” Oliphant said. “I think that’s the only way he’d get there to be honest.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/8/who-is-ilya-ponomarev-the-anti-war-russian-renegade-exiled-in-ukraine

Ukraine mounts acts of sabotage in Siberia to staunch Russian artillery,Russia has arrested a Belarusian man it accuses of bombing two fuel trains on behalf of Ukraine’s secret services.,"The past week of Russia’s war in Ukraine was remarkable, chiefly for something that happened thousands of kilometres to the east of a hardened battlefront. In an apparent sabotage operation of breathtaking audacity, Ukrainian operatives blew up two freight trains in east Siberia travelling on a track believed to be used to shuttle North Korean-made ordnance to the Russian front lines in Ukraine. Details were sketchy, but some facts have emerged. A freight train caught fire in the 15km-long (9.3-mile) Severomuysky Tunnel in the Republic of Buryatia on the night of November 29, the East Siberian Transport Prosecutor’s office reported. Ukrainian media cited intelligence sources as saying four explosive devices had been planted on the railway, one of two rail links between Russia and China, reportedly also used for ferrying ammunition. “During the movement of the freight train, four explosive devices went off,” the Ukrainian intelligence source was quoted as saying. “Now the [Russian Federal Security Service] FSB is working on the spot, railway workers are unsuccessfully trying to minimise the consequences of the SBU special operation,” the source said, referring to the Security Service of Ukraine by its acronym. The train in question was believed to be carrying 44 cars of refined fuel. At least three were destroyed. A successful detonation might have disabled the tunnel, and that indeed appeared to be the goal of the saboteurs, who told Ukrainian media the route was “paralysed”. On Thursday, the FSB arrested a Belarusian man it said planted the train explosives on behalf of Ukraine’s SBU. Calling the incident a “terrorist act”, Moscow said the detained man’s handler was a Lithuania-based Belarusian linked to Ukraine’s secret services. Russian media said “the explosion seriously damaged the rails, and the leaked fuel flooded them”. Expecting trains to be rerouted through a northern pass of the Baikal-Amur track, the SBU apparently staged a second explosion on a second fuel train as it passed over a bridge in an unspecified location. Four fuel tanks were destroyed and another two were damaged. Ukraine has every reason to disable Russia’s rail links with China. North Korea is believed to have sent Russia more than a million artillery shells to discharge in Ukraine. Satellite images the Washington Post published on October 16 suggested that two Russian ships had successfully transported cargo from the North Korean free trade zone port of Rason to Russia’s port of Dunai several times since August. From Dunai, the containers would most likely traverse the vast Russian landmass via rail. A Washington Post analysis suggested shipments began in mid-August, and US National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby confirmed on October 13 that as many as 1,000 containers’ worth of North Korean weapons had reached Russia between September 7 and October 1. Ukraine was also continuing to focus on disrupting Russian supply routes in Crimea. The Russian defence ministry said electronic warfare systems and air defences downed a total of 35 Ukrainian drones targeting the port of Feodosia in east Crimea on December 1. “Apparently, the Ukrainian Armed Forces intended to hit the oil depot and power plant in the city,” said one Russian report. It was not clear if any drones struck their targets. Russia launched more drones against Ukraine during the week – a total of 83 from November 30 to December 5. Ukraine’s air force said it downed 62 of them. Ukrainian Air Force spokesman Yuriy Ignat said Russia had increased its own production of Iranian-designed Shahed drones, and they were likely to be Russia’s main weapon targeting Ukrainian energy infrastructure during winter. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also expected an intense Russian air campaign this winter targeting electricity and water utilities, he said in an interview with the AP. Resources were one principal criterion for success in the war, resolve was the other, said Nigel Gould-Davies, chief Eurasia analyst for the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), a London-based think tank. He was speaking at the launch of the IISS’s flagship annual publication, the Armed Conflict Survey. “The GDP [gross domestic product] of the West vastly exceeds Russia’s by a factor of 12,” said Gould-Davies. “But … there are growing signs now, and more have appeared in the last few days, that… the West may be inferior in resolve. We have budget struggles in the [US] House [of Representatives] and now the [US] Senate and the EU is increasingly wrangling over budgetary support for Ukraine,” he said. House and Senate Republicans have been insisting on tying military aid for Ukraine to strengthening border security with Mexico, and a socially conservative agenda. Zelenskyy told the AP these tensions were frustrating, but he “can’t complain too much”. “Look, we are not backing down, I am satisfied. We are fighting with the second (best) army in the world, I am satisfied,” he told the AP, referring to the Russian military. He added: “We are losing people, I’m not satisfied. We didn’t get all the weapons we wanted, I can’t be satisfied, but I also can’t complain too much.” But there were also signs of dissatisfaction in Russia. A Russian opposition polling organisation,Chronicles, published a survey on November 30 suggesting that Russians who supported the war, opposed any withdrawal of troops before military aims had been achieved and supported heightened military spending had nearly halved during the year, from 22 percent to 12 percent. A consistent 39-40 percent during 2023 supported a withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine without Russia achieving its war aims.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/7/ukraine-mounts-acts-of-sabotage-in-siberia-to-staunch-russian-artillery
Republicans block Ukraine funding over US-Mexico border despite Biden pleas,"The Kremlin has celebrated the gridlock, saying it hopes US lawmakers will keep axing Biden’s aid plan.","Republican senators in the United States have blocked $106bn in new funding for Ukraine and Israel, rejecting appeals from President Joe Biden amid anger over the exclusion of immigration reforms they had demanded as part of the package. Biden had earlier warned of dire consequences for Kyiv – and a “gift” to Russia’s Vladimir Putin – if Congress failed to pass the measure, which includes about $61bn to help Ukraine keep up pressure on Russia during the freezing winter months, as well as help for Israel and Gaza. “They’re willing to literally kneecap Ukraine on the battlefield and damage our national security in the process,” Biden said. The entire 49-strong Republican minority in the upper chamber voted against the proposal, pointing to a lack of government action on the estimated 10,000 migrantscrossingfrom Mexico into the US every day. “Everyone has been very, very clear on this to say we’re standing firm. Now is the moment,” Senator James Lankford, a lead Republican negotiator on immigration and border issues, told Fox Business ahead of the vote. “We’re completely out of control at the southern border, and it’s time to resolve this.” Citing aid for Israel, independent senator Bernie Sanders also voted against the bill, which needed 60 votes to pass. The Kremlin celebrated the gridlock in Congress, saying it hoped lawmakers would keep shutting down the White House’s aid request. “It is to be hoped that there remain enough people with sober minds among American congressmen,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday. Peskov added that the White House was trying to “scorch the money of American citizens in the furnace of the Ukrainian war”. Biden had previously pleaded with Republicans over the package, warning that a victory for Russia over Ukraine would leave Moscow in a position to attack NATO allies and draw US troops into a war. “If Putin takes Ukraine, he won’t stop there,” Biden said. Putin will attack a NATO ally, he predicted, and then “we’ll have something that we don’t seek and that we don’t have today: American troops fighting Russian troops”, Biden said. “We can’t let Putin win,” he said. Border security with Mexico has emerged as a major stumbling block to continued support for Ukraine, even as the White House warned this week that funds designated for providing aid to Ukraine wouldrun outby the end of the year. House and Senate Republicans are backing renewed construction of a border wall, former President Donald Trump’s signature policy, while deeming large numbers of migrants ineligible for asylum and reviving a controversial policy under which asylum seekers are told to remain in Mexico while their immigration case is heard. Biden said he was willing to make “significant” compromises on the border issue but said Republicans would not get everything they wanted. He did not provide details. “This has to be a negotiation,” he said. Biden, who had discussed Ukraine in a virtual summit with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and G7 leaders earlier on Wednesday, said the US and its allies were prepared to continue supporting Ukraine in its 22-month war against Russia, which currently occupies about a fifth of Ukrainian territory. Zelenskyy warned the G7 that Moscow was counting on Western unity to “collapse” and said Russia had ramped up pressure on the front lines of the conflict. The precarious prospects for the aid package had been clear since a classified Ukraine briefing for senators on Tuesday saw several Republicans walk out, angry that there was no talk of border security. Zelenskyy had been due to address the meeting via video link but cancelled at the last minute. Senators of both parties have acknowledged the need to move quickly to secure a deal given that Congress has just a handful more days in session before the end of the year. Republican negotiators were expected to send a new proposal to Democrats after the failed vote. The president’s willingness to directly engage on the issue carried some political risk with some Democrats and migrant advocates urging him to reject sweeping conservative demands on immigration – which they say are akin to closing the border. House Speaker Mike Johnson, who voted against aid to Kyiv before he took on the job, has made clear he will not agree to send any more money without “transformative” changes to border policy. “The American people deserve nothing less,” Johnson said in a statement. The Louisiana Republican has also declared that any Israel aid needs to be offset with spending cuts, a policy Democrats, the White House and most Senate Republicans oppose. Even amid the disagreement over the new funding package, the US unveiled aid for Kyiv worth $175m from the dwindling supply of money that has already been approved. It includesHIMARS rockets, shells, missiles and ammunition.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/7/republicans-block-ukraine-funding-over-us-mexico-border-despite-biden-pleas

Pro-Russian former Ukrainian parliamentarian shot dead near Moscow,"Illia Kyva, declared a traitor by Ukraine, has been shot dead in a park in Odintsovo region in the southwest of Moscow.","A former pro-Russian member of Ukraine’s parliament has been shot dead near Moscow in an assassination claimed by Kyiv. Illia Kyva, declared a traitor by Ukraine, was shot dead in a park in the Odintsovo region southwest of Moscow on Wednesday. Russian investigators said they have opened an investigation and a hunt for the suspect. “An unknown person fired shots at the victim from an unidentified weapon. The man died on the spot from his injuries,” Russia’s Investigative Committee said in a statement. News agencies, including Reuters and AFP, quoted sources saying Kyva was killed by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU).    Kyva was a member of Ukraine’s parliament before Moscow invaded in February 2022, but had been in Russia throughout the war and frequently criticised Ukrainian authorities online. He had been sentenced in absentia by a Ukrainian court to 14 years in prison for charges including treason and incitement to violence. The day before Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, Kyva said the country had been “soaked by Nazism” and needed “liberating” by Russia – echoing talking points regularly advanced by Russian officials and on state TV. Speaking on national TV, Ukraine’s military intelligence spokesperson Andriy Yusov said: “We can confirm that Kyva is done. Such a fate will befall other traitors of Ukraine, as well as the henchmen of the [Russian President Vladimir] Putin regime.” Yusov did not say who was behind the assassination. In a separate incident, a proxy lawmaker in Ukraine’s eastern Luhansk region was also killed in a car bombing attack on Wednesday, Russian investigators said. Oleg Popov, who served as a deputy in the pro-Moscow Luhansk regional parliament, was killed after the “detonation of an unidentified device in a car”, Russia’s Investigative Committee said, without providing more details.    Kyiv used to rarely comment on whether it was behind the killings of pro-Russian figures, both inside Russia and in parts of Ukraine occupied by Russian forces. But lately, it has started to claim responsibility for a number ofattacksand openly threatened to hunt down other “collaborators” and “traitors”. Moscow has previously said Ukrainewas behindother audacious assassinations deep inside Russia’s borders. In August 2022, Russian nationalist Darya Dugina was killed outside Moscow in a car bombing, while an explosion at a Saint Petersburg cafe in April killed Russian military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky. Ukraine has not publicly claimed responsibility for those attacks, though US intelligence and media reports have linked Kyiv to them. Several lower-ranking Ukrainian officials and politicians who have welcomed Russia’s invasion and worked for Russian-backed authorities in occupied parts of Ukraine have also been killed.

"Putin to visit Saudi Arabia, UAE with Israel-Hamas war on agenda","Talks expected to focus on Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and oil market cooperation, says Kremlin spokesperson.","Russian President Vladimir Putin, staking out a more influential role in the Middle East, will visit the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, and host Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in Moscow the following day. The talks will focus on bilateral relations and theIsrael-Hamas war,Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday. Peskov said that discussions on oil market cooperation will be on the agenda of talks, as Moscow cooperates with all three countries through OPEC+, which is comprised of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies led by Russia. “These discussions are held within the OPEC+ format, but of course, cooperation in this area is always on the agenda,” said Peskov. The OPEC+ group, which Putin helped create in 2016, announcednew voluntary supply cutslast week, which met scepticism from the oil market.    Separately, Putin’s foreign policy adviser Yury Ushakov said that Saudi-Russian cooperation within the oil cooperation body was “fruitful”. “Fairly close Russian-Saudi coordination in this format is a reliable guarantee of maintaining a stable and predictable situation in the global oil market,” Ushakov said, according to Russian news agencies. Putin’s drive to bolster its ties with Gulf and other Middle Eastern states is part of his efforts to demonstrate that Western attempts to isolate Moscow throughsanctions for its war on Ukrainehave failed. The Russian leader has not made many international trips after the International Criminal Court (ICC)issued an arrest warrant for himin March, accusing Putin of deporting Ukrainian children. Neither the UAE nor Saudi Arabia have signed the ICC’s founding treaty, meaning they would not have to arrest him if he entered their territories. With regards to Israel’s current bombardment of Gaza in retaliation for Hamas’s October 7 attacks, Putin has sought to cast the war as a failure of U.S. diplomacy, charging that Washington had opted for economic “handouts” to the Palestinians and abandoned efforts to help create a Palestinian state. He has suggested Moscow could play the role of mediator, thanks to its friendly ties with both Israel and the Palestinians, saying that “no one could suspect us of playing up to one party.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/5/putin-to-visit-saudi-arabia-uae-with-israel-hamas-war-on-agenda
Deputy Russian army commander killed in Ukraine: Official,The governor of Russia’s Voronezh region says Vladimir Zavadsky died at a combat post in the ‘special operation zone’.,"The deputy commander of Russia’s 14th Army Corps, Major-General Vladimir Zavadsky, has been killed in Ukraine, a top regional official confirmed. Zavadsky died “at a combat post in the special operation zone”, Alexander Gusev, the governor of Russia’s Voronezh region, said on Monday without providing any further details. The “special military operation” is the term Russia uses to describe the war in Ukraine, which it launched in February 2022. Gusev paid tribute to Zavadsky, calling him “a courageous officer, a real general and a worthy man”. Zavadsky’s death marked the seventh major-general confirmed dead by Russia, making him the 12th senior officer reported deceased since theonset of the war, investigative news outlet iStories reported. Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Ukrainian authorities reported that their military successfully downed 10 out of 17 attack drones launched by Russia overnight. According to the governor of Ukraine’s Lviv region, three drones targeted unspecified infrastructure, causing minimal damage with no reported casualties. Kyiv’s air force stated the drones were intercepted across “various regions”. Simultaneously, six S-300 missiles were reportedly launched at civilian targets in eastern Donetsk and southern Kherson. At the same time, Russian officials claimed their forces neutralised at least 35 Ukrainian drones. “An attempt by the Kyiv regime to commit a terrorist attack with aerial drones … was foiled last night,” the Russian Ministry of Defence said in a statement on Tuesday, adding that “22 Ukrainian drones were destroyed and 13 others were intercepted over the Sea of Azov and Crimea”. “A new attack attempt by the Kyiv regime” on Tuesday morning saw four Ukrainian drones shot down and two intercepted over the Sea of Azov, the ministry said in a separate statement. TheCrimean Peninsula, annexed by Russia in 2014, serves as the headquarters for Russia’s Black Sea Fleet and a vital supply route for their forces in southern and eastern Ukraine. The region is frequently subject to attacks from Ukrainian forces.   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/5/deputy-russian-army-commander-killed-in-ukraine-official
US and EU struggle to agree on funding for Ukraine,Concern is growing over Ukraine’s ability to continue its defence against Russia should delays of Western funds persist.,"Uncertainty is growing over Western backing for Ukraine amid Russia’s intensifying campaign to knock out the country’s energy infrastructure. The White House has warned the United States Congress that funds designated for providing aid to Ukraine would run out by the end of the year, in a letter made public on Monday. The European Union is also facing difficulties in agreeing on a new 50 billion euro ($54bn) lifeline for Kyiv. “I want to be clear: without congressional action, by the end of the year we will run out of resources to procure more weapons and equipment for Ukraine,” the director of the US Office of Management and Budget, Shalanda Young, wrote in a letter to House SpeakerMike Johnson. In the face of an upcoming harsh winter of intensifying Russian assaults on civilian infrastructure, the lack of funding could mean defeat for Ukraine, warned the budget director. “If Ukraine’s economy collapses, they will not be able to keep fighting, full stop,” she wrote. The USnarrowly averteda government shutdown last month, with a last-minute bill keeping federal agencies funded through the new year, but leaving out key foreign aid initiatives. The US, Ukraine’s biggest single-country donor, has sent more than $40bn in aid sinceRussia’s invasionin February 2022. In October, US PresidentJoe Bidenasked Congress to approve$105bn in nationalsecurity funding, which would include support for Ukraine. But right-wing congressional Republicans have expressedincreasing scepticismtowards approving more funds for Ukraine and some $61bn in additional aid funds are now beingheld upby the US Congress. “There is no magical pot of funding available to meet this moment. We are out of money – and nearly out of time,” Young wrote, urging Congress to act “now”. At the same time, the EU is struggling to pass its own funding package, which would be part of the bloc’s future joint budget. Hungary has led arguments against the package. Prime Minister Viktor Orban has ploughed a pro-Russian furrow since Moscow’s invasion. He is also thought to be hoping to use his threat to block the plan to try to unfreeze 22 billion euros ($24bn) in funding for Budapest that Brussels is holding due to rule-of-law issues. The victory of the far-right in the recent Netherlands election and fiscal challenges in Germany are also complicating negotiations over the budget, the Financial Times reported on Sunday. The delay is endangering crucial pledges to Kyiv made months ago. A budget agreement would be “very, very difficult”, a senior official said. The 50 billion euro ($54bn) instrument proposed is designed to keep Kyiv solvent to 2027. A failure to approve long-term funding, as well as a separate 20 billion euro ($22bn) facility for weapons purchases, would hit Kyiv hard as the war grinds on. Olha Stefanishyna, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister for European and Euro-Atlantic integration, last week described the EU summit as an “existential moment” for her country. The difficulties in securing the funds in Washington and Brussels have raised concerns in Kyiv that Western backers are experiencing “fatigue” with the drawn-out battle as fighting on the front line becomes bogged down in what some see as a “stalemate“. As Russia continues its campaign targeting civilians and infrastructure in indiscriminate bombings and drone attacks, Ukraine announced a 450 million euro ($489m) expansion of a wind farm in its Mykolaiv region on Monday at the United Nations COP28 climate talks. Ukrainian officials highlighted how its turbines would be spread far enough apart to survive any Russian missile attacks. Also speaking at the climate summit, US Assistant Secretary of State for Energy Resources Geoffrey R Pyatt denounced Russia’s targeting of energy infrastructure in the war, saying that Russian President Vladimir Putin “has made energy one of his weapons”. Pyatt, a former US ambassador to Ukraine, said that Putin has “done that with his drone and missile attacks on civilian energy infrastructure. He’s done that by turning off the gas pipelines in order to try to weaken Europe’s resolve to support the Ukrainians…” “For Vladimir Putin, energy is just about as much a part of his war strategy as are his tanks and his missiles,” he said. Russia has spent recent weeks launching dozens of attack drones and missiles at Ukraine in overnight raids targeting energy facilities and military sites. Ukraine’s air force said on Monday that it had shot down 18 out of 23 Iranian-made Shahed drones and one missile. Meanwhile, Russia was reported to have intensified attacks from new directions on the industrial town of Avdiivka on Monday. “The launching of new directions proves that the enemy has been given a command to capture the city at any cost,” Ukrainian officials said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/4/us-and-eu-struggle-to-agree-on-funding-for-ukraine
"Russia boosts size of armed forces by 170,000 troops",President Putin’s decree takes number of Russian service personnel to 1.32 million amid continuing Ukraine war.,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered the country’s military to increase the maximum number of troops by nearly 170,000 people, as Moscow’sinvasion of Ukrainecontinues into its 22nd month. Putin’s decree was released by the Kremlin on Friday and took force immediately. It brings the strength of the armed forces to 1.32 million service personnel and increases the overall number of Russian military personnel to about 2.2 million. “The increase in the full-time strength of the armed forces is due to the growing threats to our country associated with the special military operation and the ongoing expansion of NATO,” the Russian Ministry of Defence said in a statement. It said the order does not imply any “significant expansion of conscription”, and that the increase would happen gradually by recruiting more volunteers. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, now deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, said on Friday that more than 452,000 people were recruited to the military under contract from January 1 to December 1, 2023. NATO’s “joint armed forces are being built up near Russia’s borders and additional air defence systems and strike weapons are being deployed. The potential of NATO’s tactical nuclear forces is being increased,” the ministry statement read. Boosting Russian troops was an appropriate response to “the aggressive activities of the NATO bloc”, the ministry added.    This is the second such expansion of the army since 2018. The previous boost of 137,000 troops, ordered by Putin in August 2022, put the military’s numbers at about two million personnel and about 1.15 million troops. Last December, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu declared that the country needed a force of 1.5 million “to guarantee the fulfilment of tasks to ensure Russia’s security”. He didn’t say when the military would reach that size. The Kremlin previously considered the size of its military as sufficient, but the calculus changed after hopes for a quick victory over Ukraine – which Russia invaded in February 2022 – were shattered by fierce resistance. Russia had undertaken various efforts to give a boost to its army – including drafting conscripts, mobilising reservists, forming volunteer battalions and running campaigns to entice more men to enlist. Some media reports and rights groups say the Russian authorities have also offered amnesty to some prisoners in exchange for a tour of military duty. All Russian men from age 18 to 27 (or age 18-30 starting on January 1, 2024) must serve one year in the military. However, a large number avoid the draft for health reasons or deferments granted to university students.

Moscow accuses Russian-Italian national of Ukrainian-ordered bomb attacks,The FSB said that the suspect was trained by special forces of NATO member Latvia to bomb a railway and military base.,"Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) has arrested a man with dual Russian-Italian citizenship for conducting sabotage operations for Ukrainian military intelligence. Moscow said on Friday that the suspect had carried out bomb attacks on railways after being recruited by Kyiv earlier this year. Infrastructure and production facilities across Russia have been damaged in unclaimed attacks since its military forces invaded Ukraine in February 2022, with investigators opening dozens of cases. The suspect is accused of planting explosives to derail a 15-carriage train in the Ryazan region, southeast of the capital, in early November. The FSB also says that he bombed the Dyagilevo military airfield in July, according to state news agency TASS. “The perpetrator turned out to be a resident of the Ryazan Region born in 1988 with Russian and Italian citizenship. The detainee gave confessionary evidence during his questioning,” the FSB’s Investigative Committee said in a statement. The intelligence agency said that the suspect was recruited by Ukrainian military intelligence in Istanbul in February. He then received sabotage training from Latvian special services in the EU and NATO member state, it added. The statement also said that a search of the suspect’s home unearthed explosives and other bomb-making equipment, and investigations are under way to establish his role in other acts of sabotage. The highest profile Ukrainian attack on Russian infrastructure since the start of the war came in October 2022, when the Kerch Strait Bridge, linking the Crimean Peninsula with Russia, wasbombed. Shortly after the blast, the FSB arrested five Russians and three others, who were citizens of Ukraine and Armenia. Sources claimed on Thursday that the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) had bombed a railway line in Siberia, illustrating its reach deep inside Russia. The attack paralysed “the only serious railroad connection between Russia and China,” used by Moscow for military supplies, the Espreso TV website reported. Russia is also busy targeting Ukrainian infrastructure and has raised the level of drone and missile attacks as winter approaches. While the war on the front lines has become bogged down, Moscow’s forces aim to repeat the tactic of last year, when strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure plunged the country into the cold and dark for extended periods. The Ukrainian military reported on Friday that it had shot down 18 of 25 attack drones, and one of two cruise missiles launched against the country by Russia overnight, mainly targeting southern and eastern regions. Ukrainian air defence systems have been boosted with Western weapons since last winter, but Kyiv continues to stress that it needs more supplies to withstand the barrage.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/1/moscow-accuses-russian-italian-national-of-ukrainian-ordered-bomb-attacks
"A hard, bloody winter awaits Ukrainian and Russian soldiers, say experts","Neither side is ready to give up, and neither can win in the medium term, but negotiations could come next year.","This winter is likely to see a long and bloody stalemate in Ukraine, with neither side backing down from offensives and counteroffensives, but may sow the seed of negotiations next year, experts tell Al Jazeera. “The winter is just going to reinforce the misery … neither side is going to have a tactical or operational breakthrough,” retired colonel Seth Krummrich, now vice president at Global Guardian, a security consultancy, told Al Jazeera. Ukraine launched a major counteroffensive in early June that by some estimates took back half the land Russia had seized earlier in the year. But it failed in its strategic objective of cutting Russian forces in two, isolating Kherson, Zaporizhia and Crimea from Luhansk, Donetsk and Kharkiv. Ukrainian senior commanders have said the counteroffensive will continue through the winter. Last month Russia attempted to answer with a new set of offensives in the east – headed towards the cities of Kupiansk, Lyman, Avdiivka and Mariinka. None has succeeded, but Russia has continued the assaults despite snow and frost, asevidencednear Kupiansk on November 21. “I think they’re going to try to push through in the winter,” said Krummrich. “The ground freezes, [they’ll] try to make some moves because they’re desperate. I don’t mean the Ukrainians. I mean the Russians. The soldiers won’t want to do it. It will be a disaster. There will be more dead bodies,” he said. That is already evident. Ukraine’s armed forces estimate 6,260 Russian deaths in the week of November 20-26, an average of almost 1,000 a day – the result of relentless Russian attacks in the east. “This is a war that lacks high strategy,” Konstantinos Grivas, who teaches weapons systems and geopolitics at the Hellenic Army Academy, told Al Jazeera. “Russia became trapped in an attrition war, which has its own logic … it’s a war on autopilot.”  Both sides have failed to come up with a technological or tactical advantage that would produce a breakthrough because defence is dominant, said Grivas. “Firepower and passive defences – minefields, trenches for instance – seem to have neutralised the capabilities of mechanised and airborne forces,” said Grivas. “If there is a critical development it will be a collapse due to exhaustion – like a boxing match where one fighter simply can’t take the blows, but not from a knock-out punch.” Both sides have had strategies for success, but all have so far been parried. Russia had hoped for a quick collapse of the Ukrainian armed forces when it invaded in February 2022. When that failed, it rained down some 10,000 missiles on Ukraine’s cities to break the country’s will to fight. Last winter Russia targeted power stations, causing outages, and in July it started targeting port infrastructure to stop the export of Ukrainian grain. Ukraine’s Western allies responded with air defence systems, spare parts and emergency generators to keep Ukraine’s power flowing. They provided medium-range missiles Ukraine combined with its domestically manufactured drones to drive Russian naval power back to its own shores, creating a safe passage for merchant shipping. Ukraine tried its own offensive strategies. It used these ranged weapons to strike deep in the Russian rear to disrupt the supply of weapons to the front, but Russia moved its stockpiles out of range and found delivery byways. Ukraine has sent drones to attack Russian missile manufacturing sites and Moscow itself, but their payloads were too small to do much damage.  Ukraine has most recently asked for F-16 fighter planes, which some NATO members have agreed to supply, but it is doubtful these will be a stalemate-breaker either, say experts. “Even if they get F-16s, they won’t be able to use them effectively because these planes need thousands of hours [of training] in flight to become operational,” Andreas Iliopoulos, a former deputy commander of the Hellenic Army, told Al Jazeera. “They won’t be effective until 2025.” “I think all this is a Ukrainian effort to continue to claim Western help and stave off fatigue and the pressure to negotiate,” said Grivas. Ukraine’s allies banned Russian oil, gold, diamonds, lumber and other lucrative exports to starve the Russian economy, but Russia sold its oil at discounted rates to China, India and other markets. Sanctions also attempted to stop the flow of capital and sensitive technologies to Russia. But Russia has been manufacturing weapons and buying artillery shells and drones from pariah states that share its hatred of the United States – Iran and North Korea. Last August, Ukrainian intelligence estimated Russia had about 585 missiles of various types left, but planned to build more than 100 a month. This month, the Ukrainian military said, Russia had stockpiled more than 800 missiles in Crimea alone and was preparing to fire them. Russia’s ability to keep up its stockpiles and to draw on large reserves of manpower has led some observers to suggest that time is on its side. “Ukraine was likely to lose in a protracted war of attrition, because it would be an unfair fight,” wrote John Mearsheimer, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago, in a recent opinion piece entitled “Bound to Lose”. “I keep hearing people say, he’s going to wear out the Ukrainians. That’s not going to happen with a conscript army that doesn’t want to be there,” said Krummrich, who has fought in special operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and believes Russian soldier morale is breaking down. “Every single wave of soldiers that somehow survives and goes home, they’re telling everybody they can, ‘for the love of God, do not get pulled out to Ukraine’,” said Krummrich. Recent reports suggest a growing number of Russian soldiers want to go home.  While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has forsworn any negotiations while Russia sits on Ukrainian soil, Russia has been more nuanced. “Russia has never refused peace talks with Ukraine,” Russian President Vladimir Putin told the Group of 20 on November 21. “Of course, we should think about how to stop this tragedy.” “I think he is messaging again, ‘Hey, I need a way out’. When he got involved in this … he did not have a plan for this situation,” Krummrich said. “I think the secret desire of both is how to get out and who is going to negotiations first,” Grivas said. But is it likely to happen this winter? Both sides are demonstrating a will to fight, for now. Putin may be looking for a symbolic victory ahead of an election next April, and other fissures in the Western alliance, say experts, particularly if former President Donald Trump seems likely to win the US presidential election. “What’s going to happen to the American election … Trump and what the Republicans represent does not help Ukraine, and could potentially make things easier for Russia,” said Krummrich. Congressional Republicans loyal to Trump have led an effort this year to staunch the flow of military aid to Ukraine, saying the US deficit is too high. Even if Ukraine is eventually partitioned, some people believe Russia will suffer a greater loss. “Russia is headed for a big defeat. Its victory would be a catastrophe, because it is being isolated from the rest of Europe, a big blow to its existential core,” said Grivas. “It is being Asianised. The winner is China and the other Eurasian powers, who are able to instrumentalise Russia for the ends of their foreign policies,” he said.

"Russian air strikes injure 10 in Donetsk, Ukraine says",The strikes come as Russia intensifies its attacks in the east and claims to capture the contested village of Khromove.,"Russian missile strikes have injured 10 people and left several unaccounted for in Donetsk, Ukrainian officials said, as attacks intensify in the embattled eastern region. The overnight shelling hurt 10 people, including four children, in several villages in Donetsk, Ukraine’s Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said on Thursday. He said a family with two children, as well as two 13-year-olds, were among the injured. “Five more people are being searched for under the rubble,” the minister added. Later, Donetsk authorities said rescuers found one body while four others, including one child, were still under the rubble. An apartment block, nine private houses, a police station, cars and garages were damaged in the villages of Pokrovsk, Novogrodivka and Myrnograd. Klymenko said a police paramedic helped a man with an injured baby get out from under the rubble. The attacks come as Russia steps up the fighting in Donetsk, of which it occupies most parts and says it intends to take over completely. Some of the most intense fighting in recent weeks has been waged in the front-line town of Avdiivka. On Wednesday, Russia said it had captured another contested village in the Donetsk region – Khromove – in what would be a rare advance after weeks of mostly gridlock. Ukrainian officials offered no comment but said Moscow’s forces were suffering heavy losses while launching fierce attacks. Unofficial accounts and bloggers acknowledged that part of the village was held by Russian forces, but dismissed any notion it was fully under Russian control. Ukrainian military spokesperson Oleksandr Shtupun said Russia’s attacks were growing more intense, with air strikes doubling and waves of up to 20 armoured vehicles pushing towards Ukrainian lines. However, he insisted Ukraine was repelling the assaults. Neither Russia nor Ukraine has made significant breakthroughs on the battlefield for weeks as Moscow’s invasion drags into the 22nd month. Ukraine, which has counted on aid and ammunition from Western allies, is pushing its backers to keep up the support amid funding delays from the United States and Europe. “We have to continue, we have to keep fighting. Ukraine is not going to back down,” Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s minister of foreign affairs, said at a summit of NATO ministers in Brussels on Wednesday. “The issue here is not just Ukraine’s security, it is the security and safety of the entire Euro-Atlantic space.” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, also attending the summit, confirmed NATO would back Ukraine for as long as it takes. “The answer here today at NATO is clear and it’s unwavering. We must and we will continue to support Ukraine,” Blinken said.   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/30/russian-air-strikes-injure-10-in-donetsk-ukraine-says
Russia to require foreigners to sign ‘loyalty agreement’,Visitors would be required to respect Russian values and laws that ensure the country’s national interest.,"Russia is reported to be preparing to introduce laws that would require foreign visitors to sign a “loyalty agreement”. The interior ministry is preparing the legislation that would bar visitors from criticising Russian policy or discrediting Soviet history. It would also require that they respect traditional Russian family values, culture and environment, state news agency TASS reported on Wednesday. All foreigners would have to sign the pledge, which would, in effect, control what they can say and do while in Russia. This means visitors would be prohibited from “interfering with the activities of public authorities of the Russian Federation, discrediting in any form the foreign and domestic state policy of the Russian Federation, public authorities and their officials,” the report said. For the draft to become law, the document has to be introduced to the State Duma, Russia’s lower house of parliament, and to go through committee review and several readings before being submitted to President Vladimir Putin for signing. Officials told state news agency Interfax that the legislation is being worked on by the interior ministry, the government, and the presidential administration and is well advanced. Lieutenant General Valentina Kazakova, head of the ministry’s Main Directorate for Migration, told TASS, “The bill is currently under discussion and will be submitted to the State Duma shortly.” In particular, foreigners would be barred from “distorting the historical truth about the feat of the Soviet people in the defence of the Fatherland and its contribution to the victory over fascism,” the draft bill reads, according to TASS. Thetriumph over Nazism, under the Soviet leadership ofJoseph Stalin,has been constantly compared with Russia’s annexation of Crimea. Putin has utilised this historical moment as an effective tool in his resurgent war on the West and the liberal values mostly associated with it. Evencritics and scholarswithin Russia, who document his totalitarian regime’s atrocities, have lost access to Kremlin-controlled media and are branded “foreign agents”. As the 2024 presidential election approaches, Putin has cast the war as part of an existential battle with the West, saying he will defend Russia’s “sacred” civilisation from what he portrays as the West’s decadence. Under the law, foreigners would have to uphold and abide by “traditional family values”, the “institution of marriage” and “traditional sexual relations”, according to TASS. Russia under President Putin has touted itself as a country home to more conservative moral and family values, backed by theRussian Orthodox Church. To this end, the authorities have cracked down on the LGBTQ community, passing legislationoutlawinggender-affirming surgeries and banning “gay propaganda”. Lawmakers, in recent months have also been working on legislation to limit access to reproductive careand abortions as a way of improving the “demographic situation” and countering the low birth rate. “The legislative initiative proposes prohibiting activities that encourage a neglectful attitude toward Russia’s environment or natural resources … Russia’s regional and ethno-cultural diversity [and] traditional Russian moral and spiritual values,” reported TASS. Russia is one of the most ethnically diverse countries in the world with nearly 200 ethnic groups residing on the territory of the Russian Federation, according to the United Nations. Following the October Revolution in 1917, and the fall of Russia’s imperialist monarchy, StalinembracedRussian nationalism based on the old imperial myth of the greatness of the Russian people, wroteBotakoz Kassymbekova. Bolshevik Moscow madeethnic Russians the most privileged groupin the Soviet Union and sent Russian settlers to populate and control non-Russian regions.

Ukraine ‘will not back down’ against Russia as it urges Western support,"‘Ukraine is not going to back down’, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tells NATO foreign ministers.","Ukraine will forge ahead in the battle against Russia’s invasion, Kyiv’s top diplomat has pledged as he seeks to rally Western support. Ukraine will not “back down” in fighting against the Russian invasion, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told a summit of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels on Wednesday, even as its military locked into a bloody stalemate with enemy forces amid signs that the provision of weapons and funding is slowing and that the war in Gaza is limiting global attention. “We have to continue, we have to keep fighting. Ukraine is not going to back down,” Kuleba said. “The issue here is not just Ukraine’s security, it is the security and safety of the entire Euro-Atlantic space.” His entreaty comes amid fears that Western fatigue is setting in over the drawn-out war, and that attention and funding is shifting to the Middle East. The United States, Ukraine’s biggest single-country donor, has sent more than $40bn in aid since Russia’s invasion in February 2022. However, some $61bn in additional aid to Ukraine is being held up by the US Congress. Another $50bn package from the European Union is struggling to pass because of opposition from Hungary, leaving Ukraine concerned about dwindling resources as it heads into the harsh winter. Despite the funding delays, Western leaders insist they will stand by Ukraine as long as it takes. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said “every single NATO member expressed enduring support for Ukraine” at Wednesday’s summit. He added that the US is looking for supplemental funding for Ukraine to be approved by Congress in the coming weeks. As well as funds, Kyiv is in desperate need of ammunition, with the West struggling to keep pace with earlier pledges to supply bullets and shells. The US is engaged in talks with Greece to buy $47m worth of artillery shells for Ukraine, which has urged partners to accelerate the delivery of ammunition. The EU has so far sent Ukraine some 300,000 of the 1 million shells it promised, Kuleba said, but it has warned that it will not be able to meet the target in full. However, Germany’s foreign minister voiced strong backing for redoubling military aid, urging for the formation of a “protective shield” that can block Russian attacks during the winter. The Ukraine-focused NATO summit comes as Russian and Ukrainian forces appear to grind to a winter deadlock 22 months into the war. On Wednesday, Ukraine’s military said it had fended off a string of overnight Russian drone and missile attacks. The air force said it destroyed nearly two dozen Russian attack drones and several missiles in the nationwide aerial assault. Russian air defence also destroyed a Ukraine-launched drone flying towards Moscow, the mayor of the capital, Sergei Sobyanin, said. Neither Russia nor Ukraine has made significant breakthroughs on the battlefield for weeks as Moscow’s invasion drags on. The conflict has killed or wounded an estimated 500,000 from both sides.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/29/ukraine-fm-vows-to-keep-fighting-while-lobbying-nato-support
"Russia unleashes assault waves on Ukraine’s Avdiivka, refugees on Nordics","Russia is losing manpower at pace, says Ukraine, whose army has been mostly on the defensive in recent days.","Russia has tried to smash through Ukraine’s eastern defences before the onset of winter, incurring huge losses during the 92nd week of the war. Between November 22 and 24, Russia unleashed what Ukraine said was the third major attempt to capture Avdiivka in two months, sending about 50 assaults supported by armour. On one day alone, Ukraine’s military said it had “eliminated” 1,100 Russian soldiers and 30 tanks. “There is an average number of eight to 16 to 18 air attacks per day. Sometimes 30. We don’t have time to count them,” Vitaliy Barabash, head of Avdiivka’s military administration, told Channel 24 television. Russian fatalities came to almost 1,000 men a day – 6,260 for the week of November 20-26, said Ukraine’s deputy defence minister Oleksandr Pavlyuk. He said 78 enemy tanks and 113 armoured combat vehicles were also destroyed in the intense fighting By Ukraine’s estimation, more than 325,000 Russian soldiers have died in the war. “The Russians are tolerant to human losses … on the other hand, this tolerance is nestled in a sense of fighting a just war,” Konstantinos Grivas, who teaches geopolitics and weapons systems at the Hellenic Army Academy, told Al Jazeera. “If that doesn’t exist, there is a social reaction … I’m not sure this traditional tolerance will apply in this war, considering also that the population is shrinking. So it will be difficult for Russia to continue to bang its head against the wall indifferent to casualties,” Grivas said. Southern forces spokesman Oleksandr Shtupun said Russian attacks were coming in waves, involving 10-20 people, similar to Ukraine’s platoon or company-sized attacks, suggesting manpower limitations. Shtupun also suggested morale was low, saying Russians were surrendering to Ukrainian forces in increasing numbers – including a dozen on November 15 and some 30 taken prisoner on November 27. Although Ukraine has said its counteroffensive would continue through the winter, its forces seemed to be busy defending from Russian attacks. The only places where Ukraine’s general staff said it was still conducting counteroffensive operations were near Robotyne, on the southern front, where it has breached Russian front-line fortifications, and on the left bank of the Dnipro river, where it has landed reconnaissance troops in force. Russia and Ukraine attacked each other in the air during the week, with Russia unleashing a record 75 Shahed drones against Kyiv on November 25 – Ukraine’s remembrance day for theHolodomor famine of 1932-33. Ukraine’s air force said it downed 74 of them, and a further eight out of nine were launched the following day. Air force spokesperson Yuri Ignat said Russia was painting its drones black and coating them in a radar-absorbent material to make them harder to detect. Ukraine planned to increase its mobile air defence units, consisting of a pick-up truck equipped with a large-calibre machine gun, anti-aircraft gun or Man-Portable Air Defence System (MANPADS). These, Ignat said, had downed a large proportion of the drones. Russia seemed to be pursuing a hybrid war through non-military means as well. Finlandon Friday closed three border crossings to Russia for a month, saying Moscow was deliberately sending asylum-seekers to create a refugee crisis. Some 900 nationals from Afghanistan, Kenya, Morocco, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen had entered Finland this month, said the Finnish Border Guard, compared with about one asylum seeker a day previously. “Intelligence information from different sources tells us that there still are people on the move … If this continues, more measures will be announced in the near future,” Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said on Monday. Finland had already closed four border crossings to Russia, and has threatened to close the remaining one – at Raja-Jooseppi, in the Arctic. Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, accused Finland of stoking “Russophobia”, but other Nordic countries have followed developments with similar concern. Latvia and Estonia said they, too, had observed an increase of asylum seekers in what Estonian Defence Minister Hanno Pevkur described as an attempt to “weaponise illegal immigration”. Both countries were considering closing their borders with Russia, as was Norwegian Prime Minister Johan Gahr Store. Some European Union members were at risk of closing their borders to Ukraine for a different reason. Slovak truckers threatened to blockade their country’s main border crossing to Ukraine beginning on December 1, if the EU didn’t limit competition from Ukrainian truckers. They were following thelead of Polish truckers, who started similar protests earlier this month and had, the previous day, blockaded a major crossing with Ukraine, creating traffic queues kilometres long. Truckers from both countries say Ukrainian hauliers are undercutting their rates and want the EU to bring back a permit system for non-EU truckers. Earlier in the year, Poland and Hungary threatened to stop the transit of Ukrainian grain through their territories if the grain was also sold in-country. They said the dumping of relatively cheap Ukrainian grain was threatening to put their farmers out of business. Both of these commercial disputes are suggestive of the problems EU leaders are likely facing in the run-up to a December summit when there will be pressure to declare Ukraine an official EU candidate. That is one of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s three declared wishes – a move that would send a powerful political signal that Europe is prepared to defend Ukraine in the long run. Zelenskyy also listed as key “victories” US Congressional approval of a $60bn military aid package and EU approval of a 19 billion euro ($21bn) military aid package, both for 2024. Russian President Vladimir Putin has already put his own military budget in place. On November 27 he signed a 70 percent increase of defence and security spending next year, to $157.5bn. Defence and security will thus represent some 39 percent of the entire Russian budget of $412bn – itself 13 percent higher than last year’s budget.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/29/russia-unleashes-assault-waves-on-ukraines-avdiivka-refugees-on-nordics
"Ukraine says Marianna Budanova, wife of military spy chief, was poisoned",Ukrainian officials say wife of Kyrylo Budanov has been hospitalised due to heavy metals poisoning.,"The wife of Ukraine’s military spy chief has been poisoned with heavy metals and is undergoing treatment, a Ukrainian official says. A spokesperson for the Ukrainian military intelligence agency, or GUR, said Marianna Budanova, wife of Kyrylo Budanov, was receiving treatment in hospital. “Yes, I can confirm the information. Unfortunately, it is true,” GUR spokesperson Andriy Yusov told the Reuters news agency on Tuesday without clarifying when the poisoning occurred or who was responsible. Budanov has become a celebrated figure in Ukraine for his role in planning clandestine operations against Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.    Yusov said this year that Budanov had survived 10 assassination attempts by Russia’s Federal Security Service, or FSB. While it is not immediately clear who was behind the suspected poisoning of his wife, the BBC’s Ukrainian service cited Yusov as saying that other GUR officials have experienced milder poisoning symptoms. The suspected poisoning was first reported by Ukrainian media. There was no immediate comment from Russian authorities. Russian media figures have speculated that the poisoning could be a result of infighting within Ukraine. Russia has previously been accused of poisoning dissidents, including politicianAlexey Navalnyand twoRussian exileswho attended a summit in Berlin organised by a critic of Russia. Moscow has also blamed Ukraine for suspected involvement in the killings of apro-war Russian bloggerand a pro-war journalist on Russian soil, something Ukraine denies.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/28/ukraine-says-marianna-budanova-wife-of-military-spy-chief-was-poisoned
Baltic foreign ministers pull out of OSCE summit over Russia invite,"Ministers of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania say presence of Sergey Lavrov risks legitimising Russian war in Ukraine.","The foreign ministers of three Baltic states have announced that they will boycott a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) after Russian Foreign MinisterSergey Lavrovwas invited to the event. In a statement on Tuesday, the officials from Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania said that a decision to invite Lavrov to attend the summit in Skopje risked legitimising Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “We deeply regret the decision enabling the personal participation of Russian Foreign Minister S. Lavrov at the 30th Session of the OSCE Ministerial Council in Skopje,” thestatementreads. “It will only provide Russia with yet another propaganda opportunity.” Separately, Oleh Nikolenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian foreign ministry, wrote in a statement on Facebook that the Ukrainian delegation would not take part in the meeting. Nikolenko said Russia had abused the rules of consensus in the organisation, resorted to “blackmail and open threats” and had also been holding three Ukrainian OSCE representatives in prison for 500 days. “In such conditions, the presence of a Russian delegation … at minister-level for the first time since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine will only deepen the crisis into which Russia has driven the OSCE,” he said. There was no immediate comment from the Russian foreign ministry.

Speaking before a gathering of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg urged members to “stay the course” in theirsupport for Ukraine, as both the United States and European Union struggle to agree on further military aid. The OSCE, a 57-member organisation first started during the Cold War with the goal of lowering tensions between East and West, has a rotating presidency currently held by North Macedonia, whose foreign minister invited Lavrov to the summit that is set to begin on Thursday. Lavrov said on Monday that he would attend, in what would be his first trip to a NATO member since Russia launched itsinvasion of Ukrainein February 2022. Speaking to reporters at NATO headquarters on Tuesday, North Macedonia’s Foreign Minister Bujar Osmani defended the decision and argued that the OSCE should be seen as a neutral forum.    “Lavrov is not coming to Skopje, in a way. Lavrov is coming to the OSCE just as he went to [the] UN in New York a few months ago,” Osmani said. “I won’t be meeting him as the foreign minister of North Macedonia, but as the OSCE chairman in office.” However, Osmani also took a firm stance on Ukraine, saying that he would tell Lavrov that “we have turned [the] OSCE into a platform for political and legal accountability of the Russian Federation for its deeds in Ukraine, and we will continue to do so”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/28/baltic-foreign-ministers-pull-out-of-osce-summit-over-russian-participation
NATO chief urges allies to ‘stay the course’ in supporting Ukraine,"Jens Stoltenberg meets alliance’s top diplomats amid some resistance in US, Europe to keep funding war against Russia.","NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg has urged members of the security alliance to continue backing Ukraine in its battle against Russia’s invasion amid opposition in the United States to a military aid package and resistance in Europe for a longer-term support plan for Kyiv. “We just have to stay the course. This is also about our security interests,” Secretary General Stoltenberg said on Tuesday at a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels. The US has provided more than $40bn in security aid to Ukraine sinceRussia’s invasionin February 2022 and pledged to back Kyiv for as long as necessary. But some $61bn in proposed US aid to Ukraine is being held up by the US Congress, while another $50bn package from the European Union is struggling to pass because of opposition from Hungary. Al Jazeera’s Step Vaessen, reporting from Brussels, said the funding delays show indications of “fatigue” from some NATO members 21 months into the war. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the two-day summit was aimed at “strongly reaffirming our support for Ukraine as it continues to face Russia’s war of aggression”. “I’m confident that the United States will continue to provide support because it is in the security interest of the United States to do so and it’s also in line with what we have agreed,” Stoltenberg said.     Stoltenberg pointed to recent pledges from Germany and the Netherlands worth 10 billion euros ($11bn) as proof that NATO remained committed to backing Kyiv. “Even though the frontline has not moved so much, the Ukrainians have been able to inflict heavy losses on the Russian forces,” he said. Concerns have ratcheted up over the future of Western backing for Ukraine as Kyiv’s top general has admitted that the fierce fighting has reached a “stalemate“. Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba will try to overcome such fatigue and lobby for continued NATO backing when he joins the summit on Wednesday. Kuleba will also work with NATO ministers to outline a plan for reforms aimed at helping Ukraine gain eventual membership in the alliance. Russia has said NATO expansionism is at the core of its grudge against bordering Ukraine, which it has repeatedlywarnednot to join the alliance. More than 500,000 troops from Russia and Ukraine areestimatedto have been killed or wounded since Moscow marched troops across its neighbour’s border in February 2022. At least 10,000 civilians have also been killed in the conflict, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine hassaid. The ministers planned to discuss Russia’s “destabilising actions” throughout the region, including allegations it has been enabling undocumented migrants to reach neighbouring Finland. Finland on Tuesday announced that it willclose its entire border with Russiato travellers for the next two weeks in a bid to halt the unusually large flow of asylum seekers to the Nordic nation, which the government and its allies called an orchestrated move by Moscow.    The ministers are likely to address theseven-week warbetween Israel and Hamas, though it is not officially on the agenda. Al Jazeera’s Vaessen said the ministers would discuss “not only the extension of the ceasefire [between Israel and Hamas] but a future for Gaza after the war is finished”. On China, Stoltenberg said: “China is not an adversary, but at the same, we must be clear-eyed about the impact of China’s coercive policies on our security.” Hanging in the background is the membership status of Sweden, which has been awaiting ratification from Turkey and Hungary for 18 months. Stoltenberg on Tuesday told Hungarian media he expected the two countries to approve Sweden’s membership bid without further delay, but gave no precise timeline. The Turkish parliament started this month to debate Sweden’s bid to join after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan launched the process following a deal at a NATO summit in July, but the legislature’s foreign affairs commission decided todelay the voteafter lawmakers expressed reservations. Turkey has demanded that Sweden take more steps to rein in local members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), considered a “terrorist” group by Ankara, the EU and the US. Sweden and Finland requested to join NATOin May last year following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In order to join, a country must be approved by all current members.

"Ukraine storm death toll rises to 10, thousands rescued in the south","Worsening weather in Odesa, Kharkiv, Mykolaiv and Kyiv has put pressure on emergency services, already overstretched by war.","Ten people have died in Ukraine as icy storms of snow and rain swept in from the Black Sea, crippling infrastructure, blocking roads and cutting power, the country’s interior minister said. The record-breaking storm has lashed swathes of the country since Sunday, leaving thousands of settlements in the affected region without power and taxing an already overworked energy grid and rescue serviceoverextendedby Russia’s nearly two-year invasion. “As a result of worsening weather conditions, 10 people died in Odesa, Kharkiv, Mykolaiv and Kyiv regions,” Minister Ihor Klymenko wrote on the Telegram app on Tuesday. “Twenty-three people were injured, including two children.” A total of 411 settlements in 11 regions had lost power, and more than 1,500 vehicles had to be rescued, Klymenko said. Emergency responders carried out rescues and evacuations of residents swept off roads and trapped by snow. Southern Ukraine was the worst affected, particularly the Black Sea region of Odesa. Cars and buses slid off frozen roads into fields and police battled high winds to tow the vehicles out. Oleh Kiper, the governor of the Odesa region where five people died due to the weather, said nearly 2,500 people had been rescued by emergency services after becoming trapped by the snow. “849 vehicles have been towed out, including 24 buses and 17 ambulances,” Kiper wrote on Telegram, adding that over 300 settlements in his region were without power. The extreme weather struck as tens of thousands of troops man front-line positions in the 21-month-old war with Russia amid fears Moscow could attack the power grid with air strikes this winter. The storm system overran also nearby regions. In Russian-annexed Crimea and southern Russia, at least three people were reported to have died. Russia’s Ministry of Energy said “about 1.9 million people” were affected by power cuts in the southern Russian regions of Dagestan, Krasnodar and Rostov as well as the occupied Ukrainian territories of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, Zaporizhia and Crimea.

"At least three killed as storm hits Russia, Ukraine’s Black Sea coast",Hundreds of thousands of people without power as fierce storm devastates infrastructure.,"More than half a million people are without power in occupied-Crimea, Russia and Ukraine after a storm in the Black Sea region flooded roads, ripped up trees and took down power lines, according to Russian state media and Ukraine’s Ministry of Energy. More than 2,000 towns and villages were without electricity on Sunday night and Monday morning in 16 Ukrainian regions, including Odesa, Mykolaiv and inland in Kyiv, as trees were uprooted, power lines snapped and electrical substations failed, leaving almost 150,000 households in the area without electricity, Ukraine’s Energy Ministry said. A 110-metre (360ft) chimney of a heat and power plant collapsed in the Ukrainian port city of Odesa on Sunday night, adding to Ukraine’s losses of energy infrastructure that have already sustained heavy damage from Moscow’s militarycampaign targeting Ukraine’s power grid. As winter nears, Russia has been attackingcivilian infrastructurefar from the front lines, leaving millions of Ukrainians without power, heat and water for days at a time. Although the heating supply has been restored after plants in Odesa were shut down for several hours due to power fluctuations, Ukrainian officials said they expected the weather to worsen as forecasters predicted more strong winds and snowfall. The head of Russia’s national meteorological service said the storm that hit Crimea was the most powerful since record-keeping began, state news agency RIA Novosti reported. At least three people were killed during the storm, local media reported. One person was killed in the resort city of Sochi, another on the Russian-held Crimean Peninsula and a third person on board a vessel in the Kerch Strait, which separates Crimea from the Russian mainland, the state news agency TASS reported. Russia’s Ministry of Energy said “about 1.9 million people” were affected by power cuts in the southern Russian regions of Dagestan, Krasnodar and Rostov as well as the occupied Ukrainian territories of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, Zaporizhia and Crimea. Crimea’s Moscow-appointed governor declared a state of emergency, and hundreds of people were evacuated. A video published online showed large waves sweeping over the seafront in Sochi and carrying away cars. In the Crimean port city of Sevastopol, an aquarium flooded and nearly 800 exotic fish, including pikes and piranhas, died from thermal shock as cold seawater flooded the facility, the aquarium director said. Roman Vilfand, the head of Russia’s national meteorological service, said a similar storm hit the region in November 1854 during the Crimean War. It caused at least 30 ships to sink off Crimea’s coast, RIA Novosti said. In southern Russia, the Caspian Pipeline Consortium stopped crude oil loading at the Novorossiysk port on Monday due to “extremely unfavorable weather conditions”, including winds of up to 86 kilometres per hour (54 miles per hour) and waves up to 8 metres (26ft) high.

Russia’s bid to arrest Meta spokesperson revealed amid media crackdown,,"Russia has put the communications director of social media company Meta on a wanted list, it has been revealed, amid Moscow’s announcement of new media restrictions ahead of next year’s presidential election. Andy Stone, aspokespersonof US tech giant Meta Platforms Inc, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, is wanted on unspecified criminal charges, Russian news wires reported late on Sunday, referring to an Interior Ministry database. Russia added Meta to its list of “terrorists and extremist” organisationslast year. The list includes right-wing nationalist groups; foreign “terrorist organisations,” including the Taliban; and Russian opposition groups. The classification means Russians using Facebook and Instagram could face possible criminal charges. According to Mediazona, an independent news website that covers Russia’s opposition and prison system, Stone was put on the wanted list in February 2022, but authorities made no related statements at the time and no news media reported on the matter until this week. In April 2022, Russia also formallybarredMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg from entering the country. Russia’s row with Meta started with its invasion ofUkraine, as users from both sides of the war voiced their unfiltered emotions on the platforms. Stone, at that time,announced temporary changesto Meta’s hate speech policy to allow for “forms of political expression that would normally violate [its] rules, like violent speech such as ‘death to the Russian invaders’”. In the same statement, Stone added that “credible calls for violence against Russian civilians” would remain banned. In late March, RussiabannedFacebook and Instagram for “carrying out extremist activities” after authorities accused Meta of tolerating “Russophobia”. Facebook and Instagram have been inaccessible in Russia since, but many Russians resorted tousing VPNsto keep using the social media networks.

"Russia downs Ukrainian drones, missiles day after its attack on Kyiv","Russian air defences intercept Ukrainian drones over four regions inside its territory, including Moscow, a day after its attack on Kyiv.","Russian air defences have intercepted Ukrainian drones over several regions inside its territory, including Moscow, just a day after Kyiv reported the “largest drone attack” on Ukraine since Moscow invaded the country in February last year. “Air defence destroyed four Ukrainian drones over the territory of the Bryansk, Smolensk and Tula regions,” Russia’s Ministry of Defence said in a statement on Sunday. Earlier, Russia said some drones were shot down over the Moscow region. The Russian army said it had also downed two Ukrainian missiles headed for Russia over the Sea of Azov, between the two countries. Ukraine, meanwhile, said its air defence had downed eight out of nine drones over the country on Sunday. On Saturday, Ukraine said Moscowhad launched 75 dronesinto the country, mostly aimed at the capital. The attack came as Kyiv markedHolodomor, the Soviet-engineered starvation tragedy that killed millions of Ukrainians during the Stalin era. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the attack an act of “willful terror”, saying “the Russian leadership is proud of the fact that it can kill”. Ukraine hashit Russian regionsand the annexed Crimean Peninsula with drones for months, launching a counteroffensive this summer to push back Russian forces.

"More than 70 Russian drones hit Kyiv, wounding five: Ukrainian officials",Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the attack an act of ‘wilful terror’.,"At least five people were wounded after Russia fired more than 70 drones at Kyiv overnight, Ukrainian officials said, calling it the largest drone attack in the war so far. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the attack on the capital an act of “wilful terror”, writing on the Telegram app that “the Russian leadership is proud of the fact that it can kill”. The attack, which used Iranian-designed Shahed kamikaze drones, reportedly began hitting different districts of Kyiv in the early hours of Saturday, with more waves coming as the sun rose. The air raid warning lasted for six hours. Air force chief Mykola Oleschuk said 71 of the 75 drones launched at Ukraine had been downed. He praised the effectiveness of “mobile fire” units – usually fast pick-up trucks with a machine gun or flak cannon mounted on their flatbed. According to Oleschuk, these downed nearly 40 percent of the drones. Kyiv’s Mayor Vitali Klitschko, writing on Telegram, said the attack had injured five people, including an 11-year-old girl, and damaged buildings in districts all across the city. Fragments from a downed drone had started a fire in a children’s nursery, he said.    The target of the attack was not immediately clear, but Ukraine has warned in recent weeks that Russia will once again wage an aerial campaign to destroy Ukraine’s energy system. Ukraine’s energy ministry said nearly 200 buildings in the capital, including 77 residential ones, had been left without power as a result of the attack. Ukraine’s air force said the raid was Russia’s largest drone attack since the beginning of thewarin February 2022. Al Jazeera’s Rob McBride, reporting from Kyiv, said Russian forces are trying to destroy critical infrastructure in Ukraine ahead of winter. “That is the concern for residents here in Kyiv and other cities as Russia targets important infrastructure and power supply as they did last year,” he said. Kyiv has also ramped updrone and missile attackson Russian military installations in eastern Ukraine and in and around the Crimean peninsula as it presses a counteroffensive it launched in June. Russian missile defences were reported to have downed 13 Ukrainian drones over Crimea and three more over the Volgograd region in the early hours of Friday, local media said, citing Russia’s defence ministry. Zelenskyy said on Friday that Ukraine needed to secure three key “victories” abroad, including the approval of extensive aid packages from the United States Congress and the European Union, and a formal start of accession talks to join the European Union. Twenty months into Russia’s full-scale invasion, fatigue has crept into the West’s relations with Kyiv, which heavily relies on its allies for military, economic and humanitarian aid to battle against the Kremlin’s troops.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/25/more-than-70-russian-drones-hit-kyiv-wounding-five-ukrainian-officials
Russian actress dies on stage as Ukraine ramps up air attacks,Russian theatre says actress Polina Menshikh died on stage in the Donbas region in a Ukrainian air raid.,"A Russian actress has been killed by a Ukrainian air attack while performing for Russian troops in eastern Ukraine. The Russian theatre for which Polina Menshikh, 40, worked confirmed that she was killed while performing on stage in the Donbas region. The details of the incident could not be independently verified, but military officials on both sides confirmed there had been a Ukrainian attack in the area on November 19. A Russian military investigator, quoted by Russian state television, said a school and cultural centre had been hit by HIMARS missiles in a village in the Donetsk region referred to as Kumachovo and known by Ukrainians as Kumachove, 60km (37 miles) from the front line. The investigator said one civilian, of whom he gave no further details, had been killed but made no mention of military casualties. The Russian defence ministry declined to comment and has mentioned no casualties from the attack. Ukrainian commanders said their forces had struck a Russian military award ceremony, targeting Russia’s 810th Separate Naval Infantry Brigade.    Robert Brovdi, a Ukrainian military commander, said in a post on social media that 25 people had been killed in the strike and more than 100 wounded. Unverified video footage on pro-Russian Telegram channels showed soldiers watching Menshikh singing on stage with a guitar on the day the Russian military celebrated their missile and artillery forces. Mid-song, the building was suddenly rocked by a blast and windows can be heard shattering before the lights go out and someone is caught on camera using an expletive. Ukraine’s Brovdi said the attack was “revenge for the 128th,” a reference to a Russian attack this month on soldiers from Ukraine’s 128th Separate Mountain Assault Brigade, in which the brigade said 19 of its soldiers were killed. Russian cultural leaders have been urged to visit areas near the front line to show support for soldiersfightingin Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin sent troops to invade in February 2022.

Ukraine battles ‘elaborate’ Russian defences as Putin condemns Israel’s war,Putin says world should try and stop ‘tragedy’ in Gaza as Russian forces reportedly kill civilians in Ukraine’s Kherson.,"Russian President Vladimir Putin reacted to criticism of his war in Ukraine from the world’s wealthiest nations, now in its 91st week, by holding up Israel’s war in Gaza for comparison. “I understand that this war, and the death of people, cannot but shock,” Putin told the virtual G20 meeting called by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday [November 21]. “And the extermination of the civilian population in Palestine in the Gaza Strip today, is not shocking?” Putin asked. Russia has leveragedthe deaths of more than 14,500 civilians in Gaza to cast its own aggression in Ukraine in a more favourable light. Putin’s remarks came after a series of speeches from other leaders expressing shock at Russian aggression. “Yes, of course, military actions are always a tragedy,” Putin said. “And of course, we should think about how to stop this tragedy.” Some observers took this remark to be conciliatory, and Putin reminded his colleagues that “Russia has never refused peace talks with Ukraine,” whereas Ukraine refuses peace talks with Russia under the current government. But only the previous day his ambassador at large, Rodion Miroshnik, told reporters in Moscow that “the current regime [in Kyiv] is absolutely toxic, we do not see any options for co-existence with it at the moment.” Putin’s opposition to war was also cast into doubt by domestic developments. A St Petersburg court sentenced Russian artist AlexandraSkochilenkoto seven years’ imprisonment for “spreading false information” on November 17, after she replaced five supermarket price tags with messages against the war. “The Russian army bombed an arts school inMariupol. Some 400 people were hiding in it from the shelling,” one read. Another said, “Russian conscripts are being sent to Ukraine. Lives of our children are the price of this war.” A Russian wartime law criminalises criticism of Putin’s prosecution of the invasion, and any view that deviates from the Kremlin’s position. Skochilenko wept in the dock as her sentence was read out. The prosecutor had asked for eight years. “How weak is our prosecutor’s faith in our state and society if he thinks our statehood and public safety can be ruined by five little pieces of paper?” she said in court. “Everyone sees and knows that you are not judging a terrorist. You’re not trying an extremist. You’re not even trying a political activist. You’re judging a pacifist.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said troops were still launching counteroffensive actions on the southern front in the 91st week of the war, but had gone on the defensive in the east. He attributed the defensive posture to winter weather, rather than a series of attacks Russian troops have launched in Avdiivka, Bakhmut, Kupiansk and Mariivka in recent weeks. “Difficult weather, difficult defence on the Lyman, Bakhmut, Donetsk and Avdiivka fronts. Offensive actions in the south,” Zelenskyy said on Telegram on Wednesday. Even in the south, however, a Ukrainian counteroffensive that began in June has failed to make territorial gains for the past few weeks. There was one bright spot for Ukraine on the front lines. Ukraine’s general staff said on November 17 their marines had established a bridgehead on the left bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson, killing a battalion’s worth of Russian soldiers – some 1,200 men – and destroying two dozen tanks and four dozen armoured vehicles. The figures were possibly cumulative for the entire period of this bridgehead action, which started approximately a month ago, when a Russian reporter said Ukrainian reconnaissance units had reached the outskirts of Krynky, 20km (12.4 miles) east of Kherson City on the left bank. Ukraine general staff said, “One of the main goals of this work is to push the enemy as far as possible from the right bank in order to secure the civilian population from continuous Russian shelling.” Russian artillery killed two civilians in a parking lot in Kherson City on Monday, Ukrainian authorities said. Despite Russia’s difficulty in reinforcing its thin defences on this far western corner of the front, Ukraine has had difficulty getting on. The staff said Russian defences in the area were “fairly elaborate”. A Ukrainian soldier told the Wall Street Journal they consisted of “elaborate dugouts that [Russian forces] constructed over months”. The strength of these could weaken over winter, said the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, a think tank. “Russian forces have not constructed extensive visible defensive fortifications … and appear to have opted for more discrete fortifications set further from the frontline,” the ISW wrote. “The discrete fortifications located away from the frontline in Kherson Oblast will likely only be fully effective if they remain concealed, however. Fall and winter weather conditions may reveal some concealed positions as foliage and natural ground cover die.” Russian sources provided contradictory accounts about this Ukrainian action. Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu told the Russian Ministry of Defence Collegium on November 21, that “all attempts of the Ukrainian armed forces to conduct an amphibious operation in the Kherson direction were unsuccessful,” while “suffering colossal losses”. But on the same day, a Russian military reporter contradicted the official version, saying Ukrainian forces gunned down an entire Russian assault group near Krynky. “If the company craps itself and leaves the village, there is no point in reporting that it is ‘ours’,” wrote the reporter in adiatribeagainst official reports that gloss over bad news. Russia scored more success by intensifying its attacks on the softer target of Ukrainian energy infrastructure – a repeat of last winter’s tactic. Russia reportedly sent a total of 96 Iranian-designed Shahed drones into Ukrainian civilian territory during the week in attacks almost every night. Some of the attacks were accompanied by missiles. The worst came on the night of November 17-18, when Ukraine said it downed 29 out of 38 drones. But the rest caused power outages in 400 towns and villages in the south and north of the country. “Your accuracy, guys, is literally life for Ukraine,” Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the air force, but warned: “The closer we are to winter, the more Russians will try to make the strikes more powerful.” Ukrainian authorities said among the drones they shot down on November 21 was an Iranian-built Mohajer-6. Unlike the Shahed, the Mohajer is not a kamikaze drone. It is designed for reconnaissance and attack, and can carry four missiles. The recurrence of Russia’s winter tactics was likely the motive for Berlin upping the number of IRIS-T air defence systems it promised to supply Ukraine from eight to 12, in a new $1.3bn defence aid package on November 21. But the systems still have to be built, and capacity is low – only three of the eight previously pledged systems have been delivered, and those took a year. Separately, a border crisis brewed. Finlandsaid it was preparing to shut all but one of its eight border crossings with Russia on November 22. Four were shut on November 17 after a surge of refugee arrivals – more than 600 in November, compared with dozens a month before that. “Russia is effectively instrumentalising people, not only letting people through to the Finnish border with invalid documents or missing documents, which has not been the case before, but also we have evidence that Russia is effectively bringing those people to the border and organizing transport as well,” foreign minister Elina Valtonen told Reuters on November 21. She described it as part of Russia’s “hybrid warfare” against Finland. “At the EU border with Finland, Russian border guards have been letting people through without Schengen visas or EU residence permits. People who are being misled. People who are being used by Russia,” EU commissioner for home affairs Ylva Johansson said on November 21. In 2021, Russia’s main ally Belarus attempted to instrumentalise refugees, bringing in thousands of Syrians and Iraqis by plane from Istanbul, Amman and elsewhere and ferrying them to the borders with Poland and Lithuania.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/23/putin-uses-gaza-to-defend-his-war-while-bombing-civilians-in-ukraine
Russian journalist Boris Maksudov dies in Ukraine drone attack,The Rossiya 24 TV channel correspondent succumbs to shrapnel wounds sustained in the drone strike in Ukraine’s Zaporizhia region.,"Russian journalist Boris Maksudov has died after sustaining injuries in a drone attack in southeasternUkraine’sZaporizhia region. Maksudov, who worked for Russian state television Rossiya 24, was wounded on Wednesday and taken to hospital. Initially, defence officials said he was in stable condition. However, he later died of shrapnel wounds. “Boris Maksudov died a hero’s death, like a brave fighter,” Dmitry Kiselyov, the CEO of the Russian media group Rossia Segodnia, said, according to state-run news agency RIA Novosti. Moscow has repeatedly accused Kyiv of attacking reporters. Last month, it said three correspondents from the Izvestia news outlet were injured by shelling in the occupied Donetsk region. At least 15 media workers apart from Maksudov have been killed in Ukraine since Moscow launched its all-out invasion last February, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. In May, the Agence France-Presse news agency’s video journalist Arman Soldin was killed near the eastern city of Bakhmut. Russian theatre actress Polina Menshikh was killed in a similar manner this week while performing for Russian soldiers in the occupied Donbas region. Missiles struck the cultural centre where, according to the Ukrainian army, a Russian military award ceremony for the810th Separate Naval Infantry Brigadewas taking place.

Russia silent on Tehran arms claim as Ukraine downs Iran-built drone,The Kremlin says only that it is ‘developing military relations’ with Iran as Ukraine reports ‘rare’ drone.,"Russia has declined to comment on US claims that Iran could supply it with ballistic missiles. Ukraine said it shot down a “rare” Iran-built drone amid a barrage of attacks overnight. The Ukrainian Air Force said on Wednesday that it had downed more than a dozen attack drones and a cruise missile. The overnight assault followed a report by authorities in the southern region of Odesa that a rare Iranian-designed attack and reconnaissance drone had been destroyed. The air force said the overnight barrage was launched from southeast Russia and that a combination of air defence units in several central regions had “destroyed all 14 enemy Shahed-131/136 drones”. “The X-22 cruise missile failed to reach its target and landed in Zaporizhia region in an open area, and the blast wave damaged private homes. There were no casualties,” it added in a statement. Ukraine has been bracing for an increase in Russian attacks on critical infrastructure – particularly energy facilities – as subzero temperatures set in. Russian strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure last winter left many in the cold and dark for long periods. Kyiv has since received more air defence systems from its allies. Authorities in the Odesa region said on Tuesday that they had downed a “rare” Mohajer-6 drone. “The reconnaissance and strike UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle] was sneaking up on the Odesa region,” city officials said. The statement on social media said Russia had purchased 30 of the drones last year and that air defence forces shot one down for the first time last September. The Mohajer-6 is designed for reconnaissance and attack, can carry four guided missiles and has a range of up to 200km (124 miles) over 12 hours, the statement added. Iran’s support of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has long disturbed the US. The Kremlin declined on Wednesday to comment on a suggestion by White House spokesperson John Kirby that Iran may be considering providing Russia with ballistic missiles for use in its war. “We are developing relations with Iran, including in the field of military-technical cooperation, but we do not comment on this information,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters when asked about the accusation. Kirby said the United States would monitor the situation between Iran and Russia and take appropriate action as needed.

"More than 10,000 civilians killed in Ukraine since Russia invasion, UN says","UN: Half the fatalities in past three months due to Russia’s use of long-range missiles, abandoned ordinance blasts.","More than 10,000 civilians have been killed in Ukraine since Russia’s invasion last year, the United Nations says, with about half of the deaths in the past three months taking place far behind the front lines. The actual toll is expected to be “significantly higher” than the official tally since corroboration work is ongoing, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine said on Tuesday. More than 560 children have been killed, and more than 18,500 people have been injured since the start of the conflict on February 24, 2022, said the mission, which has monitors across the country. The UN attributed the recent deaths far beyond the front lines to Russian forces’ use of long-range missiles and the explosion of abandoned ordinance. “As a result, no place in Ukraine is completely safe,” warned Danielle Bell, who heads the monitoring mission. At least 10,000 civilians, incl over 560 children, have been killed since the start of Russia's full-scale armed attack on Ukraine in February last year. Read the latest 👇 — UN Human Rights (@UNHumanRights)November 21, 2023  The death toll includes events in the first months after the invasion, such as the battle for control of the port ofMariupol, where residents reported high civilian casualties. Russia denies deliberately targeting civilians. “Ten thousand civilian deaths is a grim milestone for Ukraine,” Bell said. Russia’s war against Ukraine“now entering into its 21st month, risks evolving into a protracted conflict with the severe human cost being painful to fathom”, she said. The vast majority of the deaths have been caused by explosive weapons with a wide-area impact, such as shells, missiles and cluster munitions, the UN said.

Ukraine marks 10-year anniversary of Maidan ‘Revolution of Dignity’,President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the protests marked Ukraine’s ‘first victory’ in its war with Russia.,"Ukraine’s pro-democracy, pro-Europe demonstrations inMaidansquare a decade ago marked the “first victory” in its war with Russia, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared on the anniversary of the popular protest movement. Nearly 100 civilians died in violent clashes with security forces when Ukrainians took to the streets of the capital in 2013, demanding to move Ukraine out of the orbit of VladimirPutin’s Russiaand “join” the family of European democracies to which it “historically belongs”. The “Revolution of Dignity” protests ultimately led to the ouster of Kremlin-backed PresidentVictor Yanukovychand gave space to the rise of a new generation of anticorruption, pro-democracy movement leaders. “The first victory in today’s war took place. A victory against indifference. A victory of courage. The victory of the Revolution of Dignity,” Zelenskyy said in a statement on Tuesday. He praised his country’s progress towards gaining membership in the European Union since Russian forces invaded Ukraine in February of last year. “Year after year, step by step, we do our best to ensure that our star shines in the circle of stars on the EU flag, which symbolises the unity of the peoples of Europe. The star of Ukraine,” he said. His comments come as Russian forces chip away at Ukraine’s sovereignty and continue their full-on invasion of their smaller neighbour. A number of foreign leaders made trips to Kyiv in a show of solidarity. German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius arrived by train for an unannounced visit to reaffirm Berlin’s backing for Ukraine in its fight against Russia’s troops. “I am here again, firstly to pledge further support, but also to express our solidarity and deep bond and also our admiration for the courageous, brave and costly fight that is being waged here,” he said laying flowers at Maidan square in central Kyiv. Also in Kyiv on Tuesday, European Council President Charles Michel, shared a post on the social media platform X, saying it was “Good to be back in Kyiv – among friends”. He posted a picture of himself shaking hands with the EU ambassador to Ukraine, Katarina Mathernova. Moldova’s President Maia Sandu arrived in Kyiv early on Tuesday to join Zelenskyy in honouring the memory of those who died during the Revolution of Dignity, her office said on X. United States Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin made anunannounced visitto Kyiv on Monday “to meet with Ukrainian leaders and reinforce the staunch support of the United States for Ukraine’s fight for freedom”, the Pentagon said in a statement. The United Kingdom’s foreign secretary, David Cameron,visited Ukraine last weekto underline British support for Kyiv amid its ongoing war with Russia. He told Zelenskyy the UK would support Ukraine for “however long it takes”. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs commented on the anniversary of Maidan protests by blaming Ukraine and the West for the current war in which nearly 10,000 people have lost their lives. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova questioned what the dream of Europe had brought Ukraine. “From a prosperous, industrially developed, densely populated ex-Soviet republic, Ukraine has turned into an impoverished, dying territory,” she said, according to comments published on the Foreign Ministry website. Ukraine had lost its independence as a result of the Maidan events, she said. “Western colonisers determine its domestic and foreign policy.” Russia’s Foreign Ministry also made statements saying Russia cannot coexist with the “regime” in Ukraine. “The current regime is absolutely toxic, we do not see any options for co-existence with it at the moment,” Russian ambassador-at-large Rodion Miroshnik said on Tuesday. He further stated that in order for the war to end, Ukraine must be “de-militarised and de-nazified” so as not to be deemed a threat to Russia.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/21/ukraine-marks-10-year-anniversary-of-maidan-revolution-of
"US defence chief visits Kyiv, announces $100m military aid package","US will send Ukraine anti-tank weapons, air-defence equipment and an additional HIMARS system.","US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin has made a surprise visit to Kyiv where he unveiled a new military aid package for Ukraine worth $100m. Austin, on his first trip to Kyiv since April 2022, met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as well as Defence Minister Rustem Umerov and Commander-in-Chief General Valerii Zaluzhnyi on Monday and promised the long-term support of the United States. “The message that I bring you today, Mr President, is that the United States of America is with you. We will remain with you for the long haul,” Austin told Zelenskyy. Austin said Ukraine’s effort to defeat Russian forces “matters to the rest of the world” and that US support would continue “for the long haul”. The new aid package includes anti-tank weapons, air-defence interceptors and an additionalHigh Mobility Artillery Rocket System(HIMARS). Zelenskyy told Austin that his visit was “a very important signal” for Ukraine. “We count on your support,” the Ukrainian president said. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the US has provided more than $44bn – and allies an additional $35bn – in security support that ranges from millions of bullets to air defence systems, advanced European and US battle tanks and, finally, pledges for F-16 fighter jets. But there are concerns that allied support is flagging amid the devastatingIsrael-Gaza warand aperceived lack of progressin a Ukrainian counteroffensive that began in June. Fighting has been bogged down in the east of the country around ruined towns such as Bakhmut and Adviidka, although Ukraine has recently reported some success in the southern Kherson region, where it hasestablished a footholdon the east bank of the Dnipro River, and in the Black Sea. However, as the cold weather sets in, it will become more difficult for either side to make large gains due to ground conditions. “I think they are prepared for combat in the winter,” Austin told reporters after his meetings, adding that the expectation was that Russia would be “even more aggressive”. Last year, Moscow relentlessly attacked Ukraine’s energy infrastructure and the power grid leaving millions of Ukrainians in the cold and dark at a time when temperatures are often below zero. Fred Kagan, a senior resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said it would be a mistake to think there is time to wait. “If we stop providing aid to Ukraine, it’s not that the stalemate continues. The aid is actually essential to preventing the Russians from beginning to manoeuvre again in ways that can allow them to defeat Ukraine,” Kagan told the Associated Press news agency. “So the cost of cutting off aid is that Russia wins and Ukraine loses and NATO loses.” Austin’s visit comes amid increasing division over aid for Ukraine in the US Congress. Some lawmakers want to make support for Israel a priority even though US defence officials stress that Washington can support both allies simultaneously, while a small, but vocal, group of Republicans oppose sending more aid to Ukraine, saying that taxpayers’ money should be spent at home.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/21/us-defence-chief-visits-kyiv-announces-100m-military-aid-package

"Zelenskyy sacks Ukraine’s military medical chief, urges reform of system",Ukraine’s president demands rapid changes in the operations of the war-torn country’s military medical system.,"Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has demanded rapid changes in the operations of Ukraine’s military medical system, announcing the dismissal of the commander of the medical forces. Zelenskyy’s move was announced on Sunday as he met Defence Minister Rustem Umerov, and coincided with a debate over the conduct of the 20-month-old war against Russia, with questions over how quickly a counteroffensive in the east and south is proceeding. “In today’s meeting with Defence Minister Umerov, priorities were set,” Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address. “There is little time left to wait for results. Quick action is needed for forthcoming changes.” Zelenskyy said he had replaced Major-General Tetiana Ostashchenko as commander of the Medical Forces of the Armed Forces. “The task is clear, as has been repeatedly stressed in society, particularly among combat medics, we need a fundamentally new level of medical support for our soldiers,” he said. This, he said, included a range of issues – better tourniquets, digitalisation and better communication. Umerov acknowledged the change in a post on the Telegram messaging app and laid out digitalisation, tactical medicine and rotation of servicepeople as his top priorities. “The experience of the effectiveness of specific units should be extended to the entire defence forces,” he said. Ukraine’s military reports on what it describes as advances in recapturing occupied areas in the east and south and last week acknowledged that troops had taken control of areas on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River in the southern Kherson region. Ukrainian commander-in-chief General Valery Zaluzhniy, in an essay published this month, said the war was entering a new stage of attrition, and Ukraine needed more sophisticated technology to counter the Russian military. While repeatedly saying advances will take time, Zelenskyy has denied the war is headed into a stalemate and has called on Kyiv’s Western partners, mainly the United States, to maintain levels of military support.

Qatar-UN mediation returns orphaned Ukrainian teen home after Russia ordeal,"Bohdan Yermokhin is one of 20,000 Ukrainian children who were illegally taken to Russia from Ukraine’s occupied regions.","An orphaned Ukrainian teenager, who was taken to Russia from occupied regions of the war-torn country, has returned home ahead of his 18th birthday after mediation from the UN and Qatar, avoiding potential conscription in the Russian army. Bohdan Yermokhin was one of 20,000 Ukrainian children illegally taken to Russia since Moscow’s full-scale invasion in February last year, according to Ukraine. The practice is deemed a war crime by the International Criminal Court (ICC). The teenager, who had been living in the port city of Mariupol with his cousin after both his parents died, was captured by Russian troops in the first weeks of Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and put into a foster home in Russia. Yemokhin tried to return home on his own through Belarus earlier this year but was stopped at the border and sent back. He appealed to Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskyy for help getting back ahead of his 18th birthday when he risked being drafted into the Russian army. On Sunday, Yomokhin arrived in Ukraine via Belarus, the Reuters news agency reported. “I believed I would be in Ukraine, but not on this day”, Yermokhin told reporters after crossing into Ukraine. “This is a very pleasant gift, to put it in the right way. The emotions are overwhelming, all good, with the notion that Ukraine needs me.” Zelenskyy welcomed Yermokhin’s return in his nightly video address. “Many attempts were made to help him. I am happy everything worked out,” he said, expressing thanks to Ukrainian officials, international organisations, and particularly the UN children’s fund, UNICEF, and authorities in Qatar for their mediation. The ICC claims Russia intends to “permanently [remove] these children from their own country”. It has issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Children’s Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova, saying there are “reasonable grounds to believe” they are responsible for the illegal deportation of Ukrainian children. Russia denies the allegations, saying it has only sought to protect children from the risk of violence in war zones. The Kremlin says Moscow does not recognise the jurisdiction of the ICC. About 400 Ukrainian children taken to Russia during the war have been returned home. Yermokhin’s lawyer, Kateryna Bobrovska, has said the teen risked being conscripted into the Russian army after he had been told to report to a draft office near Moscow next month. She called on Zelenskyy to help bring him home, bringing international attention to the case. Lvova-Belova, Russia’s children’s commissioner, said Yermokhin left Russia on Saturday on a plane to Minsk, where he met a cousin, before continuing to Ukraine. She acknowledged that Yermokhin had wanted to be reunited with his relative. Ukraine’s human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said he was grateful Yermokhin was back home after his long ordeal. “It was a thorny path. Bogdan went through a lot while in Russia, but despite everything, he wanted to be home! Today his wish has come true,” Lubinets said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/20/qatar-un-mediation-returns-orphaned-ukrainian-teen-home-after-russia-ordeal

Ukraine says Russia launched new drone attacks on three regions,Ukrainian military says its defences shot down 15 out of 20 Iranian-made Shahed drones overnight.,"Russia has launched several waves of drone attacks on the Kyiv, Poltava and Cherkasy regions of Ukraine, stepping up its assaults on the Ukrainian capital after several weeks of respite, according to Ukrainian officials. “The enemy’s UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles] were launched in many groups and attacked Kyiv in waves, from different directions, at the same time constantly changing the vectors of movement along the route,” Serhiy Popko, the head of Kyiv’s military administration, said in a message on Telegram messaging app early on Sunday. “That is why the air raid alerts were announced several times in the capital.” Popko said preliminary information indicated that Ukraine’s air defence systems downed 10 Iranian-made Shahed kamikaze drones in Kyiv and the city’s outskirts. There were no initial reports of “critical damage” or casualties, he said. The Ukrainian Air Force said on its official Facebook page on Sunday morning that Russia attacked the Ukrainian territories from its Kursk region. It said air defences shot down 15 out of 20 drones that conducted the strikes. The reports could not independently be verified and there was no immediate comment from Russia. Russia began carrying out strikes on Ukraine’s energy, military and transport infrastructure in October 2022, six months after Moscow’s troops failed to take over the capital and withdrew to Ukraine’s east and south. Last winter, Russia pounded Ukraine with hundreds of missiles and drones, leavingmillions without electricity, heating and waterduring the coldest months of the year – before easing the assaults in the summer. After a pause of 52 days, Moscow resumed air strikes on Kyiv earlier this month. On Saturday, Ukrainian officials said all drones heading towards Kyiv were destroyed, but some hit infrastructure facilities elsewhere in Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other officials have warned that Russia will resume its large-scale bombardment of Ukrainian civilian infrastructure during the winter months. In his daily video message on Saturday evening, Zelenskyy announced new steps to bolster Ukraine’s air defences in the coming weeks. “The closer we get to winter, the greater Russia’s efforts will be to step up its attacks,” Zelenskyy said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/19/ukraine-says-russia-launched-new-drone-attacks-on-three-regions
Russia sends first free grain to Africa since end of Black Sea deal,"Moscow begins shipments of 200,000 tonnes of grain months after it withdrew from UN-brokered Black Sea grain deal.","Russia’s agriculture minister says Moscow has begun free shipments of grain totalling up to 200,000 tonnes to six African countries,as promised by President Vladimir Putin. In a statement posted on Telegram on Friday, Dmitry Patrushev said that ships headed for Burkina Faso and Somalia had already left Russian ports, and that additional shipments to Eritrea, Zimbabwe, Mali and Central African Republic would soon follow. Putin had promised to deliver free grain to the six countries at a summit with African leaders in July, soon after Moscow withdrew from a deal that had allowed Ukraine to ship grain from its Black Sea ports despite the war with Russia. The agreement, brokered by the United Nations and known asthe Black Sea grain initiative, aimed to help avert famine by injecting more wheat, sunflower oil, fertiliser and other products into world markets, including for humanitarian needs. After Russia announced its plan to send free shipments, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that a “handful of donations” would not correct the “dramatic impact” caused by the end of the Black Sea deal. Since quitting the arrangement, Russia has repeatedly bombed Ukrainian ports and grain storage facilities, and Kyiv says hundreds of thousands of tonnes of cereals have been destroyed. In response to the collapse of the deal, Ukraine announced a “humanitarian corridor” hugging the western Black Sea coast near Romania and Bulgaria. On Friday, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency quoted a senior Ukrainian government official as saying that about 151 ships have used the new Black Sea shipping corridor since it was set up in August. A total of 4.4 million metric tonnes of cargo, including 3.2 million tonnes of grain, has been shipped via the corridor, Yuriy Vaskov, deputy minister for renovation and infrastructure, was quoted as saying. Vaskov said that 30 ships were being loaded at Ukrainian ports. They included 22 ships that would carry 700,000 tonnes of grain and eight ships readying 500,000 tonnes of other cargo. Ukraine is one of the world’s leading grain producers and exporters. Keeping grain exports flowing is key for its economy, which shrank by about a third last year. It is expected to grow by about 5 percent this year.   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/17/russia-sends-first-free-grain-to-africa-since-disrupting-ukraines-trade
Finland to block border amid Russian ‘instrumentalisation of migrants’,At midnight ‘devices to prevent entry’ will go up at four of the border crossings between the European neighbours.,"Finland will place barriers on four of the eight border crossings it shares with Russia, as it seeks to stem a flow ofasylum seekers. The Finnish Border Guard said on Friday that the barriers will go up at midnight (22:00 GMT) at the Vaalimaa, Nuijamaa, Imatra and Niirala crossings in southeastern Finland. “Our aim is to use barrier devices to prevent entry,” the Border Guard’s head of international affairs Matti Pitkaniitty told reporters. The measures are a response to changes in Russia’s border policy, he said. Helsinki has accused Moscow of encouraging or turning a blind eye to undocumentedmigrantscrossing over. Russia has denied the claim. Finland announced earlier this week that it would close the four border crossings, which are the busiest points of travel between the two countries, with about 3,000 people crossing per day. Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said that amidRussia’s invasion of Ukraine, Moscow was seeking to destabilise his country in response toHelsinki’s decision to join NATO. Finland’s action was supported by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. “Russia’s instrumentalisation of migrants is shameful. I fully support the measures taken by Finland,” von der Leyen said on X. I had a call with PM@PetteriOrpowho informed me about the situation at the border with Russia. Russia’s instrumentalisation of migrants is shameful. I fully support the measures taken by Finland. And I thank the Finnish Border Guards for protecting our European borders. — Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen)November 16, 2023  Finland’s neighbour Norway, which shares a border with Russia in the Arctic, has said it is also ready to close its border at short notice if necessary. From Saturday, asylum seekers arriving via Russia will only be allowed to hand in their applications at two northern border crossings, at Salla and Vartius, Pitkaniitty said. The border closures come amid growing tension between Russia and Finland over Helsinki’s military alliances since Russia’s war with Ukraine began. Finland shares a 1,340km (833-mile) frontier with Russia that also serves as the European Union’s external border. After Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year, EU member Finland abandoned its decades-long policy of military non-alignment. The country joined NATO in April. Russia said at the time that it would take unspecified “countermeasures” in response. Finland’s Border Guard has since tracked an uptick in undocumented arrivals, mostly from Africa and the Middle East. Finland’s ombudsman for non-discrimination said on Thursday that Helsinki still had a duty under international treaties and EU law to allow asylum seekers to seek protection. Finland is constructing a 200km (124-mile) fence on a section of the border, due to be completed by 2026.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/17/finland-to-place-barriers-on-russian-border-to-block-migrant-flow
Ukraine claims gains against Russian positions on Dnipro east bank,Ukraine shoots down nine out of 10 drones above several regions and gains ‘a foothold on several bridgeheads’ of the Dnipro river.,"Ukraine’s armed forces claim to have made significant headway via a series of attacks on the Russian-occupied east bank of the Dnipro river. The country’s Marine Corps said in a statement published on social media on Friday that it had gained “a foothold on several bridgeheads” of Dnipro, near the key southern city of Kherson. The waterway is the de facto front line in the south of Ukraine. However, Russia conceded for the first time this week that Ukrainian forces had claimed back some territory on the opposing bank. “The Defence Forces of Ukraine conducted a series of successful operations on the left bank of the Dnipro River, along the Kherson front,” the marines said, and “managed to gain a foothold on several bridgeheads.” Russian and Ukrainian forces have been entrenched on opposite sides of the Dnipro river since Moscow withdrew from the western part of the Kherson region last November. The Russian-installed official responsible for occupied Kherson this week conceded that some Ukrainian soldiers were “blocked” in Krynky, a small village on the Dnipro’s eastern bank, and were facing a “fiery hell” from Russian artillery, rockets and drones.    Also on Friday, the Ukrainian Air Force said it had repelled another night of attacks. It reported that it had shot down nine out of 10 Russian drones overnight over the southern Mykolaiv and Odesa regions, and also near Zhytomyr in the centre, and in the Khmelnytskyi region in the west of the country. Russia has intensified its strikes on Ukraine’s grain infrastructure, including the major port at Odesa, since July, when Moscow pulled out of the Black Sea Grain Initiative; a wartime deal that enabled Ukraine’s exports to reach African countries facing the threat of hunger. The air force said in a statement that Russian forces also launched several C-300 missiles during an overnight attack in the eastern Donetsk region, close to the front line.

Belarus linked to forcible transfer of Ukrainian children: Study,"Yale researchers say more than 2,400 children have been deported from Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine.","Belarus has been collaborating with Moscow in the forcible transfer of thousands of Ukrainian children from Russian-occupied Ukraine in a programme “directly overseen” by the country’s President Alexander Lukashenko, according to research from Yale School of Public Health’s Humanitarian Research Lab (HRL). The report (PDF), released on Thursday, said at least 2,442 children aged between six and 17 years old had been taken to 13 facilities across Belarus since Russia began its full-scale invasion in February 2022 until the end of October this year. “Russia and Belarus are targeting children for removal from Ukraine, coordinating their transport from occupied Ukraine through Russia to Belarus, and subjecting children to re-education, sometimes including military training, sometimes including military training,” the Yale HRL researchers said. They said Belarus’s authoritarian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, had “jointly directed and co-funded” the deportations with Putin under theUnion Stateinitiative that was first agreed back in 1996. “Belarus’s direct involvement in Russia’s forced deportation of children represents a collaboration between Belarus’s authoritarian leader [Alexander] Lukashenka and Russia’s President Vladimir Putin, with various pro-Russia and pro-regime organisations facilitating the deportation,” they said. Putin is already the subject of an International Criminal Courtarrest warrantover Moscow’s alleged forcible transfer of Ukrainian children from occupied territories, along with the country’s Children’s Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova. Taking children under the age of 18 across a border without the consent of a parent or guardian is illegal under international humanitarian law. Kyiv, which estimates some19,000 childrenhave been abducted, has already said it is investigating Belarus’s alleged involvement in the policy. In September, Belarus’s state media published photos of dozens of Ukrainian children arriving in the country from the Donetsk, Luhansk and Zaporizhia regions for a “three-week holiday”. The children were shown getting off a train carrying backpacks and suitcases, mostly looking solemn. Alexei Talai, the head of the charity leading the programme, said Lukashenko had described it as an “important humanitarian project” that needed to continue. Talai was also mentioned as a facilitator in Thursday’s report. The Yale HRL is part of The Conflict Observatory, which receives funding from the United States. “These revelations of Belarusian involvement are part of a broader campaign directed by Russia,” the US State Department said in a statement. “Members of Russia’s military and government have deported hundreds of thousands of Ukraine’s civilians to Russia, including children who have been forcibly separated from their families. The United States will continue to pursue accountability for actors involved in abuses connected with Russia’s war against Ukraine.” Moscow has denied allegations that it is involved in forcible transfers or separating children from their families. The Yale HRL report said the children had been taken from at least 17 cities in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhia regions, parts of which are occupied by Russia. They were put on trains to Rostov-on-Don in Russia before being transported to Belarus. It said more than 2,050 of the children had been taken to the “Dubrava children’s camp” in Minsk, the Belarusian capital. The researchers said it was not clear how many of the children it had documented remained in Belarus.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/17/belarus-linked-to-forcible-transfer-of-ukrainian-children-study
Russian artist jailed for seven years over anti-war price tag protest,Alexandra Skochilenko was convicted of spreading ‘false information’ after she replaced five supermarket price tags with criticism of Russia’s war in Ukraine.,"Russian artist Alexandra Skochilenko has been sentenced to jail for seven years after being found guilty of spreading “false information” about the Russian military by replacing a handful of supermarket price tags with messages criticising the war in Ukraine. The 33-year-old, known as Sasha, is one of thousands of Russians to be detained, fined or jailed forspeaking outagainst Moscow’s invasion of its neighbour amid an escalating crackdown on free speech and opposition to President Vladimir Putin. Skochilenko was arrested in her native St Petersburg in April 2022, after an elderly customer at the supermarket found the slogans on the price tags and notified the police. “The Russian army bombed an arts school in Mariupol. Some 400 people were hiding in it from the shelling,” one read, in reference to Russia’sbrutal siegeof the southern Ukrainian city. Another said, “Russian conscripts are being sent to Ukraine. Lives of our children are the price of this war.” Judge Oksana Demiasheva delivered the verdict on Thursday hours after Skochilenko, who has a congenital heart defect and coeliac disease, had made a final statement to the court, asking for compassion and to be set free. As well as the prison term, the artist was banned from using the internet for three years. Skochilenko, wearing a colourful T-shirt decorated with a large red heart, reacted with shock to the sentence, covering her face and wiping away tears. Supporters shouted “shame” and “we’re with you Sasha”, the AFP news agency reported. Skochilenko’s lawyers left without giving any comment. Skochilenko’s arrest came about a month after authorities adopted a law effectively criminalising any public expression about thewarthat deviated from the Kremlin’s official line. Human rights group Memorial – now banned in Russia – said police spent 10 days interrogating supermarket staff and inspecting security camera footage before arresting the artist. “They sometimes give less for murder than for five price tags in a supermarket,” Boris Vishnevsky, a politician linked to the opposition Yabloko party, told AFP. “Hopefully, someday, the pendulum will turn the other way.” Skochilenko was accused of committing what the state prosecutor described as a serious crime out of “political hatred” towards Russia. He had asked for her to be jailed for eight years. Skochilenko admitted to swapping the tags but denied that the text written on them was false. She said she was a pacifist who valued human life above all else. “How weak is our prosecutor’s faith in our state and society if he thinks our statehood and public safety can be ruined by five little pieces of paper?” she said in court. “Everyone sees and knows that you are not judging a terrorist. You’re not trying an extremist. You’re not even trying a political activist. You’re judging a pacifist,” she said. Amnesty International condemned the verdict. “Her persecution has become synonymous with the absurdly cruel oppression faced by Russians openly opposing their country’s criminal war,” it said in a statement. Memorial has designated Skochilenko a political prisoner and has launched a campaign calling for her release. She has already been in detention for nearly 19 months, meaning that her overall term will be reduced by more than two years, since every day served in a pre-trial detention centre counts as 1.5 days of time served in a regular penal colony. But she has struggled in custody due to pre-existing health conditions, and her need for a gluten-free diet, according to her lawyers and her partner. According to OVD-Info, a prominent rights group that monitors political arrests and provides legal aid, a total of 19,834 Russians have been arrested between February 24 2022, when Russia began its invasion, and late October 2023 for speaking out or demonstrating against the war. Also on Thursday, opposition politician Vladimir Milov was convicted in absentia of spreading false information about the army and sentenced to eight years. Milov, who was once Russia’s deputy energy minister and is now an ally of imprisoned opposition leader Alexei Navalny, has left the country.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/17/russian-artist-jailed-for-seven-years-over-anti-war-price-tag-protest

Finland to shutter border crossings with Russia to deter asylum seekers,Finland accuses Russia of trying to destabilise the country by encouraging undocumented migration.,"Finland says it will close four of its eight border crossings with Russia where it has seen a surge in asylum seekers, accusing Moscow of turning a blind eye to undocumented people from mainly Africa and the Middle East to destabilise the country. Interior Minister Mari Rantanen said on Thursday that the border crossings in the southeastern regions of Vaalimaa, Nuijamaa, Imatra and Niirala would close on Saturday morning. The crossings are normally the busiest points of travel between Russia and Finland with about 3,000 people using them per day. Asylum seekers arriving via Russia will from Saturday have to turn in their applications at two northern border crossings, the government said. The border closures come amid growing tension between Russia and Finland, which share more than 1,300km (830 miles) of border, over Helsinki’s defence cooperation with the United States. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year, Finland abandoned its decades-long policy of military non-alignment and joined NATO in April. Russia said it would take unspecified “countermeasures” in response.    Finland’s Border Guard has since tracked an uptick in undocumented arrivals, mostly from Africa and the Middle East. Finnish officialsbelieveMoscow is encouraging people to go to the Finnish border, where they can apply for asylum. “It is clear that these people get help to get to the border. This seems like a very conscious decision”, Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said on Tuesday. Rantanen surmised: “Maybe [Russian officials] are annoyed by something in Finland’s activities.” The Kremlin, reacting to earlier reports that Finland was mulling a closure, put the blame on Helsinki for deteriorating ties. “We deeply regret that the Finnish leadership has chosen to deliberately move away from what used to be good relations,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday. Finland is constructing a 200km (124-mile) fence on a section of the border, due to be completed by 2026.

UK’s newly appointed top diplomat makes surprise visit to Ukraine,David Cameron tells Ukraine’s president that London would support Kyiv for ‘however long it takes’.,"The United Kingdom’s newly appointed foreign secretary, David Cameron, has made a visit to Ukraine to underline British support for Kyiv amid its ongoing war with Russia, according to his office. The former prime minister, making his first working trip abroad as Britain’s top diplomat, told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that his country would support Ukraine for “however long it takes”. “I wanted this to be my first visit,” Cameron said. “I admire the strength and determination of the Ukrainian people.” He wasnamedforeign secretary on Monday in a surprise cabinet reshuffle. Zelenskyy said he was grateful for Cameron’s gesture, which comes amid Israel’s war in Gaza that he worries has diverted attention from Ukraine’s drawn-out battle with Russia, in its 21st month. “The world is not so focused on the battlefield situation in Ukraine, and this dividing of the focus really does not help,” Zelenskyy said.    The UK has been a close ally of Ukraine throughout the war, and Cameron told Zelenskyy Britain would continue to be there for moral, diplomatic and military support. “What I want to say by being here is that we will continue to give you the moral support, the diplomatic support … but above all the military support that you need not just this year and next year, but however long it takes,” Cameron said. He added that the UK would work with its allies “to make sure the attention is here in Ukraine”. Ukraine’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Cameron had also engaged in talks on issues related to armaments, arms production, and security in the Black Sea while in Kyiv. Ukraine did not say when the talks took place. Due to stringent wartime security regulations, the details of foreign dignitaries’ trips are sometimes released late. As of last month, the UK said it was second to the United States in providing military funds to Ukraine, giving 4.6 billion pounds ($5.7bn) worth of assistance and training 30,000 Ukrainian soldiers on British soil.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/16/uks-newly-appointed-top-diplomat-makes-surprise-visit-to-ukraine

Europe considers commitments to Ukraine as Russia’s war rages on,"The European Union considers massive military and state aid packages as Ukraine claims 10,000 Russian troops killed in Avdiivka assault.","Ukraine and Russia both scored some territorial successes and flung missiles and drones at each other during the 90th week of the war, each showing little sign of abatement. But much of the main action was in Europe’s capitals. European Unionmembers debated whether to grant Ukraine 20 billion euros ($22bn) in military aid and 50 billion euros ($54bn) in state and reconstruction aid over four years, and whether to invite Ukraine to start membership talks at the European summit in December. Both actions would send a powerful message to Russia’s President Vladimir Putin that Europe’s resolve to help Ukraine has not weakened. Europe also prepared a 12th package of sanctions, making it harder for Russia to sell its oil around the world. The United Kingdom, meanwhile, ensured that Ukrainian grain would continue to be exported through the Black Sea, by brokering an insurance agreement that lowered the cost of war risk to freighters. That cost briefly rose after Russia struck a sixth civilian cargo vessel on November 8. Ukraine built up its bridgehead on the left bank of the Dnipro river during the week, threatening Russian forces at the western extremity of the front. Russian reporters said Ukraine advanced to new positions around Krynky, a town 20km (12 miles) east of Kherson City, on November 9. Geolocated footage confirmed the advance on November 13. The reports also said continuous Ukrainian artillery was pinning down Russian troops in towns between Krynky and Kherson City. Ukrainian military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said the armed forces were doing “everything possible to knock out the Russians from the left bank” in a statement on November 11, the first anniversary of a tactical Russian withdrawal from the territory it held in Kherson west of the river. Two days later, Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukraine’s presidential office, said, “Against all odds, Ukraine’s Defence Forces have gained a foothold on the left bank of the Dnieper [Dnipro river].” Ukrainian headway seemed to have caught Russia unprepared to communicate. On November 9, the day of the Ukrainian advance, Russia’s military said it had thwarted Ukraine’s attempt to gain a bridgehead on the left bank, killing 500 Ukrainian servicemen in a week. On November 13, Russia’s state TASS news agency and RIA Novosti newspaper published reports that Russia was ordering the redeployment of elements of the “Dnipro” group of forces in Kherson to “more advantageous positions”. Both withdrew the reports within minutes, issuing an apology. Russia, too, made advances. The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said Russian forces launched 30 attacks north and south of Bakhmut, an unusually high number, on November 8 and 9. Geolocated footage showed they had regained control of a railway line running south of Bakhmut and advanced north of the city. “The Russians have stepped up and are trying to recover previously lost positions” in Bakhmut, wrote Ukrainian ground forces commander Oleksandr Syrsky on Telegram. Russia also kept up pressure on Avdiivka, the eastern city south of Bakhmut it is trying to encircle. Ukraine’s military chief of staff, Valery Zaluzhny, said on November 10 that Russia had lost 10,000 men in the first month of its assault on Avdiivka. “During this time, our soldiers destroyed more than 100 enemy tanks, 250 other armoured vehicles, about fifty artillery systems and 7 Su-25 aircraft. The enemy’s total losses in manpower amount to about 10,000 people,” he wrote on social media. Neither Ukraine’s nor Russia’s claims of the other’s losses could be independently verified. Ukraine and Russia also sparred from a distance. Ukraine’s air force said it downed 19 out of 31 Shahed drones Russia fired off on November 10. Russia also fired a Kh-31 missile, an Onyx anti-ship missile and an S-300 air defence missile into Ukrainian territory, adopting a Ukrainian technique of using drones and missiles together to help overwhelm air defences. Russia’s Ministry of Defence said it downed two Ukrainian drones on the same day, one near Moscow and the other near the Russian border with Belarus. Baza, a Russian Telegram channel with links to security services, suggested one was targeting a machine plant in Kolomna, 100km (62 miles) southeast of Moscow. Ukraine has consistently asked allies for more air defence systems. On November 9, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister asked France for additional ammunition for air defence systems, and to participate in pilot training for F-16s. That pilot training took a major step forward on November 9, when five Dutch F-16s arrived at the Fetesti Air Base in Romania for pilot training. Four days later, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said F-16 pilot training had begun in a video address. The European F-16 Training Centre (EFTC) in Fetesti is to train non-Ukrainian pilots as well. The Netherlands is lending the EFTC 12-18 of its F-16s for training purposes, and helping coordinate the effort to provide Ukraine with its own F-16s. Ukrainian Deputy Energy Minister Farid Safarov recently told a NATO meeting that F-16s were the best way for Ukraine to defend its energy infrastructure from Russian attacks during the winter, but it was not certain how soon Ukraine would have operational F-16s. The EU was finalising a 12th package of sanctions on Russia that could be approved on Wednesday, the bloc’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Monday, November 13. “This 12th package will include … new export bans, among them … diamonds,” Borrell told reporters, indicating there would also be “actions to tighten the oil price cap, in order to decrease the revenue that Russia is getting from selling its oil – not to us but to others – [and] fighting against circumvention”. Days earlier, the European Parliament had called for tougher enforcement of European sanctions against Russian oil – and for an extension of those sanctions. The resolution said refined oil products from Russian oil were finding their way into the EU from India, and gas was continuing to enter the EU directly. But the most important European contributions to Ukraine’s security could come in December. Ukraine has been lobbying for an invitation to open membership talks, and the European Commission supports that demand.    “We are working to get an unconditional decision to start negotiations,” said Zelenskyy in a November 13 video address. “It is fundamental for Ukraine to implement all the recommendations of the European Commission that were given, all seven recommendations, and to do what is necessary at this stage of our journey to the European Union.” The EU last year said it would grant Ukraine candidate status if it passed legislation to fight corruption and money laundering, limit the influence of oligarchs, secure the integrity of the judiciary and guarantee the rights of ethnic minorities. At the same summit, the EU is to decide on whether to approve a 50 billion-euro ($54.2bn) financial aid package for Ukraine for the period 2024-27. The European Parliament has already given a green light to the so-called “Ukraine Facility”, designed to help finance the state as it transitions to EU membership and to rebuild the country. Separately, EU diplomats were considering a 20-billion euro ($22bn) military aid package that would commit members to spending 5 billion euros ($5.4bn) a year over four years. EU diplomats said on November 14 that there was resistance to the package. The EU’s foreign policy chief proposed the military budget in July. Among the sceptics was reportedly Germany, a stalwart provider of military aid to Ukraine so far, and this despite the fact that it proposed doubling its military aid to Ukraine to 8 billion euros ($8.7bn) next year. The governing coalition had reportedly agreed to the increase and would submit it for committee discussion on November 16. “It is a strong signal to Ukraine that we will not leave them in the lurch,” German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius is quoted as having said. Germany’s 8 billion-euro ($8.7bn) pledge came as Chancellor Olaf Scholz sought to ensure that Germany would meet a NATO defence spending minimum of 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) over the medium term. Germany is on track to spend 1.57 percent of GDP this year, and the 8 billion-euro ($8.7bn) pledge puts it over 2 percent for next year.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/15/europe-considers-commitments-to-ukraine-as-russias-war-rages-on
"Ukraine claims key southern foothold, appeals for more military aid",President Zelenskyy’s chief of staff says Ukrainian forces have secured their position on the east bank of the Dnipro.,"Ukrainian forces have secured a pivotal position on the eastern shore of the Dnipro River, a senior official said. The claim of momentum in the Ukrainian military’s counteroffensive, made by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s chief of staff in the United States on Tuesday, came as Kyiv presses the West to raise the supply of arms. “Against all odds, Ukraine’s Defense Forces have gained a foothold on the left (east) bank of the Dnipro,” Andriy Yermak told the Hudson Institute think tank in the US, as posted on Zelenskyy’s website. The statement was the first official confirmation of Ukraine’s establishment of a foothold on the Dnipro’s east bank in the Kherson region. This opens up a potential route towards Crimea. The peninsula, which was annexed by Russia in 2014, has been the focus of Ukrainian attacks in recent weeks. “Step by step, they are demilitarising Crimea. We have covered 70% of the distance. And our counteroffensive is developing,” Yermak told Hudson Institute. Russian forces seized Ukraine’s southern Kherson region in the early days of the February 2022 invasion. However, late last year, they pulled out of the regional capital, also called Kherson, and left the Dnipro’s west bank. Attacks have since been launched on Kherson and other towns from the east bank, soliciting a response from Ukraine. A Ukrainian military spokesperson this month said Ukraine had achieved “not bad results” in pushing Russian troops to relocate. Unofficial accounts have noted Ukrainian advances. In a highly unusual incident on Monday, two Russian state news agencies published alerts saying Moscow was moving troops to “more favourable positions” east of the Dnipro in Ukraine, only to withdraw the information minutes later. In the past, Russia has sometimes used similar phrasing about moving troops to more advantageous positions to describe retreats. The announcement of Ukraine’s southern foothold came as Zelenskyy also pointed to heavy Russian losses in the shattered eastern city of Avdiivka, which he said was undermining Moscow’s broader war goals. Moscow’s forces have focused on eastern Ukraine since failing to advance on Kyiv in the first days of the February 2022 invasion. They have taken aim at Avdiivka since mid-October and officials from the town, which had a pre-war population of 32,000, say not a single building remains intact. Zelenskyy, in an address on Tuesday night, said Russian assaults in the eastern Donetsk region, including Avdiivka, had been “very intense” but that Russia was rapidly losing manpower and equipment. Yermak, in his address to the Hudson Institute, said Russia’s strategy against Ukraine was “to outlast and out-endure the unity of democracies” and called on allies to provide more military aid to bolster Ukraine’s defence. “We need weapons right now. Russia still has air superiority,” he told the gathering. “It still is capable of producing missiles due to circumvention of sanctions. Not to mention the Iranian drones and North Korean artillery rounds.” The US has sent more than $46bn in military aid to Ukraine since Russia’s invasion. However, since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war on October 7, conservative US lawmakers have expressedscepticismabout further aiding Ukraine and advocated for redirecting funds to Israel. Germany, another key Ukraine ally, recently announced plans to double its military aid to Ukraine to $8.6bn next year.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/15/ukraine-claims-key-southern-foothold-appeals-for-more-military-aid

Russian convicted over journalist Anna Politkovskaya’s murder pardoned,Former police officer had been serving a 20-year sentence over his role in the killing of investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya.,"A man convicted for his role in the killing of investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya has been pardoned after fighting in Ukraine, according to his lawyer and local media reports. Politkovskaya, who was well known for reporting on abuses in Russia’s war in Chechnya early in Vladimir Putin’s presidency, was shot dead outside her flat in Moscow in 2006. The killing triggered an outcry in the West and underlined the growing dangers of reporting in Russia as Putin gradually clamped down on independent media. Sergei Khadzhikurbanov, a former police officer, was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2014 for organising the killing. “As a special forces fighter, [Khadzhikurbanov] was invited to sign a contract to participate in the special military operation… When the contract expired, he was pardoned by presidential decree,” Khadzhikurbanov’s lawyer Alexei Mikhalchik told the AFP news agency.    Khadzhikurbanov was convictedalong with four other menfrom Chechnya, a mostly Muslim region in the northern Caucasus where Russia and its local allies crushed two rebellions, in 1994-96 and, under Putin, in 1999-2009. In 2018, the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg found that, while the authorities had found and convicted a group of men who had directly carried out the contract killing, they had “failed to take adequate investigatory steps to find the person or persons who had commissioned the murder”. Politkovskaya, who did much of her work for the independent investigative magazine Novaya Gazeta, now banned in Russia, won more than a dozen international prizes for reporting on abuses committed in Chechnya by Russian and allied forces as well as by rebels, despite repeated detentions and death threats. Many Russian prisoners have been sent to fight in Ukraine since Moscow launched its offensive last February, with critics warning some have committed new crimes after returning from the front. The Kremlin last week acknowledged the use of prisoner recruits to fight in Ukraine and said convicts who “atone for their crime on the battlefield with blood” could be pardoned. “They are atoning with blood in storm brigades, under bullets and under shells,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Friday.    Russia has probably recruited 100,000 people from prisons to fight in Ukraine, Olga Romanova, the head of an independent prisoners’ rights group has estimated. Local Russian media outlets have reported several instances of released prisoners going on to commit serious offences, including murders, after having left the army.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/14/russian-convicted-over-journalist-anna-politkovskayas-murder-pardoned
Putin approves new media restrictions ahead of presidential election,Media barred from reporting on election body’s actions at military bases or areas under martial law without clearance.,"Russian PresidentVladimir Putinhas approved changes to a law that will curtail media coverage of next year’s presidential election, according to local news agencies. The elections are due to be held in March. The 71-year-old president, who has led the country for 24 years, is expected to stand for another six-year term. Putin has not officially declared he will run, saying he will announce that only after parliament formally sets the election date. The changes Putin greenlighted limit coverage of Central Election Commission sessions to registered media outlets, which could exclude freelancers or independent journalists, according to the reports on Tuesday. The amendments prohibit media from reporting on the commission’s actions at military bases or in areas under martial law without advance clearance from regional and military authorities. They also bar the publication of any campaign content on “blocked sources”, referring to restricted websites and social media services. Under an intensifying crackdown on the opposition and the flow of information, Russia has banned an array of websites and services, including Facebook and Instagram. To enforce this ban, the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media also reportedlyplansto block certain virtual private networks (VPNs) that Russians widely use to bypass internet restrictions. The state-owned news agency RIA quoted the ministry on Sunday as saying that it could block certain “VPN services and VPN protocols” that an expert commission identifies as a “threat.” Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, it hasclamped downon independent and dissenting media voices, watchdogs have said. Hundreds of journalists have gone into exile as state censors have closed many respected independent media outlets and launched criminal cases against prominent journalists and regional bloggers. “After Russian tanks entered Ukraine, the authorities switched to a scorched-earth strategy that has turned Russia’s media landscape into a wasteland,” Amnesty International’s director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, Marie Struthers,saidin March 2022. Russian polling agencies have found that Putin’s approval rating remains high – even as much as 82 percent in October. He appears easily poised to win if he runs for re-election. Last week, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “I have no doubt that if he puts forward his candidacy, he will win confidently.”   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/14/russias-putin-imposes-new-curbs-on-election-reporting

Russia labels reports on troop movements in Ukraine ‘provocation’,,"Russia’s Ministry of Defence has called the publication by media about a regrouping of its troops in Ukraine a “provocation”. The ministry said that the reports by two state news agencies on Monday, discussing Russian troop movements in Ukraine, were “false”. The reports were quickly withdrawn after publication. “The transmission of a false report about the “regrouping” of troops in the Dnipro area, allegedly on behalf of the Russian Defence Ministry’s press centre, is a provocation,” the ministry said, according to the RBC news outlet. The reports, by the RIA Novosti and TASS agencies, had said that Russian troops were being moved to “more favourable positions” east of the Dnipro River in Ukraine. The Kremlin’s spokesperson declined to comment on the incident, which has been flagged as illustrating disarray among the military establishment regarding media work, saying it was a matter for the military. On Friday, Russia’s military said that its forces had thwarted a Ukrainian attempt to forge a bridgehead on the eastern bank of the Dnipro and on nearby islands. Last week, The US-based Institute for the Study of War said that Ukraine appeared to have conducted assaults across the Dnipro in Kherson region in mid-October, and noted that Russian military bloggers were reporting continued Ukrainian ground operations on the east bank. According to ISW’sassessmentas of November 12, while Russian forces conducted a limited series of missile strikes targeting southern Ukraine, “the Russian government is attempting to downplay the extent of its efforts to strengthen control over the Russian information space”. Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials say that Russian forces have ramped up attacks in eastern Ukraine in an attempt to gain ground near two key front line cities. “Toward Bakhmut, the Russians have become more active and are trying to recapture previously lost positions,” General Oleksandr Syrskyi wrote in a statement on the Telegram messaging app. “Enemy attacks are being repelled,” he added.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/13/russia-labels-report-on-military-regrouping-as-provocation

"Ukraine military officer had key role in Nord Stream sabotage, reports say",President Zelenskyy has denied Ukraine was behind blasts that cut off a major route for Russian gas exports to Europe.,"A Ukrainian special forces commander played a key role in sabotaging theNord Stream gas pipelinesin September last year, according to an investigation by two international newspapers. Mystery has surrounded who was behind the blasts that damaged the pipelines – which run from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea – cutting off a major route for Russian gas exports to Europe and heightening already high tensions overMoscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Different theories have emerged pointing the finger at Ukraine, Russia or the United States. All have denied involvement. A joint investigation by The Washington Post newspaper and German outlet Der Spiegel, published on Saturday, singled out Roman Chervinsky, a 48-year-old who served in Ukraine’s Special Operations Forces. The officer’s alleged role provides the most direct evidence to date tying Ukraine’s military and security leadership to the sabotage that spawned multiple criminal investigations. Chervinsky was the “coordinator”, the reports claimed, citing officials in Ukraine and elsewhere in Europe, as well as other people with knowledge of the operation, who spoke anonymously.    He oversaw logistics and support for a six-person team, which rented a sailing boat using false identities and diving equipment to place explosive charges on the pipelines, according to the Post. The blasts ruptured three of the four pipelines that make up Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2, spewing gas into the Baltic Sea, near Bornholm, Denmark. Russian energy giant Gazprom halted flows through Nord Stream 1, the main conduit for Russian natural gas to Germany, amid disputes over the war in Ukraine a month earlier. The newly completed Nord Stream 2 twin pipelines never opened as Berlin pulled the plug on the project days before Russian troops entered Ukraine on February 24, 2022. The Nord Stream attack hit civilian infrastructure built to provide energy to millions of people in Europe. Ukraine had long complained that Nord Stream would allow Russia to bypass Ukrainian pipes, depriving Kyiv of transit revenue. According to the report, Chervinsky did not act alone nor did he plan the operation. Instead, he took orders from more senior Ukrainian officials, who ultimately reported to General Valerii Zaluzhny, Ukraine’s highest-ranking military officer, it said. He denied any role in the sabotage through his lawyer. “All speculations about my involvement in the attack on Nord Stream are being spread by Russian propaganda without any basis,” he said in a statement to the Post and Der Spiegel. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly denied his country was behind the sabotage. “I would never do that,” he told Germany’s Bild newspaper in June, adding that he would “like to see proof”. But the Nord Stream operation was designed to keep Zelenskyy in the dark, the Post reported. The two media outlets said the Ukrainian government did not respond to requests for comment on their investigation. US and Western officials have called the act a dangerous attack on Europe’s energy infrastructure. Chervinsky is currently in jail in Kyiv on charges of allegedly abusing his power during an attempt to persuade a Russian pilot to defect in July 2022. He says his prosecution is political retribution for having criticised Zelenskyy, according to the reports. Russia alleged that Washington was behind the attack, with President Vladimir Putin dismissing the argument that Ukraine was behind the explosions.

"Ukraine’s Kyiv comes under attack for first time in months, mayor says",Strong explosions heard in the capital in first attack on the city since September.,"Ukraine’s Kyiv has come under attack for the first time in months, the city’s mayor has said, as large explosions were heard in the capital. “Strong explosions were heard on the left bank of the capital,” Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Saturday in a post on the Telegram messaging app, referring to the left bank of the Dnipro river. “Preliminary, air defence was working against ballistic (missiles).” There were no immediate reports of casualties. Two strong explosions were heard and trails were visible in the sky in central Kyiv on Saturday morning, AFP news agency reported, citing its journalists in the city. Air alerts for Kyiv and a nearby region were announced just minutes before the explosions were heard, and city authorities urged residents to stay in shelters. Saturday’s attacks were the first on Kyiv since September 21, when Ukrainian air defences downed a missile over the capital. Falling debris from the missile wounded seven people, including a child. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said earlier this week that Ukraine had deployed more Western air defence systems in anticipation of a second full winter of Russian attacks on energy facilities. Russian attacks last year hit Ukraine’s energy grid, leaving thousands without heating or electricity in freezing temperatures.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/11/ukraines-kyiv-comes-under-attack-for-first-time-in-months-mayor-says
Fighting rages on Ukraine front line as Russia goes on the offensive,Assaults on key town of Avdiivka continue as Putin visits Russian military headquarters for progress report on offensive.,"Russian forces have intensified their attacks on key points of the front line as they go on the offensive in Ukraine. Ukraine’s general staff reported late on Thursday that its military had repelled Russian assaults across the front earlier in the day, including around the strategic eastern towns of Avdiivka and Bakhmut as Moscow’s forces become more active following Kyiv’s counteroffensive over the summer. Ukrainian forces are reported to have repelled 11 attacks near Avdiivka, 15 in the Maryinka sector and 22 to the northeast in Bakhmut. Six attacks were repelled farther north near Kupiansk, the general staff said. As Moscow ramps up its offensive, President Vladimir Putin paid a surprise visit to Russia’s military headquarters for the campaign in Rostov-on-Don in southern Russia, the Kremlin said on Friday. The president surveyed plans and equipment on his second visit there in under a month. Russian troops have been bearing down on Avdiivka since mid-October. The industrial town’s position as a gateway to the provincial capital of Donetsk, 20km (12 miles) to the east makes it highly strategic. A press officer for Ukraine’s 3rd Separate Assault Brigade told the news outlet Espreso TV that Russian forces have been launching major infantry attacks. “It is not just infantry advancing but also parallel work of artillery, drones, aviation, the same air bombing and more,” he said. However, the officer said Russian forces have been unable to replenish supplies quickly and Ukrainian defensive positions were solid. The head of Avdiivka’s military administration told Espreso that Russian forces were shelling the town “round the clock” but wet ground from several days of rain was holding them back. “Once the ground dries, they will definitely advance,” he added. Russia’s Investigative Committee, in an account of the day’s fighting, said Ukrainian forces shelled the town of Skadovsk in a Russian-occupied area of the southern region of Kherson. The report said there were dead and wounded in the attack. Russia’s Ministry of Defence also reported strikes on Ukrainian troops and equipment near Bakhmut. Elsewhere, Ukraine’s military intelligence agency said on Friday that Ukrainian forces damaged two small Russian landing boats in Crimea during an overnight attack using sea drones. The statement said the vessels were crewed and loaded with armoured vehicles. The extent of the damage was not immediately clear. Meanwhile, the news agency RIA quoted Russia’s Defence Ministry as saying its air defences had brought down two Ukrainian drones over Crimea and one over the Tula region south of Moscow. Reports from both the Russian and Ukrainian sides could not be independently confirmed. As the fighting continues, Putin assessed the state of his country’s forces in Ukraine during his overnight visit to the Southern Military District headquarters in Rostov-on-Don. Video shared by a Russian state news agency showed him being greeted by Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu and Valery Gerasimov, chief of the general staff, late on Thursday. Putin was “introduced to new types of military equipment” and was informed about the progress of the war, his spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, according to the Russian state news agency Tass. The Russian president made the visit on the way back from a trip to Kazakhstan, where he aimed to cement ties with Russia’s former Soviet neighbour and major economic partner in the midst of tensions with the West over Ukraine.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/10/fighting-rages-on-ukraine-front-line-as-russia-goes-on-the-offensive
Ukraine sees NATO air technology as key to a breakthrough on the ground,"Air wars heat up over Ukraine as front-line battles hit a stalemate, while on the diplomatic front, the EU warms up to Kyiv.","Russia and Ukraine traded missile strikes in the 89th week of the war, using air power to overcome the perception that their forces on the ground had reached astalemate. “Russia controls the skies,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said during a news conference on November 4. Moscow had provided a reminder of that air superioritythe previous night, when it launched 40 Shahed drones against Ukraine, one of the largest salvoes in recent weeks. Ukraine said it shot down 24, but the remaining 16 struck critical infrastructure and civilian homes. Among the targets were a military facility in Ivano-Frankivsk and “infrastructure facilities” in Lviv and Odesa. Two nights later, Russia again showed its superior firepower with a combination of 22 Shahed drones and four missiles of various types. Ukraine said it shot down 15 drones and two of the missiles, but the general staff said the remainder destroyed port infrastructure in Odesa and civil infrastructure in Kherson city. That same night, Russia dropped 87 glide bombs into Kherson – the largest salvo of that munition so far in the war.  The worst strike came in broad daylight on November 3. More than 20 soldiers were reported killed by a Russian Iskander missile when ithit an award ceremonyfor the 128th Separate Assault Mountain Transcarpathian Brigade in Zaporizhia. “This is a tragedy that could have been avoided,” Zelenskyy said in a video address. Defence Minister Rustem Umerov ordered a full investigation. Ukraine, too, scored important successes in the air war. A Russian news outlet, Astra, said on November 1, four Ukrainian missiles hit a command post for the Dnipr group in the village of Strilkove, on the Arabat Spit off the east coast of Crimea, killing two soldiers and wounding three. Three days later, Ukraineseverely damageda Russian corvette while it lay in a shipyard in the port of Kerch. Later photographs showed it to be the Askold, a Karakurt-class Kalibr missile carrier. The Karakurt-class corvettes first went into construction in 2016 and are among Russia’s most modern, while the Zalyv shipyard, where the strike occurred, is one of three servicing the Black Sea Fleet. “The Zalyv shipyard is the largest shipyard in Eastern Europe and is likely the main repair facility for the [Black Sea Fleet] in Crimea following a successful Ukraine strike on the Russian state-owned ship repair facility Sevmorzavod in Sevastopol on September 13,” said the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank. The strike on the Askold “will likely render it inoperable for the foreseeable future”, the ISW said.  The Russian Ministry of Defence said Ukraine fired 15 missiles at the port, 13 of which had been shot down. There were other incidents that showed the high priority Ukraine placed on air strikes. Russian military reporters said Ukraine attacked Skadovsk in Kherson with missiles on the night of November 4 and struck the port of Berdyansk with Storm Shadow missiles on November 5. Russian sources also claimed that a salvo of Ukrainian drones targeting a railway in Crimea had been downed. All this air activity appeared to be trying to make up for the lack of any great movement on the ground. Ukrainian forces reported small gains near the eastern city of Bakhmut, which they are slowly trying to encircle, and a successful defence against a Russian attempt to encircle Avdiivka, to the south of Bakhmut. There was only one report of note – Russian military reporters said Ukraine had landed more troops on the left bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson and was operating a battalion-sized force of about 300 soldiers including armoured vehicles near the village of Krynky. There was much talk of stalemate during the week. Ukraine’s chief of staff kicked off the theme. “Just like in the First World War we have reached the level of technology that puts us into a stalemate,” Valery Zaluzhny was quoted as saying in an interview published alongside an article he wrote in The Economist. Zaluzhny said the Ukraine war was moving towards an attritional stage that benefited the side with deeper resources: “This will benefit Russia, allowing it to rebuild its military power, eventually threatening Ukraine’s armed forces and the state itself.” Both governments moved to erase the notion of stalemate. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied the war had reached a “dead end”, while Zelenskyy said, “Today time has passed and people are tired. But this is not a stalemate”, during a news conference with visiting European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen.  Reports suggest Ukraine’s soldiery is indeed exhausted from almost two years of constant fighting. Zaluzhny said that to break the stalemate Ukraine needed to gain control of the air. “Basic weapons, such as missiles and shells, remain essential. But Ukraine’s armed forces need key military capabilities and technologies to break out of this kind of war. The most important one is air power,” he wrote. Igor Girkin, the Russian commander who formed and led the separatist Donetsk militia in 2014, feared this Western superiority in air technology in an analysis dated October 26. Russian troops, too, are exhausted, he said, and unable to conduct “even limited offensive operations”, as evidenced in the failure of the Avdiivka offensive. “Our troops will have to spend the rest of the autumn-winter campaign on the defensive, trying to the best of their ability to eliminate emerging operational crises,” he wrote. “Worse, by the spring of next year, our active army will probably be even less capable of offensive operations than it is now, and the enemy will be seriously strengthened in military-technical terms, which will allow him to continue to try to control the strategic initiative.” Zelenskyy told the Reuters NEXT conference that Ukraine had a battle plan for next year that included “concrete directions where we can go”. Both sides were busy resupplying themselves with ordnance, but Ukraine also hopes for a qualitative leap by spring, when it expects to receive F-16 fighter jets from Western arsenals converting to the fifth-generation F-35. These, it hopes, supplied with US air-to-air missiles, will finally give it mastery of its airspace and an edge in the Black Sea. But the Ukrainian leader dismissed calls for a March 2024 election, when Russia is to hold one. Reuters quoted unnamed Russian sources as saying Putin has decided to run for a fifth presidential term. On November 6, Reuters quoted unnamed sources in the European Commission saying Von der Leyenwouldsupport inviting Ukraine to start EU membership talks at the December summit of the European Council. Ukraine expected a positive report from the Commission towards Council members, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Olha Stefanishyna said. “I would say that the assessment would definitely be positive because we have been in permanent contact with the European Commission, discussing the steps and negotiating the steps we managed to implement,” Stefanishyna told Reuters. She said Ukraine had carried out all seven steps deemed necessary for a positive invitation. Three days earlier, Von der Leyen had praised Ukraine for its progress towards EU-mandated reforms and said she was “confident” of Ukraine’s soon reaching the “next stage” of the process of accession. “I must say you have made excellent progress,” she told Zelenskyy during their joint news conference in Kyiv. There may also have been another convergence in the offing between Ukraine and Brussels. Ukraine’s deputy justice minister said European Union leaders were considering allowing the proceeds from frozen Russian assets to be used to assist Ukraine – a long-standing Ukrainian demand. Approximately $300bn in Russian assets were in European hands, and their proceeds amounted to $3.6bn since the war began, said Iryna Mudra.

Why are US Republicans pushing for aid to Israel but not Ukraine?,Experts say a fractured Republican Party is increasingly turning away from Ukraine in favour of support for Israel.,"As wars continue to rage in both Ukraine and Gaza, another battle is playing out in the United States Congress: over which country should receive aid money. In recent months, congressional Republicans have expressedincreasing scepticismtowards approving more funds for the government of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as his country seeks to repel afull-scale Russian invasion. But that opposition has grown since thestart of the Israel-Hamas waron October 7, with some Republicans positioning aid for Israel and Ukraine as an either-or proposition. “Israel is facing [an] existential threat. Any funding for Ukraine should be redirected to Israel immediately,” Republican Senator Josh Hawleyposted on social mediatwo days after the war began. Experts say that disparate approach — with stronger Republican backing for aidto Israelthan to Ukraine — signals the growing power of the party’s hard-right flank. “Omitting aid for Ukraine is a concession to the far right of the Republican Party,” Richard F Bensel, a government studies professor at Cornell University, told Al Jazeera. Ukraine, he added, “has neither the emotional appeal of a religious ally nor the geopolitical importance of Israel, and the differences between the two issues reflect deeper divisions within the Republican Party between secular rationalism and sectarian emotionalism”. The debate over foreign aid comes amid turmoil within the Republican caucus, which struggled last monthto elect a speakerto lead the House of Representatives. After weeks ofinternal fighting, religious conservativeMike Johnsonfinally won the gavel on October 25, in an apparent victory for hardline and evangelical interests. One of Johnson’s first moves was to introduce a bill that included nearly $14.5bn in support for Israel but zero dollars for Ukraine.It passedthe Republican-controlled House by a vote of 226 to 196, only to be shut down in the Democrat-led Senate on Tuesday. Robert Y Shapiro, a political science professor at Columbia University, said the failed bill points to the continued sway former President Donald Trump holds over the Republican Party. Trump is currently theRepublican frontrunnerin the 2024 presidential race. During his time in office, he championed an“America First” foreign policythat saw the US withdraw from certain international agreements, in favour of a more isolationist stance. “This [bill] is clearly a show for the Trump base of the Republican Party, which opposes anything related to Ukraine,” Shapiro said. Trump, he explained, has lingering resentment towardsUkraine. After all, questions over whether Trumpillegally withheld military aidto Ukraine led to hisfirst impeachment. And then there was Trump’s cosy relationship with Ukraine’s adversary,Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he praised on several occasions. Since leaving office, Trump has remained critical of aid to Ukraine. In campaign stops for his reelection bid, he called on Congress to cut off military assistance to the country, accusing it of paying “millions of dollars” to the “Biden crime family” — a reference to his Democratic rival,President Joe Biden. Trump is hardly the first leader to push for more isolationism in US foreign policy: The sentiment was particularly strong after World War I, as the country tried to disentangle itself from continued tensions in Europe. But Stephen Zunes, a professor of politics and international studies at the University of San Francisco, told Al Jazeera that isolationism is making a comeback. “Recent years have witnessed a growing segment of the Republican Party moving away from its more overtly imperialistic and interventionist foreign policy to a more isolationist foreign policy,” Zunes said. However, the strong Christian leanings in the Republican Party allow for a more easy embrace of aid requests for Israel. “An exception is made for Israel, in large part due to the strong influence of fundamentalist Christians who believe that the modern state of Israel is the manifestation of Biblical Israel and therefore is in God’s favour,” Zunes explained. Aid to Ukraine still hasprominent supportersamong the Republican Party, including Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell. He called for military assistance to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan to be packaged together, along with greater funds forUS border security. “We view all of these problems as connected,” McConnell told reporters at an October 31 press conference. But US views overall are shifting towards the war in Ukraine, with Republican voters in particular retreating from their initial support for the embattled country. AGallup pollreleased on November 2 found that 41 percent of Americans believe their country is “doing too much” to help Ukraine, up from 29 percent this June. The belief is most common among Republicans, 62 percent of whom agreed with that statement. Some experts point to the prevalence ofwar fatigueamong the American public. The war in Ukraine has stretched on for months since its start in February 2022, arriving at a seemingdeadlock. But the Israel-Hamas war is new. It was sparked on October 7 with asurprise attackfrom the Palestinian group Hamas, and it has continued over the last month with thesteady Israeli bombardmentof the Gaza Strip. The US public has responded with large-scale protests in favour of Israeli and Palestinian causes.One pro-Palestinian marchon Saturday brought thousands of people to Washington, DC, flooding Freedom Plaza. “Part of [the issue] is that newer conflicts will get more attention than ongoing conflicts,” Zunes said. “Another is that the Gaza War is more violent. Israel has killed more Palestinian civilians during the past month than Russia has killed Ukrainian civilians in the past 20 months.” Zunes also noted that Israel “plays an important role in advancing US strategic interests in the greater Middle East”, making support for the country more pressing. With withering Republican support for Ukraine, Democrats have largely helmed the push to bundle aid for the two countries together. In October, President Biden called on Congress to approve a$105bn supplemental funding request, which included $61.4bn for Ukraine and $14.3bn for Israel. But as Congress approaches its November 17 deadline to pass budget legislation — or else risk a government shutdown — experts suspect Biden’s funding request isunlikely to pass. What’s more, the 2024 presidential race is heating up, with polls showing Biden and Trump neck and neck. Foreign aid will likely be one of many flashpoints. “We won’t see a compromise between Democrats and Republicans,” Shapiro, the Columbia professor, told Al Jazeera. “The Republicans will almost certainly ultimately come together in opposing all things Democratic in the 2024 election.” Bensel, meanwhile, spoke to the increasingpolarisationacross the political landscape. Not only does theRepublican-controlled Housebutt heads with the president’s agenda, but it is also at odds with theDemocratic majorityin the Senate. “The disagreements between the administration and the House of Representatives — and between the two chambers of Congress — are clearly driven by the very serious partisan divisions in the nation at large,” Bensel said. That political impasse is not necessarily new, he added. “What is abnormal is the apparently irreconcilable split within the Republican Party in the House of Representatives.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/8/why-are-us-republicans-pushing-for-aid-to-israel-but-not-ukraine
Ukraine says Russia struck civilian ship near Odesa,"A missile has hit a civilian vessel in the Black Sea region, killing one and injuring four, the army says.","Russia has fired a missile at a Liberia-flagged civilian ship entering a port in the Black Sea region ofOdesa, according to the Ukrainian army. A harbour pilot was killed and four of the ship’s crew were injured in the attack on Wednesday. “The missile hit the structure of a civilian vessel flying the Liberian flag as it was entering the port,” the army said. “Three crew members, citizens of the Philippines, were injured, one of them was hospitalised. The pilot was killed and another port worker was injured,” it added. Since a United Nations-brokered deal guaranteeing safe passage for civilian shipsfell through in July, both Kyiv and Moscow have ramped up military activity and attacks in the Black Sea. “Continuing the terror of civilian shipping, the enemy insidiously fired an Kh-31P anti-radar missile in the direction of one of the ports of Odesa region from tactical aircraft in the Black Sea,” the Ukrainian army said. The collapse of the UN-backed grain export dealprompted Moscow to warnthat any ships entering Ukrainian ports could be viewed as potential military targets. Ukraine subsequently announced the launch of a new “humanitarian corridor” – a sea route for civilian ships – that avoids international waters. But Russia has continued to attack Ukraine’s grain-exporting ports and infrastructure. EU membership prospects On Wednesday, the European Union’s executiverecommendedopening formal membership talks with Ukraine, as soon as it meets final conditions, in a major show of support for Kyiv in itsbattle against Russia. “This is a strong and historic step that paves the way to a stronger EU with Ukraine as its member,” Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyposted on social media. Zelenskyy also said that Ukraine would still try to deliver battlefield results by the end of the year and that he remained sure Kyiv would eventually have success in the war despite difficulties at the front. Acknowledging the slow progress of Kyiv’s counteroffensive in the occupied south, in an interview by video link at the Reuters NEXT conference in New York, he also touted a Ukrainian battlefield plan for 2024 that he said he could not disclose. His tone contrasted with the gloomier assessment last week of his commander-in-chief who said the fighting now in its 21st month might be heading towards a deadlock and a war of attrition that could play into Russia’s hands.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/8/ukraine-says-russia-struck-civilian-ship-near-odesa
Russia turns to buybacks to resupply forces deployed in Ukraine: WSJ,"The Wall Street Journal reports that Russia is engaging in export requisitions and buybacks to boost its depleting arsenal, as it continues its invasion of Ukraine.","Russia is trying to get back parts of defence systems it had exported in an attempt to restock for its invasion of Ukraine, the Wall Street Journal hasreported. In an article published on Wednesday, the US-based newspaper reported – citing three people with knowledge of the encounter – that Russian officials visited Cairo in April and asked Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to return more than 100 engines from Russian helicopters. The sources claimed Sisi gave the green light and the deliveries will likely begin in December. An Egyptian government spokesman declined to comment to the WSJ. Al Jazeera was not able to independently verify the claims. Cairo has maintained some arms trade ties with Russia, to which the US has acquiesced. According to the newspaper, Moscow has also contacted Pakistani, Belarusian and Brazilian officials to try to recover engines and transport helicopters its forces lost to Ukrainian defences early on in the war. “Russia spent decades building its arms trade,” one source said, according to the WSJ. “Now they’re going back in secret to their customers trying to buy back what they sold them.” As well as buying back weapons, Russia is understood to be stepping up domestic production. Russian officials have rejected repeated Western claims its supplies are shrinking and steered clear of announcing specifics regarding its arsenal and domestic production. The war in Ukraine began on February 24, 2022, and has claimed tens of thousands of lives – mostly soldiers on both sides, devastated the country, and sent diplomatic ties between the West and Moscow to historic lows. WSJ reporter Evan Gershkovich is currently detained in Russia, accused of spying. He and his paper deny the allegations. In its report on Wednesday, the WSJ also alleged that Russia has received more munitions from partners, including North Korea – aclaimmade earlier this month by South Korea and denied by Pyongyang. Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Russia officiallypulled outof the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE), an international security pact that restricts the use of conventional weapons, saying NATO’s expansion has made such cooperation impossible. As for Ukraine’s weapons supplies, military analysts have said Kyiv’s counteroffensive has so far failed because the West is failing to send arms in an efficient manner. “Strategic objectives have not been achieved this year, and it’s hardly possible” in the remaining months, Lieutenant General Ihor Romanenko, former deputy chief of the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, told Al Jazeera.

Ukraine gets European Commission nod to start EU membership talks,Ukraine’s president hails move as ‘strong and historic step’ that paves way to a stronger EU.,"The European Union’s executive has recommended opening formal membership talks with Ukraine, as soon as it meets final conditions, in a major show of support for Kyiv in itsbattle against Russia. “This is a strong and historic step that paves the way to a stronger EU with Ukraine as its member,” Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyposted on social media on Wednesday. “Our country must be in the European Union. Ukrainians deserve it both for their defence of European values and for the fact that even in times of full-scale war, we keep our word,” he said. The European Commission, which also paved the way for discussions to begin with Moldova, recommended that the talks should formally be launched once Ukraine satisfies remaining conditions related to reining in corruption, adopting a law on lobbying in line with EU standards and strengthening national minority safeguards. “Today is a historic day,” commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. “Ukraine continues to face tremendous hardship and tragedy provoked by Russia’s war of aggression, and yet the Ukrainians are deeply reforming their country.” Ukraine launched its bid to become part of the EU after Moscow’s invasion in February 2022 and was officially named a candidate to join in June that year. Former Soviet republicMoldovahad applied at the same time as Ukraine. Moldovan President Maia Sandu thanked Brussels and said her country was “firmly on the path for EU membership and we will continue working relentlessly towards this goal”. The EU’s 27 leaders still have to sign off on the recommendations at a summit in December, and the membership process is contingent upon the completion of required reforms with regular progress assessments as part of a long and vigorous process. Brussels also suggested member states grantGeorgiacandidate status. “I rejoice with the people of Georgia,” Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili wrote online. Balkan country Bosnia and Herzegovina did not get approval yet again, having come short on expected membership criteria, von der Leyen said. Other EU hopefuls includeTurkey, which began accession talks in 2005, but those are at a dead end. Albania, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia are also stuck in negotiations. Thewar in Ukrainehas breathed new life into the EU’s stalled push to take on new members as the bloc looks to keep Russian and Chinese influence at bay. The commission in June last year set Kyiv seven reform benchmarks to complete, including tackling corruption and curbing oligarch power, before talks should start. Von der Leyen said Ukraine had now completed “well over 90 percent of the necessary steps”. The positive signal from the EU provides a vital boost to Ukraine at a difficult time. However, whether EU countries will be ready by December to approve the talks with the war-torn country of more than 40 million people is uncertain.

G7 ‘united’ on Ukraine as Russia warns over Western ‘aggression’,The G7 hopes to assure Ukraine of support amid the Gaza war as Russia says Western policies endanger the world.,"TheGroup of Seven(G7) has reiterated its unwavering support for Ukraine as the Israel-Hamas conflict threatens to take the focus off Russia’s invasion. However, Moscow remains defiant, claiming that Western “aggression” risks global catastrophe. The foreign ministers of the leading industrial democracies said on Wednesday that they had gathered in Japan seeking to “speak … with one clear voice” and forge a consensus amid two serious conflicts and other crises around the world. “Our steadfast commitment to supporting Ukraine’s fight for its independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity will never waver … we further call on China not to assist Russia in its war against Ukraine,” the ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union, said in a statement. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned that amid the war in Gaza, his country’s continuing defence against the Russian invasion must not slip out of focus. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba joined the G7 meeting by video conference. With the war approaching its third year, Ukraine is braced for a Russian winter offensivetargeting energy infrastructure, with more than 60 attacks in recent weeks, Ukraine’s energy ministry said. The Kremlin, meanwhile, warned on Wednesday that the West’s aggressive behaviour could lead to catastrophe. Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev said that the “destructive” policies of the United States and its allies were increasing the risk that nuclear, chemical or biological weapons would be used. “The natural consequence of the United States’ destructive policies is the deterioration in the global security,” Patrushev said, according to state news agency TASS. “The risk that nuclear, chemical and biological weapons will be used is increasing,” Patrushev said. “The internationalarms control regime has been undermined,” he added, claiming that Ukraine had tried to attack three Russian nuclear power plants. “We have a doctrine where everything is clearly spelled out. There are no changes. This is confirmed by the president,” Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov said when asked to clarify Patrushev’s remarks. Patrushev also warned of a wider Western colonial agenda, claiming that more countries are falling victim to Western exploitation. The opening of formal EU membership talks was recommended for Moldova and Ukraine on Wednesday, with Georgia to be awarded candidate status. Patrushev said Moldova is “on a path to lose its sovereignty and risks becoming another victim of Western colonialism”. Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also joined the criticism, accusing the West of provoking crises in the global markets. He blamed boycotts on Russian energy and a self-serving rush to switch to green energy for hurting global energy security. Meanwhile, he reported that efforts to renegotiate the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which allowed Ukrainian exports by sea, have broken down again. The deal, brokered by the United Nations and Turkey last year, allowed Ukraine to safely export grain and deliver much-needed grain all over the world. However, Russia withdrew in July, saying the arrangement was not delivering grain to the poorest countries, and discriminated against its own exports of grain and fertiliser. Since the deal was scrapped, Russia has concentrated fire on Ukrainian grain storage and port facilities.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/8/russia-defiant-against-colonialist-west
Car bomb kills Russia-backed politician in east Ukraine,Mikhail Filiponenko had been engaged in Luhansk’s pro-Russian separatist movement since 2014.,"Ukraine said it carried out a special operation to kill a Russia-backed politician who died as a car bomb exploded in eastern Ukraine. The assassination is the latest in a series of attacks against separatists and Moscow-installed officials in the Ukrainian regions to which the Kremlin lays claim. Mikhail Filiponenko, a deputy in the Russia-backed parliament in occupied Luhansk, was killed on Wednesday after an “explosive device detonated” in his car, his son told the Luhansk Information Centre news agency. Filiponenko, who had been engaged in Luhansk’s pro-Russian separatist movement since 2014, previously acted as one of the top commanders in the army of the so-called Luhansk People’s Republic. In September, he was voted into the regional assembly in a poll that sparked broad international condemnation. Ukraine’s military intelligence agency said it conducted the operation with resistance forces in Luhansk. “A special operation to eliminate Filiponenko was implemented jointly with representatives of the resistance movement. As a result of the morning explosion, Filiponenko died on the spot,” it said on the messaging app Telegram. Luhansk is one of four Ukrainian regions Russia said it annexed last year, despite not exerting full military control in the areas. Russian media shared photos of what they said was Filiponenko’s battered vehicle on the side of the road, with traces of blood on the seats. ☠️🧨 Explosão em carro mata ex-comandante da Milícia Popular de Lugansk Mikhail Filiponenko, deputado do Conselho da RPL, ex-comandante da Milícia Popular da república, morreu em resultado de uma explosão em seu carro, esclareceu o Centro de Informações de Lugansk.pic.twitter.com/kqrpch00hA — Sputnik Brasil (@sputnik_brasil)November 8, 2023  Several high-profile backers of Russia’s assault on Ukraine and Moscow-installed officials in territory seized by Russian forces have been attacked since the conflict started last February. Last month Oleg Tsaryov, a pro-Kremlin politician that Moscow was reportedly prepping to head a pro-Russian government in Kyiv, survived being shot in his hotel complex on the annexed peninsula of Crimea. Moscow has accused Ukrainian secret services of carrying out that and several other attacks, including the car bombing of nationalist Darya Dugina outside Moscow last year and the bombing of military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky in a Saint Petersburg cafe in April. Kyiv has given no immediate comment after Wednesday’s bombing. Russia and Ukraine have been locked in a bloody 20-month war since Moscow sent troops to invade the neighbouring country in February 2022.

‘Strategic objectives not achieved’: Has Ukraine’s counteroffensive failed?,Ukraine hoped to unleash punishing counterattacks on invading Russian troops. Experts explain why the push did not live up to expectations.,"Kyiv, Ukraine –Referring to the Soviet puzzle video game, Alla says her husband kills Russian soldiers as though he is playing “human Tetris”. “A drone hangs in the sky, and he watches [them] crawl across the forest,” she told Al Jazeera. “And he kills them. And then they crawl again.” The war in Ukraine has turned Avdiivka, where Alla’s husband is stationed, into a maze of ruins, trenches and tunnels surrounded by burned-down fields and patches of forest studded with landmines, explosion craters and remnants of Russian soldiers and armoured vehicles. Avdiivka sits 20km (12 miles) north of separatist Donetsk, wedged deep into occupied areas. Ukraine has held it since 2014. But it is nearly surrounded, and Ukrainian forces may have to leave it after weeks of bombardment with 500kg (1,100-pound) gliding bombs and storms that killed thousands on both sides. The surrender may become a sobering, pessimistic end of this year’s counteroffensive campaign, that began in June along the crescent-shaped, 1,000km-long (621-mile) front line in eastern and southern Ukraine. Last year, Ukrainian forces liberated almost 75,000 sq km (30,000 sq miles), an area the size of the United Arab Emirates, according to the Institute for the Study of War, a think tank in Washington, DC. Kyiv had said it wanted to reach the Sea of Azov to cut the “land bridge” between the Russian mainland and annexed Crimea. But Russian forces spent months building defence lines and planting thousands of landmines across no-man’s land. They also rule the air and airwaves with their planes, Lancet kamikaze drones, and radio-jamming systems that paralyse and disorient Ukrainian unmanned vehicles. Meanwhile, the F-16 fighter jets the West pledged to supply will take months to arrive – and their future pilots will spend many more months on training. So far this year, Kyiv has lost some 487 square kilometres (188 sq miles), according to a calculation by The New York Times published in late September. The results are disappointing due to several factors, military analysts say. “Strategic objectives have not been achieved this year, and it’s hardly possible” in the remaining months, Lieutenant General Ihor Romanenko, former deputy chief of the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, told Al Jazeera. He blamed Western allies for months-long delays of weaponry and a reluctance to supply more sophisticated arms. “Weaponry should be supplied on time, not the way our allies are doing it,” he said. Ukrainian “generals asked [for certain arms] a year ago, but they still didn’t supply even the types of arms that had been agreed upon.” Ukrainian top brass have long complained about the delays that Western officials say are caused by logistical hurdles. Meanwhile, the war has morphed into WWI-like positional warfare that exhausts both sides in terms of manpower and economy. “This is not our war because resources-wise, economically, Russia looks stronger and has a four-fold advantage in manpower,” Romanenko said. Russia’s population stands at 143 million, but millions of Ukrainian nationals live in annexed Crimea and other occupied areas of eastern and southern Ukraine. Ukraine’s current population is between 29 and 33 million, according to different estimates. And even though men aged 18 to 60 are not allowed to leave Ukraine, and several waves of mobilisation had hundreds of thousands drafted, heavy losses have bled Ukrainian forces dry. “Obviously, there isn’t enough manpower,” Romanenko said. He said there should be tougher measures to register all men of fighting age and classify them according to their fitness for combat. Meanwhile, some younger Ukrainians dodge the draft any way they can. “I got a summons, it was stuck in my [apartment] door,” Boris, a 21-year-old university student in Kyiv, told Al Jazeera. “I have kept it there for two months so that it looks like no one lives in the apartment.” Ukraine’s commander-in-chief reportedly admitted that the counteroffensive had reached a “stalemate”. “Just like in the first world war we have reached the level of technology that puts us into a stalemate,” he told The Economist on November 1. “There will most likely be no deep and beautiful breakthrough.” Nikolay Mitrokhin, of Germany’s Bremen University, told Al Jazeera that Ukraine paid too dearly, with Western-supplied arms spent during “meaningless” frontal assaults on enemy lines. “A part of Western equipment burned down in meaningless attempts to break through that ended with the liberation of half a dozen ruined villages.” The counteroffensive brought with it huge casualties among Ukrainian servicemen – especially the Western-trained units that were withdrawn from the eastern towns ofBakhmutand Soledar – Russia’s last sizeable territorial gains last year. While there are no reliable official figures of casualties, tens of thousands of soldiers on both sides are understood to have been killed in the war this year. “Russian defence ground down the attack brigades that had been trained for at least six months and for whose salvation Bakhmut and Soledar were abandoned,” Mitrokhin said. Meanwhile, the Kremlin managed to avoid the collapse of Russia’s economy. “Russia has used comprehensive stimuli of investment, credit and budget – from affordable mortgages to the military-industrial complex,” Kyiv-based analyst Alexey Kushch told Al Jazeera. Moscow’s strategy of affordable credits and “replacing import” in response to Western sanctions triggered the mushrooming of domestic businesses, he said. In comparison with Russia, Ukraine’s economy is “hanging by a thread of foreign aid”, Kushch said. “There are no programmes of internal development, monetary policies are aimed at restriction of domestic credits,” he said. The economic backbone of Russia is hydrocarbon exports, and it can only be broken if the “entire world will stop buying Russian oil and gas,” said Sergey Bizyukin, an exiled opposition activist from the western city of Ryazan. “And yes, defence factories in Ryazan, where the technological base has traditionally been strong, work at a full throttle, and there’s only a lack of workforce,” he told Al Jazeera. But regardless of how small Kyiv’s gains are, they “shouldn’t be underestimated” – in the words of Rybar, a pro-Russian Telegram channel with 1.2m subscribers. Ukrainian forces are expanding their toehold on the left bank of the Dnipro river in the southern Kherson region, a gateway to Crimea, it said. Supported by swarms of drones, Ukrainians ferried armoured vehicles and some 300 servicemen to the village of Krynki earlier this month, Rybar said. “Krynki is ours,” Ukrainian war veteran Yevgen Dikyi said in televised remarks.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/7/russia-looks-stronger-and-has-a-four-fold-advantage-in-manpower
Blinken seeks G7 unity on Israel-Hamas war,"Top diplomats of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, the US and the EU are gathering amid two serious conflicts.","After a whirlwind tour of the Middle East, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has shifted his intense diplomacy on theIsrael-Hamas warto Asia with an appeal for the Group of Seven (G7) leading industrial democracies to forge consensus on how to deal with the crisis. As he and his G7 counterparts began two days of talks in Japan, Blinken said it was important for the group to show unity – as it has over Russia’s war in Ukraine and other major issues – and prevent existing differences on Gaza from deepening. “This is a very important moment as well for the G7 to come together in the face of this crisis and to speak, as we do, with one clear voice,” Blinken told Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa, shortly after talks with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. The devastating monthlong conflict in Gaza and efforts to ease the dire humanitarian impacts of the Israeli assault will be a major focus of the meeting. Yet with the Russia-Ukraine war, fears North Korea may be readying a new nuclear test, and concerns about China’s increasing global assertiveness, it is far from the only crisis on the agenda. In Tokyo, Blinken and foreign ministers from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and Italy will be seeking common ground in part to prevent the Gaza war from further destabilising already shaky security in the broader Middle East and seeking to maintain existing positions on other matters. Israel, after a surprise attack on October 7 by Hamas – the group that rules Gaza, and that on October 7 and in its aftermath killed more than 1,400 people in Israel – has waged a monthlong assault on Gaza, relentlessly bombarding the enclave and sending in ground forces for the first time since 2014. Israeli attacks have during this timekilledmore than 10,000 Palestinians, more than a third of them children, according to Gaza’s officials, while displacing 1.5 million people and decimating much of the territory’s infrastructure.    An early consensus on Gaza appeared to be building as at least four of the G7 members made statements in favour of a strong common stance. Kishida said “the unity of G7 is needed more than ever with the situation in Israel and Palestine, the situation in Ukraine, and the challenges in the Indo-Pacific region,” his office said in a statement, adding that the prime minister “highly appreciates the leadership and diplomatic efforts by the Biden administration concerning this issue”. “You have our utmost support,” Kamikawa told Blinken, the top diplomat in the administration of United States President Joe Biden. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said that “as G7 countries, we are making clear that Israel has the right and the duty to protect its population and its people in the framework of international law”. She said that she has been discussing with many partners “how we can finally get humanitarian ceasefires off the ground, in terms of time and also geographically”. United Kingdom Foreign Secretary James Cleverly told journalists his government only supports a time and geographically specific “humanitarian pause” and not a wider ceasefire. “Firstly, we have seen and heard absolutely nothing that makes us believe that Hamas leadership is serious about [a] ceasefire,” he said, adding that a ceasefire would hamper Israel’s ability to defend itself. The US has provided firm backing to Israel, offering it a $14.5bnmilitary aid packageamid the war and voting with it against a “humanitarian truce” at the United Nations General Assembly last month. France voted in favour of the “humanitarian truce” while all other G7 member countries abstained. Blinken has said Washington is working “very aggressively” to expand aid for trapped civilians in Gaza. “I think we will see in the days ahead that the assistance can expand in significant ways,” Blinken said on Monday, without providing details. Another focus of the G7 meet-up will be Russia’s war in Ukraine, which has lost global attention due to the bloodshed in Gaza. The G7 was expected to stick to firm language condemning Moscow and reaffirm its commitment to Ukraine. “Our commitment to continue strict sanctions against Russia and strong support for Ukraine has not wavered at all, even as the situation in the Middle East intensifies,” Japan’s FM Kamikawa told a news conference before the meeting. The gathering will include a virtual meeting with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. The G7 has been at the forefront of sanctions on Russia since Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. In the latest move aimed at ramping up economic pressure on Russia, the group is considering proposals to impose sanctions on Russian diamonds. UK Foreign Secretary Cleverly is set to meet Kamikawa on the sidelines of the gathering to discuss intensifying military cooperation with Japan under a new pact that allows their countries’ militaries to enter each other’s territories for joint exercises. These talks, also featuring UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps and Japan’s Defence Minister Minoru Kihara, are likely to include expanding joint exercises and cooperation in new areas such as space and cybersecurity, based on the Japan-UKHiroshima Accordreached in May. Japan in December announced a new mid- to long-term security strategy to build up its security and defence – including counterstrike capability – in a significant shift from its self-defence-only principle adopted after the last world war. Foreign ministers of five Central Asian countries are also expected to participate online in the Tokyo gathering, as the grouping aims to deepen ties to the region amid the Ukraine war. Ministers of former Soviet nations Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan will join for talks on Wednesday. G7 leaders have recently increased outreach to these resource-rich countries, with French President Emmanuel Macronmaking stopsin Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan last week during his Central Asia tour, and Japanese PM Kishida planning a similar trip in 2024.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/7/g7-foreign-ministers-hold-talks-in-japan-israel-gaza

Ukraine’s Zelenskyy says war complicates plans for 2024 elections,The Ukrainian president says talk of polls is ‘irresponsible’ while the country is fighting a Russian invasion.,"Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyysays discussions about the fate of scheduled 2024 elections are irresponsible as the country is locked in a war with invading Russian forces. Speaking in a video address on Monday, Zelenskyy said Ukraine must remain focused on itsmilitary challengesand stay united. “We all understand that now, in wartime, when there are many challenges, it is utterly irresponsible to engage in topics related to an election in such a frivolous manner,” Zelenskyy said. “We need to recognise that this is a time for defence, a time for battle, upon which the fate of the state and its people depend. … I believe that elections are not appropriate at this time.”    Ukraine is currently undermartial lawas it battles Russian forces, whom Kyiv hopes to expel from its territory. But as the war drags on, Zelenskyy has considered whether a special provision could be invoked to hold elections. Over the weekend, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the president was considering the positives and negatives of holding elections during a time when large swathes of the country remain affected by fighting. As Ukraine battles to maintain the support of Western allies such as the United States, some, such as US Senator Lindsey Graham, have called for the elections to proceed as planned to demonstrate Ukraine’s commitment to democracy.

Russia bombards Ukrainian grain port Odesa,,"Russian forces have bombarded Ukraine’s port city of Odesa with missiles and drones. Four missiles and 22 attack drones were launched from the occupied region of Crimea of Ukraine at the Black Sea port late on Sunday, Ukraine’s air force reported on Monday. The attacks injured at least eight people, destroyed grain, and damaged the 124-year-old Odesa Fine Arts Museum. “Fifteen Shaheds and one Kh-59 air guided missile were shot down,” the Ukrainian air force said, referring to the Iranian-designed kamikaze unmanned aerial vehicle. Ukrainian Presidential Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak posted images on social media of the aftermath of the strike, vowing retribution for the attack. “This is their despicable answer to the reality – the Ukrainian Crimea will be demilitarised, without the Black Sea fleet and military bases of the Russians,” he said. Ukraine has recently ramped up strikes on the Russian naval base at Sevastopol. Meanwhile, Russian air attacks have intensified in recent weeks, with infrastructure a particular target ahead of the winter. Odesa, Ukraine’s main grain port, has also been targeted since earlier in the year when Moscow pulled out of a deal that allowed Ukrainian grain exports through the Black Sea. Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said 20 residential buildings, the Odesa Fine Arts Museum and infrastructure facilities were damaged. A warehouse and trucks with grain caught fire, which was promptly extinguished. The museum, where walls and windows were damaged, housed before the war more than 10,000 pieces of art, including paintings by some of the best-known Russian and Ukrainian artists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. “On November 6, the Odesa National Art Museum turns 124 years old,” Oleh Kiper, governor of the Odesa region, of which the Odesa city is the administrative centre, said on the Telegram messaging app. “On the eve of November 6, the Russians ‘congratulated’ our architectural monument with a missile that hit nearby.” Eight people were injured during the attack.

Ukraine orders investigation after Russian attack on brigade ceremony,President Volodymyr Zelenskyy promises ‘complete truth’ after at least 20 soldiers killed in Russian missile attack.,"Ukraine has begun a criminal investigation after a group of soldiers attending an “award ceremony” not far from the front line in the southern Zaporizhia region were killed in a Russian missile attack. At least 20 soldiers were reported to have been killed in the incident on Friday in Zarichne, according to local media. Zaporizhia Governor Yuriy Malashko said nine civilians were also injured in the attack on the village, which is about 16km (10 miles) from the front line. “This is a tragedy that could have been avoided,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in aspeechlate on Sunday. “A criminal investigation has been registered into the tragedy,” he added, saying the intention was to uncover the “complete truth” about what happened to ensure such incidents were not repeated. The Ukrainian Armed Forces confirmed on Saturday that several soldiers from its 128th Mountain Assault Brigade had been killed in a missile strike the day before, but did not provide casualty figures. “[Russia] fired an Iskander-M missile at the personnel of the 128th Mountain Assault Brigade, killing the soldiers and causing injuries of varying severity to local residents,” the army said. Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said in a social media statement the same day that he had ordered a “full investigation” into what had happened. Zelenskyy said Umerov had briefed him on the measures taken to clarify the circumstances of the attack, who was specifically involved and what orders were given. The New York Times, citing a military official who was not named because they were not authorised to speak to the media, said that any investigation was likely to focus on how Russia had found out about the event and been enabled to attack it. By holding the ceremony in the open, senior brigade members appeared to have breached military regulations, the official added. One Ukrainian soldier said on social media that 22 people from the brigade had been killed, criticising commanders for having held the ceremony. The event was organised to commemorate Artillery Day, which took place on Friday. “Everyone is writing that ‘Heroes died’. Although it is more appropriate to write ‘Heroes became victims’,” soldier Ivan Savytskyy said. “They became victims of military rudimentary traditionalism in its worst form,” he said. In its daily updates on battlefield developments, the Russian defence ministry said only that Russian forces had “inflicted fire” on a unit of Ukraine’s assault brigade in Zaporizhia, killing as many as 30 soldiers.    Russia and Ukraine have often underestimated their own military casualties in the 20-month-long war and exaggerated the losses they claim to have inflicted on each other. Ukraine’s western Zakarpattia region, where the 128th assault brigade is based, will observe a three-day mourning period from Monday, local Governor Viktor Mykyta said. “Our heroes are alive as long as the memory of them and their deeds lives on,” he said. Amid little apparent movement along the nearly 1,000km (620 mile) front line, Zelenskyy hasrejectedsuggestions that the conflict is at a deadlock, urging allies to continue their support even as theIsrael-Gaza wardraws increasing attention. In his statement on Sunday, Zelenskyy sought to reassure Ukrainians about the conflict. “When we go through weeks like this, filled with pain and difficult discussions, it is important for people to understand that what weighs on their hearts is seen, and the necessary changes will be made,” the president said. “This applies to many things, from negligence that can occur to the Soviet legacy and the terrible bureaucracy that prevents Ukraine and many in our defence forces from realising their potential correctly and effectively.” Zelenskyy promised that the investigation into the attack would provide “honest answers” for the soldiers’ families as well as the wider Ukrainian society.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/6/ukraine-orders-investigation-after-russian-attack-on-brigade-ceremony

Ukraine military says it hit Zalyv shipyard in Russian-annexed Crimea,Crimea’s Russian-installed chief says downed missile fragments had hit a dry dock and that there were no casualties.,"Ukraine’s armed forces said they hit marine and port infrastructure at a shipyard in the port city of Kerch on the eastern coast ofRussian-occupied Crimea. Since launching itscounteroffensiveagainst Moscow’s forces this summer, Kyiv has ramped up attacks on theBlack Sea peninsulathat Russia seized in 2014. The peninsula’s Russian-installed chief said on Saturday that downed missile fragments had hit a dry dock and that there were no casualties. Ukraine had “implemented successful strikes on marine and port infrastructure of the ‘Zalyv’ factory in the temporarily occupied city of Kerch,” the Department for Strategic Communications of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said in a Telegram post, giving no further details. “I hope another ship has followed theMoskva!” Mykola Oleshchuk, commander of Ukraine’s Air Force, said in a Telegram post, referring to the Russian Black Sea Fleet flagship sunk by Ukrainian missiles on April 14, 2022. Oleshchuk said cruise missiles struck the infrastructure at Zalyv – which is now named BE Butoma – “where one of the most modern Russian Navy ships was stationed, a Kalibr cruise missile carrier”. He said he was “awaiting official confirmation of the results”. Sergei Aksyonov, the Russian-installed governor of Crimea, said air defence systems had been in action around a Kerch shipyard named after BE Butoma. “Fragments of downed missiles fell onto territory of one of the dry docks,” Aksyonov said in a Telegram post. “There were no casualties.” Meanwhile, Russian news agencies cited the Russian Ministry of Defence confirming that Ukraine hit a shipyard in Kerch with 15 cruise missiles, damaging one ship. It added that air defence systems destroyed 13 of the Ukraine-launched missiles. The Reuters and AFP news agencies said it was not possible to verify the Russian and Ukrainian statements, nor social media posts including videos of missile activity as well as fire and smoke that the posts said was rising from the same location the Ukrainian military mentioned. Military analyst and journalist Andriy Tsaplienko said in a Telegram post that one of Russia’s most modern ships, a small cruise missile carrier launched in 2021, the Askold, was damaged in the attack, according to what he described as preliminary information.

Ukraine’s Zelenskyy denies war with Russia at ‘stalemate’,"The Ukrainian leader says the war between Israel and Hamas has drawn attention away from them, adding that is ‘Russia’s goal’.","President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has denied thatUkraine’s war with Russiahad reached a “stalemate”, pushing back at suggestions Western leaders were lobbying for peace talks. The sprawling front line between the two warring sides has barely moved in almost a year, with one senior Ukrainian official warning this week that the conflict was deadlocked. “Time has passed, people are tired … But this is not a stalemate,” Zelenskyy told a news conference on Saturday in Kyiv with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The Ukrainian leader also rejected the idea that Western countries were putting pressure on Kyiv to enter negotiations with Russia, amid reports US and EU officials had discussed what such talks would entail. “No one among our partners is pressuring us to sit down with Russia, talk to it, and give it something,” he said. Such pressure existed before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and at the beginning of the fighting, but “today, none of the EU leaders or the US are putting pressure on me to sit down with Russia, negotiate and give Russia anything. There will be no such thing,” he added. Zelenskyy expressed irritation at media reports about pressure to negotiate, saying he had no idea where those claims came from. At the same time, he emphasised that he would always act in accordance with the will of the Ukrainian people. With the war now in its 20th month and Ukraine struggling to gain ground in its counteroffensive, Zelenskyy has routinely met Western leaders in a bid to stave off fatigue with the conflict. Zelenskyy said thewar between Israel and Hamashad also drawn attention away from Ukraine, and said that this was “Russia’s goal”. “Of course, it’s clear that the war in the Middle East, this conflict, is taking away the focus,” Zelenskyy said. “We have already been in very difficult situations when there was almost no focus on Ukraine,” he said, but added, “I am absolutely sure we will overcome this challenge.” Ukraine’s backers, including the United States, have maintained they are ready to support Kyiv with military and financial support for as long as it takes to defeat Russia.

Ukrainian shelling kills 9 in occupied south: Russia-installed officials,Moscow-appointed governor says attack in southern Kherson left nine dead and nine others ‘badly injured’.,"Ukrainian forces have killed at least nine people and wounded nine others in strikes on the Russian-occupied part of the southern Kherson region, the region’s Russia-installed authorities have said. The strikes on Friday struck an employment centre in Chaplynka, a town about 100 kilometres (62 miles) southeast of the regional capital Kherson, the region’s Moscow-appointed Governor Vladimir Saldo said. “As of now, nine dead have been pulled out from under the rubble as well as nine who are badly injured,” Saldo was quoted as saying by Russian state television. Moscow-backed official Konstantin Basyuk accused Kyiv of attacking civilian infrastructure in Chaplynsky, including the local pensions office and jobs centre. Ukrainian officials and Ukrainian media have not confirmed the attacks. Al Jazeera could not independently confirm the strikes or any resulting casualties or damage. Russia captured the Kherson region shortly after it launched itsfull-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, but has since abandoned the region’s main town and other centres on the west bank of the Dnipro River. Friday’s reported strikes came as Kyiv is mounting a counteroffensive to retake territory from Russian forces, focused on the south of the country.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/4/ukrainian-shelling-kills-9-in-occupied-south-russia-installed-officials
Italian PM’s diplomatic adviser steps down over prank phone call fiasco,Meloni discussed issues such as the Ukraine war and migration with a Russian comedian posing as an African official.,"Italian Prime MinisterGiorgia Melonisaid that her chief diplomatic adviser has resigned, after she was tricked by a prank phone call in which she discussed the war in Ukraine and migration. Meloni said on Friday that Francesco Talo, who previously served as Italy’s ambassador to NATO and Israel, had stepped down over the fiasco. “This matter was not handled well, we are all sorry, Ambassador [Francesco] Talo took responsibility for it,” Meloni said. In a call in September, supposedly with a high-level official from the African Union, Meloni made stark comments about several topics, saying that Italy was not receiving adequate support to crack downon migrationand that there was international “fatigue” over the war in Ukraine.    The prime minister’s office later confirmed that the caller was not, in fact, an African Union official, but a Russian comedian who managed to fool them. Meloni blamed her staff for failing to adequately screen the caller after comments from the conversation were released online earlier this week. She said that she had “a doubt” about the identity of the caller but “no certainty”. The opposition Democratic Party had asked Meloni to inform parliament about the incident, charging that it raised questions about national security. The Italian leader also reiterated her country’ssupport for Ukraineon Friday, saying that comments about fatigue over the war are “nothing new”. “We have taken a very clear [pro-Ukraine] position and perhaps this is also why [Russians] call us,” she told a news conference, adding that there was no evidence that the call was part of a propaganda campaign. It is not the first time that Russian pranksters Vladimir Kuznetsov and Alexei Stolyarov, known as Vovan and Lexus, have successfully fooled powerful leaders.

"Russian drones, missiles and shells target Ukrainian infrastructure",A rise in shelling and drone attacks is sparking concern that Moscow is targeting energy infrastructure ahead of winter.,"Russia has launched dozens of drone attacks and fired shells and missiles against civilian infrastructure, Ukraine reports. Kyiv said two dozen Russian drones and a missile were downed overnight as concern grows that Moscow is once again targeting Ukraine’s energy infrastructure ahead of winter. Officials in Kharkiv reported civilian targets were hit by shelling and drone attacks. The General Staff of Ukraine’s militarysaidRussian drones targeted several areas across Ukraine and were launched from Russia’s Kursk region and the Primorsk-Akhtarsk area. “As a result of combat operations, in cooperation with the defence forces of Ukraine, 24 attack bpla ‘Shahed-136/131’ [drones] and one controlled aviation missile were destroyed,” the statement said, using the acronym for “bezpilotniy letayuschiy apparat”, or “pilotless flying equipment”. Police in Kharkiv in northeastern Ukraine reported that at least 10 Russian drones hit civilian infrastructure and triggered multiple fires in the city and shelling also damaged buildings. “As a result of the drone strikes, a local school was attacked, causing a fire that destroyed the roof and two of the building’s floors. A residential building, a service station and an administrative building were also on fire due to shelling,” the police officials added. Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said the fires were being brought under control. While no casualties have been reported so far, Kharkiv police officials said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app that doctors have diagnosed three residents with “an acute reaction to stress”. The overnight raids are part of a recent rise in Russian attacks.More than 100 settlementsin eastern Ukraine, including Kharkiv, were targeted on Wednesday, the heaviest day of shelling so far in 2023. Local authorities in Kharkiv said overnight shelling in the city on Wednesday killed one person. Ukraine and its partners in the West worry that Russia could try to replicate a strategy it followed last winter, squeezing Ukraine bytargeting energy infrastructureas temperatures fall. Last winter, Russia repeatedly attacked civilian infrastructure far from the front lines, leaving millions of Ukrainians without power, heat and water for days at a time. “We are strengthening air defence and mobile fire groups,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on the social media platform X.

New US sanctions over Russia-Ukraine war target Lancet drones,"Sweeping new measures target entities including in China, Turkey and UAE in bid to cut off Russia’s supply chain.","The United States has announced new sanctions covering some 130 new entities, including firms in China, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates, for allegedly supplying Russia’s military with much-needed components and technology and abetting itsongoing war in Ukraine. “Russia is dependent on willing third-country individuals and entities to resupply its military and perpetuate its heinous war against Ukraine, and we will not hesitate in holding them accountable,” Secretary of the Treasury Jane Yellensaid in a statementon Thursday. The new measures target critical supply chains that have otherwise allowed Russia to circumvent international sanctions and export controls by exploiting “otherwise legitimate economic relationships” with China, Turkey, and the UAE. These loopholes allow entities in the three countries to send Russia “high-priority dual-use goods” such as vehicle parts or encryption software that can be used by civilians or the military. In a move welcomed by Ukraine, the latest sanctions mark the first time Washington has moved against the production of Russia’s Lancet suicide drones. Ukrainian soldiers say the drone – an angular grey tube with two sets of four wings – has emerged as an increasing threat on the front lines. In his nightly video address, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hailed the measures as “just what is needed”. His chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, agreed. “I am very pleased that … restrictions are being tightened against companies associated with the military-industrial complex of the Russian Federation … ,” Yermak wrote on the Telegram messaging app. The new Treasury sanctions also target Russia’s domestic industrial base, which, the Treasury said, had been reorientated from “producing goods for the Russian people to attempting to ensure that the war machine can sustain itself”. Separately on Thursday, the US Department of State added 100 new sanctions targeting Russia’s energy, metals and mining sectors, defence procurement and “those involved in supporting the Russian government’s war effort and other malign activities”. The Commerce Department, meanwhile, also blacklisted 12 Russian companies and another from Uzbekistan that is says helped Moscow acquire critical drone technology. The US, European Union and other countries have already sanctioned hundreds of Russian individuals and entities since Moscow’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Further sanctions have also targeted its economy, freezing overseas assets, restricting exports, and otherwise making the cost of doing business in Russia extremely challenging and expensive. Yellen said the “global sanctions coalition” had “choked off Russia’s access to key inputs for its military-industrial complex and has undermined the Kremlin’s ability to wage its unprovoked war”. Despite the sanctions,Russia’s economyis expected to grow 1.5 percent this year, according to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development as countries like China, Turkey and India have provided Moscow with a critical economic lifeline.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/3/new-us-sanctions-over-russia-ukraine-war-target-lancet-drones

"Russia attacks more than 100 settlements in 24 hours, Ukraine says",Ukrainian authorities have said that cities and towns in the east have come under heavy bombardment over the last 24 hours.,"Ukraine’s interior minister has said that more than 100 settlements have come under fire in 24 hours, marking the heaviest day of Russian shelling this year. In a statement on social media, Ukrainian Interior Minister Igor Klymenko said that Russia had unleashed a barrage of millions of shells on cities across the eastern regions of the country. “Over the last 24 hours, the enemy shelled 118 settlements in 10 regions,” Klymenko said on Wednesday. “This is the highest number of cities and villages that have come under attack since the start of the year,” he said.    Russia’s wave of strikes turned some towns and villages to rubble. Local authorities said that overnight shelling in the city of Kharkiv, near the border with Russia, killed one person, with another also killed in southeastern Kherson. A Russian drone strike on the southern city of Nikopol also killed a 59-year-old woman and injured four people. Kyiv reported that a Russian strike on an oil refinery in Kremenchuk had caused a fire that took hours to extinguish, but resulted in no casualties. Ukraine and its partners in the West, such as the United States, worry that Russia could squeeze Ukraine bytargeting energy infrastructureas winter approaches. In an interview published by the British outlet The Economist on Wednesday, Ukrainian top general Valery Zaluzhny said that the conflict is moving towards a state of attrition, and that Ukraine will need new technology and larger army reserves to meet its goals. While Western supporters of Ukraine had hoped that a much-anticipatedUkrainian counteroffensivewould result in large territorial gains, Zaluzhny said in the interview that there would be no “deep and beautiful breakthrough”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/1/russia-attacks-more-than-100-settlements-in-24-hours-ukraine-says
Russia pursues Avdiivka with ‘meat assaults’ in a replay of Bakhmut,"Russia throws vast numbers of poorly supported troops into a new meat grinder, Ukrainian officials say.","Russia has doubled down on a campaign to capture the eastern Ukrainian town of Avdiivka during the 88th week ofits warin what appears to be a repeat of its year-long campaign to capture nearby Bakhmut, which fell in May. As inBakhmut, the Russian tactics have consisted of waves of infantry attacks that Ukrainian commanders said would soon become denser, and as in Bakhmut, Russian forces were suffering large losses of men and equipment. The Russian military is mounting efforts to retake the initiative in other places on the eastern front as well. The commander of Ukraine’s ground forces,Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Russia has “significantly strengthened” its forces in Bakhmut and switched from defence to offence. Ukrainian forces have had the Russians in retreat there in recent months as they tried to encircle the captured town. They retook commanding heights north of Bakhmut in July, from which they’ve been shelling Russian positions. During the past week, they advanced past a railway line that runs 10km (6.2 miles) southwest of Bakhmut, meaning Russian forces can’t use it to resupply their front lines. Russian forces tried to advance from several directions towards Kupiansk in the Luhansk region, Syrskyi said. Ukrainian southern forces spokesman Oleksandr Shtupun estimated on Thursday that 5,000 Russians had been killed or wounded two weeks into the effort to capture Avdiivka and Moscow had lost about 400armoured vehiclesthere and in Mariinka, farther south along the eastern front. That high rate of attrition continued in the past week, according to Ukraine. Its armed forces reported 660 Russians killed on Saturday across the front in 70 combat clashes, 10 of them in Avdiivka. Two days later, they said they killed 680 Russian soldiers. Shtupun said 500 of those casualties were in the Avdiivka area over 30 assaults. Russia is apparently able to replenish its numbers. The commander of the Russian “Arbat” Separate Guards Special Purpose Battalion, which is serving in Avdiivka, told a Russian reporter that fighters from theWagner mercenary groupare now among its ranks, an observation backed by a Ukrainian source. Wagner fighters were largely responsible for the capture of Bakhmut but were taken off the front lines because of military disagreements between the late Wagner boss,Yevgeny Prigozhin, and the Russian Ministry of Defence. Their recruitment is likely to strengthen the quality of Russian forces. Russian National Security Council Deputy Chairperson Dmitry Medvedev said nearly 385,000 people entered service with the Russian armed forces this year. There may be worse to come.    Shtupun said Russia was training Storm-Z assault troops to deploy in Avdiivka. Storm-Z soldiers are recruited in prisons and are thought to receive only rudimentary training and equipment but are believed to be ruthless in close-quarters combat. Ukrainians refer to such waves of infantry with poor mechanised and air support as “meat assaults”. Retired Ukrainian Colonel Petro Chernyk said Russia could potentially call on up to 3 million former conscripts trained in basic combat and, despite the fact that Ukraine has “destroyed” about 25,000 Russian soldiers a month, these were always immediately replaced. “The enemy should not be underestimated strategically. They have an extremely large number of small arms in their warehouses, and the last battles for Avdiivka and Bakhmut showed that they will use large infantry [columns]. Therefore, any information that Russia is currently running out of mobilisation resources is absolute nonsense,” Ukraine’s armed forces website Armyinform quoted Chernyk as saying. Both sides appeared to be scraping the bottom of the barrelfor ordnance. The Bloomberg news agency quoted unnamed sources as saying that the European Union had supplied only a third of the one million shells it has promised Ukraine by April. While Ukraine’s allies made new pledges of hundreds of millions of dollars of equipment in the past week, it appeared that not all were immediately deliverable. The New York Times reported that the US military was looking into marrying Soviet-era air defence launchers with modern Western missiles that are accurate and effective. These so-called FrankenSAM hybrid systems are an effort to make use of readily available components to enrich Ukraine’s air defences. In the same spirit, Russia was reportedly upgrading its gliding bombs – the FAB-250, FAB-500 and FAB-1500 – to use laser guidance, which improved their accuracy from 50 metres (55 yards) to 5 metres (5.5 yards). The smallest of these bombs reportedly carries 99kg (218lb) of explosives and has a damage radius of 120 metres (130 yards) while the largest packs 675kg (1,500lb) of explosives and has a blast radius of half a kilometre (a third of a mile). Gliding bombs are generally cheaper and easier to produce than other highly accurate systems, such as missiles or drones. Ukraine prides itself on having contained Russia’sBlack Sea Fleet, allowing grain ships to continue using a safe corridor along its coastline to the territorial waters of NATO members Romania and Bulgaria. The Reuters news agency reported on Thursday that Ukraine had suspended that corridor because of a threat from Russian warplanes. Ukraine’s reconstruction minister, Oleksandr Kubrakov, denied there had been a suspension. The US ambassador to Kyiv, Bridget Brink, appeared to reinforce Ukraine’s denial, saying 53 ships had passed safely through the corridor in September, delivering 2 million tonnes of grain. Russia pulled out of a deal to allow Ukraine’s grain ships to cross the Black Sea in July after Ukraine attacked the KerchBridge to Crimeafor a second time. Russia threatened to prevent ships from loading at Ukrainian ports, but Ukraine has since managed to keep the Russian fleet at bay.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/1/russia-pursues-avdiivka-with-meat-assaults-in-a-replay-of-bakhmut
North Korea sends Russia artillery rounds for satellite advice: S Korea,"Pyongyang and Moscow have an ‘arms-for-liftoff deal’, claims South Korea’s spy agency.","North Korea is supplying munitions to Russia for use in its war against Ukraine in return for satellite technology, South Korea has said. Pyongyang has supplied Moscow with more than one million artillery shells since early August, Seoul’s National Intelligence Service (NIS) reported on Wednesday. In return, Russia is assumed to be providing technology and know-how to North Korea, which is making a third effort to launch a satellite following two failures. South Korean lawmaker Yoo Sang-bum said that Pyongyanghas sent around 10 arms shipments to Russiaby air, as well as via naval shipments between a North Korean east coast port and Russian ports, asthe United States has previously claimed. More than one million artillery shells were transported by sea, originating from the port of Najin and reaching the Russian ports of Dunai and Vostochny, according to NIS. From there, they were conveyed by train to Ukraine, near the Toretsk ammunition depot. It is estimated that these deliveries will keep Russian forces in Ukraine supplied for two months. Meanwhile, the West is struggling to keep pace in supplying Ukraine’s forces with ammunition. “North Korea is running its munition factories to full capacity to meet demand for military supplies to Russia and even mobilising residents and civilian factories to make ammunition boxes for exports,” Yoo said. The US, South Korea, and Japan have condemned North Korea’s supply of arms and military equipment to Russia, and Moscow’s supply of technology in the other direction. The allegations have been denied by bothNorth Koreaand the Kremlin. “Russia, as a responsible member of the world community, strictly adheres to its international obligations towards Pyongyang through the UN Security Council,” Russian Ambassador at LargeOleg Burmistrov said in responseto the allegations. North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in September in eastern Russia, where the leaders toured Russia’s most important satellite launch centre, theVostochny Cosmodrome. During the meeting, President Putin said Russia would help North Korea build satellites, without providing specifics. Observersspeculatedafter the meeting that Moscow would help with North Korea’s space programme in return for supplying conventional weapons. Indeed, North Korea appears to have received technical assistance from Russia with its spy satellite system, South Korea’s spy agency claims. North Korea lacks both financial resources and technical expertise in its satellite programme, and appears to have not yet mastered the technology for atmospheric re-entry of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) warheads, Yoo said. Now, Pyongyang is in the final stages of a third, likely successful, satellite launch attempt, after two previous failed attempts. North Korea also hopes to receive Russian fighter jets and other aircraft in the exchange, according to Yoo.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/1/north-korea-sends-russia-artillery-rounds-for-satellite-advice-s-korea
Sirens in Sevastopol as Ukraine ramps up attacks on Crimea,"Ukraine’s strategy to quell Russia’s control of Crimea and the Black Sea requires patience, says Zelenskyy.","Russian officials have declared an air raid alert in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol in anticipation of further attacks from Ukraine. Sirens went off in the city early on Wednesday. Traffic on the Crimean bridge, linking the peninsula to Russia, as well as sea transport, were suspended. The alert comes amid a string of Ukrainianattacksin recent weeks in and around Crimea, which was seized and annexed by Moscow in 2014. Kyiv’s forces have struck a Russian air base on the peninsula and the Black Sea Fleet command post in Sevastopol, as Ukraine seeks to weaken Russia’s control over the water. Moscow on Tuesday accused Ukraine of theattempted assassinationof pro-Russian politician Oleg Tsaryov in Yalta. The Crimean Bridgewas attacked in July. At the same time, amid disappointing results from Kyiv’s much-vauntedcounteroffensive, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is seeking to rouse his country ahead of a winter campaign anticipated to be harsh. Ukraine hopes that weakening Russian forces on the Black Sea will deliver an ultimate victory in the war. The “illusion” of Russia’s domination of Crimea and the Black Sea had been shattered, Zelenskyy told a meeting of the Crimea Platform on October 24. “The Russian (Black Sea) fleet is no longer able to operate in the western part of the Black Sea and is gradually fleeing from Crimea,” Zelenskyy said. “And this is a historic achievement.” The attacks have highlighted Kyiv’s growing capabilities, which include naval drones. Meanwhile, Moscow continues bombarding Ukraine from afar with long-range missiles and assault drones. Last week, the Russian defence ministry said “a set of mine and anti-sabotage measures” in Sevastopol Bay had intercepted three unmanned Ukrainian boats. Ukraine said on Wednesday that Russia had shelled more than 100 settlements over the last 24 hours; the highest number of attacks on any single day so far in 2023. “We have not yet gained full fire control over Crimea and surrounding waters, but we will,” Zelenskyy told the attendees of the diplomatic initiative gathered in Prague. “This is a question of time.” On Monday, the Ukrainian military claimed a successful attack on a Crimean Russian air defence base with naval drones and missiles. As the strategy persists, and a downbeat analysis of Ukraine’s progress with its counteroffensive mounts, Zelenskyy sought on Tuesday to rouse his troops and country with a message of patience, perseverance and focus on the final goal. “We live in a world that gets used to success too quickly. When the full-scale invasion began, many people around the world did not believe that Ukraine would survive,” the Ukrainian president said in his nightly video address on Tuesday. “Glory to all those who do not retreat, who do not burn out, who believe in Ukraine just as they did on February 24, and who has been fighting for unwaveringly.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/1/air-raid-sirens-in-sevastopol-as-ukraine-ramps-up-attacks-on-crimea
Is Russia recruiting Muslim migrants to fight its war in Ukraine?,"Moscow appears to be flouting its own laws to boost its forces, targeting foreign workers from Central Asia.","Kyiv, Ukraine –In mid-October, Mamut Useinov performed on Sing Better Than a Star, a popular Russian television show for aspiring singers on the state-controlled Channel One network. “I’ve been anticipating this and can’t hide my excitement,” the 25-year-old from annexed Crimea wrote on Telegram on October 15, as he thanked “the Almighty” for the chance. But Useinov’s way to stardom was cut short. Five days after the broadcast, Useinov went to a “prayer house”, a type of informal mosque that offers a place to worship in the absence of officially sanctioned places for prayer. Heavily armed riot police officers detained him along with several dozen men who gathered for the Muslim Friday prayer in Kotelniki, an overpopulated southeastern suburb of Moscow where labour migrants settle because rent is cheap. All the men were forced into a police bus for an ID check and taken to a military conscription office in the nearby town of Lybertsy, according to Useinov and media reports. There, they underwent a medical evaluation that deemed Useinov “fit for military service”, despite flat feet and a recent surgery, he said. They were reportedly shipped to a military base east of Moscow and given a choice – go to jail or enlist. “We were all told that we have to sign one-year contracts, otherwise – jail,” he said in a Telegram-posted video on October 21, without specifying the charges they may face. He fears that once they sign the contract, the men will be sent to the front lines in Ukraine, the nation where Useinov was born and whose national he was, before accepting Russian citizenship in 2014, he wrote. “During a morning lineup, I heard we would all be send to the special military operation,” he wrote using the Kremlin’s preferred euphemism for the war in Ukraine. In a video he posted, he is seen in a small room filled with men next to bunkbeds listening to an elderly ethnic Russian man in camouflage. One more video shows the courtyard of a large building whose sand-coloured brick walls are adorned with a Russian flag and a banner reading, “Devotion to the motherland.” He went incommunicado on October 22. At the time of publishing, Useinov had not responded to Al Jazeera’s requests for comment. He has been taken to yet another military base for basic training, his representative told the Astra telegram channel on October 23. What Useinov described blatantly violated Russian rights legislation. The men were detained and denied access to lawyers. They were told about being conscripted without receiving a written notification issued by the conscription office where each man is registered – and then signed by the recipient. The men had no chance to overrule the forced conscription in court – or voice their objection to military service.Conscientious objectorshave a right to an alternative service in Russia. “This procedure violated all of my rights,” Useinov wrote.    Dire demographic problems and oil wealth turned Russia into a magnet for millions of labour migrants from ex-Soviet Central Asia. SomeCrimean Tatars, a Muslim community of about 200,000 in the annexed peninsula, became part of this influx as they share ties with Turkic-speaking nations of Central Asia, a region their forefathers had been deported to en masse in 1944. Meanwhile, Russia’s mostly Muslim, impoverished and corruption-choked North Caucasus is one of the few regions with high birth rates, and hundreds of thousands also move to Moscow and other big cities. But attending a mosque almost anywhere in Russia can be complicated and sometimes dangerous. Moscow only has five official mosques, and tens of thousands of believers throng areas around them duringMuslimholidays, putting their prayer mats on the asphalt or even tram tracks. Most labour migrants choose to attend informal “prayer houses”, which some locals and police see as hotbeds of “extremism”. These houses have mushroomed because authorities routinely do not sanction new mosques, even though Muslims are Russia’s fastest-growing population stratum. While the Kremlin tries to revive its Soviet-era clout in the Middle East, courting Muslim leaders and calling Islam one of Russia’s “traditional religions”, Russian police snub religious rules and rights during their raids on prayer houses. They do not take their boots off, interrupt prayers, shower believers with slurs, and spray them with tear gas, according to dozens of reports, photos and videos. Far-right role Russian far-right nationalists help organise raids on “prayer houses”, in an apparent effort to kill two birds with one stone. They see the forcible conscription of Muslims as a way to rid Russia of unwanted “aliens” and help the faltering war effort, according to analysts. Zov (Call), a group whose closed Telegram channel has 141,000 subscribers, routinely informs police about Muslim gatherings – and proudly announces raids, detentions and deportations. “Just now, police visited two illegal mosques organised in apartment buildings. More than 70 people were rounded up. Awaiting deportation,” one of Zov’s posts said. The group is led by Andrey Tkachuk, head of a small media group in Moscow, and Andrey Afanasyev, a former staffer of the Tsargrad television channel whose oligarch owner Konstantin Malofeyev has been sanctioned in the West as a sponsor of separatists in Ukraine’s Donbas region. Muslim labour migrantshavefaced hate attacks, arbitrary detentions and arrests, police brutality, extortion and threats for decades. But after the Kremlin realised that its blitzkrieg in Ukraine failed amid disastrous losses of manpower, it threw a new curveball their way. As part of a nationwide series of raids dubbed “Illegal 2023”, police have been combing construction sites, markets, farms, restaurants, apartment buildings, hostels and “prayer houses” – or simply rounding up anyone who does not look Slavic, according to rights groups and media reports. During ID checks, they find “problems” – both imaginary and real, such as a lack of registration, a blurred stamp, or an expired work permit. The migrants are locked up and forced to enlist in military service, facing several kinds of threats to ensure their cooperation, an expert said. Shukhrat Ganiyev, a human rights advocate based in the central Uzbek city of Bukhara, told Al Jazeera that the pressure put on migrants included “threat of deportation of [their] families from Russia, the planting of drugs, an intolerable atmosphere for business”. He said some Uzbeks had signed contracts for construction jobs in the Russia-occupied southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, but then ended up on the front line – “and were not heard of since”. Police in St Petersburg, Russia’s second-largest city and President Vladimir Putin’s hometown, said they handed conscription papers to 56 migrants with Russian passports after just one raid on a market on September 6. A month earlier, about 100 migrants were served with conscription papers, it said. The Illegal 2023 investigations are “tied to organisation of illegal migration, trade in drugs and psychotropic substances, arms trade and border crossings”, Ministry of Internal Affairs spokeswoman Irina Vovk said. Another way of forcing Muslim migrants into the trenches has been to deny Central Asians citizenship – a red Russian passport eliminates many of the problems with police and bureaucratic hurdles that migrants face. In one case, migration officials turned down an application from a Tajik man whose mother is a Russian national, according to rights advocate Tatyana Kotlyar. The man was told to enlist first, even though as a father of five he cannot be drafted, she said. In another case, an Uzbek man whose wife and child are Russian nationals, was told that “without a [military] contract and participation in the special military operation, they won’t even accept his citizenship application,” Kotlyar, who is based in the city of Obninsk 120km (75 miles) southwest of Moscow, told Al Jazeera. Both men did not reply to Al Jazeera’s request for comment. And in Kaluga, a region of more than one million people, some 200km (124 miles) south of Moscow, foreign workers have been barred from submitting citizenship applications in recent months unless they enlist, Kotlyar said. Officials at the Kaluga migration office refused to comment on her claim. And even if a migrant already has a Russian passport, recently adopted laws allow authorities to take it away with ease. “If you are a Russian national but are not ready to fulfil your military duty, a decision should be made to strip such a man of his citizenship,” Russia’s top investigator Aleksander Bastrykin told a military conference in mid-October. Bastrykin said earlier that migrants have a “constitutional duty to defend the nation that accepted them” and that enlisting them should be a “priority”. There have even been calls to abolish age limits for migrants so that they can be forced to serve in the military. The conscription age in Russia is between 18 and 30. “You became a Russian national at age 50 – go serve at 50,” nationalist lawmaker Aleksey Zhuravlyev said on October 24. Muslim migrants are among the most vulnerable people in Russia, said Sergey Abashin, a migration expert and anthropologist based in St Petersburg. They are often subject to the whims of police officers and officials because they “always” have problems with their documents, he said. “The [Russian] legislation’s very design makes it impossible to have absolutely ‘clean’ documents,” he said. The migrants are also dependent on the goodwill of their employers, as many work without the permits to do so. Meanwhile, public opinion is dominated by rampant nationalism, xenophobia and often portrays Muslim newcomers as hostile and alien, he said. “The sum of these dependencies makes migrants easily victimised,” he said. Very few make their cases public, fearing persecution of their families, rights advocates have said, adding the immigrants are accustomed to authoritarian rule and police brutality in their countries of origin, often know little about their civil rights in Russia, do not have access to lawyers, and may not speak much Russian. Where there is a stick, there follows a carrot – promises of hefty pay and a Russian passport. “Since at least May 2023, Russia has approached Central Asian migrants to fight in Ukraine with promises of fast-track citizenship and salaries of up to $4,160,” the British Defence Ministry said in September. In September 2022, Putin signed a decree that gives Russian nationality to anyone who has served on the front line for six months. The first Uzbek national taken prisoner in Ukraine said he was driven by financial interest, according to a Ukrainianmedia report. Lying on his back in a camouflaged coat, Mukhriddin Akhmedov, a 22-year-old student from the central Uzbek city of Samarkand, said he joined the Redoubt military company because he “needed money”. He said that “one more Uzbek” had joined the company. Looking ahead, the Russian military faces a shortage of manpower on the front lines after heavy casualties in the so-called “meat storms” on Ukrainian positions, experts have said. The shortage is exacerbated by Russia’s catastrophically low birthrates and a population loss of hundreds of thousands of people a year in the rapidly aging nation of 143 million. “By waging the war in Ukraine via the tactics of ‘meat storms’ and thus suffering heavy losses of manpower, the Russian military began experiencing a lack of cannon fodder,” Alisher Ilkhamov, head of the London-based Central Asia Due Diligence group, told Al Jazeera. Although their forcible conscription has undermined earlier official steps to limit Central Asia natives’ access to firearms – for years, Central Asian migrants were denied permits to buy hunting rifles – the political risk to Russian leaders is minimal. So far, there has only been a single public incident associated with the forced conscription of migrants. Last October, two Tajik nationals were forcibly sent to a training camp before departure to Ukraine. After the men, Ekhson Aminzoda and Mekhrob Rakhmonov, heard their commanding officers “insult their religion”, they got hold of a machine gun and killed 11 people and injured 15 others. The two were shot dead and pronounced “terrorists” by authorities. Meanwhile, the Kremlin is afraid to declare a second round of mobilisation in advance of the March 2024 presidential election, he said. The September 2022 “partial”mobilisationtriggered an exodus of hundreds of thousands of Russian men, making migrants more attractive targets. “In such conditions, the emphasis is on recruiting migrants, as their loss on the front line will not affect Russia politically or economically,” Ilkhamov said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/1/is-russia-recruiting-muslim-migrants-to-fight-its-war-in-ukraine
