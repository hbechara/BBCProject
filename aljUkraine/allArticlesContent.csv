EU agrees $5.5bn boost for military aid to Ukraine,"The move provides a welcome boost for Kyiv as support from its other major backer, the US, wavers and its outgunned forces struggle to hold back Russia.","European Union countries have agreed to provide 5 billion euros ($5.48bn) for military aid to Ukraine as part of a revamp of an EU-run assistance fund, handing Kyiv a timely boost as its forcesstruggle against Russia’s invasion. Ambassadors from the EU’s 27 member countries agreed to the overhaul of the European Peace Facility (EPF) fund at a meeting in Brussels on Wednesday aftermonths of wrangling, with EU heavyweights France and Germany at the centre of much of the debate. “The message is clear: we will support Ukraine with whatever it takes to prevail,” EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell posted on social media platform X after the decision. The fund operates as a giant cashback scheme, giving EU members refunds for sending munitions to other countries. France, a strong promoter of European defence industries, had insisted on a strong “buy European” policy for arms eligible for refunds. Other countries argued that such a requirement would inhibit efforts to buy worldwide to get weapons to Ukraine quickly. Germany, by far Europe’s biggest bilateral donor of military aid to Ukraine, had demanded donations be taken into account in determining the size of countries’ financial contributions to the fund. Diplomats said compromise was eventually reached allowing flexibility on the “buy European” rules and taking into account part of the value of bilateral aid when calculating members’ financial contributions. “This is yet another powerful and timely demonstration of European unity and determination in achieving our common victory,” said Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. “We look forward to the final decision being approved at the next EU Foreign Affairs Council meeting.”    The final text said the scheme should give priority to the European defence industry while “exceptionally allowing for flexibility in cases where it cannot provide within a timeframe compatible with Ukrainian needs”. The compromise will allow the fund to help finance a Czech initiative to buy hundreds of thousands of desperately needed artillery shells from countries outside Europe, according to diplomats. The EPF has already been used to allocate some 6.1 billion euros ($6.7bn) to military aid for Ukraine, according to the EU. Borrell proposed creating a new cash pot last year specifically for aid to Kyiv – the Ukraine Assistance Fund – inside the EPF, with a budget of up to five billion euros per year for the next four years. That prompted a prolonged debate about rules for future aid, eventually leading to Wednesday’s agreement. The compromise included measures to satisfy Hungary, which has previously blocked payouts from the EPF and said it does not want its contributions to finance arms for Ukraine. Under the deal, its contributions will be used to fund military aid to other countries, according to EU officials. “Ukraine needs more arms and equipment, we will provide them in sufficient quantities and in a coordinated manner,” said Hadja Lahbib, the foreign minister of Belgium, the current holder of the EU’s rotating presidency. “Europe is true to its commitments. Our freedom is at stake.”    The announcement of the latest funds for Ukraine has come as Kyiv’s forces are under pressure along the front line in the face of ammunition shortages. The United States on Tuesday announced a new $300m weapons package for Ukraine, but a further $60bn in funding remains stalled by Republicans in Congress. Warnings have grown in Europe that a failure to keep up support for Kyiv could see it ultimately defeated and that an emboldened Kremlin might then attack other countries. The EU is pushing to bolster weapons and ammunition production by its defence industry, buttwo years into the war, it is still struggling to ramp up output. The bloc is set to fall well short of a promise it made a year ago to supply Ukraine with a million artillery shells by this month. Meanwhile, Russia has stepped up its arms production by putting its economy on a war footing and has received major deliveries of weapons from Iran and North Korea.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/13/eu-5bn-euro-boost-for-ukraine-military-aid-fund-russia
Nordic tensions on the rise amid Russian anger over NATO accessions,"Finland PM urges EU to step up defence spending and coordination, as tensions rise with Russia following NATO accession.","Signs of tension with Russia are rising in the Nordic region following Sweden and Norway’s accession to NATO. Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo on Wednesday warned that Moscow is gearing up for a “long conflict with the West” and Denmark revealed plans to boost defence spending, as Russia continued to condemn the expansion of the Western military alliance in the wake of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. In comments delivered to the European Parliament, Orpo called for increased spending and coordination on European defence. “Russia is evidently preparing for a long conflict with the West and represents a permanent and essential military threat to Europe,” the Finnish leader declared. “If we, as a united Europe, fail to respond sufficiently to this challenge, the coming years will be filled with danger and the looming threat of attack,” he said, before adding: “Russia is not invincible.” Orpo, whose country neighbours Russia, urged the 27-country European Union to step up defence spending and said the bloc had to take care of its own defence, insisting that its security cannot hinge on the outcome of the election in the United States. Republican contender Donald Trump suggested last month thatNATO guarantees could be weakenedshould he win back the White House in November’s vote. Meanwhile, Moscow has continued to hit out at the Western alliance’s expansion. President Vladimir Putin said in remarks published on Wednesday that Finland andSweden’s entry into NATOwas “a meaningless step”. Russia will deploy troops and systems of destruction to the border after Finland joins the alliance, he reiterated. Putin also warned the West on Wednesday thatRussia was technically ready for nuclear warand that if the US sent troops to Ukraine, it would be considered a significant escalation of the conflict.  Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula in 2014 served as a wake-up call for European countries, and saw NATO increase its minimum defence spending recommendation from less than 1.5 percent to 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). Many have been struggling to hit that threshold. However, Moscow’s continuing invasion of Ukraine is focusing minds, while weapons and ammunition handed to Kyiv have boosted spending. Denmark, one of NATO’s founding members, on Wednesday said it would raise its defence budget by $5.9bn over the next five years to boost its military capacity, pushing it past the spending target starting this year. “The total defence budget, including aid to Ukraine, will amount to 2.4 percent of Danish GDP this year and in 2025,” Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told reporters. The increased funding will be used both to boost Denmark’s military capacity and provide aid to Ukraine. It will also go towards an expansion of conscription, which will be extended from four to 11 months and will include women for the first time. Denmark already announced last year that it was tripling its military spending over the next 10 years. “We haven’t stopped investing in defence, but it’s still not enough,” Frederiksen said. “If we want to reach NATO’s target of being able to deploy a brigade of 6,000 soldiers as quickly as possible and to defend Denmark against air strikes, we have to modernise even more quickly,” she stated.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/13/finnish-leader-says-russia-is-preparing-for-long-conflict-with-the-west

"Three killed, 38 injured in Russian attack on Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih",Ten children are among those injured in the missile attack on apartment buildings as rescue teams search for survivors.,"A Russian missile has hit two apartment buildings in the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih, killing three people and injuring at least 38, with rescue teams sifting through rubble in a night-time search for survivors. Serhiy Lysak, governor of the Dnipropetrovsk region, put the provisional injury toll from the attack on Tuesday at 28 adults and 10 children. “Two buildings were hit, one five storeys, one nine storeys,” Lysak wrote on Telegram. “The number of injured is constantly rising as is the number of children injured.” Video of the scene showed a blaze that erupted at the top of one apartment block and rescue teams carrying the injured out of shattered building entrances. “The emergency services and residents who care are rescuing residents blocked in their apartments and are continuing to search for anyone who might be under the rubble,” Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko wrote. “Four people have already been rescued.” Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who was born and raised in Kryvyi Rih, said on Telegram that search operations “will continue as long as they are needed.” In his evening address, he said: “We will inflict losses on the Russian state in response – quite rightly. They in the Kremlin must learn that terror does not go unpunished for them.” The city of Kryvyi Rih has been frequently targeted by Russian forces throughout the conflict.

Anti-Putin paramilitaries claim incursion into Russia from Ukraine,Ukraine’s military intelligence says anti-Putin Russian volunteer militias are not acting under orders from Kyiv.,"Pro-Ukrainian militias have claimed multiple attacks on Russian border regions as Russia insisted it beat back the raids, staged three days before it holds a presidential election. Ukraine-based armed groups, made up of pro-Kyiv Russian volunteer fighters who oppose Russian President Vladimir Putin, said on Tuesday they had entered the Kursk and Belgorod regions. The cross-border raids, which Russia’s defence ministry said were thwarted, took place as Kyiv launched dozens of drones and rockets in Russia in its largest attack since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The Ukrainian attack set twooil refineriesin Russia ablaze. Ilya Ponomarev, a former member of the Russian Duma, now acting as political head of the Freedom of Russia Legion, said on Telegram that the raids had been carried out by his group in a “joint operation” with the Russian Volunteer Corps and the Siberian Battalion. The Legion claimed it was still clashing with Russian forces as of 1:15pm local time (10:15 GMT). It published a video from a drone purportedly showing a vehicle being blown up and fighters on the streets of the village of Tyotkino, on the border between Russia and Ukraine. However, Russia’s Ministry of Defence said its forces had repelled the last attack at 8:25am (05:25 GMT), saying troops had fought off multiple attacks by “Ukrainian terrorist groups” that had attempted to invade from three directions after alleged “intensive shelling” of civilian sites. “All the Ukrainian attacks were repelled. The enemy was hit by aircraft, rockets and artillery,” it said. Kursk Governor Roman Starovoyt said there had also been a shootout in his region, but a larger incursion had been thwarted. In the wake of the attacks, schools in the city of Kursk were switching to online classes, according to the TASS news agency. Another pro-Kyiv paramilitary group, the Russian Volunteer Corps, posted night-vision video on Tuesday purporting to show its troops engaged in a firefight. Ukraine-based militias have claimed to be behind previous incursions into Russian territory. Andriy Yusov, a spokesman for Ukraine’s military intelligence, said that the Russian volunteer groups were not acting under orders from Kyiv. But he added that the attacks showed “the Kremlin is once again not in control of the situation in Russia”. A spokesperson for the political wing of the Freedom of Russia Legion told the AFP news agency on Tuesday that the attack was timed to coincide with Russia’s March 15-17 presidential elections. “This is not an election at all. It is the next stage of a usurpation of power, the formation of Putin’s dictatorship under the guise of elections,” spokesman Alexei Baranovsky said. The cross-border attack came as Kyiv launched one of its most significant drone strikes on Russia of the two-year war. Moscow said it downed 25 Ukrainian drones over regions including Moscow, Leningrad, Belgorod, Kursk, Bryansk, Tula and Oryol. Waves of drone attacks continued through the day, the defence ministry said. Russian officials reported attacks on energy facilities, including a fire at Lukoil’s NORSI refinery and a drone destroyed on the outskirts of the town of Kirishi, home to Russia’s second-largest oil refinery. Gleb Nikitin, governor of the Nizhny Novgorod region, posted a picture of a fire truck beside the NORSI refinery and said emergency services were working to put out a blaze there. “A fuel and energy complex facility was attacked by unmanned aerial vehicles,” Nikitin said on Telegram. Industry sources told the Reuters news agency on condition of anonymity that the main crude distillation unit (AVT-6) at NORSI was damaged in the attack, which means that at least half of the refinery’s production is halted. Lukoil declined to comment.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/anti-putin-paramilitaries-claim-incursion-into-russia-from-ukraine
European Commission to recommend EU accession talks with Bosnia,Brussels is pushing to accelerate EU expansion in Western Balkans as it eyes growing Russian and Chinese influence.,"The European Commission is set to recommend that the European Union open accession talks with Bosnia and Herzegovina. President Ursula von der Leyen said on Tuesday that the EU’s executive arm will ask member states to open negotiations with Sarajevo, despite lingering ethnic divisions in the Western Balkan country, as the West eyes the growing influence of Russia and China in the region. Bosnia is among six Western Balkan nations – alongside Albania, Serbia, Kosovo (a semi-autonomous territory and self-declared republic), Montenegro and North Macedonia – that are at different stages of the EU accession process. Despite early efforts to bring the sextet into the bloc to try to help consign the region’s wars and crises in the 1990s to history, impatience has been growing, with progress stalled for years. However,Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and inroads being made by Moscow and Beijing in gaining influence, are helping to focus some minds in the West, pushing EU officials to accelerate the process. “We have realised that it is not enough to just wait for the Western Balkans to move closer to us,” von der Leyen told the European Parliament. “It is not enough to say that the door is open. We must also take responsibility, and support their path towards our union in any possible way.” EU leaders are expected to discuss the recommendation at a summit in Brussels next week. There is no guarantee that member states will endorse it asMilorad Dodik, a pro-Russian, separatist Bosnian Serb leader, continues to undermine the presidency and other political functions in the country. Bosnia has been riven byethnic divisions even decades after the warthat tore it apart in the 1990s. In December, Dodik said he intended to keep weakening the country to the point where it falls apart.    Bosnia was granted EU candidate status in 2022. To join the bloc, countries must go through a lengthy process to align laws and standards and show that their institutions and economies meet democratic norms. Von der Leyen admitted that Bosnia needs “more progress”, but insisted that it has made “impressive steps”. “More progress has been achieved in just over a year than in over a decade,” she said. “First, Bosnia and Herzegovina is now fully aligned with our foreign and security policy, which is crucial in these times of geopolitical turmoil.” She also praised the country for its efforts in fighting money laundering, the financing of terrorism and improving the control of migration flows. “The country is showing that it can deliver on the membership criteria, and on its citizens’ aspiration to be part of our family,” she said. “The message coming from Bosnia and Herzegovina is clear. So our message must be clear too. The future of Bosnia and Herzegovina lies in our union.” Bosnia is perhaps the most fragile of the Balkan countries. Ethnic tensions there have persisted long after the end of the 1992-95 interethnic war that killed more than 100,000 people and displaced millions.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/european-commission-to-recommend-eu-accession-talks-with-bosnia
Ukrainian drones and missiles strike Russian oil refineries,Ukraine continues to target Russia’s oil and gas infrastructure.,"Ukraine has launched a barrage of drone and missile strikes against Russia, igniting two oil refineries. The overnight attacks, some of which reached deep into Russian territory, hit refineries in towns hundreds of miles apart in the Nizhny Novgorod and Oryol regions. No casualties were reported, according to regional officials. In Kstovo, a town located 828km (514 miles) from the Ukraine border in Nizhny Novgorod, a fuel and energy complex, reportedly owned by Lukoil – Russia’s largest privately-owned company – was attacked by drones, according to regional Governor Gleb Nikitin. “The special services are working on the spot, using all the necessary force and means to localise the fire at one of the oil refining installations,” he said on the Telegram messaging app. A drone also smashed into a refinery in the town of Oryol, some 160km (99 miles) from the Ukraine border, according to Andrey Klychkov, governor of the Oryol region. An emergency services official quoted by Russian state news agency RIA Novosti said a tank containing petroleum products caught fire. At least 17 people from high-rise buildings near the site of the drone crash were reported to have been evacuated to a temporary accommodation centre. Ukraine and Russia have often used drones to strike critical infrastructure, military installations and troop concentrations in their more than two-yearwar. Kyiv has concentrated fire on Russian refineries and energy facilities in recent months. The latest overnight operation saw it launch at least 25 drones and seven missiles, targeting Moscow, Leningrad, Belgorod, Kursk, Bryansk, Tula and Oryol, Russia’s Ministry of Defence said. One drone flying towards Moscow was downed over the Ramensky district near the capital, said Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin on Telegram. Meanwhile, Russian forces bombed a five-storey residential building in the eastern city of Kupiansk in the Kharkiv region, according to Ukraine’s State Emergency Service, destroying it and causing several fires. The attack came after four people were injured in Russian attacks in Kharkiv on Monday, including a 70-year-old woman.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/ukrainian-drones-and-missiles-strike-russian-oil-refineries

"Russia, NATO at odds over pope’s call for Ukraine to show ‘white flag’",Moscow said the pope’s comment was ‘quite understandable’ while NATO said ‘it’s not the time to talk about surrender’.,"The Kremlin has said Pope Francis’s call for talks to end the war in Ukraine was “quite understandable”, while NATO’s secretary general said now was not the time to talk about “surrender”. Pope Francis said in an interview recorded last month that Ukraine should have “the courage of the white flag” to negotiate an end to awarthat is now in its third year. As Russia makes gains on the battlefield, the West grapples with how to support Ukraine and the prospect of a dramatic change in United States policy if Donald Trump wins November’s presidential election. “It is quite understandable that he [the pope] spoke in favour of negotiations,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday. He said RussianPresident Vladimir Putinhad repeatedly said his country was open to peace talks. “Unfortunately, both the statements of the pope and the repeated statements of other parties, including ours, have recently received absolutely harsh refusals,” he said.    Moscow’s offers to negotiate have invariably been predicated on Kyiv giving up the territory that Moscow has seized and declared to be part of Russia, amounting to more than a sixth of Ukraine. Peskov said Western hopes of inflicting a “strategic defeat” on Russia were “the deepest misconception”, adding: “The course of events, primarily on the battlefield, is the clearest evidence of this.” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said negotiations that would preserve Ukraine as a sovereign and independent nation would only come when Putin realised he would not win on the battlefield. “If we want a negotiated, peaceful, lasting solution, the way to get there is to provide military support to Ukraine,” he told the Reuters news agency at NATO headquarters in Brussels. Asked if this meant now was not the time to talk about a white flag, he said: “It’s not the time to talk about surrender by the Ukrainians. That will be a tragedy for the Ukrainians.” “It will also be dangerous for all of us. Because then the lesson learned in Moscow is that when they use military force, when they kill thousands of people, when they invade another country, they get what they want,” he said. On Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dismissed Pope Francis’s call for talks with Russia as “virtual mediation” from a distance. In his nightly video address, Zelenskyy did not directly refer to Francis or his remarks, but said the pope’s ideas had nothing to do with efforts by religious figures in Ukraine to help the country. “They support us with prayer, with their discussion and with deeds. This is indeed what a church with the people is,” Zelenskyy said. “Not 2,500km [1,550 miles] away, somewhere, virtual mediation between someone who wants to live and someone who wants to destroy you.” Zelenskyy, who signed a decree in 2022 ruling out talks with Putin, said last week that Russia will not be invited to a peace summit due to be held in Switzerland.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/11/kremlin-nato-at-odds-over-popes-call-for-ukraine-to-show-white-flag
Hungary’s Orban claims Trump said he won’t ‘give a penny’ to Ukraine,PM Viktor Orban tells Hungarian state broadcaster that Trump has a ‘clear vision’ after meeting former US president in Florida.,"Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban says former US President Donald Trump has told him that he would “not give a penny” to the war in Ukraine. Orban related the comments by Trump, who is running in November’s presidential election, during an interview with state broadcaster M1 late on Sunday after he travelled to Florida to meet Trump. “He has a very clear vision, which is hard not to agree with. He says the following: First of all, he will not give a penny in the Ukraine-Russia war,” Orban said in the interview. There was no immediate response from Trump’s team on these comments from Orban. Orban often calls for a ceasefire and peace talks in theRussia-Ukraine war, which recently entered its third year. He also arguesTrumpis best qualified to end the conflict, having expressed hope for his return to power.    “That is why the war will end because it is obvious that Ukraine cannot stand on its own feet. … If the Americans do not give money, the Europeans alone will not be able to finance this war. And then the war is over,” he said. A statement from Trump’s campaign did not mention Ukraine but said the pair on Friday discussed issues affecting both nations, including their respective border security. Orban angered fellow European Union leaders by meeting Russian PresidentVladimir Putinin October and has maintained ties with the Kremlin since Russia invaded Ukraine. He has also spoken out against Western sanctions on Moscow. US President Joe Biden criticised the Trump-Orban meeting, saying the Hungarian leader was “looking for dictatorship”. European leaders have long been nervous that another Trump presidency would mean waning US support for both Ukraine and NATO.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/11/hungarys-orban-claims-trump-said-he-wont-give-a-penny-to-ukraine
Oppenheimer reigns supreme: Five takeaways from the 96th annual Oscars,"Christopher Nolan satisfies the Oscars’ cravings for meaty biopics, while protests for Gaza appear on the red carpet.","It was an explosive night at the96th annual Academy Awards, with the biopic Oppenheimer running away with themost trophies— and protesters taking advantage of the spotlight to call attention to the deadly conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine. Outside the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, California, traffic snarled to a standstill as demonstrators called for a ceasefire in Gaza, the Palestinian enclave that has been subject to a five-month-long Israeli military offensive. Inside the auditorium, actors and artists also used their wins to call for peace, drawing on themes presented in the various nominated films. With 13 nominations, the biopic Oppenheimer was the frontrunner going into the night’s ceremony. And it made good on early predictions about its Oscar success, with seven wins in major categories. Here are the night’s biggest takeaways. With its blistering portrayal of J Robert Oppenheimer, the so-called father of the atomic bomb, the film Oppenheimer started the night slowly but quickly built momentum, grabbing some of the ceremony’s biggest prizes. Robert Downey Jr scored the first win of the night with his much-expected Best Supporting Actor trophy. But his co-star Cillian Murphy faced tight competition in the Best Actor category — but he still made off with the golden statuette, prevailing over other leading men like Paul Giamatti. The film also delivered a long-awaited win in the Best Director category for Christopher Nolan, whose relationship with the Academy Awards stretches back over two decades. Nolan was first nominated for an Academy Award in 2002 for the memory-loss mystery Memento, but while his films have earned major prizes at the Oscars, Nolan himself had consistently come up empty-handed. That changed, however, with Sunday’s ceremony. Not only did Nolan grab Best Director, but his wife, producer Emma Thomas, took the stage with him to receive the Best Picture honour, the most-coveted trophy of the night. One of the final categories of the night was Best Actress — and the auditorium at the Dolby Theatre held its collective breath while the presenters unveiled the winner. The race was one of the tightest of the evening, but Lily Gladstone was widely believed to be the frontrunner, on the cusp of delivering a history-making win for her role in Killers of the Flower Moon. Never before had a Native American woman won the category, much less been nominated. Gladstone, a member of the Nez Perce and Blackfeet nations, played the role of Mollie Kyle, a real-life Osage woman who loses close family in a 1920s killing spree known as theOsage Reign of Terror. It was a quietly stunning performance, with Gladstone exuding steady intelligence in every scene. But in a surprise twist, she lost the Best Actress category to another top contender, Emma Stone, who delivered a zany, off-kilter performance in the surreal comedy Poor Things. With Gladstone’s loss, Killers of the Flower Moon was entirely shut out of the Oscar race, despite 10 nominations. Poor Things, meanwhile, picked up four wins, largely in technical categories like Best Production Design and Best Makeup and Hairstyling. On stage and off, however, world eventsdominated the conversation. Outside the Dolby Theatre, groups like the Los Angeles branch of Jewish Voice for Peace held up placards and chanted for a ceasefire in Gaza, blocking several lanes of traffic. Among the protesters was SAG-AFTRA Members for a Ceasefire, a group of working actors. The demonstrators said they sought to ensure that Israel’s assault on thesouthern Gaza city of Rafahwas not ignored, even amid the glitz and glamour of the evening. More than30,000 Palestinianshave been killed so far in Israel’s military offensive, which has prompted concerns over the risk ofgenocideandfamine. On the Oscar red carpet, appeals for peace in Gaza continued, with celebrities like singer Billie Eilish and Poor Things star Ramy Youssef sporting “Artists4Ceasefire” pins to raise awareness about the unfolding humanitarian crisis. “I think it’s a universal message of just: Let’s stop killing kids,” Youssef told the magazine Variety. “Let’s not be part of more war.” The director of the chilling Holocaust drama The Zone of Interest likewise lent his voice to the cause, while accepting his Oscar for Best International Feature. “Right now, we stand here as men who refute their Jewishness and the Holocaust being hijacked by an occupation that has led to conflict for so many innocent people, whether the victims of October 7 in Israel or the ongoing attack on Gaza,” he said to applause. The war in Gaza was not the only international conflict to grab the Oscar spotlight. With a win in the Best Documentary Feature category, the film 20 Days in Mariupol renewed attention about the ongoingRussian invasionof Ukraine. It has been more thantwo yearssince Russia launched its full-scale military assault in February 2022. With his documentary, filmmaker Mstyslav Chernov captured the early days of that war, as the southeastern city ofMariupolfaced Russian bombs. Chernov’s win in the category was historic. He explained from the Oscar stage that he was bringing home Ukraine’s first Oscar but that he would trade it all for peace in his homeland. “Probably, I’m the first director on this stage who will say: I wish I had never made this film. I wish to be able to exchange this to Russia never attacking Ukraine, never occupying our cities,” he said with deep emotion as he faced the crowd. “But I cannot change the history. I cannot change the past,” he continued, appealing to the filmmakers in the audience to continue to shine a light on Ukraine. “We can make sure the history record is set straight and that the truth will prevail, and that the people of Mariupol and those who have given their lives will never be forgotten. Because cinema forms memories and memories form history.” Currently, the US Congress is struggling topass aidto Ukraine, amid Republicanoppositionto the funding. The political divides in the US — and thepresidential electionlooming in November — also briefly coloured the night’s events. The Oscars delivered its usual mash-up of spectacle and glamour. In one of the night’s highlights, Canadian actor Ryan Gosling took to the stage for a live performance of his Barbie-themed power ballad I’m Just Ken, dressed in a sparkly pink suit and backed by cowboy-hatted dancers. In another eye-popping moment, actor and wrestler John Cena appeared naked on stage to present the Best Costume prize. But four-time Oscar host Jimmy Kimmel couldn’t resist sprinkling a little political humour into the night’s movie-themed zingers. He first took a shot at Katie Britt, a US senator from Alabama who recently delivered the rebuttal to President Joe Biden’sState of the Unionspeech. Kimmel compared Britt to the Frankenstein-like heroine of Poor Things, brought to life by Oscar-winner Stone. “Emma played an adult woman with the brain of a child, like the lady that gave the rebuttal to the State of the Union on Thursday night,” Kimmel quipped. Then, before the night closed, Kimmel reappeared on stage to read a mean social media post directed at him. Its author? Former US PresidentDonald Trump, a frequent target of Kimmel’s comedy. “Has there ever been a worse host than Jimmy Kimmel at The Oscars?” Kimmel said, reading from his phone screen. Looking up, he addressed the former president, who facesfour criminal indictments, directly: “Thanks for watching. Isn’t it past your jail time?”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/11/oppenheimer-reigns-supreme-five-takeaways-from-the-96th-academy-awards

Ukraine rejects pope’s call to ‘raise the white flag’ to end Russia’s war,"The Catholic leader, 87, told a Swiss broadcaster that Ukraine should negotiate with Russia and raised the idea of surrender.","Ukraine has rejected Pope Francis’s call to hold negotiations with Russia more than two years into its invasion, saying that Kyiv will “never” surrender. “Our flag is a yellow and blue one. This is the flag by which we live, die, and prevail. We shall never raise any other flags,” Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on social media Sunday, a day after the pope said Kyiv should “have the courage to raise the white flag”. The 87-year-old Catholic leader said in an interview with Swiss broadcaster RTS that Ukraine should negotiate with Russia, which has seized large swathes of Ukrainian territory since it launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. In part of the interview released on Saturday, the Catholic leader raised the prospect of surrender. “I believe that the strongest are those who see the situation, think about the people, and have the courage to raise the white flag and negotiate,” Pope Francis said in an interview that the Vatican said was conducted in early February. Kuleba called on the pope to stand “on the side of good” and not put the opposing sides “on the same footing and call it ‘negotiations'”. The strongest is the one who, in the battle between good and evil, stands on the side of good rather than attempting to put them on the same footing and call it “negotiations”. At the same time, when it comes to the white flag, we know this Vatican's strategy from the first half… — Dmytro Kuleba (@DmytroKuleba)March 10, 2024  Kuleba also appeared to reference some Catholic church collaboration with Nazi forces during World War II when he said the following: “At the same time, when it comes to the white flag, we know this Vatican strategy from the first half of the 20th century.” “I urge to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past and to support Ukraine and its people in their just struggle for their lives,” Kuleba added. He also thanked Pope Francis for his “constant prayers for peace” and said Kyiv hoped he would visit Ukraine. “We continue to hope that after two years of devastating war in the heart of Europe, the Pontiff will find an opportunity to pay an Apostolic visit to Ukraine to support over a million Ukrainian Catholics, over five million Greek-Catholics and all Ukrainians,” Kuleba said. The foreign minister of Poland, a vocal ally of Kyiv, also condemned the pope’s remarks. “How about, for balance, encouraging Putin to have the courage to withdraw his army from Ukraine? Peace would immediately ensue without the need for negotiations,” Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said in a post on X. How about, for balance, encouraging Putin to have the courage to withdraw his army from Ukraine?Peace would immediately ensue without the need for negotiations.https://t.co/gWNYSUt79u — Radosław Sikorski 🇵🇱🇪🇺 (@sikorskiradek)March 10, 2024  In a separate post, Sikorski made parallels between those calling for negotiations while “denying [Ukraine] the means to defend itself” and European leaders’ “appeasement” of Adolf Hitler before World War II. Andrii Yurash, Ukraine’s ambassador to the Holy See, compared the pope’s comments to calls for “talking with Hitler” while raising “a white flag to satisfy him”. Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk, the head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, also said Sunday that surrender is not on the minds of Ukrainians. “Ukraine is wounded, but unconquered! Ukraine is exhausted, but it stands and will endure. Believe me, it never crosses anyone’s mind to surrender. Even where there is fighting today: listen to our people in Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Odesa, Kharkiv, Sumy,” he said. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni later clarified that the pope supported “a stop to hostilities [and] a truce achieved with the courage of negotiations”, rather than an outright Ukrainian surrender. While Pope Francis has tried to maintain the Vatican’s traditional diplomatic neutrality, he has also expressed some sympathy with the Russian rationale for invading Ukraine, such as when he noted that NATO was “barking at Russia’s door” with its eastward expansion. Ukraine has remained steadfast on not engaging directly with Russia on peace talks, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy saying multiple times that peace negotiations must come from the country that has been invaded.

Zelenskyy said the talks had been “sincere and fruitful”, though he refrained from alluding to the mooted peace summit in a statement released on X after the meeting.

Zelenskyy also thanked Erdogan for his efforts in negotiating the release of Ukrainian prisoners “held in Russian prisons and camps under extremely harsh and inhumane conditions”.

Turkey’s strategic location on the Black Sea and its control of the Bosphorus Strait gives it a unique military, political and economic role in the conflict. Shortly after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Turkey hosted failed ceasefire talks between Kyiv and Moscow. “Both sides have now reached the limit of what they can achieve through war,” Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said this month. “We think it’s time to start a dialogue towards a ceasefire.” In July 2022, Ankara with the United Nations brokered the Black Sea Grain deal, the most significant diplomatic agreement so far reached between Kyiv and Moscow. But Moscow ditched the initiative a year later, complaining that the terms were unfair. Kyiv has since used an alternative shipping route hugging the coastline to avoid contested international waters. The Erdogan-Zelenskyy meeting comes a week after Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov met his Turkish counterpart Fidan at a diplomatic forum in Antalya. Russian President Vladimir Putin was set to visit Turkey last month, but postponed the trip, according to Turkish and Russian media citing diplomatic sources.

Ukraine’s former commander-in-chief appointed ambassador to UK,"Zaluzhnyi, known as the ‘Iron General’, had seen his once sky-high popularity falter after a failed counteroffensive.","Ukraine has namedValerii Zaluzhnyiits new envoy to the United Kingdom a month after he was removed from his position as the country’s military commander-in-chief. “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine sent a request to the British side for an agreement,” the foreign ministry said in a statement on Thursday. Ukraine has not had an ambassador in the UK since President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dismissed former envoy Vadym Prystaiko in July 2023 after he publicly criticised the leader. Zaluzhnyi had led the Ukrainian army since the start of the war against Russia, pushing back a vastly more powerful invading force in the first months of the conflict. Dubbed the “Iron General” by Ukrainian media, Zaluzhnyi came to symbolise the country’s resistance and enjoyed sky-high approval ratings among the public. But the failure of a much-vaunted counteroffensive last summer and public disagreement with Zelenskyy tarnished his reputation in the president’s office. He was replaced in February by Oleksandr Syrskii, who commanded Ukraine’s lightning autumn 2022 counteroffensive in the northeastern Kharkiv region. At the time of Zaluzhnyi’s dismissal, Zelenskyy took to X to thank the military leader for his two years of service and said that the time had come for changes in the military leadership. Zaluzhnyi himself conceded that Ukraine’s military strategy “must change” after roughly two years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion. “The tasks of 2022 are different from those of 2024. Therefore, everyone must change and adapt to the new realities as well in order to win together,” he wrote. “The war does not remain the same. War changes and demands change. New approaches and new strategies are needed,” Ukraine’s Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said at the time of his dismissal. On Thursday, UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps visited Kyiv, Zelenskyy said on X. “Our primary focus was on bolstering Ukraine’s air defence and long-range capabilities, as well as meeting other urgent needs for weapons and ammunition and developing joint weapon production,” he said.

"Russia’s presidential election: Putin, power, the possibility of protests",The 71-year-old president is all but certain to win another term in a vote that begins on March 15.,"Russian PresidentVladimir Putinis all but certain to win his fifth election. But according to the 2020 constitutional amendment that “nullified” his previous terms, the March 15-17 election is going to be his “first”. Putin announced his candidacy in December during a choreographed ceremony in a lavishly decorated Kremlin hall when talking to a separatist “colonel” from the southeastern Ukrainian region of Donbas. “On behalf of all of our people, our Donbas, the lands that reunited [with Russia], I wanted to ask you to take part in this election,” Artyom Zhoga, clad in an impeccable uniform adorned with medals, told Putin. “I’m not going to hide it, I’ve had different thoughts at different times, but now is the time to make a decision, and I will run,” poker-faced Putin replied. He has served four. He was elected president in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, 2012, and 2018. If he wins, as expected, he will serve another six years, thanks to constitutional amendments that have expanded the term. This would mark his fifth term. He can then be re-elected again in 2030 for a sixth term. That means he could be in power until 2036, when he will be 83 years old. The 71-year-old ex-KGB spy is already Russia’s longest-serving leader since Soviet leader Josef Stalin. Putin’s increasingly iron-fisted treatment of opposition, critics and antiwar protesters has been widely compared with Stalin’s “big terror” campaigns. But to Kremlin loyalists, Putin is a political “genius” who prevented Russia’s disintegration, reigned in billionaire oligarchs and subdued Chechen separatists. Putin’s supporters also call him a “gatherer of Russian lands”, an honourable sobriquet for Russian princes and czars, for waging the 2008 war on ex-Soviet Georgia, recognising two breakaway Georgian statelets, annexing Crimea in 2014 and parts of four more Ukrainian regions in 2022. On February 16, Alexey Navalny, Putin’s most outspoken political opponent, died in an Arctic prison in what his family, supporters, and much of the international communityclaimed was political murder. Navalny was denied registration in the 2018 presidential election that Putin won with almost 78 percent of the vote. Two more opposition figures – Ilya Yashin and Vladimir Kaza-Murza – have been sentenced to eight-and-a-half years and 25 years in jail, respectively, for their criticism of Putin’s war in Ukraine. Thousands more – opposition figures, critics and average Russians who posted an antiwar comment online or simply liked or shared one – have faced criminal charges. Tens of thousands have been arrested, fined or forced out of the country. In addition, at least a million Russian men fled after the war, especially following the September 2022 announcement of “mobilisation”. “I’ve got nothing to do with this farce. They wanted me to die, they wanted my son to be an orphan,” Demyan, a 32-year-old web designer who fled to Georgia and then to southern Portugal in late 2022, told Al Jazeera. Authorities largely do not prevent their exodus. But they adopted a law allowing confiscation of their property for “criticising the special military operation”, the Kremlin’s preferred euphemism for the war in Ukraine. Some 79 percent of Russians intend to vote for Putin, according to a February survey by VTsIOM, a Kremlin-controlled pollster. Some everyday Russians await the vote with apathy and hopelessness after adapting to the wartime reality around them. “Everyone seems to have gotten used to the situation, gave up or sometimes even began to gain from it,” Mikhail, a freelance copywriter from a Moscow suburb, told Al Jazeera. “The shock has been replaced with apathy and depression.” This is the first vote in Russian history that lasts three days instead of one. It is also the first time voters in 29 regions can vote online. Some 112 million people aged 18 and above in Russia are eligible to vote. People in annexed Crimea and occupied parts of Ukraine will also vote, a move Kyiv and its Western allies have condemned as illegitimate. Millions of Russian nationals living abroad – from the Russia-leased spaceport of Baikonur in southern Kazakhstan to California in the United States – can also vote in embassies, consulates or by mail. At least 61 percent of Russians are “definitely” taking part in the vote, according to a poll by FOM, a Kremlin-funded pollster, released on March 5. Another 16 percent are “likely” to cast their ballots, and only 9 percent will abstain from the vote, the poll said. Initial results are expected to be announced on March 19, with the final outcome to be revealed on March 29. The officially-expected turnout is nearly as high as during the 2018 vote, when almost 68 percent of Russians cast their ballots, according to official figures. In 2018, independent election monitors documented thousands of cases of vote rigging, including ballot stuffing and “carousels”, when hundreds of voters are bussed to multiple polling stations. Some of the monitors faced threats and were denied access to polling stations.    The vote was “overly controlled” and “lacked genuine competition”, said the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, an international election observer. Authorities coerced government employees, servicemen and law enforcement officers to vote for Putin, it said. Observers who follow Russian politics have little hope the vote will be carried out in a free and fair manner. Putin is running as an independent candidate because the ruling United Russia party is widely seen as corrupt and inefficient. Late opposition leader Navalny dubbed it the “party of crooks and thieves”. Other candidates are seen as figureheads whose participation is only supposed to show how “popular” Putin is. One is Nikolay Kharitonov of the Communist Party. He took part in the 2004 vote and finished a distant second. Another is Leonid Slutsky of the nationalist Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR). He has been accused of sexually harassing a journalist. Slutsky called the accusations part of a “conspiracy” against him. Slutsky replaces Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a flamboyant populist who ran against Putin four times and was widely compared with former United States President Donald Trump, as the LDPR presidential nominee. He died in 2020. And while the Communist and LDPR candidates are relatively known, the third registered candidate, Vladislav Davankov of the New People party, is obscure and barely known outside Moscow. All three are part of the “systemic opposition”, a handful of parties with a presence in the State Duma, Russia’s lower house of parliament.    All three back the war in Ukraine and generally support the Kremlin party line. Between 2 percent and 4 percent of Russians are expected to vote for each of them, according to the VtsIOM poll. Liberal opposition candidate Boris Nadezhdin was denied registration because of allegedly “invalid” signatures of support in his candidate application. Nadezhdin, who openly criticised the war in Ukraine, said he would recruit independent election monitors and has promised to keep fighting against the Supreme Court rulings against him. But there is no chance he will be able to run. He told Al Jazeerain early February that he was excluded “because my election rating, the number of people who are ready to vote for me grows 5 percent a week”. In the winter of 2011-12, some of the largest opposition rallies in Russia’s post-Soviet victory took place after the parliamentary and presidential votes that were widely seen as rigged. The Kremlin responded with a massive crackdown. It now has more advanced tools to silence opposition – facial recognition software and mobile phone data to identify each protester. Any protests “will be disunited and badly organised”, said Sergey Biziyukin, an opposition activist from the western city of Ryazan who was forced out of Russia after trying to register for the 2018 presidential vote. “Most of the populace, irrespective of their attitude to Putin, the elections look staged,” he told Al Jazeera.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/7/russias-presidential-election-putin-power-the-possibility-of-protests
"FM Wang Yi insists China ‘force for peace’, defends Russian ties","Speaking at a rare news conference in Beijing, Wang Yi calls for peace talks  to bring two-year-old Ukraine conflict to an end.","China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi has said China sees itself as a “force for peace” in the world, even as it pursues deeper ties with Russia despite Moscow’s invasion of neighbouring Ukraine. “In the face of complex turmoil in the international environment, China will persist in being a force for peace, a force for stability, and a force for progress in the world,” Wang told reporters at a press conference in Beijing on Thursday, on the sidelines of the country’s annual meeting of its parliament. Wang, who spoke in Mandarin, was also asked about China’s relationship with Russia, which began itsfull-scale invasion of Ukrainein February 2022. The two countries announced a “no limits” partnership shortly before the invasion, as Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Beijing, and visiting Moscow last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping hailed a “new era” of cooperation. The foreign minister said Beijing and Moscow’s closer relationship was a “strategic choice”, noting that bilateral trade had reached a record $240bn in 2023. “New opportunities” lay ahead, he added, portraying the two countries’ ties as a “new paradigm” in the relations between big powers. “Major countries should not seek conflict and the Cold War should not be allowed to come back,” Wang said. China has positioned itself as a neutral party in the Ukraine war, and on the first anniversary of the conflict, released a12-point peace plancalling for a ceasefire and talks between the two parties. On Thursday, Wang insisted that Beijing maintained an “objective and impartial position” on Ukraine and called again for peace talks, noting that peace envoy Li Hui was currently in the region. “A conflict, when prolonged, tends to deteriorate and escalate and could lead to an even bigger crisis,” Wang said. During the wide-ranging discussion, which lasted for 90 minutes, 70-year-old Wang was also asked about issues including the conflict in Gaza, China’s relationship with the United States, and the disputed South China Sea. The veteran diplomat called Israel’s five-month-long war in Gaza and the world’s apparent inability to stop the bloodshed, a “tragedy for humanity and a disgrace for civilisation”. Israel sent its forces into the territory after Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2006, launched an assault on Israel on October 7, killing 1,139 people and kidnapping some 250 Israelis and foreigners. At least 30,717 Palestinians have been killed in the bombardments since amid a collapse in the health system and a growing risk ofstarvation. Hamas released some of the captives during a ceasefire in November but is thought to still be holding about 100 people. Urging the release of “all detainees”, Wang called for an immediate ceasefire and peace talks. “The calamity in Gaza is a wakeup call for the world,” he said. Talks brokered by Egypt, Qatar and the US to reach a six-week ceasefire ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan have so farfailed to achieve a breakthrough. Wang also reiterated China’s longstanding commitment to a two-state solution, saying it was the only way to achieve an end to the conflict. He also said China supported Palestine’s “full” membership of the United Nations. On relations with the US, which recovered some equilibrium late last year after the countries’ two presidentsmet in San Francisco, Wang struck a note of optimism even as he lashed out at Washington for sanctions that he said had reached a “bewildering level of unfathomable absurdity”. Noting the US and China were due to mark 45 years of formal bilateral ties this year, Wang said China wanted relations that were “stable and consistent” and that Washington could work with Beijing on the basis of “mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation.” The two sides have been at odds over a range of issues from Taiwan to trade and an alleged Chinese spy balloon that was shot down after crossing into the US last year. Wang reiterated China’s claim over Taiwan, a self-ruled island that Beijing maintains is part of its territory, and said those who sought independence would be “liquidated by history”. He also had sharp warnings over the disputed South China Sea where China, whichclaims almost the entire seadespite an international tribunal ruling it without merit, has been involved in multiple confrontations with the Philippines in recent months. In the latest incident on Tuesday, the Philippines said its boat wasdamagedby a Chinese coastguard ship that tried to block a resupply mission to the disputed Second Thomas Shoal, which lies about 200km (124 miles) from the western Philippine island of Palawan and more than 1,000km (621 miles) from China’s southern Hainan Island. Manila has moved closer to the USamid the growing tension in the strategic waters where China also deploys a maritime militia and its fishing fleet. Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam also claim the parts of the South China Sea around their coasts. “We resolutely oppose all acts of hegemony and bullying, and will strongly uphold national sovereignty and security as well as development interests,” Wang said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/7/fm-wang-yi-insists-china-force-for-peace-defends-russian-ties
Russia attacks Ukraine’s Odesa as Greek PM visits war-stricken city,"At least five people killed in attack, a navy spokesperson was quoted as saying by Ukrainska Pravda media outlet.","Several people have been killed in a Russian strike on Ukraine’s port city of Odesa, according to a spokesperson for Ukraine’s navy. The attack came as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was giving a tour of the war-ravaged city to Greece’s prime minister on Wednesday. Russia said it successfully attacked a hangar housing Ukrainian naval drones in a strike on the port. “The goal has been achieved. The target has been hit,” the Russian Defence Ministry said in a statement. Zelenskyy was showing Greek PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis around the destruction inthe city where 12 people – including five children – were killedin a drone attack on March 2 at the time of the Russian strike. “You see who we’re dealing with, they don’t care where to hit,”Zelenskyytold reporters following the attack on Wednesday. Mitsotakis said the delegations were getting into their cars when they heard the blast, which he said is a “vivid reminder” that the city is embroiled in war with Russia. It is one thing to hear about the war and “quite another to experience war firsthand”, Mitsotakis said.    At least five people were killed in the attack, a navy spokesperson was quoted as saying by the Ukrainska Pravda media outlet. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen condemned the “vile attack”, which she described in a post on X as a “new attempt at terror” by Russia. Over the course of the conflict, foreign leaders have made numerous trips to Ukraine, occasionally having to take refuge in shelters when air raid sirens sound. Russia has ramped up its attacks on port infrastructure since mid-July, when it quit a United Nations-brokered deal that allowed the safe passage of Ukrainian grain shipments via the Black Sea.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/6/ukraines-odesa-hit-in-attack-as-greek-pm-was-touring-war-stricken-city
Russia takes more ground in east Ukraine but loses another ship at sea,"Ukraine’s naval drones score another hit in the past week, but its troops continue to fall back in Donetsk.","Russian troops continued a relentless march in eastern Ukraine for a third straight week, giving defenders no respite since seizing Avdiivka on February 17. Geolocated footage on February 29 showed Russian troops had advanced 5km (3 miles) west of Avdiivka to the outskirts of Orlivka and Berdychi. The following day, they were in central Orlivka. By Monday, they were spotted close to a road that connects Orlivka to the village of Tonenke to its south. By the estimate of the Russian Ministry of Defence, it took Moscow’s forces four months to advance 9km (5.6 miles) through the Donetsk region before seizing Avdiivka. By that standard, 5km in three weeks – including 3km (nearly 2 miles) in the past week alone – was fast progress. It was a similar story west of Bakhmut, another city in Donetsk, which Russian forces captured in May. Ukrainian forces said on Sunday that they were fighting fierce battles to hold onto Ivanivske, a village 2km (1.2 miles) west of Bakhmut. Geolocated footage showed Russian troops making their way into the village centre that day. “Our military is heroically resisting and trying to repel the enemy from the occupied lines,” said Captain Ilya Yevlash, a spokesperson for the defenders in the area. A spokesperson for the Tavria group of forces fighting there said they were managing to build tank trenches, ramparts and bunkers but these were isolated, not contiguous. It may not have been a coincidence that Ukraine’s military on Sunday announced record spending on fortifications in the Zaporizhia region on the southern front. Russian troops claimed to have advanced marginally at many points along the battlefront in Donetsk. Another advance was confirmed in the village of Novomykhailivka. Geolocated footage published on Tuesday showed Russian forces in the fields south of the settlement “I don’t buy … that this is going to shift the course of the war,” retired US Colonel Seth Krummrich told Al Jazeera. “Show me the map. Show me what’s been achieved in two years. … I see maybe one-eighteenth [of Ukrainian territory] in Russian control at the cost of 250,000 to 500,000 casualties. I don’t see imminent victory by the Russians,” said Krummrich, now vice president of Global Guardian, a security consulting firm. Yet the situation was worrying enough to bring Ukraine’s newly installed commander-in-chief, Oleksandr Syrskii, to the eastern front for three days. On Friday, Syrskii revealed he had made command personnel changes and reinforced decision-making in some brigades around Avdiivka. “I have sent groups of specialists to individual brigades where there are problems … to transfer experience and provide assistance,” he said. “In some cases, when … the actions and commands directly pose a threat to the life and health of subordinates, I am forced to make personnel decisions.” There appear to be qualitative changes in Russia’s tactics that could spell trouble for Ukraine. The Russian assault on Bakhmut last year relied heavily on pardoned prison inmates who were thrown into battle in continuous waves with little training and suffered heavy casualties. A number of Ukrainian soldiers who fought in Avdiivka recently told The Washington Post that the Russian assaults were well-prepared and the units well-manned and mostly well-trained. They also said Russian artillery targeting was accurate and fast. Ukrainian fallback positions were being shelled soon after Ukrainian defenders reached them, and a column of retreating troops was decimated, they added. “It was … a convoy of the best men ever. And in front of our eyes, this convoy was destroyed by artillery,” one survivor said. Perhaps most worrying was Russia’s effective use of air support to drop satellite-guided glide bombs – inertial bombs fitted with flight surfaces to achieve greater range and accuracy. Ukraine’s air force has been taking out the Sukhoi-34 and Sukhoi-35 fighter-bombers that deliver those bombs in increasing numbers, including six Su-34s on February 28 and 29 alone. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Kyiv’s forces had shot down 15 Russian military planes from February 1 to Sunday, an unusually high number. Russia may have decided to accept higher losses for increased firepower on the ground. Forbes and The New York Times have reported that Russia was adopting more aggressive air tactics, conducting an increased rate of 100 or more sorties a day on the eastern front. Observers have blamed Republicans in the United States Congress for holding up aid to Ukraine as the biggest cause for Russian advances. “The collapse of Western aid to Ukraine would likely lead to the eventual collapse of Ukraine’s ability to hold off the Russian military and significant Russian advances further west, likely all the way to the western Ukrainian border with NATO member states,” wrote the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank. Zelenskyy warned on February 25 that Russian forces were planning a major new offensive as early as May. Russia’s war on Ukraine’s will to fight scored a direct hit on Friday when a Russian drone demolished a nine-storey apartment building in Odesa, killing at least 12 people. It was the deadliest attack of the past week and one of the worst this year. “The delay in the supply of weapons for Ukraine, air defence systems for the protection of our people leads, unfortunately, to such losses,” Zelenskyy said after the attack. Ukrainian air force spokesperson Yuri Ignat said on Tuesday that it was not possible to protect Odesa from all missiles and drones. “Odesa is … a densely populated city bordering the coast, large buildings, infrastructure. The location of air defence in the Odesa region is built in such a way that it is not always possible to intercept both drones and missiles on the approaches to the city itself,” Ignat said. Another drone struck Odesa on Wednesday as Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis met with Zelenskyy in the city. Ukraine’s air defences downed 36 of 43 drones that Russia launched from February 29 to Tuesday, but officials have warned that it could run out of missiles for its air defence batteries without further support. Maksym Timchenko, who runs Ukraine’s largest electricity utility, told the Financial Times that Ukraine was better prepared for Russia’s first drone onslaught on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure last winter, and that increasingly in recent weeks, drones were reaching their targets. Russia had targeted energy infrastructure no fewer than 160 times just this year, he said. The brightest spot for Ukraine during the week was its sinking of the Russian patrol ship Sergei Kotov near the Kerch Bridge off eastern Crimea early on Tuesday. Ukrainian military intelligence’s Group 13 launched Magura V naval drones, which Ukraine claims to be the fastest in the Black Sea. Military intelligence spokesman Andriy Yusov said the ship suffered five direct hits. The final pair of drones seemed to detonate inside the hull, which had been ripped open by previous explosions. Group 13 has undertaken previous special operations with naval drones, sometimes in cooperation with the Security Service of Ukraine, sinking or disabling from one-third to half of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/6/russia-takes-more-ground-in-east-ukraine-but-loses-another-ship-at-sea
ICC seeks arrest of Russian officers over infrastructure attacks in Ukraine,It is the second time the court has announced arrest warrants for Russian officials in relation to the war in Ukraine.,"The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for high-ranking Russian commanders Sergei Kobylash and Viktor Sokolov over alleged war crimes in Ukraine, it said in a statement. The ICC said on Tuesday that the pair were responsible for “missile strikes carried out by the forces under their command” against Ukrainian electric infrastructure from at least October 10, 2022, until at least March 9, 2023. “During this timeframe, there was an alleged campaign of strikes against numerous electric power plants and sub-stations, which were carried out by the Russian armed forces in multiple locations in Ukraine,” the court said. The warrants mark the second such warrants issued calling for the arrest of Russian officials related to thewar in Ukraine, a conflict which recently hit the two-year mark. In March last year, the ICC issuedarrest warrantsfor President Vladimir Putin and Children’s Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova on war crimes charges related to the abduction of Ukrainian children. The Kremlin has rejected the allegations. The ICC said the attacks led by Koblylash and Sokolov on Ukraine’s electrical grid caused civilian harm which was excessive when compared with any expected military advantage. Before the ICC’s announcement, Ukraine’s prosecutors were already investigating possible war crimes after a winter campaign of air raids on Ukrainian energy and utilities infrastructure. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy welcomed the ICC’s decision on Tuesday. “Every Russian commander who orders strikes against Ukrainian civilians and critical infrastructure must know that justice will be served. Every perpetrator of such crimes must know that they will be held accountable,” he said on social media platform X.    Russia has denied deliberately targeting civilian infrastructure in Ukraine, saying that its attacks are conducted to limit Kyiv’s ability to fight. The Geneva Conventions and additional protocols under international courts say that militaries should distinguish between “civilian objects and military objectives”, without attacking the former. However, some infrastructure owned and used by civilians can also be a military target, with some experts arguing civilian power plants or railways could fall into this category. As with Putin and Lvova-Belova, there is little prospect that either Kobylash or Sokolov will be turned over to face trial in The Hague. Russia is not a member of the court, does not recognise its jurisdiction and refuses to hand over suspects charged by the court.

Russia accuses Western ambassadors of meddling in internal affairs,"Moscow hit out at envoys claiming they refused to meet with foreign minister, as relations continue to deteriorate.","Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has accused Western ambassadors in Moscow of meddling in its internal affairs and questioned their function. The statement on Tuesday followed complaints from Moscow’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov the previous day that ambassadors from European Union countries had refused to meet him. The rebuke comes with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine having pushed relations with the West to their lowest ebb in decades. Lavrov said on March 4 that he had invited EU envoys for a conversation ahead of Russia’s March 15-17 presidential election but that they had refused.There was no immediate reaction from Western diplomats. However, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova revived the subject on Tuesday on Russian state television. “The question indeed arises among everyone: what are they doing, and why, how do they interpret their conduct on the territory of our country if they do not perform their most important function?” Zakharova declared to anchor Vladimir Solovyov. Solovyov noted that EU ambassadors attended the March 1funeral of opposition politician Alexei Navalny, whom he labelled their agent. Navalny, whose death at an Arctic prison colony was announced on February 16, always denied he was a Western agent.    Zakharova said such behaviour showed Western ambassadors in Moscow were meddling in Russia’s affairs and putting on “performances” rather than doing their diplomatic work. The banner headline on Solovyov’s television show read: “Should the EU ambassadors be sent out?” The West is grappling with what support it will give to Kyiv after Russian forces regained the initiative on the battlefield after a failed Ukrainian counteroffensive last year. Diplomatic relations between Russia and the West continue to deteriorate as the war grinds on. Last week, President Vladimir Putin reiterated his claim that Russia is fighting defensively against a Western proxy war that risks provoking nuclear conflict. Even at a petty level, agreement is scarce. Russian media last week published an audio recording of a meeting of senior German military officials discussing sending missiles to Ukraine. Reports said on Monday that Moscow hadsummonedGermany’s envoy over the issue, but Berlin said the meeting had long been scheduled. Ambassador Alexander Graf Lambsdorff was also scolded over attempts by Berlin to restrict the activities of Russian journalists in Germany, Zakharova claimed on Tuesday. “If they touch Russian correspondents and bring their plans to conclusion, German journalists will leave Russia,” she asserted.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/5/russia-says-western-ambassadors-are-meddling-in-russias-affairs
Russia spins German military leak but chances of escalation slim: Analysis,"Russia intercepted a call that revealed top-level talk on striking the Kerch Bridge. But analysts say while Berlin may be embarrassed, it’s far from planning an attack.","Russian propagandistsmade surethe German military’s most embarrassing leak in years would look like an episode of the 1941-1945 Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union. “Comrades in uniforms,” or Russian intelligence services, intercepted a 38-minute-long conversation between German Air Force chief Lieutenant-General Ingo Gerhartz with his officers, Margarita Simonyan, the head of the Kremlin-funded RT television network, wrote on social media on Friday. “The bridge in the east is hard to hit, it’s a rather small target, but [German-made] Taurus [missiles] can do it, can also hit the ammunition depots,” one of the officers told Gerhartz, according to the leak Simonyanpostedonline. The bridge in question, the Kerch Bridge, is a $4bn, 19km long (12 miles) lacework of steel and concrete that links Crimea to mainland Russia. To the Kremlin, the link is both geographic and metaphoric and epitomised the success of Crimea’s 2014 takeover from Ukraine that skyrocketed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s approval ratings and paved the way for the ongoing war. To Ukraine, the bridge’s destruction would mean the disruption of a key supply route and a symbolic blow to the Kremlin’s determination to win the war. And the Taurus missiles could help achieve just that. They are equipped with stealth technology that makes them hard to detect by Russian air defence systems. But the scandal will not result in Germany’s involvement in the war, observers say. “So far, this will only affect the improvement of the security system during such talks and the identification of methods the Russian intelligence services used to make the recording,” Nikolay Mitrokhin of Germany’s University of Bremen told Al Jazeera. And no matter how much the Kremlin spins the scandal, to Germans, it “isn’t changing that much”, said Andreas Umland, a German political scientist who works for the Swedish Institute of International Affairs. “It’s a big topic in Russia, but in Germany, it’s mainly a topic in terms of how this leak was possible and how the Russians were able to get this recording. The content is a secondary issue, actually,” Umland told Al Jazeera. German officials said the audio was intercepted from a call happening on Cisco’s WebEx platform that has security flaws allowing potential hackers to join conversations as “ghosts”. The leak makes German Chancellor Olaf Scholz look weak, said Umland. “The conversation is undermining the Scholz narrative that the Taurus missile can only be used with assistance from Germany, and that’s why Germany cannot give them over to Ukraine,” he said. It also makes Germany look careless and untrustworthy to its Western allies, says a former Russian diplomat. “This may decrease the coordination of Europe’s efforts, the Germans will be less trusted,” Boris Bondarev, who quit his job as a member of Russia’s delegation to the United Nations in Genevato protest the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, told Al Jazeera. “[Scholz] most likely will hide his head in the sand even deeper,” he said. “I hardly believe in Berlin’s determination.”  Kyiv has long been urging Berlin, Ukraine’s second-largest provider of military aid after Washington,to supply the missilesthat have a range of up to 500km (310 miles). With this range, the missiles could hit targets deep within Russia, but Berlin has adamantly refused to supply them as it is also worried that Russia could get hold of a missile or two to steal its stealth technology. But the officers in the leaked conversation discussed the possibility of providing Kyiv with the missiles – and training Ukrainian servicemen to operate them. The training “may take three or four months”, one of the Germans said in the leak that she claimed took place on February 19. “This part of training may take place in Germany.” They also mentioned “many people in civilian clothes that speak with an American accent”, making the open secret about the presence of US instructors in Ukraine even more open. Germany’s Ministry of Defence confirmed the conversation was indeed “intercepted”, but could not say “whether changes have been made to the recorded or written version that is circulating on social media”. “It’s part of an information war Putin is waging” against the West, German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said on Saturday. “It’s a hybrid attack aimed at disinformation. It’s about division. It’s about undermining our resolve,” he said. And when bristling at Berlin, propagandist Simonyan referred to its 1945 takeover by Soviet troops that was followed by the division of Germany into the pro-Soviet East and the capitalist West that ended only in 1990. “Is this a high time for Russia to actively remind Germany how the blowing-up of Russian bridges ended for Germany last time?” quipped Simonyan, who has been blacklisted in the West for backing the annexation and the war. Other Russian public figures eagerly followed her rhetoric. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said NATO was “caught red-handed”. “If nothing is done, and the German people do not stop this, then there will be dire consequences first and foremost for Germany itself,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. Her words touched a nerve. The USSR lost 27 million people during the war, and many residents of former Soviet republics still associate the term for German air forces, Luftwaffe, with the harrowing and indiscriminate bombing of Soviet cities (including those in today’s Ukraine). Scholz’s reluctance to send the troops – let alone advanced weapons – echoes the feeling of guilt towards the Soviet Union and Russia that generations of Germans have been raised with. “We will not send European soldiers to Ukraine. We don’t want a war between Russia and NATO. And we will do all we can to prevent it,” Scholz said on Saturday. He responded to the suggestion of French President Emmanuel Macron, who on February 26 said the possible deployment of NATO troops to Ukraine was not “ruled out”. When Scholz said that a thorough check should be conducted, Simonyan immediately responded with a sarcastic: “You can turn to us, we can help with the check.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/5/russia-spins-german-military-leak-but-chances-of-escalation-slim-analysis
"Russian Black Sea ship Sergey Kotov sunk after drone strike, says Ukraine",Kyiv’s military intelligence unit says it sank the patrol ship Sergey Kotov near the Crimean peninsula.,"Ukraine claims to have destroyed a Russian military patrol boat near the annexed Crimean peninsula. The country’s military intelligence unit, GUR, said on Tuesday that it had hit the Sergey Kotov with drones. It reported that the patrol ship had sunk, making it the latest victim in a series of attacks on Russia’s Black Sea Fleet. Posting on the Telegram messaging app, GUR said that the vessel was destroyed by special unit Group 13 near the Kerch Strait, which sits between Crimea and Russia. The military intelligence unit published a video on social media, claiming that the grainy footage depicted the ship being downed. 📽️ Як топили «сєрґєя котова» ― відео знищення патрульного корабля чф рф 🔗https://t.co/UNfZROKTBWpic.twitter.com/llI1MoWyDY — Defence intelligence of Ukraine (@DI_Ukraine)March 5, 2024  It was not the first timeUkrainehad attacked the ship, reportedly worth $65m. However, this time, the overnight strike caused critical “damage to the stern, starboard and port sides”. Military intelligence spokesman Andriy Yusov said the strike had left some dead and wounded, but it was likely some crew members had managed to evacuate. In an apparent reference to the attack, the Ukrainian president’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said on Telegram that Russia’s Black Sea Fleet – based in the peninsula’s port of Sevastopol – is “a symbol of the occupation,” adding that, “it cannot be in Ukraine’s Crimea”. There has been no official response from the Russian defence ministry. The Black Sea has become an increasingly important battleground of Russia’s two-year invasion. In recent months, Ukraine has mounted a series of attacks on the Black Sea Fleet, pushing Russia’s ships out of the western waters to help free up a key export route. In February, theCaesar Kunikovlanding ship was hit off the southern coast of Crimea. Later the same month the missile-armed corvetteIvanovetswas shown on Ukrainian military footage sinking stern-first below the waves. On land, the adversaries remain largely bogged down on the front line in eastern Ukraine and continue to swap cross-border air attacks, as well as clandestine operations targeting infrastructure. On Monday, Ukraine hinted that it was behind an attack on arailway bridgein the Russian region of Samara, with military intelligence boasting that the attack had “paralysed’ traffic in the area. On Tuesday, a military intelligence source in Kyiv told AFP that Ukraine had carried out an attack on an oil depot in the Belgorod border region setting storage tanks ablaze.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/5/ukraine-claims-another-critical-strike-on-russias-black-sea-fleet
"Medvedev says ‘Ukraine is definitely Russia’, rules out peace talks",The former Russian president says parts of Ukraine should ‘return home’ as he rules out peace talks with Zelenskyy.,"Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, says Ukraine is part of Russia as he rules out peace talks with the current Ukrainian leadership. In a bellicose speech on Monday at a youth festival in the southern city of Sochi, Medvedev saidRussiawould prosecute what it calls its “special military operation” until the other side capitulated. The former president and prime minister said what he called historical parts of Russia should “return home”. Medvedev spoke in front of a map of Ukraine, which showed the country as a much smaller landlocked slice of territory squeezed up against Poland with Russia in complete control of its east, south and Black Sea coast. “One of Ukraine’s former leaders said at some point that Ukraine is not Russia,” Medvedev said. “That concept needs to disappear forever. Ukraine is definitely Russia,” he said to applause from the audience. Medvedev said peace talks would not be possible with the current Ukrainian leadership, led by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He said any future Ukrainian government that wants talks would need to recognise what he called the new reality on the ground. Commenting on East-West relations, Medvedev, who accused US special forces and military advisers of waging war against Russia, said ties between Moscow and Washington were worse than during the1962 Cuban missile crisis. On Sunday, Medvedev joined a chorus of Kremlin voices accusing Western countries of participating in the war in Ukraine after awiretap recordingof German military officials was published on Russian social media. The discussion revolved around the potential impact of Ukraine’s use of German-made Taurus missiles. The conversation included remarks about aiming the missiles at targets such as the Kerch Bridge, which links the Russian mainland to occupied Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has so far refused to send the missiles to Ukraine, fearing it would escalate the conflict. In a Telegram post on Sunday, Medvedev criticised the German military and claimed the country was preparing to attack Russia.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/4/medvedev-says-ukraine-is-definitely-russia-rules-out-peace-talks
"Ukraine hints at responsibility for Samara, Russia bridge attack",Kyiv publishes pictures of the damaged bridge deep inside Russia that was used to transport weapons.,"Ukraine has hinted that it was behind an attack on a railway bridge in the Russian region of Samara. Kyiv’s military intelligence agency boasted on Monday that the explosion on the bridge had “paralysed’ traffic in the area. While attacks on infrastructure in Russia have become regular, it is rare for Kyiv to comment. “A railway bridge over the Chapaevka River in Russia’s Samara region was blown up. On 4 March 2024, at around 6:00 am (0200 GMT), the bridge was damaged by blowing up its support structures,” the Defence Intelligence of Ukraine said on messaging site Telegram. It included a photograph of the damaged bridge in itspost. Russia was using the railway line to transport ammunition from a plant in the town of Chapayevsk, about 1,000km (621 miles) from the Ukrainian border, military intelligence added. The post stopped short of directly claiming responsibility for the attack, but Ukrainian intelligence rarely comments on attacks in Russia. “Given the nature of the damage to the railway bridge, its use will be impossible for a long time,” the statement read. The incident was the latest in a string of explosions targeting Russia’s rail network, which Kyiv says Moscow uses to move troops and equipment being used for its invasion of Ukraine. Chapayevsk is home to JSC Polimer, a weapons manufacturer sanctioned by the United States in December. Russia’s railway operator announced earlier that “an intervention by non-authorised persons” had caused the incident but said no one had been injured. “Rail traffic is suspended for the moment at this section,” it added. “There are no deaths or injuries,” the Russian Federal Security Service in the Samara region told the state news agency Tass on Monday, with the area around the bridge cordoned off by security forces. Moscow was yet to comment on the Ukrainian statements. Claims on both sides are hard to verify in the war, which has now entered a third year, with the front line in eastern Ukraine largely bogged down in trench warfare. Illustrating Kyiv’s increased confidence regarding attacks on Russian territory, its military agency said in January that “unseen opponents of the Putin regime” had burned down a railroad, as well as facilities Russian troops allegedly use for logistics in the Russian cities of Saratov, Yaroslavl and Dzerzhinsk.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/4/ukraine-hints-at-russia-rail-bridge-target-in-rare-statement
Russia claims German military leak proves Western involvement in Ukraine,Kremlin says the wiretap shows the German military is discussing plans to strike Russian territory.,"A wiretap recording of German military officials published over the weekend proves Western countries were participating in the conflict in Ukraine, the Kremlin has claimed. The assertion was made by a spokesman on Monday, shortly after Moscow had reportedly summoned the German ambassador. The previous day, Berlin said that the release of the recording via social media was part of efforts to “destabilise” Germany. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the discussions among military officials of the potential use by Ukraine of German-made Taurus missiles to hit Russian targets, “once again highlight the direct involvement of the collective West in the conflict in Ukraine”. Russian state-run agency RIA Novosti published a video of Germany’s envoy Alexander Graf Lambsdorff arriving at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Moscow, declining to answer the questions of Russian journalists. “The German ambassador … was summoned in connection with the publicised conversation of German officers about Crimea,” RIA said. However, Berlin said that, contrary to reports by Russian state media, the envoy was not summoned. “Our ambassador went to a long-planned meeting in the Russian foreign ministry (on Monday) morning,” a foreign ministry spokesman said. The 38-minute recording of the discussion was posted late on Friday on Russian social media. Subsequently, a Foreign Ministry spokesperson demanded on social media “an explanation from Germany”. The officers were discussing the potential impact of the use of Taurus missiles. The conversation included aiming the missiles at targets such as the Kerch Bridge, which links the Russian mainland to Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. The audio leak came amid a debate in Germany over whether to supply the missiles. Ukraine is seeking a boost to its arsenal as ammunition stocksrun short, Ukraine has been seeing setbacks on the battlefield after two years of war, with military aid from the United States being held up in Congress and the EU struggling to source enough weapons to send. However, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has so far refused to send the missiles, fearing that it would lead to an escalation of the conflict.    Peskov sought to press home the Kremlin narrative that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was really a defensive action against a proxy war, led by the US. “The recording itself suggests that the Bundeswehr [German armed forces] is discussing substantively and specifically plans to strike Russian territory,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. The spokesman added that it was not clear whether the German armed forces were acting on their own initiative. On Monday, Germany confirmed the authenticity of the call, saying it is investigating what it called an apparent act of eavesdropping by Russia that was part of an “information war”. It accused Russia of leaking the discussions in an attempt to divide Europe. “This hybrid attack aimed to generate insecurity and divide us,” a government spokesman said. “And that is exactly what we will not allow. We are in constant contact with our partners.” The Kremlin has repeatedly denied accusations of spreading false or misleading information when faced with allegations from other countries. Meanwhile, German Chancellor Scholz reaffirmed his reluctance to send Taurus to Ukraine. “You cannot deliver a weapons system that has a very wide reach and then not think about how control over the weapons system can take place,” he said on Monday. “And if you want to have control and it’s only possible if German soldiers are involved, that’s out of the question for me.” His hesitancy is a source of friction within his three-party coalition, and of contention with Germany’s conservative opposition.     Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said said that while the German officers discussed scenarios to use Taurus missiles, that did not mean a green light had been granted to supply the weapons to Ukraine, Russian state media TASS reported on Monday. “I think the officers did what they are there for. They are thinking through different scenarios without planning anything in any way and leaving no doubt about it,” Pistorius told reporters. “Neither I nor the chancellor have given the green light for the use of Taurus.” He said it is “their job as leaders” to contemplate what scenarios were possible. Germany is among the NATO countries that have supplied weaponry to Ukraine, including tanks. Russia accuses what it calls the “collective West” of using Ukraine to wage a proxy war against it; NATO says it is helping Kyiv to defend itself against a war of aggression.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/4/russia-summons-german-ambassador-over-military-leak-russian-media
They fled Ukraine to the Netherlands. Why are they being expelled?,"Thousands of third-country nationals who fled Ukraine must leave the country this week, a court has ruled.","Thousands of third-country nationals who found refuge in the Netherlands after Russia’s February 24, 2022 invasion of Ukraine have been told to leave the country by Monday, though a four-week reprieve to exit the nation has given them a little extension. Many of those affected, mostly students and young workers from Ukraine, have been gathering in the streets of Amsterdam to protest in recent weeks, accusing the recently-elected far-right Dutch government of discrimination. The expulsion order came after a high court of the Netherlands ruled in January that a European Union policy that allowed both Ukrainian nationals and residents to settle in the country since the war would no longer apply to temporary residents. Those affected must exit the country by March 4 or risk forced deportation. Here’s why the Dutch government is asking this group to leave now and how lawyers are hoping to overturn the ruling: Like most of the European Union, the Netherlands initially opened up its borders to those fleeing Ukraine right at the start of the war, in March 2022. A Temporary Protection Directive (TPD) from the EU provided that Ukrainian refugees and permanent residents be offered refuge for two years until March 4, 2024, and that permits could be extended by the bloc as needed on a yearly basis. However, unlike several other EU members, the Netherlands did not assess individual cases to distinguish Ukrainian nationals from those with temporary permits, like the thousands of students – mostly from India, Nigeria, Morocco and Egypt – who lived and studied in Ukraine for years before the fighting. “The point was to alleviate the burden on the asylum system,” Lotte van Diepen of Everaert Advocaten, an immigration law firm, told Al Jazeera. In most other countries, authorities assessed if people were able to return safely meaning those with temporary permits were then either allowed to stay on or return to their countries, according to the strength of individual cases. The Netherlands’ approach, however, was more attractive. Thousands of third-country nationals trooped to Dutch cities and about 4,500 were registered in municipalities across the country. The government provided most people with accommodation in refugee centres, a stipend, healthcare access and work permits.  Early in 2023, the Dutch government announced it would end protection for third-country nationals, and informed them via multiple letters to leave their shelters and the country by September 4, 2023 – or be kicked out. Dutch authorities argued that third-country nationals who could safely go back home to their countries had “abused” the protection system. Minister of Migration Eric van der Burg said not taking action would “overburden” municipalities and promised 5,000 euros ($5,422) in “remigration” compensation for those willing to leave voluntarily. “We didn’t know what to do because those letters were very petrifying, very scary,” said Isaac Awodola, a Nigerian graduate of Odessa State University and co-founder of the Derdelanders group, which represents third-country nationals. “We had like six months to prepare to do whatever we wanted, [but] at that moment we were still traumatised,” he said. Some third-country nationals working with immigration lawyers like van Diepen sued the Dutch government, questioning if it could terminate protection for a group it had previously greenlit under the EU directive. Many of those cases were fast-tracked in the courts, while others were left pending. With the legal intervention, Migration Minister van der Burg was forced to suspend the September 4 deadline, granting thousands like Awodola temporary relief. Now, uncertainty looms again for the refugees. Many want to stay because they are still tied to Ukraine, Awodola said. There are those who need to return to recoup lost certificates, or those, like medical students, who need to stay close because, although their university studies are held online, they have to be physically present for practical exams – and flight costs from their countries are not cheap. “We are also human beings regardless of our background or where we come from, because the bombs and rockets that dropped on Ukraine did not ask for a passport,” Awodola added. “There should not be any segregation or separatism involved.” In several individual cases, including those filed by van Diepen who represents at least six people, district courts ruled that the authorities did not have the power to terminate the stay of third-country nationals without an explicit EU directive. However, other courts ruled that van der Burg could ask third-country nationals to leave, even without a European law saying so. Due to the split, appeals went up to the Council of State, the highest administrative court in the Netherlands. The court had to decide if the Dutch government had the authority to expel people protected under the EU directive. In October, the EU extended the temporary protection directive for a second time until March 4, 2025. On January 17, the council ruled that Dutch authorities don’t have such powers, and that the minister could not separate third-country nationals from Ukrainian nationals when everyone had been initially provided with blanket protection. If the directive applied to Ukrainian refugees, the court said, it should apply to third-country nationals, too. However, the court also said permits for third-country nationals would expire on March 4 – the initial, flexible expiry date the EU set at the start of the war. In its ruling, the court said the EU extension in October did not explicitly mention third-country nationals, and thus, protection no longer covered that group. It was a convenient win for the Dutch authorities, but shocking for third-country nationals and their lawyers. The court “went beyond [the] scope of the initial dispute brought before it,” van Diepen argued, referring to the original question around the powers of the Dutch government. “The consideration about the end date being 4 March 2024 … was not a topic of the debate in court. It was only an additional expression of opinion uttered by the court in the final judgement, not essential to the decision and therefore – we argue – not legally binding as a precedent.” The Council of State’s ruling cannot be appealed. The Dutch government has granted an extra 28 days for people to organise their exits and will let them keep their accommodation until the first week of April. State-covered amenities like stipends or healthcare have ceased though, and work permits are cancelled. After the grace period, people could be deported. Dutch authorities have asked third-country nationals who don’t feel safe returning to their homes to file for asylum, but most don’t fall under that category. About 2,700 to 2,900 of the original 4,500 who initially settled in the Netherlands still remain. “I don’t have a plan yet,” one person from Zimbabwe, who just graduated from their online Ukraine university, said of this week’s deadline. Awodola, the Nigerian, has vowed to keep protesting. Van Diepen and other lawyers are going back to lower district courts to argue in pending cases that the EU’s extension did not have to explicitly mention third-country nationals, since it protected them before. If the lower courts disagree, they can request the EU’s Court of Justice to intervene. A ruling from the bloc supersedes national law. Third-country nationals say Ukraine was home for them, too, and that they are affected by the war. In several instances, African and Asian students said they were refused exit from the war zones back in 2022 because they were not Ukrainian. But migration is a tense topic in a Netherlands that voted for thefar-right, anti-migration Party for Freedom– headed by politicianGeert Wilders– in November’s parliamentary elections. Some Dutch citizens say third-country nationals are diverting resources meant for Dutch people and Ukrainian refugees, and that the government has a right to cancel their stay. “We recognise their move was very generous in the first instance,” van Diepen said. “But the issue is, for those who were already allowed in, you can’t now turn around and say we don’t want you again. It’s an unjust decision with no legal basis.” Some of the lower court cases, the lawyer said, will be heard in the next few weeks. But time is fast running out for the thousands of third-country nationals who now have to pack up.

Death toll rises to 10 in Russian drone strike on Ukraine’s Odesa,"Three children killed in the attack, officials say, as Zelenskyy calls on the West to boost Ukraine’s air defences.","The death toll from a Russian drone strike that destroyed an apartment block in Ukraine’s southern port city of Odesa on Saturday has risen to 10. Ukraine’s interior ministry reported that rescue workers on Sunday morning retrieved the remains of an infant and the baby’s mother, raising the number of children killed in the attack to three. “The mother tried to cover the 8-month-old child with her own [body]. She tried to save them. They were found in a firm embrace,” the ministry said in a Telegram post. On Saturday, Ukrainian authorities reported that a baby was among those killed after falling debris from an Iranian-made Shahed drone hit the apartment building – one of eight Russian-launched drones reported by officials. Russia has launched several thousand of these long-range winged drones throughout the war at targets acrossUkraine. Later on Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that a second child had also died. “Tymofiy was 4 months old. Mark was about to turn 3 years old. My condolences to all of their close ones,” Zelenskyy wrote on X. He added that a three-year-old girl and seven other people were injured in the attack. Four more people may be trapped in the rubble in Odesa, the local branch of Ukraine’s main emergency service said in a Facebook update on Sunday. Local Governor Oleh Kiper said that rescue workers continue to comb through the site, and regional authorities announced a day of mourning for the victims. Elsewhere in Ukraine, regional authorities reported that a 58-year-old man died under rubble after Russian forces shelled his village in the southern Kherson province. Another civilian man, aged 38, was killed in a Russian artillery strike on the neighbouring Zaporizhia region, local Governor Ivan Fedorov said. Zelenskyy called on Western allies to boost Ukraine’s air defences in the wake of the deadly attack. “Delays in the delivery of weapons to Ukraine, as well as air defence to protect our people, unfortunately result in such losses. … Ukraine has never requested anything more than what is necessary to protect lives,” Zelenskyy said. Ukraine is currently struggling for resources as the war grinds into its third year with a $60bn aid package held up in the United States Congress.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/3/death-toll-rises-to-10-in-russian-drone-strike-on-ukraines-odesa
Seven killed in Russian drone attack on Ukraine’s Odesa apartment block,Separate attacks killed an additional three people in Ukraine as Zelenskyy urges the West to deliver more air defences.,"A Russian drone attack on an apartment block in the southern Ukrainian port city of Odesa has killed at least seven people, including a three-year-old and a woman with an infant child, regional authorities said. “Rescuers in Odesa have just uncovered the bodies of a mother with a three-month-old baby,” Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said in a post on the Telegram app on Saturday. At the scene, smoke poured from rubble strewn across the ground where the drone had ripped a chunk several storeys high out of the building. Clothes and furniture were scattered in the ruined mass of concrete and steel hanging off the side of the apartment block. Ukraine’s State Emergencies Service posted photos, including of a dead toddler being placed in a body bag by rescuers. “This is impossible to forget! This is impossible to forgive,” it wrote. It said five people including a child had been rescued alive. Odesa region governor Oleh Kiper said eight people were wounded, and rescuers were still looking for more people under the debris. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the drone was a Shahed supplied by Iran. Russia has launched several thousand of these long-range winged drones throughout the war at targets deep insideUkraine. Al Jazeera’s Rob McBride, reporting from Kyiv, said a total of 17 Shahed drones targeted Ukraine in the overnight attacks, with most of them intercepted by air defences. Separate shelling attacks on the front-line Kharkiv, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions killed three, Ukrainian officials have said. The spate of attacks led Zelenskyy to re-iterate his calls on the West to deliver more air defence systems. “We need more air defences from our partners. We need to strengthen the Ukrainian air shield to add more protection for our people from Russian terror. More air defence systems and more missiles for air defence systems save lives,” he said. Ukraine is currently on the back foot in the two-year war as a crucial $60bn aid package is held up in the US Congress. Ukraine also appears to have launched an attack of its own, with a drone striking a five-storey residential building in St Petersburg, Russia’s second city, on Saturday causing no casualties, according to Russia’s National Guard division. Videos on Russian social media showed what appeared to be a drone spiralling downwards into the building, triggering an explosion, blowing out windows and causing small fires. The city’s National Guard division said its preliminary assumption was the damage was caused by a “falling drone”. Ukrainian media reported that the drone was shot down by Russia’s air defences while targeting an oil depot around a kilometre from the crash site.

"After Macron touted troops to Ukraine, Putin warns West of nuclear war risk","The Russian president, in a state of the nation address, upped the ante on Thursday. Should the world be worried about his threat?","President Vladimir Putin hasthreatened to use nuclear weaponsif Western powers send soldiers to within striking distance of Russia. His comments on Thursday, in a state of the nation address, were the kind of remarks usually uttered by Dmitry Medvedev, a Putin ally who served as Russia’s president from 2008-2012 and prime minister until becoming a top security official in 2020. Throughout the conflict in Ukraine, Medvedev has warned of nuclear action and penned countless social media posts showering Western leaders and nations with slurs and threats. “Medvedev used to write posts about the riders of the apocalypse in the style of [US filmmaker Quentin] Tarantino, and Putin brought his threats back to the limits of sanity,” Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kushch told Al Jazeera. Putin has now upped the ante, responding to French President Emmanuel Macron’sassumptionon Monday that a deployment of European troops to Ukraine cannot be “ruled out”. Putin issued his threats during his annual national address – a carefully choreographed ceremony broadcast live to be chopped into soundbites and quotes that Russian media will likely repeat and comment on for days.    The West has “announced the possibility of sending Western military contingents to Ukraine,” Putin said on Thursday. “The consequences for possible interventionists will be way more tragic. “They should eventually realise that we also have weapons that can hit targets on their territory. Everything that the West comes up with creates the real threat of a conflict with the use of nuclear weapons, and thus the destruction of civilisation,” he said. Moscow has the world’s largest nuclear arsenal including a new generation of hypersonic missiles and several times more tactical nuclear weapons than the collective West. “Now it is Putin who clearly draws a red line about using the nukes,” Kushch said, adding that Macron had probed Putin’s reaction on when Moscow would be ready to launch the nukes. But to Boris Bondarev, a senior Russian diplomat who quit his job to protest against Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, there was “nothing new” in Putin’s menacing diatribe. The threats were Putin’s “usual scares and a projection of his own unrealised desires on to the West,” Bondarev, who served in the United Nations office in Geneva until 2022, told Al Jazeera. This was not the first time Moscow bared its teeth in a confrontation with the United States and Europe. Soviet helmsman Nikita Khrushchev banged his shoe on the podium in the United Nations headquarters in New York in 1960 ranting about “toady American imperialism” and promising “further interventions”. Two years later, Khrushchev provoked the Caribbean Missile Crisis that nearly triggered a nuclear apocalypse. Soviet leaders in the late 1970s and early 1980s routinely hinted at the possibility of a nuclear war until Mikhail Gorbachev started his perestroika reforms that prompted a sign of relief in the West, but buried the USSR. During the war in Ukraine, the Kremlin pulled out of nuclear arms control treaties with Washington in moves that many predicted would start a new arms race. “This is not a bluff,” Putin said in 2022 when announcing the possibility of a nuclear strike. “Putin’s regime has not once used the scare of a nuclear war to frighten the West and convince it not to provide military aid to Ukraine,” Alisher Ilkhamov, head of Central Asia Due Diligence, a think tank in London, told Al Jazeera. “In the past, the scare was usually voiced over by Medvedev and all sorts of propagandists, now it’s Putin’s turn to announce them,” he said. And it wasn’t Macron’s assumption that irked Putin – it was Ukraine’s success in striking airfields, fuel depots, warships and military planes deep in Russia and Russia-occupied areas, Ilkhamov said. So far, the West has been able to raise the stakes in providing increasingly effective weaponry to Ukraine and ignore the Kremlin’s threats, he said. And Putin will chicken out of a direct duel because Russia’s military-industrial potential is too exhausted to support an all-out confrontation with NATO, he said. “The power of [both] sides is too unequal,” Ilkhamov said. “Putin has nothing to lean on in the confrontation with the West. He understands it very well and won’t go farther beyond the scares.” The widow of Russia’s most outspoken opposition leader offered a useful insight into how Putin issues his threats and acts upon them. “You’re dealing not with a politician but with a bloody monster. Putin is the head of an organised criminal group,” Yulia Navalnaya, whose husband Alexey Navalny died on February 16 in an Arctic prison, said in a video on Wednesday. “It’s impossible to harm Putin with yet another resolution or yet another batch of sanctions that are no different from previous ones. You can’t win over him thinking he is a man with principles, with morals and rules,” she said. During his speech, Putin seemed in denial about his own role in the war that grinds into its third year. “I noticed during Putin’s speech that he said Russia did not start the war,” Ivar Dale, a senior policy adviser with the Norwegian Helsinki Committee, a human rights group, told Al Jazeera. “He thought about the risks, he decided to do it, and he failed. The right thing to do now is to withdraw all troops from Ukraine, and not continue to threaten innocent people with a nuclear holocaust,” Dale said. Putin’s blackmail is not his first and probably not his last, and the West should indeed deploy NATO troops to aid Ukraine, said an expert on Eastern Europe. “The emergence of Western servicemen in Ukraine will, of course, cross yet another ‘red line,'” Nikolay Mitrokhin of Germany’s Bremen University told Al Jazeera. “Although it would very much help Ukraine and give it a chance to free several brigades that are currently guarding the rear and the border with [breakaway and pro-Russian Moldovan region of]Transnistria.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/1/how-real-is-putins-threat-to-nuke-the-west
Ukraine’s strategic goal in 2024 is to make Russia’s war felt in Moscow,Ukraine is doubling down on remote warfare to smash Putin’s power base and ability to fight.,"Ukraine appears to have few resources with which to mount another counteroffensive. The European Union is upping its military aid from 28 billion euros ($30bn) in the past two years to 21 billion euros ($23bn) this year alone, but that is still not enough to replace United States military aid, stalled in Congress. The Financial Times reported last month that certain US officials had urged Ukraine to play defence in 2024 and conserve strength for a counteroffensive next year. “Defensive operations do not necessarily present Ukraine with more opportunities to husband materiel and expand reserves,” wrote the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, in a scathing critique of that advice. Talking to journalists on Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hinted that he would appease conservatives with a summit in Switzerland this spring to thrash out a peace proposal. But he also said, “We believe that it is only right to get stronger on the battlefield … We do not want any negotiation formats or peace formulas to be imposed on us by countries that are not here today, not at war.” If Ukraine is to fight for a better bargaining position, many experts feel offence is its only choice. “We are headed towards a war of attrition, which plays into Russia’s hands,” Vienna-based geopolitical strategist Velina Tchakarova told Al Jazeera. “Ukraine will launch a military offensive – it is clear,” said Tchakarova, who also predicted Russia’s 2022 invasion. Ukraine has hinted as much. “We are doing everything possible and impossible to make a breakthrough,” Rustem Umerov, defence minister, said in the past week. “Plan 2024 is already there. We do not talk about it publicly. It is powerful, it is strong, it gives not only hope but also will give results in 2024,” he said. Ukraine still aims to restore the borders Russia recognised in 1991, which means pushing Russian forces out of four partially occupied regions – Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia and Kherson – and also retaking Crimea. A survey for the Munich Security Conference showed that at least three-quarters of Ukrainians still back all of these goals. But how will it be done? Last year’s counteroffensive strategy was to capture Melitopol and reach the Sea of Azov. From there, Ukrainian forces could cut off Russia from Crimea by firing on the Kerch bridge. Had it succeeded, the strategy would have delivered Crimea, Kherson and most of Zaporizhia, and saddled Russian President Vladimir Putin with enormous political pressure to end the war. Tchakarova said the 2023 counteroffensive failed because it depended on weapons deliveries from allies. The Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a think tank, measured that weapons commitments in August-October last year were 87 percent lower than during the same period in 2022, the first year of the war. “This was the decisive factor that led to no significant breakthroughs on the front lines,” Tchakarova said. This year, Ukraineplans to makeas many of its own weapons as possible. “We are expecting a lot more [help from allies] if we believe the announcements – F-16s, drones and ammunition,” said Tchakarova. “But I don’t expect any serious support,” underlining the wisdom of Ukraine’s new approach.    Ukraine’s tactics are also evolving. Last June’s counteroffensive was based on mechanised manoeuvres and manpower, but its expenditure in weapons and lives proved unsustainable beyond September. At about the same time, though, Ukraine launched a series of ranged attacks that proved more sustainable and, in some ways, more devastating to Russia. In May it struck the Kremlin with drones and followed up with more attacks in the heart of Moscow. That “produced an incredible sense of worry”, Jade McGlynn, a Russia expert at King’s College London’s War Studies department, told Al Jazeera. “They were targeting that whole ministry of defence area or the area where the Kremlin elites live, so it was a signal to anyone in that circle that ‘even you are not safe’.” Surface drones of Ukraine’s own manufacture and Storm Shadow missiles provided by Britain and France have since struck repeatedly in the waters around Crimea, sinking or rendering inoperable half of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet. Aerial drones and missiles have destroyed Crimean air defences, aircraft and the Black Sea Fleet headquarters in Sevastopol. More recently, drones have targeted oil and gas infrastructure in Russia itself, vital to its export revenue. Russian newspaper Kommersant said refineries had to reduce their output by four percent in January compared with January 2023, because of damage caused by Ukrainian drones. Zelenskyy said this month that “our task this year is not only to bolster our sky shield and Ukraine’s long-range capabilities to the fullest extent possible, but also to inflict maximum systemic losses on Russia”. That has been a constant in Ukraine’s strategy. In September 2022, then-commander-in-chiefValery Zaluzhnysaid Russia’s ability to strike Ukraine with impunity was “the true centre of gravity of the enemy”, and sought long-range weapons to reciprocate the pain. “It’s important that Ukrainians continue,” said McGlynn. “Unless [Russians] feel even a thousandth of what Ukraine feels, they’re not going to feel any responsibility to act against it.” Ukraine is now levelling up this strategy. It has said it will build 20,000 drones with a range of hundreds of kilometres, suggesting a devastating intended usage rate of 55 a day, and 1,000 drones with a range of more than 1,000km (621 miles) to strike deep inside Russia. Zelenskyy on Sunday summarised this year’s strategic goals. “We have to prove that we can deprive Russia of its air supremacy, its financing of aggression and its political power. This is a task for the year,” Zelenskyy told allies gathered in Paris. Ukraine’s emphasis on remote warfare seems to go hand in hand with a more conservative use of manpower in 2024. When ground forces commanderOleksandr Syrskyiireplaced Valery Zaluzhny as commander in chief this year, there was concern about a return to costlier tactics. “He is from this Soviet old school of thinking, which is highly artillery-driven and more prone to devote mass to the front, which generates a great deal of concern in Ukraine,” Cambridge University’s Rory Finnin, a Ukraine historian, told Al Jazeera. Yet Syrskyii belied this assumption on February 17, when he withdrew his troops from the almost surrounded eastern city of Avdiivka. It was a reversal of his tactics in Bakhmut, where he had ordered them to fight a rearguard for every inch of territory. “Social media showed Russia was caught off guard by the fact that Ukrainian forces pulled back,” said retired Colonel Seth Krummrich, now vice-president of Global Guardian, a security consultancy. As part of its effort to conserve manpower, Ukraine plans to build a million short-range drones this year, which can deliver small bombs with great accuracy near the front lines, a goal experts havetold Al Jazeerais feasible. Such a rate of production would average about 20,000 bombs a day, and would likely overwhelm Russian volumes. On February 12, Ukraine reported downing 1,157 Russian short-range drones in a week. Short-range drones might also be the key to equalising artillery power, a step Zelenskyy said was necessary before any new counteroffensive. “We need to come to those moments when we had appropriate operations, counteroffensive actions, when we went [to a ratio of] 1 to 1.5-3. Then we will be able to push back the Russians,” he said at Sunday’s press conference. What would be the effect on Russia if Ukraine succeeded in its remote warfare strategy? Russia has managed to avoid many dire predictions so far. Despite a mutiny by the Wagner military company last year and numerous antiwar protests, Putin has not been toppled. The rouble did not collapse. Russia circumvented sanctions to sell oil and buy weapons. However, some experts believe the effects are accumulating. “I think this year will be the high watermark of Putin’s capacity to influence clearly what’s going on in Ukraine,” British historian Mark Galeotti told the Futucast podcast last month, predicting that “towards the end of this year … we’ll see some very, very large chickens coming home to roost.” Those chickens include rising household debt, thinning public services and disillusionment with Putin, Galeotti believed: “The system is more and more vulnerable to the unexpected, and the unexpected could come tomorrow or in five years’ time.” On Monday, Zelenskyy suggested he might focus directly on Crimea this year. “We must fight for the full restoration of international law in relation to Crimea,” he said in a statement marking the 10th anniversary of Russia’s annexation of the peninsula. Ukrainian military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said last month that attacks on Crimea would intensify, and this month predicted, “the peninsula will be brought back”. This, too, has been a strategic goal since 2022, because Russia maintains five airfields on the peninsula from which it has attacked Ukraine, and uses it to support troops in Zaporizhia and Kherson. Even if it doesn’t recapture the Crimean peninsula this year, Ukraine can render it unusable as a Russian base of operations using drones and missiles. With US aid stalled, Europe has an opportunity to play a bigger geopolitical role, career British diplomat and lecturer at Cambridge University’s Centre for Geopolitics Suzanne Raine told Al Jazeera. “For many years now, America has been the first mover that has given us the confidence to do something, and that’s a ridiculous position for us all to be in, frankly,” Raine said. “If the EU wants to be able to take itself seriously on anything, it needs to be able to galvanise conversations that lead to decisions and action.” The EU has passed 12 sanctions packages and invited Ukraine to become a member with record speed, but these were low-hanging fruit, said Raine. “Sanctions are easy and theydon’t really work. Accession talks are easy as long as you don’t actually allow them to join,” she said. Britain has so far been the only European country to upstage the US on new categories of weapons, offering Ukraine tanks in January 2023 followed by medium-range Storm Shadow missiles in May. Germany has an equivalent Taurus missile it refuses to send Ukraine until the US approves ATACMS. Raine said she is waiting for the continent to wake up. “If not now, when?” she said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/1/ukraines-strategic-goal-in-2024-is-to-make-russias-war-felt-in-moscow
Russian troops inch ahead as war in Ukraine barrels into third year,"Meanwhile, Ukraine downs a second A-50 radar detection plane, Macron talks ground troops, and Putin threatens nuclear risk.","Ukrainian forces in the east struggled to find stable new defences during the past week, as Russian troops continued to advance after capturing Avdiivka – suggesting that artillery and other shortages were affecting Ukraine’s ability to hold the entire 1,000km (620-mile) front line. Ukrainian forceswithdrewfrom Avdiivka on February 17, after a four-month Russian onslaught to take the town. On February 24, Ukrainian defenders also withdrew from the village of Lastochkyne, three kilometres (1.9 miles) west of Avdiivka, never having had a chance to build proper defences under fire. “There were no defences built there, and the fighters had to withdraw from the battles in Avdiivka and gain a foothold in the very process of hostilities,” one Ukrainian military reporter known as DeepStateUA wrote on Telegram to his 700,000 followers, predicting that the same would occur at other points of retreat. Three days later, Ukrainian troops withdrew from the villages of Stepove and Sieverne, north and south of Lastochkyne, after fierce overnight battles. Oleksandr Tarnavskyi, commander of the Tavria Group of Ukrainian forces, which is fighting in this area, said on February 27 that the line of defence had “stabilised” along Tonenke-Orlivka-Berdychi axis, a row of three villages immediately to the west of Lastochkyne, but even that assumption seemed precarious. Geolocated footage the following day showed Russian troops at the southeastern approaches to Orlivka. Tavria spokesman Dmytro Lykhoviy said Russian forces had increased the size of attacking units from squads to platoons or even companies. A squad can be as small as half a dozen troops. Platoons can be as big as 50, and a company can reach 200 troops. Russian troops also claimed on February 26 to have advanced to the outskirts of Ivanivske, a village west of Bakhmut, the last city to fall to Russian forces, in May. And Russian forces reclaimed Robotyne, a village Ukrainian troops recaptured during last summer’s offensive at the western end of the front, in Zaporizhia. Geolocated footage on February 24 showed Russian troops in the centre of Robotyne, where military reporters said they had secured the central fortified positions in the school and recreational centre. Russian troops also continued to assault Ukrainian positions in Krynky, on the left bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson, without success. One reason for Russian success in Avdiivka appears to have been the fact that Moscow’s forces secured local air superiority and used it to drop glide bombs – large, inert weapons fitted with fins to fly further and strike more accurately. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia had dropped more than 3,200 glide bombs since the beginning of the year. Ukraine has targeted Russian bombers and the command planes that coordinate them. On February 27, Ukraine downed two Sukhoi-34 bombers, at least one of them in the east, which are used to drop glide bombs. More consequentially, on February 23 the Ukrainian military shot down a Russian A-50 early warning and control plane over the Sea of Azov coast. The A-50 is an airborne radar used to monitor enemy air activity and air defences. Russia has used them to feed target coordinates to fighters, bombers and long-range missiles. Ukrainian military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said the operation had left Russia with just six A-50 planes in the Ukraine theatre, and that more would be downed. Zelenskyy told allies gathered in Paris that a strategic goal for this year was to deprive Russia of air superiority, just as it had been deprived of its control of the Black Sea and its superiority on land. Ukraine has long-targeted these planes, which are very difficult to replace. Russia only built 40 of them, and crew training takes years. Some reports suggest they will be vital to Russian efforts to shoot down Ukrainian F-16s, once they start flying. Western allies have promised to hand Ukraine at least two dozen. A year ago, fighters bombed the Machulishchi air base in Belarus, where Russia had parked an A-50, damaging it. On January 15, Ukraine downed an A-50 in the Sea of Azov, along with an Ilyushin-22 command plane. Ukraine also continued ranged attacks on Russian energy and defence infrastructure. On February 24, its military intelligence and security service said they had jointly organised a successful drone attack against the Novolipetsk Metallurgical Plant, in Lipetsk, 370km (230 miles) southeast of Moscow. The plant supplies steel for the manufacture of artillery, missiles and drones. Russia, too, continued its aerial campaign against Ukrainian infrastructure using missiles and drones. From February 21-28, Ukraine downed 79 Iranian-designed Shahed drones out of 98 launched, along with a number of missiles. Ukraine’s allies continued to pledge military assistance. Denmark announced a $228m military aid package including 15,000 rounds of ammunition. Germany announced a new military aid package that included 14,000 artillery rounds and reconnaissance drones. French President Emmanuel Macron gathered 20 heads of government, including 15 from the EU, in Paris on February 26, to discuss increasing the supply of artillery rounds to Ukraine. The European Union has said it will be in a position to manufacture a million artillery rounds a year by the end of 2024. Macronalso calledfor the formation of a new alliance to supply “missiles and bombs of medium and long range to carry out deep strikes”. France and the UK were the first to supply Ukraine with Storm Shadow/SCALP missiles, with a 140km (87-mile) range, last May. Until then, the longest-range weapon Ukraine had was 80km (50-mile) range HIMARS rockets. The US is now reportedly thinking of supplying 300km range ATACMS missiles, and Ukraine claims it has developed a 700km range (435-mile) missile. While there was “no consensus” on the sending of Western ground troops to Ukraine, “nothing should be excluded. We will do whatever it takes to ensure that Russia cannot win this war,” Macron said. Russian President Vladimir Putinrespondedwith a threat of nuclear war, should NATO members send troops to Ukraine. “[Western nations] must realise that we also have weapons that can hit targets on their territory,” he told assembled lawmakers on Thursday. “All this really threatens a conflict with the use of nuclear weapons and the destruction of civilisation.

Putin warns risk of nuclear war if West sends troops to Ukraine,"Two weeks ahead of the presidential election, the Russian leader says his troops won’t back down in Ukraine.","Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned of a “real” risk of nuclear war if the Western countries sent troops to fight in Ukraineduring an annual address to the nationtwo weeks ahead of the presidential election. “There has been talk about the possibility of sending NATO military contingents to Ukraine. But we remember the fate of those who once sent their contingents to our country’s territory. But now the consequences for possible interventionists will be far more tragic,” Putin said addressing parliament and other senior elites. “They must realise that we also have weapons that can hit targets on their territory. All this really threatens a conflict with the use of nuclear weapons and the destruction of civilisation. Don’t they get that?” Putin has previously spoken of the dangers of a direct confrontation between NATO and Russia, but his nuclear weapon warning on Thursday was one of his most explicit. Putin’s warning comes in the wake of French President Emmanuel Macron’s proposal on Monday of European NATO members sending ground troops to Ukraine. The United States, Germany, the United Kingdom and some other members rejected the suggestion. But Putin suggested that Western leaders remember the fate of those like Germany’s Adolf Hitler and France’s Napoleon Bonaparte, who unsuccessfully tried to invade his country in the past. The Russian leader previously pulled Moscow out of theSTARTarms control treaty with the US last year and previously said he was “not bluffing” when he stated he was ready to use nuclear weapons. Putin also said Russia was “ready” for dialogue with the US on “strategic stability” issues despite the invasion of Ukraine triggering the worst relations between Moscow and the West since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis.  Putin praised Russian troops fighting in Ukraine as “courageous” warriors who would not back down. Most opposition candidates are either in jail or forced out of the country, making it easier for Putin to secure another six-year term in the March 15-17 vote. His most formidable challenger, jailed leader Alexey Navalny,mysteriously diedin prison in mid-February. “I look at these courageous people, sometimes very young guys, and without any exaggeration I can say my heart fills with pride. They will not back down, will not fail and will not betray,” Putin said. His comments also come with the Kremlin revelling in itsrecent gainsin Ukraine, an economy that has defied the devastating effects of sanctions, and signs of Western support for Ukraine becoming strained. On the war in Ukraine, Putin said the Russian army had increased its combat capabilities and is “confidently” advancing across the front line. “Today, when our homeland is defending its sovereignty and security and protecting the lives of our fellow countrymen in Donbas and Novorossiya [regions of Ukraine that Russia claims to have annexed], the decisive role in this righteous struggle belongs to our citizens, our unity, devotion to our native country and responsibility for its fate,” he said. Earlier on Thursday, Russia said it fought off an attempted landing by Ukrainian special forces on the Tendra Spit sandbar in the Black Sea, killing “up to 25” Ukrainian personnel.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/29/putin-warns-risk-of-nuclear-war-if-west-sends-troops-to-ukraine
"Why has the EU sanctioned Indian, Chinese companies for Russia links?","The latest sanctions, coinciding with the anniversary of the Ukraine war, touch New Delhi, Beijing for the first time.","A day before the two-year anniversary ofRussia’s invasion of Ukraine, the European Union released anexhaustive new listof companies, entities or people in countries including Russia, India, Iran, China and Syria, that it said it was sanctioning over allegations that they were connected to Russia’s defence and security sector. The new sanctions added 27 new entities to a list of more than 600 that were already facing EU bans and restrictions. But the additions included companies in mainland China and India for the first time, targeting entities in the countries that have been the biggest buyers of Russian fossil fuels since the Kremlin launched its full-fledged war on Ukraine in February 2022. Here’s more about the new sanctions, who they target, why these companies have been sanctioned, how China, India and Russia have responded – and why all of this matters. While 619 of the 641 entities on the 27-nation bloc’s sanction list are in Russia, a handful of entities from other countries are also on the sanctions register. These include: Besides Russian companies, the sanctions are also against Russian officials, including judiciary members, local politicians and people the EU said were “responsible for the illegal deportation and military re-education of Ukrainian children”. Most international companies were sanctioned by the EU in June 2023. Only 27 of the entities on the list were first announced to be sanctioned on Friday. The foreign companies have been sanctioned over allegations that they have exported dual-use goods to Russia that could be used in its war against Ukraine. A dual-use item is something that can be used for both civilian and military applications such as technology, satellites ordrones. The EU regulation describes the foreign countries as “third countries”. Ali Ahmadi, a scholar of sanctions and economic statecraft, explained that these countries are often “points of transshipment” – places through which sensitive technology is routed to Russia. If European countries refuse to export an item to Russia because it might have military applications, the item might still be sent to a country like Uzbekistan or the UAE. From there, it could in turn be sold to Russia – at times without the branding and labelling of its country of origin. “So it essentially ends up in Russia indirectly,” added Ahmadi, an executive fellow at the Geneva Centre for Security Policy and an analyst at Gulf State Analytics. TheUS also imposedroughly 600 new sanctions against entities in Russia and other countries on Friday in the largest single round of penalties sinceRussia’s invasion of Ukraineon February 24, 2022. US President Joe Biden said the sanctions were a response to the war in Ukraine and Russian opposition leaderAlexey Navalny’sdeath. There is overlap between the entities the US and EU have sanctioned. Ahmadi said that the US and the EU “certainly cooperate with each other a lot, but there are entities that are on one sanctions list, not on the other”. The EU sanctions mean that EU member states can not sell battlefield or dual-use goods to the entities on the sanctions list. The US and EU sanctions on the companies in countries besides Russia are “going to make it substantially harder for them to interact with the outside world,” said Ahmadi. Ahmadi compared the sanctions with former US President Donald Trump’smaximum pressure campaignsagainst Iran or Syria, adding that it is a much more aggressive stance reflecting that “the Europeans have acknowledged their sanctions are veryleaky“. However, Ahmadi added that the third countries themselves will not necessarily take a significant hit – yet – since only a handful of companies from these nations have been targeted so far. Take Iran, the country with the most companies targeted, other than Russia. The Iranian companies on the list are state-owned institutions. “Whatever business they do is with Iran’s allies,” said Ahmadi. “They don’t have any interaction with the dollar. They don’t do business with any European entities.” Their very purpose and design effectively shield them from the new sanctions. So what’s the point of the sanctions? Simply, say experts, to send a signal of the EU’s disapproval – and a reminder to the countries hosting these companies, including China and India, of what Brussels could do more of, if it wants to. After the sanctions were announced, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce released a statement on Monday condemning them. In the statement, the ministry said that the sanctions were unilateral, with “no basis whatsoever in international law and authorisation from the United Nations Security Council”. Beijing, New Delhi and most Global South capitals have long criticised sanctions imposed by individual countries and blocs like the EU that do not have the legitimacy of the UN’s approval, though China’s veto power on the Security Council makes it practically impossible for that body to sign off on sanctions against Beijing. The Chinese statement also added that the sanctions go against the spirit of discussions during theChina-EU leaders’ meeting, which happened between Chinese President Xi Jinping and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in December 2023. China warned that these sanctions would have a detrimental impact on China-EU economic and trade relations. Yet, Ahmadi said China’s response – much like the EU sanctions – was for the most part symbolic. “It is something that China feels like it has to react to,” said Ahmadi. However, he added that only Chinese microtechnology companies have been affected, which does not affect China so much. If the EU attempted to impose sanctions on major Chinese banks, that would likely have significant implications for the global economy. But, Ahmadi said, “I don’t think the Europeans or the Americans are ready to go that far, even if they may be, it may be the only way to stop transshipment through China.” Si2 Microsystems Pvt Ltd, based in India’s Bengaluru, is a new addition to the sanctions list as of Friday. Si2 designs integrated circuits for commercial, military and space industries and has partnered up with India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (Meity) and the state-funded Indian Institute of Technology Madras, as part of an effort to research the fabrication of chips with silicon photonic processor cores. It manufactures chips for quantum computing and avionics among other sectors and has claimed the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), General Electric and IBM to be past customers, according to a government press release and global tech publisher, The Register. The EU sanctions do not detail what specifically Si2 is believed to have helped Russia with, but experts suspect it is accused of having to facilitate semiconductor shipments to Moscow. Many modern weapons systems rely on semiconductors. India is a close strategic partner of the EU and the US. Though it has purchased the most Russian fossil fuels since the start of the war, after China, the West has, until now, avoided targeting New Delhi or Indian entities. Adopted on July 31, 2014, the European Council’s Regulation 833/2014 states that it is “prohibited to sell, supply, transfer or export, directly or indirectly, dual-use goods and technology” to Russia or for use in Russia. It was adopted in the aftermath of the Russian annexation of Crimea and the Kremlin’s support for secessionist movements in eastern Ukraine. The EU Regulation that came on Friday is essentially an amendment to Regulation 833/2014. The last amendment was made to the regulation on December 18, 2023, when 13 new entities were added to the sanctions list. Initial sanctions and restrictive regulations largely targeted Russian and Belarusian entities. In February 2023, seven Iranian entities were sanctioned for allegedly manufacturing items used by Russia’s military in the war. In June 2023, entities from Hong Kong, China, Uzbekistan, the United Arab Emirates, Syria and Armenia also made the sanctions list. As a response to the latest round of EU sanctions, Russia’s foreign ministry announced that it had significantly expanded a list of EU officials and politicians banned from entering Russia. The announcement was made on Friday. “The European Union is continuing its fruitless attempts to put pressure on Russia through unilateral restrictive measures,” the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/29/why-has-the-eu-sanctioned-indian-chinese-companies-for-russia-links
"Zelenskyy seeks support, arms at Albania summit of Balkan nations",Ukrainian president promotes idea of joint arms production at two-day summit of Southeast European countries.,"President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has tried to drum up Balkan support for his vision of peace in Ukraine and has promoted the idea of joint arms production at a two-day summit of Southeast European countries. The meeting was held in the Albanian capital, Tirana, as Kyiv is trying to improve its defensive capabilities to beat back Russian forces at a time of faltering US support a little more than two years into Russia’s full-scale invasion. “We are interested in co-production with you and all our partners,” Zelenskyy told delegations from Albania, Serbia, North Macedonia, Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Croatia and Moldova in his opening remarks at the summit on Wednesday. “There are about 500 defence companies operating in Ukraine. Each of them adds strength, but it is not enough to win [against Russian President Vladimir] Putin. We see the problems with the supply of ammunition, which affects the situation on the battlefield.” Zelenskyy proposed organising a Ukrainian-Balkans defence forum in Kyiv or a Balkan capital to nurture arms cooperation, repeating similar initiatives conducted last year with British and US weapons companies. Albania, North Macedonia and Montenegro are NATO members, have joined Western sanctions against Russia, and sent arms and equipment to Ukraine. There are significant arms industries in parts of the Balkans, especially Serbia and Croatia, a legacy of the former Yugoslavia. Longtime Moscow allySerbia has not imposed sanctions, and neither Belgrade nor Kyiv recognise the independence of Kosovo, Serbia’s former predominantly Albanian southern province, which backs Ukraine and is seeking European Union and NATO membership. Zelenskyy said he had invited all Balkan leaders to take part in a summit of partners and allies in Switzerland this spring that would discuss his vision of peace, which entails a Russian military withdrawal from all Ukrainian territory.    That diplomatic initiative – based on what is known as Zelenskyy’s“peace formula”– does not involve Russia and has been dismissed by Moscow as a non-starter. Zelenskyy said he met Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama for talks and the two leaders had signed an Agreement on Friendship and Cooperation. “This document will contribute to the development of cooperation and strengthening of Ukraine’s position in the Balkan region,” Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram messenger. His chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said: “They also spoke about Ukraine’s defence needs and the possibility of joint weapons production.” Zelenskyy said at a news conference later that every time weapons supplies to Ukraine are delayed, it is a “gift” to Putin, an apparent allusion to the months-long impasse in the US Congress over providing more military aid to Kyiv. Zelenskyy, who was inSaudi Arabia for talkson Tuesday, is also due to meet the leaders of Serbia, North Macedonia, Kosovo, Bosnia and Montenegro at the summit. Thirteen countries are attending the summit along with officials from the EU and other international institutions. “A pivotal moment for fostering bilateral ties, and standing in solidarity with Ukraine in its heroic fight against Russia’s aggression,” Albanian Foreign Minister Igli Hasani wrote on X shortly after Zelenskyy’s arrival.

Zelenskyy’s trip came as Kyiv’s forces are slowly being pushed back in eastern Ukraine. Russia has the upper hand due to its big advantage in troop numbers and weapons supplies, military analysts said, as Kyiv waits for news of new provisions from its Western partners. The Ukrainian military said on Tuesday that after intense overnight fighting, it has withdrawn its forces from two more villages in the eastern region of Donetsk nearAvdiivka, which fell to Russian forces this month after a four-month offensive.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/28/zelenskyy-seeks-support-arms-at-albania-summit-of-balkan-nations
Transnistria tensions: Will Russia try to annex Moldova’s breakaway region?,"Pro-Russian rebels hint at a referendum, a move Moldova has dismissed as meaningless propaganda.","Bucharest, Romania –Alexandru Flenchea’s phone has been ringing non-stop since last week. “I cannot tell you how many phone calls I have received in the last two days from both the press and just acquaintances,” Flenchea told Al Jazeera, by phone. People keep asking him whether it is safe to stay in Moldova. “It is just insane,” he said. Flenchea heads the Initiative 4 Peace Association in Chisinau, Moldova’s capital. He has been fielding calls since Ghenadie Ciorba – an opposition figure in Transnistria – recently reportedly suggested that separatists may call for a referendum on the region’s annexation to Russia. On Wednesday, the call Ciorba touted did not quite come at a rare special congress in the narrow strip of land that isinternationally recognisedas Moldovan territory but backed by Russia. But the “congress of deputies of all levels” in the separatist region’s capital did pass a resolution seeking Moscow’s support in staving off an apparent economic crisis, which they blamed on Moldova. “There is social and economic pressure on Transdniestria, which contradicts European principles and approaches to the protection of human rights and free trade,” the resolution said. Transnistria has been under the control of separatist authorities since 1992, and is home to about 470,000 people. Moldovan authorities have dismissed its demand as a propaganda move and downplayed the recent events, saying there is no risk of escalation. Wednesday’s meeting took place just a day before Russian President Vladimir Putin’s annual address to the Russian Federal Assembly.  Wedged between Moldova and Ukraine, Transnistria is not recognised by any member of the United Nations as an independent entity. About 1,500 Russian troops are stationed in the strip, which is home to ethnic Russians, Ukrainians, and Moldovans. “People from Transnistria have their own passport that is not valid anywhere,” said 36-year-old Cristina Afinoghenova, who is originally from Transnistria and currently living in Chisinau. As a result, “many obtain secondary documents”, she added. Most Transnistrians have Moldovan passports, while some have Russian and Ukrainian papers. Afinoghenova, who was six when the region declared independence, recalled discussions “particularly about language”, arguing “whether the Moldovan language lacked prestige” or “if Russian was considered cool”. The conflict over Transnistria in 1989 was over “the language issue”, according to Anatoli Dirun, head of the Tiraspol School of Public Studies; Tiraspol is the region’s capital. Transnistria was part of what was known as the Moldavian Republic within the Soviet Union. However, with the proclamation of perestroika, the political and financial reform movement launched by Russian leader Mikhail Gorbachev, the growth of national movements began in many Soviet republics. “Moldova was no exception,” Dirun said. Then, the Moldova parliament in 1990 decided that the only state language in the republic would be Moldavian in the Latin script. Transnistria, historically under the sovereignty of the Russian Empire, which had just joined Bessarabia (Moldova) in 1940, “did not agree with this decision”, Dirun added. “After their demands were ignored, the population of Transnistria organised a large-scale strike”, he explained. The war in Ukraine has polarised opinion on both sides of the Dniester River. Dirun believes that since 2014, amid the Donbas conflict and Russian annexation of Crimea, “Ukraine has seriously changed its attitude towards Transnistria, considering the Russian troops stationed there as a threat to its national security.” After February 2022, following Russia’s invasion of its neighbour, Ukraine closed its border with Transnistria. “Tiraspol has found itself sandwiched between Chisinau and Kyiv,” said Dirun. The Russian aggression in Ukraine has also impacted negotiations, said a Moldova government spokesperson of a department focused on reintegration policies. “[It] is currently [impossible] to hold meetings since two of its very important actors, Ukraine and Russia, cannot sit at the same table to negotiate,” said the spokesperson. According to Afinoghenova, there are children and parents in Transnistria “who have different views [regarding the war in Ukraine] and stopped meeting and speaking with each other”. The closure of the border with Ukraine, combined with a Moldovan decision to tax goods imported into the separatist region, has skyrocketed prices of basic products, said Afinoghenova, whose parents and relatives live in Transnistria. According to Dirun, the war has rocked Transnistria’s economy “but also forced the leadership of Transnistria to take a more restrained position” and “not demonstrate its pro-Russian views”. The war in neighbouring Ukraine has also made Transnistria “an even greater ground for disinformation campaigns”, said Anastasia Pociumban, a research fellow at the Center for Order and Governance at the German Council on Foreign Relations. Another challenge “has been related to the supply of electricity”, Pociumban added. Moldova was once one of the European nations most dependent on Russian energy. By 2023, it became independent of Russian gas, but it continues to rely on electricity sourced from the breakaway region of Transnistria. Pociumban argued that “Moldova’s previously full dependency on Russian and gas and electricity from Transnistria was used as a vulnerability for Russia’s blackmailing”. On the other bank of the Dniester River, in Moldova, “this war has [also] polarised the population even more”, said Alexandru Flenchea. However, “if there’s one thing that all Moldovans have in common, it is that almost all of us don’t want war,” he added. Moldova was officially granted candidate status by the European Union in June 2022, a process the bloc still believes in. “Moldova’s European future cannot be held hostage by the conflict,” Peter Stano, EU spokesperson, told Al Jazeera.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/28/transnistria-tensions-could-russia-try-to-annex-moldovas-breakaway-state
"Fishy business: After Russia invaded Ukraine, its seafood industry thrived","Observers say Russia’s seafood industry was not sanctioned quickly or harshly enough, especially during the onset of the war.","After Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the West’s reaction was swift and decisive, with unanimous decisions by the European Union and the United States to support Ukraine and punish Russia with economic sanctions. Two years on, the war continues whileRussia’s economyremains resilient. “Sanctions work. And there is hardly any alternative that would work more effectively. But they are not working at full capacity,” Agiya Zagrebelska, a department manager at the Ukrainian National Agency on Corruption Prevention, told Al Jazeera. While parts of the Russian industry were sanctioned immediately, some important industries were not. The Russian fishing industry was only partially blocked by Washington and marginally by the European bloc, which continues to import about  $1bn worth of seafood from its aggressive neighbour. “Are the lives of a few hundred Ukrainians worth a crab or salmon?” said Zagrebelska. Since February 2022, when the invasion started, the EU has passed 13 sanction packages on Russia targeting President Vladimir Putin and people close to him, Russian banks, media companies, political parties and paramilitary groups. However, the European sanctions excluded most food products from Russia. The bulk of Russia’s billion-dollar seafood business, such as Alaskan pollock or cod, kept flooding EU and US fish markets and restaurants. The US included Russian seafood in sanctions in March 2022. And late last year, the government issued an executive order, taking additional steps by banning any Russian-origin seafood that had been incorporated or substantially transformed into another product in a third country. The new sanctions aimed at closing loopholes. With Russia was unable to export its seafood directly to the US, it sent ships to South Korea or China for processing. According to Stephanie Madsen, the head of the US-based At-Sea Processors Association, Russian fish made it through EU and US borders ultimately in disguise, under another country’s label. Madsen testified in front of the US Congress that Russian fish exports also directly funded Moscow’s war in Ukraine. In 2023, newly-added Russian fish export duties and $3.97bn from auctions distributing pollock and crab fishing quota reportedly went to support Putin’s warfare. “The majority of American consumers do not support the war in Ukraine,” said Sally Yozell, the director of the environmental security programme at the Stimson Center, a think tank. “I think they would feel very uncomfortable if they thought that their fish sticks that they’re eating at home or the [fish] sandwich that they’re eating at lunch was made up of Russian pollock that was supporting the Russian regime in its war against Ukraine.” Even if fish sanctions are in place, ensuring the fish does not enter European or US markets can be difficult because seafood is not always easily traceable. One representative from the Environmental Justice Foundation, a United Kingdom NGO, said that “many EU member states do very little verification of seafood imports, providing opportunities for the products of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing to enter the EU market”. Yozell said, regarding the US system, that mandatory catch licenses showing where the fish is coming from are easily manipulable PDF files. She added that while the US has been monitoring illegally-harvested seafood that enters the US market through the Seafood Import Monitoring Program since 2018, the scheme only focuses on 13 species and does not include some of the Russian seafood that enters the US market like pollock and halibut. That means that even in the US, where Russian seafood is directly banned, the fish served in restaurants or sold in supermarkets might be supporting the Russian economy. The result is that the EU imports about 740,000 tonnes of Alaskan pollock, a third of which comes directly from Russia, while another third gets it from China, of which 95 percent is of Russian origin, said Guus Pastoor, the president of the EU Fish Processors and Traders Association (AIPCE). In 2022, Russia ramped up its fish exports to the EU – despite tensions over the war in Ukraine, Russia’s Kommersant daily reported, citing trade data. Volumes increased by 18 percent that year, and by another 13 percent in 2023, reaching an all-time high. Before reaching Western markets, many Russian catches make a pit stop at the Busan harbour in South Korea, one of the world’s biggest shipping ports. Since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, the port has seen significant increases in Russian seafood. Data obtained for this investigation, in part from the Environmental Justice Foundation, shows that the Russian side of the harbour has been busier than ever. The numbers are staggering. For example, in 2021, no halibut – a highly-priced white-fleshed fish often caught in the Russian/Norwegian Barents Sea – was brought into the Busan harbour by Russian vessels. But in 2023, after the war started, the harbour imported more than 11,000 tonnes. While some of that fish might end up in the South Korean market, halibut exports from Korea to the US and China increased significantly in the same year. In 2023, South Korea imported 213,000 tonnes of seafood from Russia, compared with 439,000 in 2022 and 185,000 in 2020. Korean exports of fish to Europe and the US surged. From 2021 to 2022, exports of frozen herring to the US increased by 99 percent, while fillet exports to Germany skyrocketed by 541 percent. For most of the war, as well as being exempt from sanctions, Russian seafood producers enjoyed some privileges. Some fish arrived in the EU free of duties or at a reduced tariff. In January 2024, the Council of the European Union ended these perks. But not everyone was happy about the increased tariffs on Russian fish. “This, of course, will mean that the price [of fish] will go up because these tariffs are calculated into the final price for the consumer,” said Guus Pastoor, the president of the EU Fish Processors and Traders Association. “We understand the political reasons behind this but we think it sets a dangerous precedent.” Back in Ukraine, Zagrebelska is working around the clock to campaign for stricter sanctions. “Until 2014, I thought that freedom and basic rights were what we had by default. Today, every Ukrainian knows that freedom is something to be won and defended.” This article was developed in cooperation with Aktuálně.cz and Kringvarp Føroya in the Faroe Islands with the support ofJournalismfund Europe.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/28/fishy-business-after-russia-invaded-ukraine-its-seafood-industry-thrived
China lauds Russia relations and calls for strengthened Asia-Pacific role,Beijing official said relations with Moscow are at an historic high.,"China has heralded historically strong relations with Russia as it called for the pair to coordinate on security, stability and development in the Asia-Pacific region. China and Russia should play a “better role as an anchor of stability in the changing circumstances of the century,” the foreign ministry in Beijing said in a statement issued on Wednesday following a visit to Moscow by Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong. Although wary of damaging ties with the West, Beijing has refused to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and relations between the two BRICS states have remained warm amid the war. Sun said in the statement that “under the strategic guidance of President Xi Jinping and President Putin … relations between the two countries are at the best period in history”. Such statements will do little to quell suspicion in the West, which has viewed Moscow and Beijing with increased anxiety over the past two years as theyramp up tiesin trade and defence. Beijing hasresponded with angeras Chinese companies have been blacklisted by the United States and European Union for their role in helping Russia evade trade sanctions. Moscow has looked to Beijing as a crucial economic lifeline amid the sanctions, while China has benefitted from cheap energy imports and access to vast natural resources. At the same time, China’s interest in Russia’s sparsely populated, resource-rich, far-eastern region has long been viewed with some concern in Moscow, which sits 11 time zones westwards. Sun stressed Chinese hopes of deepening “coordination” in the Asia-Pacific region, extolling the role of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), a Eurasian political, economic, international security and defence organisation established in 2001. “Both sides should promote the SCO to better play its role as a ‘stabilizing anchor’ in the century-old changes, strengthen communication and coordination in Asia-Pacific regional affairs, and jointly safeguard regional security, stability and development,” he said. During his trip to the Russian capital, the Chinese official also exchanged views with Moscow’s foreign minister Sergey Lavrov on the Ukraine crisis, the situation on the Korean peninsula, and other international and regional matters, the statement noted, without offering details. Separately, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry said on Wednesday that its special representative for Eurasian affairs will tour Russia, Poland, Ukraine, Germany and France in early March to promote a political settlement of the Ukraine crisis.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/28/china-lauds-russia-relations-and-calls-for-strengthened-asia-pacific-role
"Zelenskyy in Saudi Arabia to push for peace, POW deal with Russia",Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has sought to position himself as a potential mediator to end war between Ukraine and Russia.,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has held talks in Saudi Arabia with the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) in an attempt to push for an end to the invasion of Ukraine and the return of prisoners of war from Russia. A statement on Zelenskyy’s website said the two men discussed a Ukrainian plan to end the conflict, and said that the president had thanked MBS for his mediation role. “The head of state [Zelenskyy] noted in particular Saudi Arabia’s strivings to help in restoring a just peace in Ukraine,” the statement said. “Saudi Arabia’s leadership can help find a just solution.” The state-run Saudi Press Agency said that MBS had “affirmed the Kingdom’s keeness and support for all international endeavours and efforts aimed at resolving the Ukrainian-Russian crisis”. It later reported that Zelenskyy had left Saudi Arabia. MBS has sought to position himself as apotential mediatorto end the war between Ukraine and Russia – even as Riyadh remains closely aligned with Russia on energy policies through the OPEC+ group of countries. Zelenskyy’s trip on Tuesday came as Kyiv’s forces are slowly being pushed back in eastern Ukraine. Russia has gained the initiative due to its big advantage in troop numbers and weapons supplies, military analysts say, as Kyiv waits for news of new provisions from its Western partners. The Ukrainian military said Tuesday that it has withdrawn its forces from two more villages nearAvdiivkain the eastern Donetsk region following intense overnight fighting, according to a Ukrainian army spokesman. Ukrainian troops have pulled back from Sieverne and Stepove, Dmytro Lykhovyi said on national television. The two villages had a population of some 100 people in total before the full-scale invasion, he said. Ukraine continues to “rely on Saudi Arabia’s ongoing active support” in pushing forward with what has been described as a “Peace Formula” to end the full-scale invasion, which marked itssecond anniversaryover the weekend, Zelenskyy said in a message on X. Zelenskyy has presented a 10-point peace formula that, among other things, seeks the expulsion of all Russian forces from Ukraine and accountability for war crimes – at a time when the two sides are fighting from largely static positions along a roughly 1,500km (930-mile) front line. Such ideas are rejected out of hand by Moscow. “The second topic is the return of POWs and deportees,” Zelenskyy wrote. “The kingdom’s leadership has already contributed to the release of our people. I am confident that this meeting will also yield results.” On Monday MBS also met with Russian State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin, the SPA reported, adding that they had discussed ways to boost parliamentary cooperation and “developments of common concern”. In recent years, MBS – the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia – has reached a detente with Iran, pursued a peace deal with Yemen’s Houthi rebels and also offered himself as a leader in other crises worldwide. That is after facing widespread international condemnation for Saudi Arabia’s involvement in the war in Yemen and the 2018 killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, which US intelligence agencies believe was carried out on his orders – a claim MBS denies. In May, Zelenskyy travelled to Saudi Arabia for a meeting of Arab leaders and also met then with MBS. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar – all neighbours on the Arabian Peninsula – have been involved in prisoner exchanges since the war broke out in 2022.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/27/zelenskyy-lands-in-saudi-to-push-for-peace-pow-deal-with-russia
"Germany, NATO rule out sending troops to Ukraine as Russia rebukes Macron",Rebuttal of Macron’s remarks comes as Kremlin warns of conflict if West puts boots on ground in Ukraine.,"Germany, Poland and NATO have ruled out sending ground troops to Ukraine, as the Kremlin warned such a move would mark a major escalation and result in direct conflict between Russia and the Western security alliance. The statements on Tuesday came a day after French President Emmanuel Macronraised the prospectfollowing a European leaders’ meeting on boosting support for Ukraine in its war against Russia. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said participants of the conference in Paris discussed the matter but had agreed “that there will be no ground troops, no soldiers on Ukrainian soil who are sent there by European states or NATO states”. Scholz said there was also consensus “that soldiers operating in our countries also are not participating actively in the war themselves”. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala – two of Kyiv’s strongest supporters – meanwhile said they too were not considering sending troops. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg also told The Associated Press news agency that while members of the alliance had provided “unprecedented support” to Ukraine, “there are no plans for NATO combat troops on the ground in Ukraine”. The idea of sending troops has been taboo, particularly as NATO seeks to avoid being dragged into a wider war with nuclear-armed Russia. Nothing prevents NATO members from joining such an undertaking individually or in groups, but the organisation would get involved only if all 31 members agreed. The Kremlin, meanwhile, warned that a direct conflict between NATO and Russia would be inevitable if the alliance sent combat troops. “The very fact of discussing the possibility of sending certain contingents to Ukraine from NATO countries is a very important new element,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters,commenting on Macron’s remarks. It is “absolutely not in the interests” of European members of NATO, Peskov said. “In that case, we would need to talk not about the probability, but about the inevitability [of direct conflict].” With Macron increasingly looking isolated, his government subsequently sought to clarify his comments. French Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne said on Tuesday the president had in mind sending troops for specific tasks such as helping with mine clearance, production of weapons on site, and cyber-defence. “[This] could require a [military] presence on Ukrainian territory, without crossing the threshold of fighting,” Sejourne told French lawmakers. “It’s not sending troops to wage war against Russia,” the minister said. The conference in Paris was held just after France, Germany and the UK each signed 10-year bilateral security agreements with Ukraine as its government works to shore up Western support.

Russian activist Oleg Orlov sentenced to 30 months in prison,Moscow court finds veteran human rights advocate who spoke out against the war in Ukraine guilty of discrediting armed forces.,"A Russian court has sentenced prominent human rights campaignerOleg Orlovto two-and-a-half years in prison after he was found guilty of discrediting the army. Footage posted online on Tuesday byMemorial, a now-banned Russian human rights group, showed the handcuffed 70-year-old smiling as he was put by officers in a van after the verdict by the Golovinskii district court in Moscow. Nobel Prize-winning Memorial, which has Orlov as its co-chairperson, slammed the trial as “a mockery of justice and an attack on the fundamental right to free expression”. It said in a statement cosigned by dozens of rights groups that the campaigner’s legal team would appeal the verdict and pledged to continue its work. #HandsOffOrlovOleg Orlov being taken awaypic.twitter.com/ub6FAc0tFd — Memorial in English (@EnMemorial)February 27, 2024  Human rights groups say the targeting of Kremlin critics has escalated since Russia launched a full-scale invasion against Ukraine in February 2022. The case against Orlov was based on an article he wrote that year in which he denounced the invasion and said Russia, under the leadership of President Vladimir Putin, had descended into “fascism”. A district court initially fined him 150,000 roubles ($1,629), but a retrial was ordered, and prosecutors sought a jail sentence of two years and 11 months. The prosecution claimed that Orlov published the article motivated by hostility “against traditional Russian spiritual, moral and patriotic values” and hatred of the Russian military, according to independent Russian news outlet Mediazona. In his closing remarks on Monday, Orlov said he had committed no crime and regretted nothing, instead slamming the “totalitarian” and “fascist” Russian state. “All these are links in the same chain: The death, or rather, the massacre of Alexey [Navalny], the judicial reprisals against other critics of the regime, including me, the strangulation of freedom in the country, the entry of Russian troops into Ukraine.” Navalny, an opposition politician and staunch Kremlin critic,died suddenlyearlier in February in an Arctic penal colony. While the circumstances of his death remain unclear, many, including world leaders and activist groups, blame Russian authorities for his death. The Kremlin rejected the allegation as “unsubstantiated and groundless.” The UN special rapporteur on human rights in Russia, Mariana Katzarova, called Orlov’s trial “an orchestrated attempt to silence the voices of human rights defenders in Russia”. Orlov himself, in a recent interview with the AFP news agency, had said he held no illusions about the trial’s outcome. Even as other campaigners fled Russia as antidefamation laws intensified and those found guilty of spreading “fake information” about the army could face up to 15 years in prison, Orlov remained in the country where he said he was “more useful” than abroad. He told AFP his long career spent working on documenting Soviet crimes and human rights abuses in modern Russia gave him no choice but to also campaign against the invasion of Ukraine.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/27/russian-activist-oleg-orlov-sentenced-to-30-months-in-prison
"Two years in, left and right united in opposing more US aid for Ukraine","With no end in sight to conflict with Russia, conservatives and progressives say ‘no’ to more military aid for Ukraine.","Two years after Russia invaded Ukraine, Americans’ support for the war is waning, creating a surprising alliance between the political left and right. Forty-one percentof Americans told Gallup pollsters three months ago that the United States is spending too much to support Ukraine on the battlefield. That compares with 24 percent of Americans who felt similarly in August 2022, six months after the start of the war. Perhaps most surprising, though, is that the shift is most pronounced among Republicans, the political party that has historically been known for its hawkishness. In March 2022, 9 percent of Republicans believed the US was supplying Ukraine with too much military aid; by December last year,48 percentof Republicans said their government was spending too much on Ukraine, according to Pew Research Centre surveys. The percentage of Democrats who view the Biden administration’s spending on Ukraine as excessive is only 16 percent, according to the same December poll. To be sure, partisan politics shapes the rift in Washington with Republicans in the House of Representatives refusing to pass legislation that includes $60bn in military aid for Ukraine. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson has said the bill passed by the Democratic-controlled Senate doesn’t do enough to protect the southern border from immigration, a stance that bolsters Donald Trump’s presidential campaign against incumbent Joe Biden. And Representative Marjorie Taylor Green leads a group of staunch conservatives in Congress who haveconsistently opposedUS funding for Ukraine. Still, a number of liberals, such as the writer Glen Greenwald and the podcaster Jimmy Dore, have joined conservatives, such as media presenter Tucker Carlson, in questioning the federal government’s priorities in spending billions on a distant war while the US has so many pressing needs, including immigration, affordable housing, healthcare and student debt relief. “The motivations for the far left and the far right are very different, but what unites them is where they arrive on Ukraine and also this anti-establishment populist strain,” said Dominik Stecula, assistant professor of political science at Colorado State University While some in the Republican Party — like presidential candidate Nikki Haley and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell — have a traditional national security focus reminiscent of the Cold War, the faction of the party that identifies with former President Trump’s political movement – MAGA, short for his campaign slogan Make America Great Again – is increasingly rejecting Ukraine spending. Isolationism has been a feature of Trump’s political message since 2016, explained Rachel Blum, an assistant professor in the University of Oklahoma’s Department of Political Science. “That is a really core thread of the MAGA movement.” The white working-class voters who make up the bulk of Trump’s supporters are animated by the sense that they are being left behind in a shape-shifting economy and money that would be better spent on their families is going to people of colour, the LGBTQ community and big business, including defence contractors. These sentiments often converge with racist, homophobic and transphobic beliefs. Blum told Al Jazeera that Trump’s isolationism is of a particular type that does not necessarily transfer to other conflicts. “Trump is much warmer toward Israel than he is toward Ukraine,” she explained. “So I think a lot of it has to do with Trump’s very personal animosity toward Ukraine and [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy and his past problems there and his affinity for [Russian President Vladimir] Putin.” As the MAGA movement has strengthened its hold on the Republican Party, she said, “it’s not surprising that those sentiments are starting to spill over.” Republicans are divided between those who remember Cold War policy and view Putin, a former Soviet intelligence officer, as a threat and those who are inclined to blindly follow Trump, she said. In a Venn diagram, those two groups do not overlap. “It’s hard for me to think of an example of a Republican who is pro-Ukraine aid and super supportive of Trump,” Blum said. As the November election draws closer, Blum said Trump’s position as the presumptive nominee gives Republicans an incentive to oppose aid to Ukraine to win favour with Trump if he returns to the White House. A number of factors played pivotal roles in the Republicans’  shift against Ukrainian aid, said David Hopkins, associate professor of political science at Boston College. A generational divide is part of the story. Older conservatives remember the Cold War alliance between the US and Western Europe against the Soviet Union while younger conservatives don’t have memories of the tensions between the West and the Soviet bloc, he said. Generally, Americans’ foreign policy worldview is likely to be influenced by authority figures they trust, including politicians and media personalities, he said. And conservatives are reflexively sceptical of policies favoured by Democrats, such as Biden’s support for Ukraine.    Moreover, Trump supporters’ sense of American exceptionalism extends to unfavourable views on Europe – which is seen as not wholly sharing the same values as the US – and, consequently, NATO. “They are open, just on the merits, to the argument that the US should be looking for ways to remove itself from involvement with European politics and alliances with international allies and organisations like NATO and the UN,” Hopkins said. Trump supporters are also open to viewing Putin as a traditionalist with similar values to theirs. “Under Putin, Russia has advertised itself internationally as a bulwark of traditional Christianity,” Hopkins said. “I think there are elements of the populist right in the United States that respond very positively to that message and indeed see figures like Putin as ideological allies in the culture war and international politics.” In aJuly 2022 piece for Foreign Policy, Stecula and co-author Jan Dutkiewicz argued that while the majority of Americans supported aid to Ukraine, many on the far right and far left argued the US should not intervene — an observation they explained with the “horseshoe theory”. The theory comes from French philosopher Jean-Pierre Faye, who believed extreme political positions aligned like a horseshoe magnet, which widens in the middle before nearly converging at its prongs, Stecula explained. On the far right, there is a warmth toward authoritarianism, he said. “I don’t think it’s a feature of conservatism, but it’s a feature of the Republican Party right now under Trump.” He agreed with Hopkins that the populist right is warming to Putin’s agenda, including his anti-LGBTQ policies. “He’s very well-versed in American culture wars. He talks about cancel culture. He talks about woke-ism all the time,” Stecula said. Meanwhile on the political left, the argument is that the Democrats have become gradually more hawkish since the Vietnam War in an effort to thwart Republican efforts, especially by former President Ronald Reagan, to portray the party as soft, and naive about the threats posed by communism. It is not uncommon, for instance, to hear progressives on popular podcasts express their view that the Democrats have, in fact, become even more hawkish than the Republicans as a means of rewarding their Wall Street donors with windfall profits that accrue from investments in arms suppliers such as Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and General Dynamics. Leftist writers and pundits contend that former President Barack Obama was the most interventionist, hawkish president in US history, launching air strikes or combat operations in at least seven countries – Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, Syria, Somalia and Pakistan – and dramatically expanding the Pentagon’s military footprints in Africa. And while Trump enthusiastically embraced the wars he inherited from Obama, even progressives acknowledge that he did not start any new wars, and he reduced the Pentagon’s military presence in Africa. In a 2023 interview with then-Fox News host Carlson, the progressive Greenwaldsaid:“I’ve been asking since February, in what conceivable way will the lives of American citizens be materially improved? How will you or your family’s lives be protected or fostered by sending tens of billions of dollars, now in excess of $100bn, for the war in Ukraine?”    Another popular progressive, the YouTuber Dore, said at an antiwar rally last year: “We could have spent that money saving lives with universal healthcare, but instead, we spend that money taking lives overseas, which is our specialty.” And Robert F Kennedy Jr, who is popular with both the left and the right in the US, announced his 2024 presidential campaign by contrasting the “$113bn committed to the Ukraine” with the “57 percent of Americans [who] can’t put their hand on $1,000 if they have an emergency” and the “one-quarter of Americans [who] go to bed hungry”. Stecula attributed the convergence of the left and right on the issue of Ukraine to a populist streak that has long been present in US politics. “They’re people on the fringes who reject the establishment, who are more anti-elite. And it’s a weird situation where people who are seemingly very different from each other can arrive at similar conclusions about what the US should be doing in regards to the conflict in Ukraine.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/26/with-no-end-in-sight-to-conflict-with-russia-conservatives-and-progressives-say-no-to-more-military-aid-for-ukraine
France’s Macron does not rule out Europeans sending troops to Ukraine,"French president opens door to European nations sending troops to Ukraine, although he cautioned that there was no consensus at this stage.","French President Emmanuel Macron has said that sending Western ground troops to Ukraine could not be “ruled out” as European allies announced new measures to deliver munitions and boost Kyiv in its fight against Russia. The comments on Monday came after some 20 European leaders gathered in Paris to send Russian President Vladimir Putin a message of European resolve on Ukraine and counter the Kremlin’s narrative that Moscow was bound to win a war now in its third year. “We are convinced that the defeat of Russia is indispensable to security and stability in Europe,” Macron told reporters after the meeting. “There’s no consensus today to send in an official, endorsed manner troops on the ground. But in terms of dynamics, nothing can be ruled out,” he said. “We will do everything that we must so that Russia does not win.” Macron declined to provide details about which nations were considering sending troops, saying he prefers to maintain some “strategic ambiguity”. A White House official told the Reuters news agency that the United States had no plans to send troops to fight in Ukraine and that there were also no plans to send NATO troops to fight in Ukraine. We are talking about our support for Ukraine and our collective security. A collective leap is necessary from all of us.pic.twitter.com/NViI9ntaVY — Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron)February 26, 2024  The conference in Paris signalled Macron’s eagerness to present himself as a European champion of Ukraine’s cause, amid growing fears that US support could wane in the coming years. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Poland’s President Andrzej Duda were among the European heads of state and government present at the conference, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy joined virtually. Duda said the most heated discussion was about whether to send troops to Ukraine and “there was no agreement on the matter”. “Opinions differ here, but there are no such decisions,” he said. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, who has opposed military aid to Ukraine, meanwhile said several NATO and European Union members were considering sending soldiers to Ukraine on a bilateral basis. “I can confirm there are countries that are prepared to send their own troops to Ukraine, there are countries that say never, among which Slovakia belongs, and there are countries that say this proposal needs to be considered,” he said before boarding his plane home. The conference was called as Ukraine suffered setbacks on eastern battlefields, with its generals complaining of shortages of arms and soldiers. It saw progress on a Czech-led initiative to buy hundreds of thousands of ammunition rounds from third countries, something that France has been cautious about as it wants to prioritise developing Europe’s own industry. Ammunition supplies have become a critical issue for Kyiv. The EU, though, is falling short of its target of sending Ukraine a million rounds of artillery shells by March. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said about 15 countries had agreed to sign up to his initiative. “We are talking about hundreds of thousands of pieces of ammunition we should and could get in relatively short time,” Fiala told reporters. Defence ministers had been mandated to come up with a plan within the next 10 days, Portugal’s Prime Minister Antonio Costa said. Rutte said the Netherlands would contribute 100 million euros ($108.5m) for the purchase of munitions overseas. He said the countries that would provide the munitions had asked not to be identified. “I think there was a great sense of urgency, particularly for the short term on ammunition and on air defence,” Rutte said. “I hope other countries will follow.” Macron also announced a new coalition would be set up to supply Ukraine with “missiles and bombs of medium and long range to carry out deep strikes”. There was a “broad consensus to do more and quicker”, he added, saying there was also a consensus to ramp up joint production of armaments with Ukraine and boost its own military industry. The Paris conference comes after France, Germany and the UK recently signed 10-year bilateral agreements with Ukraine to send a strong signal of long-term backing as Kyiv works to shore up Western support.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/26/macron-holds-meeting-in-paris-to-rally-european-support-for-ukraine
"Hungary ratifies Sweden’s NATO bid, clearing final obstacle to membership",Vote by Hungarian parliament ends more than 18 months of delays.,"Hungary’s parliament has voted to ratify Sweden’s bid to join NATO, bringing an end to more than 18 months of delays that have frustrated the alliance as it seeks to expand in response to Russia’s war on Ukraine. Monday’s vote, which passed with 188 members for and six against, was a culmination of months of wrangling by Hungary’s allies to persuade its nationalist government to lift its block on Sweden’s membership. The government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban submitted the protocols for approving Sweden’s entry into NATO in July 2022, but the matter had stalled in parliament over opposition by governing party lawmakers. Unanimous support among all NATO members is required to admit new countries, and Hungary is the last of the alliance’s 31 members to give its backing since Turkey ratified the request last month.  Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson called it “a historic day”. “We stand ready to shoulder our share of the responsibility for NATO’s security,” Kristersson wrote on X. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said the military alliance would soon be “stronger”. “Now that all Allies have approved, Sweden will become the 32nd #NATO Ally,” the secretary-general wrote on X. “Sweden’s membership will make us all stronger and safer.” Orban, a right-wing populist who has forged close ties with Russia, has said criticism of Hungary’s democracy by Swedish politicians had soured relations between the two countries and led to reluctance among lawmakers in his Fidesz party. But the vote on Monday removed the final membership hurdle for Sweden which, along with neighbouring Finland,first applied to join the alliance in May 2022, just a few months after the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Finland experienced fewer roadblocks in its membership application and joined NATO in April last year.    Addressing lawmakers before the vote on Sweden, Orban said: “Sweden and Hungary’s military cooperation and Sweden’s NATO accession strengthen Hungary’s security.” Orban criticised Hungary’s European Union and NATO allies for placing increased pressure on his government in recent months to move forward on bringing Sweden into the alliance. “Several people tried to intervene from the outside in the settling of our disputes [with Sweden], but this did not help but rather hampered the issue,” Orban said. “Hungary is a sovereign country. It does not tolerate being dictated by others, whether it be the content of its decisions or their timing.” This month, a bipartisan group of United States senators visited Hungary and announced it would submit a joint resolution to the US Congress condemning Hungary’s alleged democratic backsliding and urging Orban’s government to immediately lift its block on Sweden’s transatlantic integration. On Friday, Kristersson met with Orban in Budapest, where they appeared to achieve a reconciliation after months of diplomatic tensions. After their meeting, the leaders announced the conclusion of a defence industry agreement that will include Hungary’s purchase of four Swedish-made JAS 39 Gripen jets and the extension of a service contract for its existing Gripen fleet. Orban said the additional fighter jets “will significantly increase our military capabilities and further strengthen our role abroad” and will improve Hungary’s ability to participate in joint NATO operations. “To be a member of NATO together with another country means we are ready to die for each other,” Orban said. “A deal on defence and military capacities helps to reconstruct the trust between the two countries.” A presidential signature is needed to formally endorse the approval of Sweden’s NATO bid, which is expected within the next few days. Sweden will then be invited to accede to the Washington Treaty and officially become NATO’s 32nd member.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/26/hungary-ratifies-swedens-nato-bid-clearing-final-obstacle-to-membership
"Denmark’s Nord Stream probe finds sabotage, not enough grounds for case",Police find deliberate sabotage responsible for 2022 blasts at Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines but not sufficient grounds to pursue criminal case.,"Denmark says it has closed its investigation into mysterious blasts that in 2022 damaged two pipelines built to carry Russian gas to Europe, with authorities concluding they were an act of sabotage but there were not enough grounds for a criminal case. The explosions at the multibillion-dollar Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines contributed to tensions that followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine two years ago. Russia and Ukraine’s Western allies swiftly traded blame over the incident under the Baltic Sea, which also caused environmentally damaging releases of vast amounts of methane into the air. Danish police said in a statement on Monday that their investigation – one of three into the explosions – had found “there was deliberate sabotage” of the pipelines, but “the assessment is that there are not sufficient grounds to pursue a criminal case”. In response to the announcement, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the decision was “close to absurdity” and accused Denmark of closing the case to cover up for its allies. “On the one hand, they recognise that a deliberate sabotage took place, but on the other hand they are not moving forward,” Peskov told journalists, adding that Denmark had refused requests to provide information about its investigation. Denmark’s announcement came after Sweden also said earlier this monthit was closing its probe, noting that the case did not fall under its jurisdiction. Swedish officials also said they handed over to Germany “material that can be used as evidence in the German investigation”. The German federal prosecutor’s office said on Monday that its investigation continues and that it would not provide more information.  The undersea explosions shortly after midnight on September 26, 2022 ruptured the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which was Russia’s main natural gas supply route to Germany until Russia cut off supplies at the end of the previous month. They also damaged the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which never entered service because Germany suspended its certification process shortly before the invasion of Ukraine. The explosions took place about 80 metres (260 feet) underwater on the ocean floor in the Baltic Sea. Seismic measurements indicated that they occurred shortly before the discovery of unexplained leaks. Months after the detonations, there is no accepted explanation. As investigations continue, a series of unconfirmed reports have variously accused Russia, the United States and Ukraine of sabotage. The pipelines were long a target of criticism by the United States and some of its allies, who warned that they posed a risk to Europe’s energy security by increasing dependence on Russian gas. Russia has accused the US of staging the explosions, which they have described as a terror attack. The US has denied involvement. In March 2023, German mediareportedthat a pro-Ukraine group was involved in the explosions using a vessel and setting off from the German port of Rostock. Ukraine rejected suggestions it might have ordered the attack and German officials voiced caution over the accusation. Swedish prosecutors earlier hinted that the identity of the perpetrator was likely to remain unclear. Beyond their geopolitical impact, the Nord Stream pipeline leaks were a huge environmental disaster with local wildlife affected and huge volumes of methane discharged into the Baltic Sea in what observers believe could be the single largest release of methane due to human activity.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/26/denmarks-nord-stream-probe-finds-sabotage-not-enough-grounds-for-case
"Zelenskyy says 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers killed in war with Russia",Ukrainian president’s comments are the first time that Kyiv has confirmed the number of its losses since the Russian invasion began.,"Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in action in the two years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion. Speaking at the “Ukraine. Year 2024” forum in Kyiv, Zelenskyy said that “each of these losses is a great sacrifice” for Ukraine. He added that “tens of thousands of civilians” had been killed in occupied areas of Ukraine, but said that no exact figures would be available until the war was over. It’s the first time that Kyiv has confirmed the number of its losses since the start of Russia’s full-scale war against Ukraine on February 24, 2022. Russia has also provided few official casualty figures. Independent Russian news outlet Mediazona said on Saturday that about 75,000 Russian men died in 2022 and 2023 fighting in the war. A United States intelligence report declassified in mid-December 2023 estimated that 315,000 Russian troops had been killed or wounded in Ukraine. If accurate, the figure would represent 87 percent of the roughly 360,000 troops Russia had before the war, according to the report. It has been two years since RussiainvadedUkraine and commemorations to mark the second anniversary brought expressions of continued support, new bilateral security agreements and new aid commitments from Ukraine’s Western allies. But Ukraine’s Defence Minister Rustem Umerov highlighted that they still needed to deliver on their commitments if Kyiv is to have any chance of holding out against Moscow and stressed that delays in arms shipments will cost lives. “We look to the enemy: Their economy is almost $2 trillion, they use up to 15 percent official and nonofficial budget [funds] for the war, which constitutes over $100bn annually. So basically whenever a commitment doesn’t come on time, we lose people, we lose territory,” he said, speaking at the Kyiv forum. Europe has admitted it will fall far short of a plan to deliver more than one million artillery shells to Ukraine by March, instead hoping to complete the shipments by the end of the year. Umerov highlighted that such delays put Ukraine at a further disadvantage “in the mathematics of war” against Russia, which the West has said is increasingly building a war economy. Kyiv has also been weakened by the blocking of a vital $60bn US aid package amid political wrangling in the US Congress. US President Joe Bidensaidthe hold-ups directly contributed to Ukraine being forced to withdraw from Avdiivka. On Sunday, Ukraine’s Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said he was “deeply convinced that the US will not abandon Ukraine in terms of financial, military and armed support”. In recent weeks, fighting has intensified on parts of the front line. On Sunday, Russian shelling and rocket strikes continued to pummel Ukraine’s south and east, as local Ukrainian officials reported that at least two civilians were killed and eight others were wounded in the Zaporizhia and Kherson provinces. Moscow and Kyiv also continued to trade nightly drone attacks, with Ukraine’s air defences shooting down 16 of 18 Iranian-made Shahed drones launched overnight by Moscow and a Russian drone on Sunday morning striking an unspecified facility in Ukraine’s western Khmelnytskyi region, the regional military administration reported without giving details. Russian troops also appeared to be pressing on west ofAvdiivka, the strategic city whose capture this month handed Moscow a significant victory. Zelenskyy told a news conference on Sunday that Ukraine has a clear plan for a new counteroffensive against Russian forces. Kyiv’s troops conducted a counteroffensive last year, but were unable to break through prepared defensive lines in the Russian-occupied south and east. “There is a plan [for a counteroffensive], the plan is clear, I can’t tell you the details,” Zelenskyy said. He said that a major shake-up that saw the head of Ukraine’s military replaced earlier this month was connected to the new plan of action on the battlefield. “This plan is related to the change of management; there are corresponding changes. Several plans will be prepared due to a leak of information,” Zelenskyy said, without elaborating. Earlier he said that Kyiv’s plans to conduct a counteroffensive last year had been leaked and ended up “on a desk in the Kremlin” before the operation had even begun. Meanwhile at the forum in Kyiv, besides highlighting issues in military deliveries, Umerov insisted that Ukrainian forces were doing “everything that’s possible, and also what’s impossible, to secure a breakthrough” this year. The defence minister said that a “strong” military strategy is already in place for the coming months, but did not disclose details.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/25/ukraines-umerov-says-delays-in-western-arms-deliveries-costing-lives
Should Russia pay Ukraine to rebuild – or even to defeat its own invasion?,The EU finds itself in uncharted legal territory as it ponders using Russia’s frozen assets against it.,"Within days of invading Ukraine in February 2022, Russia lost control of the assets its central bank held in foreign currencies abroad. Some $300bn was frozen in the European Union, United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Japan – about half the bank’s holdings – as Ukraine’s allies sought to hobble Russia’s ability to wage war. Legally, the money belongs to Russia, but the EU, which holds the largest chunk – about $207bn – is struggling to find a legal way to use Russia’s money to rebuild Ukraine’s shattered infrastructure. Some experts believe Russia’s money could even be used to generate immediate benefits for Ukraine’s war effort – especially since $60bn of US military aid remains stalled in Congress. On January 29, EU leaders told European financial institutions to keep separate accounts for Russian-immobilised money, along with any profits made from investing it, pending a decision on what to do. “This decision paves the way for the council to decide on a possible establishment of a financial contribution to the EU budget raised on these net profits to support Ukraine and its recovery and reconstruction at a later stage,” said the European Council. The G7 supported its decision. “So far, the EU has been putting out into the public domain the idea of taxing this money,” Anton Moiseienko, an international law expert at Australian National University, told Al Jazeera.    Tax on the profits made from investing the money is said to amount to about $2.5bn. “What we’re seeing today is the beginning of a more ambitious approach … separating the profits suggests that the entire [proceeds] might be sent to Ukraine,” Moiseienko said. The proceeds could amount to between $15bn and $17bn over four years. The legal reasoning is that Russia will, at some point, be called upon to pay compensation for invading Ukraine. “What we have here is a recognised debt. Russia owes reparations to Ukraine,” said Moiseienko. “At some point, it does become rather perverse that we all know Russia owes the debt and we’re going to pay Ukraine to rebuild but we’re not going to touch the Russian money.” Some law experts go further. “I would invest it in the defence industry,” Maria Gavouneli, an international law professor at Athens University and director of the Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy, a think tank, told Al Jazeera. “We wouldn’t be buying bullets to send Ukraine, we’d be making bullets to send Ukraine. Under such a formula, you could use the entire principal [of $207bn] as well as the proceeds,” Gavouneli said. EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton last month floated the idea of a 100-billion-euro ($108bn) European Defence Investment Programme (EDIP), to revive Europe’s dormant defence industries, without specifying where the money would come from. Investing Russia’s money would enable the EU to plough vast resources into raising the production of artillery rounds and air defence missiles which Ukraine sorely needs. It would, perhaps, be the first time in history that an aggressor’s assets would be used to help the defender’s war effort, Gavouneli said. But, she said, it would not amount to a confiscation of Russian assets, which would be illegal. “When the war is over there has to be an accounting. It has to be clear that Russia’s property can be returned to Russia. If it is going to be kept against reparations [to rebuild Ukraine], that will be decided at that time,” she said. Ukrainian experts go further, still. Russian money could be leveraged and used as collateral for loans worth several times its nominal value, Tymofiy Mylovanov, president of the Kyiv School of Economics, told Al Jazeera. “You can get much more than the proceeds if you need to,” Mylovanov said. “It also serves to bring a sense of fairness.” As attractive as all this sounds, there are also serious risks involved, bogging the discussion down in a legal and political morass of dissent and fear of consequences. The EU was meant to propose a legal formula to make use of Russia’s assets last December, but nothing of this emerged publicly. Another discussion was to be held earlier this month – but, again, there was no decision. One fear is the risk of retaliation by Russia which, on December 29, said it had a list of European, US and other assets it could seize. Russian state news agency RIA put their value at $288bn last month. RIA did not provide details, and it was not clear if this sum included assets Western companies have already written down or divested themselves of. For example, British Petroleum pulled out of a stake in Russian state oil company Rosneft, valued at $14bn, days after the war began. Shell withdrew from Russian gas projects valued at $3bn. The greater fear, however, is the reputational impact on the US dollar and the Euro, currently the world’s two most dependable reserve currencies, attracting vast investments from governments, central banks, corporations and individuals around the world. “It will undermine the confidence of other countries in the United States as well as in the EU as economic guarantors. Therefore, such actions are fraught with very, very serious consequences,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists in December. The European Central Bank agrees. “The euro is the second most important currency in the world, and we have to consider its long-term reputation,” said ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos late last year. “Weaponising a currency inevitably reduces its attractiveness and encourages the emergence of alternatives,” Bank of Italy governor Fabio Panetta said last month. Despite all this, EU leaders have tried to hammer out a new legal theory that protects the reputation of the euro and deals a measure of justice for Ukraine. Although states are obliged to respect the assets of other states, international law provides an exception known as countermeasures, Dapo Akande, professor of public international law at Oxford University, told Al Jazeera. “Countermeasures just means that you are taking action which is ordinarily unlawful, but is justified as a response to a prior unlawful action by the other state,” said Akande. In this case, Russia’s unlawful act was to wage a war of aggression, against the statutes of the United Nations Charter and its recognition of Ukraine’s borders in 1991. Countermeasures carry an important condition, says Akande, “that the object of it is to induce compliance by the other state with its obligations, which means countermeasures have to be temporary and reversible and inducing compliance”. In other words, if Russia withdrew from Ukraine, its money should be returnable, so any investments made with it should be reversible. The pricklier question is who can enforce countermeasures. “Can the states that are not the direct victims of the violation, ie states that are not Ukraine, seize assets?” asked Akande. “There’s been a growing number of lawyers who’ve come out and said yes, that would be perfectly lawful,” said Moiseienko. Still, by acting on Ukraine’s behalf, the EU would be breaking new legal ground that Russia might challenge in European courts. The impetus may ultimately be provided by unprecedented political circumstances. The longer US funding for Ukraine remains blocked by allies of presidential hopeful Donald Trump in Congress, and the more Russia challenges European sovereignty by pushing deeper into Ukraine, the less tenable it may become politically to hold in awe the untouchability of Russian assets.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/25/should-russia-pay-ukraine-to-rebuild-or-even-to-defeat-its-own-invasion
"Bitter but resilient: Ukraine fights on, two years into Russia’s war","Short of ammunition though not determination, Ukraine faces an uncertain future. What is clear is that it won’t buckle to Russia.","Kharkiv, Ukraine –Andriy’s undermanned squad can only shoot 10 shells a day at encroaching Russian troops because of a dire shortage of ammunition. The 45-year-old suffers from stomach pains, deteriorating eyesight and other consequences of multiple contusions that landed him in hospital several times. Two years ago, Andriy defended Kyiv in the full-scale war’s first weeks until Russian troops withdrew after heavy losses, and fought in the eastern town of Bakhmut that fell to the Wagner private army last May. The timing and duration of tours to “zero” positions, or the front lines of the eastern Donbas region, are unpredictable, and his commanding officers deliberately report less “zero” time for him to decrease his pay, he said. But when it comes to Andriy’s determination to stand his ground, he has no doubts or qualms. “This is my land, understand? I grew up here. I eat bread grown on this land. That’s what keeps me going,” he told Al Jazeera while on a break in the eastern city of Kharkiv. He withheld his last name and his unit’s location in accordance with wartime regulations. Theabsolute majorityof Ukrainians – 85 percent – are confident of victory in the war that began two years ago today, according to a survey by the Rating Group, a Kyiv-based pollster, released on Monday. Most of the remaining 15 percent hail from eastern or southern regions next to the front lines and occupied areas that witness the worst consequences of the war firsthand, it said. “I’d agree for peace if they want to keep the occupied lands,” Konstantin, a resident of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city that sits near the Russian border, told Al Jazeera. Last spring, the shockwave from an explosion right next to his apartment building shattered his windows and blew open his solid metal front door. He stayed on, but almost daily bombardments and the failure of last year’s counteroffensive have worn him out. “I don’t want to grow old hearing the incoming [shelling] every day and night, because one day it’ll hit my home,” he said. Western aid is crucial to Ukraine’s victory, say 79 percent of Ukrainians, according to the Rating Group’s poll. But the aid is dwindling, while Western governments tacitly urge Kyiv to sign a truce with Moscow by recognising the loss of occupied areas that amount to one-fifth of Ukraine’s territory. Yet, the public mantra of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and every Ukrainian politician is: Moscow has to withdraw from all occupied areas before peace talks can begin. “The political acknowledgment of the occupation is impossible, no politician will go for it, and the public won’t accept it, ” Kyiv-based analyst Alexey Kushch told Al Jazeera. “There are unofficial talks about freezing the conflict according to the Korean scenario,” he said, referring to the Korean Armistice of 1953, under which North and South Korea agreed to an end to fighting without formally ending the war. But until the war is over, Ukraine will “officially announce maximal goals” to mobilise the public and Western allies, Kushch said. The war has cost Ukraine 30 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) and 3.5 million jobs, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Wednesday. But the biggest loss is to its people. At least 6.5 million people have fled abroad, and the population in Kyiv-controlled areas is below 30 million, analysts say – a far cry from the 52 million at the dawn of Ukraine’s independence in 1991. Many refugees have nothing to go back to. Last June, Halyna, a 28-year-old woman from the southern city ofMariupol, where tens of thousands of civilians died during a months-long siege, told Al Jazeera about the horrors her two young children went through during Russian air raids and shelling. “When things got real tense, they just convulsed with hysteria in those basements. And they asked questions: ‘Does it hurt to die?’ she said. After moving to the Czech Republic, her children are safe – but still scarred. “Only recently, my son stopped being frightened by the sound of planes. The daughter sometimes weeps at night, wants to go back to her past life, to her pillow with [the images of] cats,” she said. “There’s a new life looming for us, but it’s not in Ukraine, unfortunately,” she said. Last week, Russia scored a rare victory after Ukrainian forces pulled out of the town of Avdiivka in the Donbas region held by Russian-backed separatists since 2014. But the Kremlin-funded propaganda blew it out of proportion. “The Kyiv regime and its protectors have missed a blow they will possibly not recover from,” publicist Kirill Strelnikovwroteon Tuesday. The news coincided with the death of jailed opposition leader Alexey Navalny, and Russian President Vladimir Putin gloated. “The objectives our ill-wishers had in terms of limiting, isolating Russia, obviously fell apart,”he saidon Wednesday. While independent observers reject Putin’s assessment, they admit that Russia’s economy has shown unexpected resilience to Western sanctions designed to crush it. On Friday, the US imposed its latest round of sanctions against Russia, in response to Navalny’s death in an Arctic prison. “The sanctions didn’t affect Russia’s economy the way they had been expected to, Russia’s isolation didn’t become total,” Temur Umarov of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, a think tank in Berlin, told Al Jazeera. With all walks of life around them militarised, many Ukrainians tilted to the political right largely accepting fiercely anti-Russian slogans spawned by fringe nationalist groups, said Kyiv-based human rights advocate Vyacheslav Likhachev. These groups stood for banning all things Russian, including the language, the literature and the Orthodox Church that reported toMoscow Patriarch Kirill. These days, millions of Russian-speaking Ukrainians voluntarily switch to Ukrainian in daily life, while Zelenskyy’s government is pondering a ban on the Russia-affiliated church. “Radical ideas that used to be marginal are now shared by a sizable part of the public and are to some extent implemented by the government,” Likhachev told Al Jazeera. What the war made clear is the sense of identity, unity and true political independence. “The war showed us that a sovereign state can’t exist simply by default. That sovereignty demands constant work on self-determination, self-understanding, self-respect,” Svetlana Chunikhina, vice president of the Association of Political Psychologists, a group in Kyiv, told Al Jazeera. Ukrainians “acquired the sense of volumetric political optics that lets them see themselves as full-fledged participants of the historical process within the [European] continent and the world,” she said. And they didn’t forget about their trademarksense of humourthat helped them survive the war’s first months.

Western leaders visit Ukraine to show solidarity as war enters third year,Visit comes as Kyiv is on the defensive amid flagging Western aid and Russian territorial gains.,"Western leaders including the European Commission’s Ursula von der Leyen and Canada’s Justin Trudeau have visited Kyiv to show solidarity with Ukraine as it enters the third year of its war with Russia. Von der Leyen, Trudeau, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and Belgium Prime Minister Alexander De Croo arrived in the country on Saturday on an overnight train from neighbouring Poland as Ukraine marks the second anniversary of Moscow’s invasion on the defensive amid flagging Western aid and Russian territorial gains. “We have been fighting for this for 730 days of our lives. We will win on the best day of our lives,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said at an anniversary event at Kyiv’s Gostomel Airport, which was targeted by Russia in the first days of its invasion. Oleksandr Syrskii, the chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, said: “I am convinced that unity is our victory. And it will definitely happen. Because light always conquers darkness.” Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) major democracies, chaired this year by Italy, also held a videoconference with Zelenskyy later on Saturday, vowing to continue supporting Ukraine. “As Ukraine enters the third year of this relentless war, its government and its people can count on the G7’s support for as long as it takes,” the group said in a statement. It added that it would look for ways to make Moscow pay for the damage inflicted by its invasion: “We will continue to raise the cost of Russia’s war, degrade Russia’s sources of revenue and impede its efforts to build its war machine.” In a post on the social media platform X, von der Leyen said: “More than ever, we stand firmly by Ukraine. Financially, economically, militarily, morally. Until the country is finally free”. At the Wall of Remembrance, I pay my respects to the Ukrainians who made the ultimate sacrifice fighting for our values. Freedom, democracy, the rule of law. They are in our hearts and minds. Their legacy lives on. And it will shine through the day Ukraine wins this war.pic.twitter.com/2SeulZsNPe — Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen)February 24, 2024  Trudeau said that Ukrainians were fighting for “our collective future”. “They are fighting to remind the world that democracy is both important enough to die for and strong enough to win,” he said in a statement before arriving in Kyiv. “As the war continues, that is what is at stake. And that is why Canada has stood with Ukraine since day one.” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg expressed confidence that Ukraine will join the transatlantic military alliance. “It is not a question of if, but of when. As we prepare you for that day, NATO will continue to stand with Ukraine,” he said. On Saturday in Kyiv, Zelenskyy also signed security agreements with Canada’s Trudeau and Italy’s Meloni intended to shore up Ukraine’s security until it can reach its aim of becoming a NATO member. Trudeau’s office said Canada would provide more than 3 billion Canadian dollars ($2.22bn) in financial and defence aid to Ukraine in 2024, while Meloni gave no financial details about the Italian accord. Earlier, the United Kingdom announced a new $311m defence package to help boost the production of “urgently needed artillery ammunition” for Ukraine. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promised: “We will stand with Ukraine today and tomorrow, prepared to do whatever it takes, for as long as it takes, until they prevail.”    Kyiv’s fortunes have suffered in recent weeks amid shortages of military supplies, with Russia this month capturing the eastern town ofAvdiivkain its biggest victory on the battlefield in months. United States President Joe Biden has blamed Republicans in Congress for holding up a $61bn package of military funding, casting the support as crucial to Kyiv’s efforts to repel Moscow. Biden on Friday announced Washington’s largest package ofsanctions against Russia, pledging to keep up pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “war machine”. On Friday,Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kulebadelivered a rebuke to sceptics who doubt Kyiv’s ability to defeat Moscow, insisting that “Ukraine will win the war” and victory would come “sooner rather than later” with international support. Zelenskyy earlier this week told diplomats in an emotional address that he remained “convinced that victory awaits us”. While neither Ukraine nor Russia has provided official estimates of the number of military casualties in the war, both sides claim to have inflicted heavy losses. The New York Times in August cited US officials who estimated that about 70,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed and a further 100,000-120,000 wounded. In December, leaked US intelligence suggested that about 315,000 Russian troops had been killed or injured. In its latest report, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine said this week that it been able to corroborate the conflict-related deaths of 10,582 civilians since February 2022. It had verified that 19,875 civilians had been wounded. “The actual numbers are likely significantly higher,” it said.

"Russia-Ukraine war: List of key events, day 731",These are the main developments on the second anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.,"Here is the situation on Saturday, February 24, 2024.      ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/24/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-731
"Two years after Putin ordered a war on Ukraine, what’s changed in Russia?","While fears simmer on the border near Ukraine, life goes on as usual in most of Russia as Putin prepares for a predictable election.","On December 30,a volley of rocket firehit the Russian city of Belgorod near the Ukrainian border. “I live in the very centre of the city, and three or four things fell just outside my home. I don’t know whether it was a shell or shrapnel or what,” said 21-year-old Yuliya, a journalist from Belgorod who requested Al Jazeera use only her first name. “The buildings nearby were seriously damaged. My own building was fine, but it was very frightening, very loud. In that moment, you can only think, ‘This is the end.’’” Belgorod’s been bombarded severaltimessince the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, but December’s barrage was the deadliest. At least 25 civilians, among them five children, were killed in the attack blamed on Ukraine’s armed forces. For the residents of the Russian border city, the war had come home. “The atmosphere in the city shifted dramatically since December 30 because people in Belgorod finally felt what war is, that it’s nearby and that it’s not so safe in the city as it seemed,” Yuliya said. “Life has greatly changed.” She said children now know what it’s like to be shelled, recognise the sound of air raid sirens and know how to tie a tourniquet. “Now the council doesn’t discuss how many tulips to plant for the summer festivals but how to paint the insides of bomb shelters. I think life in Belgorod will never be the same.” In the weeks after the invasion on February 24, 2022, the picture looked bleak for Russia as the rouble crashed and foreign investors fled. But the economy has withstood sanctions. “The Russian economy went through multiple stress tests,” economist Artem Kochnev said. “The first one was in 2014 when the first round of sanctions was introduced and Russia took some lessons from that specifically by building a national financial infrastructure and tightening the grip over the financial sector. The second was the COVID crisis and how they tried to manage logistics in very rapidly changing circumstances. So they had some experience they could draw upon.” Kochnev added that the gradual implementation of sanctions gave Russia time to readjust its oil exports. The European Union halted its imports from Russia, so Russia turned to China and India instead, using a “shadow fleet” of barges registered with shell companies in third countries such as Cameroon. Russia also had vast cash reserves from its petroleum sales, which were originally set aside to offset the shock from any drop in oil prices. “Now this money has been used for completely another purpose – financing the war,” Kochnev said. “That’s a fiscal stimulus which is actually larger than what government has put into the economy during the COVID crisis.” Major global brands, such as McDonalds and Starbucks, have left Russia, forced to sell off their assets far below market value to buyers approved by a government committee before being rebranded. For example, Starbucks has become Stars Coffee. A few firms have effectively been nationalised. According to Kochnev, the assets went mainly to powerful and well-connected individuals, which may have created some friction between elites. Despite adramatic mutinyby Wagner mercenaries last year, Putin’s position appears to be stable. He is expected to win a fifth six-year presidential term in the upcomingMarch election. Assuming he lasts until the end of his term, he’d be the longest-serving Russian leader since the tsars, overtaking even Josef Stalin. Two candidates running on an anti-war platform, Yekaterina Duntsova and Boris Nadezhdin, were disqualified by the Central Election Commission despite neither being considered a serious contender against Putin. The war has certainly left an impact on society: After a decade of decline, problematic drinking has reportedly become more common, which some health experts have attributed to geopolitical confrontations. But on the whole, life goes on. There are still music concerts and exhibitions, and customers can still buy foreign goods, such as Coca-Cola, which have been rerouted through third countries such as Uzbekistan. Some Russians are even upbeat. “I’ve heard a lot about propaganda in the West. It makes people idiots,” 51-year-old Alec from St Petersburg said. “But absolutely everything is still here. You think people don’t want to make money? Nothing has changed except the psychopathic liberals have left. Whether we like it or not, Russia has started it’s great game, and it’s very interesting to see. You have to be here to understand it.” On the front lines in Ukraine, nearly 45,000 Russians have been killed in action since February 2022, the independent outlet MediaZona has reported. That is three times the Red Army’s losses during its decade-long occupation of Afghanistan. Even so, Russia has greater resources in terms of manpower than Ukraine. Since Ukraine’s failed counteroffensive in the summer, Russian forces have slowly inched forward, capturing the town ofAvdiivkathis month after a fierce, months-long battle. “Russia’s hidden mobilisation has continued,” said Oleg Ignatov, senior Russia analyst for the International Crisis Group think tank. “Regions are given the number of contract soldiers they have to call up. As a result, regional officials persuade whoever they can to sign up. These include debtors, people with financial and lifestyle problems, single men, ex-criminals and so on as well as [state employees]. The military, in turn, persuades conscripts to sign a contract. Also, more foreigners are coming to the front. But apparently, such methods work. The Russian army manages to replenish its ranks faster than the Ukrainian army.” Russia’s defence industry appears to still be functioning at full capacity, pumping out shells to be fired on Ukrainian positions. “Russian military production has grown significantly, including by restoring production at old Soviet factories,” Ignatov added. “Russia has been able to outpace Western ammunition supplies and maintain its advantage in equipment and long-range weapons. Sanctions, of course, increase the price of production and create logistical problems but do not hinder the production of shells and hardly prevent Russia from modernising old Soviet equipment and sending it to the front. Russia’s industrial capability to produce weapons is very large but not enough to create a decisive advantage, so Russia buys ammunition from North Korea.” Besides the shelling of Belgorod, there have been several cross-border raids by the Russian Volunteer Corps, a militia of Russian citizens with far-right nationalist views fighting for Ukraine, engaging in brief skirmishes with Russian forces and border guards before falling back. Their strategic impact on the war has been limited but has undermined Russia’s sense of security. Meanwhile, drones have targeted Russia’s oil infrastructure, spectacularly blowing up a fuel export terminal near St Petersburg in January. “Ukraine has conducted a series of successful attacks on Russian infrastructure and apparently managed to destroy several units of valuable and expensive equipment, but in general, these attacks do not change the overall picture, which is still in Russia’s favour,” Ignatov said. This will bring little comfort to Yuliya, whose heart still races whenever she steps outside. “Some of my friends who’ve left Russia and see the shelling of our city say, ‘Well, what did you expect? People are dying in Ukraine as well, and rockets are flying from Belgorod to Kharkiv,’” she said. “But I live here, and no matter what I do, I can’t stop these rockets. No one in our city can. So I don’t know how you can say that we had it coming. It’s very upsetting.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/23/two-years-after-putin-ordered-a-war-on-ukraine-whats-changed-in-russia
US sanctions 500 Russia-linked targets ahead of Ukraine war anniversary,US reiterates support for Ukraine with largest package of economic restrictions as Republicans block military aid.,"The United States has issued sanctions on more than 500 Russian-linked targets in response to Moscow’sinvasion of Ukrainetwo years ago and the death in prison of opposition leader Alexey Navalny. Washington has also imposed new export restrictions on nearly 100 entities for providing support to Russia and take action to further reduce Russia’s energy revenues, US President Joe Biden said on Friday. The entities and sectors targeted include Russia’s Mir payment system, Russian financial institutions and its military industrial base, sanctions evasion, and future energy production, and will also include officials believed to be involved in the death of Navalny, the Treasury and State departments said. The measures represent the largest single tranche of penalties since Russia invaded Ukraine onFebruary 24, 2022, and come on the back of a series of new arrests and indictments that the US Department of Justice announced on Thursday, targeting Russian businessmen, including the head of state-owned VTB Bank, Russia’s second-largest bank. “They will ensure Putin pays an even steeper price for his aggression abroad and repression at home,” Biden said of the sanctions. The new economic restrictions come after the White House said this week that it was preparing“major” penaltiesafter the death ofNavalny, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s most prominent critic, in an Arctic penal colony. Biden said on Thursday, after meeting Navalny’s widow Yulia and daughter Dasha in California, that “we’re going to be announcing sanctions against Putin, who is responsible for his death, tomorrow”. Today, I met with Yulia and Dasha Navalnaya – Aleksey Navalny's loved ones – to express my condolences for their devastating loss. Aleksey's legacy of courage will live on in Yulia and Dasha, and the countless people across Russia fighting for democracy and human rights.pic.twitter.com/aiCcgTrws3 — President Biden (@POTUS)February 22, 2024  The Kremlin hasdeniedPutin was behind Navalny’s death and slammed the West for making assumptions before there was proof to back up its allegations. Deputy US Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo told the Reuters news agency on Thursday that the sanctions will also be taken in partnership with other countries who are looking to keep up the pressure on Russia over its war on Ukraine. “Tomorrow we’ll release hundreds of sanctions just here in the United States, but it’s important to step back and remember that its not just America taking these actions,” Adeyemo said. Washington has been coordinating with its European allies in its efforts to cut Russia off from the global economy. The European Union on Friday announced its13th package of sanctionsagainst Russia, banning nearly 200 additional entities and individuals accused of involvement in the two-year conflict. “Today, we are further tightening the restrictive measures against Russia’s military and defence sector,” said EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell. “We remain united in our determination to dent Russia’s war machine and help Ukraine win its legitimate fight for self-defence.” Commitment met: two years after the start of the full-scale Russian aggression against#Ukraine, the 13th package of sanctions is adopted. These measures are taking a heavy toll on Russia’s economy.https://t.co/65gyOcE67t — Josep Borrell Fontelles (@JosepBorrellF)February 23, 2024  The United Kingdom hasimposed sanctionson six officials overseeing the penal colony where Navalny died. “Sanctions and export controls are geared towards slowing Russia down, making it harder for them to fight their war of choice in Ukraine,” Adeyemo said. The Biden administration has exhausted money previously approved for Ukraine, and a request for additional funds for military aid to Ukraine is stuck in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. “But ultimately, in order to speed Ukraine up, to give them the ability to defend themselves, Congress needs to act to give Ukraine the resources that they need and the weapons they need,” Adeyemo added.    The US and its allies have additionally capped the price at which Russian crude oil can be sold on global markets, frozen billions of dollars of its central bank’s assets and imposed trade restrictions in an attempt to block technology and equipment used by Moscow to supply its military. However, they have not dented Russia’sability to wage war. On Friday, Putin claimed that 95 percent of Russia’s strategic nuclear forces had been modernised and that the Air Force had just taken delivery of four new supersonic nuclear-capable bombers. In a recorded speech to mark Russia’s annual Defender of the Fatherland Day, which celebrates the armed forces, he also praised soldiers fighting in Ukraine as heroes battling for “truth and justice”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/23/us-to-sanction-500-russia-linked-targets-ahead-of-ukraine-war-anniversary
More than 14 million people fled homes in Ukraine since Russia invasion: UN,"As second anniversary of conflict nears, millions remain displaced at home and abroad, with ‘no end in sight’ to war.","The United Nations has said that more than 14 million Ukrainians were forced to flee their homes at some point in the two years since Russia’s invasion, as UN rights chief Volker Turk spoke of the “horrific human cost” of the conflict. AsRussia’s war in Ukrainegrinds into its third year, the UN’s International Organization for Migration (IOM) said on Thursday that nearly 6.5 million people are now living outside the country as refugees. It said an estimated 3.7 million people are still displaced within Ukraine. Reflecting on thetoll of the war, which started when Russia invaded its neighbour on February 24, 2022, IOM director general Amy Pope said: “The destruction is widespread, loss of life and suffering continues.” While a total of more than 14 million people – nearly one-third of Ukraine’s population – fled their homes at some point during the war, the agency said that more than 4.5 million people returned home to date, from either abroad or displacement within the country.

But, it pointed out, needs were continuing to grow, outpacing resources. Some 14.6 million people remain in need of some form of humanitarian assistance in 2024, IOM said. For those who return home, the challenges are immense. Federico Soda, director of the IOM’s humanitarian response and recovery department, said returnees faced “insecurity, loss of livelihoods, damaged housing and infrastructure, and strained services”. Since the start of the war, the agency has received $957m in donations. Overall, the UN says it needs $4.2bn this year to provide humanitarian aid in Ukraine and to refugees who have fled.

"‘Era of peace in Europe over’ says Ukraine, as Avdiivka falls to Russians","Russian forces capture their first city in more than nine months, partly a result of failing weapons deliveries from allies.","Russiaachievedits first major territorial success in more than nine months in the Ukraine war, capturing the eastern city of Avdiivka last week. The once-bustling community of 30,000 civilians was gone and it was doubtful whether the local employer, Europe’s biggest coking plant, could be returned to operability soon. But the capture offered Russian President Vladimir Putin bragging rights ahead of theelectionhe faces in March. Russian forces began to press Ukrainian defenders in earnest last October, after Ukraine’s three-month-long summer counteroffensive had ended, promising to deal Ukraine a winter blow. They formed a pincer to the north and south of the city, and during the four months of most intense fighting Ukraine’s Tavria forces commander, Oleksandr Tarnavskyi, estimated they had sustained 47,000 casualties, and lost 364 tanks, 248 artillery systems, 748 armoured fighting vehicles and five aircraft. The news fell like a bombshell on the continuing Munich Security Conference, where Ukraine’s Western allies convened to survey a gloomy outlook for 2024. “The era of peace in Europe is over,” Dmytro Kuleba, Ukrainian foreign minister, told those present. “And every time Ukrainian soldiers withdraw from a Ukrainian town because of the lack of ammunition, think of it not only in terms of democracy and defending the world-based order, but also in terms of Russian soldiers getting a few kilometres closer to your towns.” Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also seized upon the moment to press allies for more weapons supplies. “Unfortunately, keeping Ukraine in artificial deficits of weapons, particularly in deficits of artillery and long-range capabilities, allows Putin to adapt to the current intensity of the war. This self-weakening of democracy over time undermines our joint results,” Zelenskyy told the conference. Many Ukrainians squarely blame the United States for the emboldening of Russia, as a $60.6bn military assistance measure for Ukraine remains stalled in Congress. Unfortunately, keeping Ukraine in artificial deficits of weapons, particularly in deficits of artillery and long-range capabilities, allows Putin to adapt to the current intensity of the war. This self-weakening of democracy over time undermines our joint results. — Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa)February 18, 2024  “In 2022, the [US] administration [of Joe Biden] submitted funding requests in the spring, almost immediately after the invasion,” wrote Kyiv School of Economics director Tymofiy Mylovanov. “But in 2023, it waited until mid-fall to announce what it plans to submit,” he said. “Avdiivka demonstrates the cost of these political delays: human lives, lost territory, and encouraged Russia. If that’s the plan ‘to be with Ukraine as long as it takes’, then the US delays in aid have just prolonged the war.” The key to breaking the months-long impasse on the ground seems to have come from the air. “Russian forces appear to have temporarily established limited and localised air superiority and were able to provide ground troops with close air support during the final days of their offensive operation,” said the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank. Sergei Shoigu, Russian defence minister, said Moscow’s forces had made 450 high-precision air strikes in the final days of the campaign for Avdiivka. Many of those came in the form of glide bombs, massive unpowered munitions fitted with adjustable fins to travel further than ordinary inertial bombs and strike with greater precision. One Ukrainian soldier reported 60 being dropped on February 17 alone. The use of forward air power came at a cost. Ukraine shot down two Sukhoi-34s and a Sukhoi-35 over Donetsk on Saturday as they performed sorties to drop glide bombs. On Monday they shot down another Sukhoi-34 and a Sukhoi-35 striking Ukrainian positions with glide bombs, and a Sukhoi-34 on Wednesday. In all, Ukraine said it shot down seven planes in five days. The first signs that Ukraine’s defences around Avdiivka were failing came on Thursday, when geolocated footage showed Russian forces advancing to new positions south of the city. On Saturday, Ukraine’s newly appointed commander in chief,Oleksandr Syrskii, said he ordered Ukrainian units to withdraw early in the morning in order to avoid encirclement and capture. Geolocated footage showed Russian troops entering Avdiivka along a railway line running past quarries to the northeast of the city and to the coking plant in the east. By evening Russia claimed “full control” over Avdiivka. Shoigu also claimed that Ukrainian forces had withdrawn in great disarray, suffering a large number of dead, wounded and captured men. He may have overstated the case. The New York Times quoted unnamed Western officials confirming that a “significant” number of Ukrainian troops may have been captured. Two Ukrainian soldiers put the number at 850 to 1,000. But Tavria Group spokesman Dmytro Lykhovyi said that report was influenced by Russian information operations, and the actual number captured was much smaller. It remains an open question whether Russian forces can keep repeating the formula that helped them capture Avdiivka in other areas of the front. Russian forces in the last week also ramped up their attacks on the eastern cities of Lyman and Kupiansk, which some observers believe are their next targets, on Robotyne, in western Zaporizhia, which Ukraine recaptured last year, and on Ukrainian positions on the left bank of the Dnipro river in Kherson. Beyond the symbolic loss of another town, the first since Bakhmut fell in May last year, Avdiivka may offer Russia few strategic advantages. “Avdiivka offers Russian forces limited avenues for future advance,” said the ISW. “Ukrainian forces have long fortified many of the surrounding settlements, which Russian forces are also struggling to capture.” The week also brought some good news for Ukraine. The fall of Avdiivka prompted Denmark’s prime minister to donate all of the country’s remaining artillery assets to Ukraine, prompting others to a similar shift in attitudes. “We, Denmark, have decided to transfer all our artillery to Ukraine,” wrote Mette Frederiksen on X, formerly Twitter. “There is military equipment in Europe … We have weapons, ammunition, air defense systems, which we do not use yet. They must be handed over to Ukraine.” France and Germany pledged to lead an air coalition to supply Ukraine with a million First Person View drones, with a total of nine countries saying they planned to join. Germany and Ukraine signed a multi-year defence cooperation agreement including $7.5bn in defence transfers this year alone. Lithuania said it was stepping up delivery of artillery rounds to Ukraine, and Norwegian-Finnish ammunition manufacturer Nammo said it was adopting a round-the-clock schedule at a plant in Sweden to increase the production of 155mm artillery shells for Ukraine. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg also said the alliance was opening a training centre for Ukrainian personnel in Poland.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/22/era-of-peace-in-europe-over-says-ukraine-as-avdiivka-falls-to-russians
Zelenskyy invites Poland’s leaders to border to resolve farmers’ protests,"Polish farmers have been protesting Ukrainian food imports, angry at what they say is unfair competition.","Ukraine’s president has invited Polish leaders to meet him at their shared border to resolve a blockade by Polish farmers protesting Ukrainian food imports. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on social media on Wednesday that he hoped the proposed border meeting for him, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and a European Union representative could happen before the two-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Saturday, February 24. “This is national security,” Zelenskyy said. “I am ready to be at the border with our government.” “We have had enough misunderstanding. We should not humiliate each other; we should not humiliate either Ukrainian or Polish farmers. We need unity. We need solutions – between us, Ukraine and Poland, and at the level of the whole of Europe,” Zelenskyy said in a statement. There was no immediate reaction from the Polish government. Zelenskyy added that Ukraine could not accept the appearance of slogans supporting Russian President Vladimir Putin at the protests, after one such banner was displayed on Tuesday. Earlier, Polish authorities voiced concern over the slogans praising Putin and his war against Ukraine. Poland, a member of NATO and the European Union, has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion, accepting unlimited numbers of refugees and providing Ukraine with weaponry.    Poles, with past oppression by Moscow rooted deeply in generational memory, are largely supportive of Ukraine. But tensions have been growing as Polish farmers blame imports of Ukrainian grain and other food for pushing down prices and harming their livelihoods. Polish farmers are among farmers across Europe who have been protesting competition from Ukraine as well as EU environmental policies, which they say will increase their production costs. On Tuesday they staged a major day of protest, blocking almost all traffic on the border with Ukraine, angering Kyiv, in an escalation from previous demonstrations. Earlier Wednesday, Poland’s Foreign Ministry said it believed that extreme groups were trying to take over the protest movement “perhaps under the influence of Russian agents”. It noted “with the greatest concern the appearance of anti-Ukrainian slogans and slogans praising Vladimir Putin and the war he is waging”. On Tuesday, a tractor at a protest in the southern Polish region of Silesia carried a Soviet flag and a banner that said: “Putin, put things in order with Ukraine, Brussels, and our rulers.” A photograph was published by the Gazeta Wyborcza daily. Poland’s Interior Minister Marcin Kierwinski called the banner “scandalous” and said it was immediately secured by police, and prosecutors were investigating. “There will be no consent to such criminal activities,” he said.    The public promotion of a totalitarian system can be punished with up to three years in prison under Polish law. The Foreign Ministry called on protest organisers “to identify and eliminate from their movement” the initiators, arguing it was necessary for Poland’s interest. “The current situation of Polish farmers is the result of Vladimir Putin’s aggression against Ukraine and the disruption of the global economy, not because Ukrainians are defending themselves against the aggression,” the ministry said. Polish farmers blocked eight major roads on Wednesday. Police said protests continued at border crossings to Ukraine in Medyka and Korczowa, but passenger traffic was smooth and some trucks were also being let through.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/21/zelenskyy-invites-polands-leaders-to-border-to-resolve-farmers-protests
UK imposes sanctions on heads of penal colony where Russia’s Navalny died,"Cameron promises to hold those responsible accountable, as Navalny’s mother takes legal action to recover his body.","The United Kingdom has imposed sanctions on six officials overseeing the Arctic penal colony where Russian opposition leaderAlexey Navalnydied. The sanctions, announced by British Foreign Secretary David Cameron on Wednesday, target the head and five deputy heads of theIK-3 penal colonyin Kharp in Russia’s Yamal-Nenets region, who now face a ban on entering the UK and will have their assets frozen. “Those responsible for Navalny’s brutal treatment should be under no illusion – we will hold them accountable,” Cameron said. “It’s clear that the Russian authorities saw Navalny as a threat and they tried repeatedly to silence him.” The UK is the first country to impose sanctions in response to Navalny’s death, the Foreign Office said as it described him as “a political prisoner who dedicated his life to exposing the corruption of the Russian system, calling for free and open politics, and holding the Kremlin to account”. 🔴 SANCTIONED: heads of Arctic penal colony where Alexei Navalny was killed.pic.twitter.com/2FZn0W5b73 — Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (@FCDOGovUK)February 21, 2024  The sanctioned individuals include Vadim Konstantinovich Kalinin, who oversaw the prison whereNavalnywas kept in solitary confinement for up to two weeks at a time, it added. The penal colonyabout 1,900km (1,200 miles) northeast of Moscowis considered one of the toughest in Russia. Its inmates are convicted of grave crimes. Russian authorities have said the cause of 47-year-old Navalny’s sudden death on February 16 at the colony, called “Polar Wolf”, is still unknown and have refused to release his body for the next two weeks, pending a preliminary inquest. On Wednesday, Navalny’s mother,Lyudmila Navalnaya, filed a lawsuit at a court in the town of Salekhard near the penal colony, contesting officials’ refusal to release her son’s body so she could bury him with dignity. A closed-door hearing has been scheduled for March 4, Russia’s state news agency TASS reported. Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, released avideoon Monday claiming the authorities had not yet handed over his body because they were waiting for traces of the Novichok nerve agent to disappear. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has rejected allegations of a cover-up and President Vladimir Putin’s alleged involvement as “unfounded, insolent accusations about the head of the Russian state”. The UK’s decision to take targeted punitive action against the prison heads coincided with plans by theUnited Statesto impose sanctions against Russia over the Putin critic’s death and the two-yearwar in Ukraine, set to be announced on Friday. Cameron will attend the G20 foreign ministers’ meeting in Brazil later on Wednesday and the Foreign Office said “he will use the opportunity to call out Russia’s aggression and its global impact directly to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.”   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/21/uk-imposes-sanctions-on-heads-of-penal-colony-where-russias-navalny-died
EU approves new sanctions against Russia over Ukraine war,"Bloc officials say 200 people and entities have been added to the sanctions list, bringing the total to 2,000.","European Union members have approved a 13th package of sanctions against Russia over itswar in Ukraine, banning nearly 200 additional entities and individuals accused of involvement in the two-year conflict. “EU Ambassadors just agreed in principle on a 13th package of sanctions in the framework of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine,” Belgium, which holds the rotating EU presidency, said on X on Wednesday, calling it “one of the broadest approved by the EU”. The sanctions will be formally approved by the 27-nation bloc on February 24, the day in 2022 when Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine. “I welcome the agreement on our 13th sanctions package against Russia. We must keep degrading Putin’s war machine,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen wrote on social media. I welcome the agreement on our 13th sanctions package against Russia⁰We must keep degrading Putin's war machine.⁰With 2000 listings in total, we keep the pressure high on the Kremlin.⁰We are also further cutting Russia’s access to drones.https://t.co/AfSxsEUB8x — Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen)February 21, 2024  EU representatives in Brussels signed off on the package, which targets individuals and organisations linked to the Russian government and the invasion. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said 200 people and entities have been added to the sanctions list, bringing the total to 2,000. “With this package, we are taking more action against entities involved in circumvention, the defence and military sectors,” Borrell said on X. The EU recently targeted companies based in China, Uzbekistan, Iran and the United Arab Emirates that are allegedly involved in circumventing the bloc’s sanctions. The latest measures go after the Russian weapons industry’s access to components to manufacture drones, diplomats told the German Press Agency dpa. Companies in the bloc would not be allowed to sell goods and technologies with military connections to Russia. The focus is on entities and individuals that are part of Russia’s military industrial complex and those involved in trafficking andkidnapping Ukrainian children, EU sources told the Reuters news agency. One North Korean and one Belarusian firm were also added, the sources said. The companies in the latest round are mainly Russian and also include three mainland Chinese firms and one Hong Kong-based company, Reuters reported. However, the fresh sanctions do not contain wide-ranging measures to impact specific economic sectors. A previous round of EU measures included a prohibition on importing diamonds and jewellery from Russia. A far-reaching ban on imports of crude oil, coal, steel, gold and luxury goods as well as measures aimed at banks and financial institutions has been in place for some time. While Western allies’ focus on Ukraine has been winding down amidwar fatigue, concerns over the excessive costs of the war and the conflict in Gaza, thedeathlast week of Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny has given a fresh impetus to impose new sanctions. On Tuesday, President Joe Biden said theUnited Stateswill also announce new economic restrictions on Russia. While Biden did not provide details, White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the package will target a range of items, including Russia’s defence and industrial bases, along with sources of revenue for the economy.

"Analysis: How Russia, Ukraine’s militaries stack up after two years of war","Ukraine is outgunned by Russia, but plans to increase drone production as the war drags on into a third year.","Ukraine has been fighting Russia for two years to liberate its lands and drive Russia back – but supply, tactics and the flat terrain have meant that themuch-vaunted Ukrainian counteroffensiveof last year has produced few tangible results. In the wide-open agricultural land of southern Ukraine, there is not much in the way of cover for an attacking force. Russia had months to prepare its defences, and built them in depth. Row after row of trenches, anti-tank obstacles, ditches and reinforced bunkers have formed a barrier, often kilometres deep, effectively containing Ukrainian forces as they have repeatedly tried to break through into the open country beyond, with little success. The counteroffensive has bogged down into slow, attritional warfare, as Russia’s strategy of making Ukraine pay for every metre it tries to take is showing signs of succeeding. The quality of Russia’s soldiers may be questionable, but they are still able to slow down Ukrainian advances, protected in fortified dugouts, along with the help of surveillance drones that stop Ukraine’s military from springing surprise attacks on them. Even so, a mixture of new and old weaponry has changed the dynamics of the modern battlefield and the war fought in Ukraine. Some new tactics are being developed and successful weapons systems have been brought into play as old ones, such as the tank, have been kept on. Yet despite all the 21st-century innovations, the battlefields of southern Ukraine are starting to take on an eerie World War I dynamic. A general from a century ago would have no problem understanding the brutal slog of this conflict. Drones have been integral to both sides of this war. Russia was very late to adopt their use and paid the price as attempts by its military to surprise Ukraine were dashed, with mass artillery used to destroy Russian armoured and infantry units. Small Ukrainian drones were used to drop grenades onto Russian positions, demoralising the troops stuck in trenches and foxholes. Ukrainian artillery used them to spot for batteries that could quickly adjust fire in real time, catching Russian troops and tanks in the open as they tried to advance across flat, featureless fields. Moscow’s forces have, over time, applied the same lessons and turned the tables. It is now Ukrainian units that get caught advancing only to be destroyed by Russian artillery strikes. The rivals have both realised the value not just of surveillance drones, but also of longer-range drones that can be used to strike valuable targets deep behind enemy lines. Russia has used hundreds of Iranian-imported Shahed-136 drones as cheap cruise missiles. While slow flying, they serve to exhaust Ukrainian air defences, depleting Ukrainian missile inventories as a combination of drone, cruise and ballistic missile attacks steadily erode Ukraine’s ability to defend itself. Ukraine has learned the lesson that plenty of cheap, effective, armed drones are useful in an industrial-level war and a good way to offset a weaker air force. Ukraine plansmass production of dronesthat can destroy targets up to 1,000km (620 miles) away, theoretically bringing Moscow and St Petersburg into range. More importantly, marshalling yards, port facilities, train depots and barracks would now all potentially come under fire, further complicating Russian logistical challenges in supplying its forces on the front lines. To give an idea of the reliance on drones, Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, said that in 2023 alone, domestic drone production rose to 300,000 drones, and this didn’t include foreign donations. The target this year is to make over a million drones, with at least half the components locally made, in an effort to offset waning United States support for Ukraine. Regardless ofwho wins the US election, backing for Ukraine has eased as domestic concerns and other wars, such as Israel’s campaign in Gaza, soak up US support and resources. Ukraine is not getting the military aid it desperately needs as Russia puts its economy on a light war footing, now allocating 6.5 percent of its total budget to replacing its significant losses on the battlefield. One estimate, published this month by the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think-tank, says Russia can now produce 125 tanks per month, more than enough to replace those destroyed in recent fighting. European members of NATO have been increasingly relied on to make up any potential US shortfall in military aid. Boosting Ukrainian defence manufacturing in drones and artillery ammunition is now considered a national priority. The brutal arithmetic shows Ukraine needs an extra 240,000 shells a month to even keep pace with Russia. As most of the fighting is being conducted at long range, artillery is key to both sides. Russia’s industry has significantly ramped up production of artillery shells and multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS), together with large imports of North Korean artillery ammunition and ballistic missiles. Russia is now able to fire five shells for every Ukrainian one. Desperate Ukrainian defenders in some areas are now down to firing a few rounds a day, just to stave off defeat. The world’s militaries have been watching the conflict unfold and have had to take several hard lessons onboard. Prewar estimates for artillery production were woefully small and the Ukrainian conflict shows just how much industrial power one needs when fighting an equivalent army or larger. Prewar stockpiles of missiles are also extremely low. Most land-attack missiles were leftovers from the Cold War and would mostly have been nuclear tipped, a few hundred sufficing. It’s now clear that thousands would be needed, which means that low-cost, quickly manufactured missiles are key parts of any arsenal. So too is a layered air-defence system, again reliant on plentiful amounts of cheap missiles, whose production can be quickly scaled up. The same goes for cruise missiles. The likes of theStorm Shadowmissile – with a range of more than 250km (155 miles) – are extremely effective but are expensive and take a long time to build. Cheap alternatives are needed. The idea of the tank has made a comeback. Pre-invasion, many militaries were steadily getting rid of their tank inventories. But experience now shows that the tank, properly protected and part of a combined-arms assault, still has great uses on the battlefield and remains a formidable weapon. Back to drones, which have infused themselves at every level of the battlefield. Serious force multipliers, they can help any military leverage what equipment and weapons it has. One Ukrainian soldier recently noted, in an interview with Politico, that the accuracy of artillery units increased by 250 percent when paired with drones.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/21/analysis-how-russia-ukraines-militaries-stack-up-after-two-years-of-war
"US to impose ‘major sanctions’ on Russia over Navalny death, Ukraine war",Biden does not give details of measures to be announced on Friday ahead of second anniversary of Russian invasion.,"The United States is set to announce new sanctions against Russia over the death of opposition leaderAlexey Navalnyand the two-yearwar in Ukraine. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, US President Joe Biden did not give details but said he would provide more information about the package of measures on Friday, ahead of the second anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said that the “major sanctions package” would hold Russia “accountable” for what happened toNavalnyand respond to the “vicious and brutal war that has now raged on for two years”. The new sanctions will target a range of items, including Russia’s defence and industrial bases, along with sources of revenue for the economy, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said. According to a senior US official, a sanctions package was already being planned to mark the second anniversary of the war, which Washington will now reconsider and supplement in response to the death of Putin’s most prominent opponent. Russian authorities have said the cause of 47-year-old Navalny’s sudden death on February 16 at a penal colony north of the Arctic Circle is still unknown and have refused to release his body for the next two weeks as the preliminary inquest continues, according to the opposition leader’s team. On Tuesday, Navalny’s mother,Lyudmila Navalnaya, urged Putin to “immediately” release her son’s body so she could bury him. The demand was echoed by his widow Yulia Navalnaya, who had previously claimed in avideo statementthat the authorities had not yet handed over the body because they were waiting for traces of the Novichok nerve agent to leave his corpse. The European Union summoned Russia’s charge d’affaires over Navalny’s death, as Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and Poland called in Russian ambassadors.    The US and its allies have already imposed araft of sanctionsto isolate Moscow since it invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022, hitting Putin, thousands of Russians and firms. The measures have included freezing Russian Central Bank funds, banning certain Russian goods, restricting Russian banks’ access to SWIFT – the dominant system for global financial transactions – and imposing a $60-per-barrel price cap on Russian oil and diesel, among other measures. The US Treasury’s under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, Brian Nelson, was discussing sanctions over Navalny’s death on a trip to Europe this week, the Reuters news agency reported. Nelson, in visits to Germany, Belgium and France, is also discussing Washington’s authority to target those funding Russia’s war production efforts even if they are in third countries, the Treasury said, adding that Washington was “aggressively pursuing those who attempt to evade our sanctions”. Policy experts have advanced an array of proposals meant to further starve Russia of the money it needs to continue its invasion – from seizing the nation’s Central Bank funds housed largely in Europe to lowering the Group of Seven price cap on Russian oil. Charles Kupchan, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said, “Sanctions are always in the quiver, but they’re not going to matter that much – because let’s be honest, the sanctions have not had a huge impact on the Russian economy. “What will make a big difference is military and economic assistance to Ukraine, full stop,” he added.

"Ten years ago Russia annexed Crimea, paving the way for war in Ukraine",Russia’s annexation of the peninsula was not recognised by any nation except Moscow.,"On March 7, 2014, a husky man in his late 30s with closely cropped hair addressed an uneven line of four dozen “volunteers”. Next to him were three men in body armour and green uniforms, with no insignia. The crowd of men, aged 20 to 50, were gathered outside a white Stalinist-era government building in Sevastopol, a port in Ukraine’s Crimea. They were uphill from the seashore, next to huge sequoias, blossoming cherry trees and elderly ladies holding hand-written posters that read, “In Russia through a referendum” and “I want to go home to Russia.” Eight days later, Moscow would hold a “referendum” on the Black Sea peninsula’s “return” to Russia, and the men were a nascent “self-defence unit” that would “prevent provocations,” the man said. I approached them with a notebook and a dictaphone – and was immediately seized by two “volunteers”. “Got a spy here!” they yelled, twisting my arms and ready to beat me to a pulp. But the instructor told them and me to wait. He kept on talking for half an hour, telling the crowd that they would train at a military base outside Sevastopol and should arrive in “comfy clothes” and sneakers. One of the volunteers asked him whether they should bring firearms. Many others nodded approvingly. “When you take up arms, we become an armed criminal group. But if something happens, each unit will be backed by fire,” the instructor said. After the meeting, he checked my press ID and told me he was a retired intelligence officer who had served in Russia’s volatile North Caucasus region and arrived in Crimea as a “volunteer”. “Our groups will have to respond to challenges, provocations because there is a shortage of policemen in town,” he told me. “There’s NATO propaganda at work. “Our aim is to prevent the first shot. If the first shot happens, you won’t stop the mess,” he said. He politely declined to say what his name was. The first shot didn’t happen, but what took place in Crimea 10 years ago paved the way for today’s war between Ukraine and Russia. On February 20, 2014, Vladimir Konstantinov, speaker of Crimea’s regional parliament and a Russian politician, said he “didn’t rule out” the peninsula’s “return” to Russia. On the same day, thousands of gun-toting men in unmarked uniforms appeared throughout Ukraine’s Crimea. They responded to the victory of pro-Western protests in Kyiv that would within days remove pro-Russian Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. Dubbed “little green men” or “polite people,” the servicemen didn’t interact with locals or reporters, while Russian President Vladimir Putin said in Moscow that “they are not there”. They appeared next to Ukrainian military, naval and air bases, and the interim government in Kyiv ordered Ukrainian servicemen in Crimea to leave without firing a single shot. Many servicemen – along with thousands of police officers and government officials – joined the pro-Russian “government” formed by Sergey Aksyonov, a minor political figure and former mafia boss nicknamed “Goblin.” Some servicemen were detained, including Ihor Voronchenko, deputy head of Crimea’s coastal defence at the time. “There was a solitary cell, without a window, when you lose the sense of time, space. It affects one psychologically,” Voronchenko told me in 2018 when he was head of Ukraine’s navy. No shots were fired, but blood was spilled. On March 4, a “self-defence” unit abducted a Crimean Tatar protester, Reshat Ametov. He was held with other hostages in Simferopol, Crimea’s administrative capital, and tortured for a week. His naked, bruised body was found on March 15, head wrapped in plastic, eyes poked out. A day later, the “referendum” took place. Only a handful of schools and government buildings were used as “polling stations” so that the jubilant pro-Russian “voters,” mostly the elderly nostalgic about their Soviet youth, would throng and fill them, creating an illusion of mass vote. Moscow said 90 percent of Crimeans voted to join Russia, but the “referendum” was not recognised by Ukraine or any other nation. On March 21, Russian President Vladimir Putin made Crimea part of Russia. The annexation propelled his sagging approval ratings to an atmospheric 88 percent, and some Russians saw it as a first step to restoring the USSR. In response to the Arab Spring, a series of mass protests in the Middle East, the Kremlin came up with the idea of a “Russian Spring,” stoking protests in Russian-speaking Ukrainian regions in the east and south. Ancient Greeks, Romans, Mongols and Turks contested Crimea, the westernmost end of the Great Silk Road. It became a jewel in the crown of Russian czars, who annexed it in 1783 from the Crimean Tatars, whose Muslim state was ruled by the descendants of Genghis Khan and allied with Ottoman Turkey. The czars and communists understood Crimea’s utmost strategic importance in controlling the Black Sea, and Nazi Germany occupied it during World War II. Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin accused Tatars of “collaborating” with the Nazis and ordered their entire community of 200,000 deported to Central Asia. “Early in the morning, there was a loud bang on the door. I yelled, ‘Mum, Dad is back from the war! But there were two soldiers who told us to start packing,’” historian Nuri Emirvaliyev, who was 10 at the time, told me about the May 18, 1944 deportation. More than half of them died en route, including his younger sister. “During stops, soldiers yelled, ‘Got any dead? Bring them out!’” Emirvaliyev recalled. The rare survivors and their descendants were allowed to return to Crimea in the late 1980s only to see their homes occupied by ethnic Russians and Ukrainians and become a distrusted and vilified minority. Crimea was made part of Soviet Ukraine in 1954 during the construction of the North Crimean Canal which made agriculture inarid interiorareas possible and triggered the growth of urban centres. Moscow turned Crimea into a Soviet Riviera, and millions of former Soviet citizens still reminisce about their holidays there. After the 1991 Soviet collapse and Ukraine’s independence, Crimea remained predominantly Russian-speaking, its residents were mostly loyal to Moscow, andRussia’s Black Sea Fleetwas based in Sevastopol. Since the 2000s, Russian politicians, including Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov, began visiting Crimea and openly urging its residents to “reunite” with Russia. Meanwhile, Ukrainian political elites didn’t pay much attention to the peninsula’s development and allowed graft to thrive, “thinking that corruption would tie local elites to central ones,” Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kushch told Al Jazeera. But the practice misfired in 2014, when Crimean elites saw the success of the pro-Western revolt in Kyiv, got scared of “responsibility for the corruption,” and preferred the annexation, he said. The annexation was followed by the arrival of Russian officials – and the transformation of endemic corruption. They conducted a massive revision of ownership rights and expropriated thousands of properties, including beachfront hotels, vineyards, a film studio Alexander Strekalin, 75, resisted the takeover of his small cafeteria in the port of Yalta. In September 2017, he doused himself with acetone, flicked a lighter and died three agonising days later. “He died for nothing,” his widow Mila Selyamieva told me. Meanwhile, the Kremlin and pro-Moscow authorities initiated a crackdown on critics, including secular dissidents and religious Crimean Tatars, sentencing dozens to jail for alleged “extremism” and “encroachment on Russia’s constitutional order”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/20/crimea-anniversary-war-ukraine
Russia arrests dual US citizen for Ukraine-linked ‘treason’,The woman is accused of raising funds that benefitted the Ukrainian armed forces.,"Russia’s internal security and intelligence agency has arrested a woman who holds dual Russian and United States nationality in the Ural district for committing “treason” by raising funds for Ukraine. The Federal Security Service (FSB) in the city of Yekaterinburg took into custody the unnamed woman, identified only as a 33-year-old resident of Los Angeles, state media reported on Tuesday. She “was involved in providing financial assistance to a foreign state in activities directed against the security of our country”, said a statement by the security agency carried by Russian media. It said since February 2022, she was “proactively collecting money” for a Ukrainian organisation that would ultimately benefit the Ukrainian armed forces in the form of purchase of “tactical medicine items, equipment, weapons and ammunition”. The woman had also allegedly taken part in multiple public demonstrations in the US in support of Ukraine, which is financially and militarily backed by a Western coalition after Russia invaded it in February 2022. Russian state media released a video as well, which showed hooded FSB officers escorting and handcuffing a woman in a white coat and a white hat pulled down over her eyes. Treason is punishable by up to 20 years in prison in Russia. The Wall Street Journal reporter, Evan Gershkovich, is one of several US nationals who are currently imprisoned in Russia. The journalist wasarrested last year on charges of espionagethat have been rejected by Gershkovich, the US outlet and the US government. On Tuesday, a court in Moscow rejected Gershkovich’s appeal against the extension of his pre-trial detention period and said he “will remain in custody until March 30”. Russian-American journalistAlsu Kurmashevahas been in prison since October and charged with failing to register as a “foreign agent” and spreading “false information” about Russia’smilitary campaign in Ukraine. Paul Whelan, a former US marine and security executive, was arrested in Russia in 2018 and convicted of spying in 2020. Russian President Vladimir Putin said this month that Moscow is open to a prisoner swap for Gershkovich as a “gesture of goodwill”. Russia and Ukraine have also completed several rounds of prisoner exchanges in the past few months,with 100 prisoners of war exchangedearlier this month.

Ukraine PM calls for long-range missiles to fight back Russia,"Shmyhal says delays in providing long-range artillery, missile equipment is ‘main danger for us on the battlefield’.","Ukraine needs long-range missiles and other ammunition to repel Russian troops, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal has said, as the country nears its third year of war amid battle losses and shrinking foreign aid. Speaking during a visit to Japan on Tuesday, Shmyhal said Ukraine has modern equipment and trained soldiers and is fighting at NATO standards, but the country needs more long-range missiles for air defence against Russia on the front line. “Unfortunately, now they prevail in the air and unfortunately this leads to some consequences from the front line, but I should say that we have no refuses from our partners to supply military equipment to Ukraine,” he said. Shmyhal’s comments came as ammunition shortages and limited manpower are causing Ukraine some serious losses on the battlefield. On Sunday,Russian troops captured Avdiivka, a key hub city to access the industrial Donbas region, marking their biggest success since the fall ofBakhmutin May. But support from Western powers has been facing pushback over growing costs, while lawmakers in Washington continued to wrangle over a military aid package for Kyiv. Should the $95bn foreign aid package survive a vote in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, US media reports suggest that President Joe Biden is considering including long-range ballistic missiles. These are weapons with a longer reach compared with the medium-range missiles sent so far by the United States. They would allow Ukraine to hit inside the Russian-controlled Crimean Peninsula. The US has until now provided Ukraine with about $111bn, largely in weapons but also equipment and humanitarian assistance. When Ukraine begins fielding F-16 fighter jets later this year, “we will balance the situation on the battlefield and it will be much easier for us”, Shmyhal said. But currently, with the ongoing shortage of long-range artillery and missile equipment, “if it will be stopped, if it will be delayed, this is the main danger for us on the battlefield”. On Tuesday, Sweden said it would give $682m worth of military equipment to Ukraine. “The reason we are continuing to support Ukraine is a matter of humanity and decency. Russia started an illegal, unprovoked and indefensible war,” Defence Minister Pal Jonson told a news conference.    Shmyhal was in Tokyo to meet Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida whose country hopes to build momentum for global support for Ukraine as the war drags on and attention has been diverted to the conflict in Gaza. Japan has focused on reconstruction aid, in part due to constitutional restraints on providing lethal weapons. The previous day, Kishida promised a long-term commitment to Ukraine’s reconstruction at a conference focused on economic growth. During their meeting, Shmyhal also called for new sanctions on Russia following thedeath of prominent opposition leader Alexey Navalny. The 47-year-old critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin died on Friday in a remote prison colony in Russia under circumstances that remain murky. Navalny’s death prompted global outrage, with many Western leaders, including Biden,blaming Putin. “We are fighting for democratic values for all the democratic world, this is an existential war of democracy against autocracy,” Shmyhal said on Tuesday during the news conference in Tokyo. Germany, Lithuania and Sweden have also called for new penalties on Moscow during a meeting of the European Union’s top diplomats.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/20/ukrainian-prime-minister-calls-for-new-sanctions-on-moscow
"Maksim Kuzminov, Russian pilot who defected to Ukraine, killed in Spain",Spain’s EFE news agency says Maksim Kuzminov’s body was found on February 13 in the southern town of Villajoyosa.,"The bullet-riddled body of a Russian pilot who defected to Ukraine last year has been found in a town in southern Spain, according to Spanish and Ukrainian media. Spain’s EFE news agency, in a report on Monday, said Maksim Kuzminov’s body was found in an underground garage on February 13 in the town of Villajoyosa, situated near Alicante in southern Spain. “This traitor and criminal became a moral corpse at the very moment when he planned his dirty and terrible crime,” said Sergey Naryshkin, the head of Russia’s SVR foreign intelligence service, on Tuesday. He did not confirm or deny any Russian involvement in the former pilot’s death. “In Russia, it is customary to speak either good of the dead or nothing at all,” Naryshkin said, according to Russian state media. Kuzminov, who had landed in Ukraine with his Mi-8 helicopter last August, had been living in Spain with a Ukrainian passport under a different name, EFE reported. A spokesperson for Ukraine’s GUR military intelligence confirmed that Kuzminov had died in Spain, but did not specify the cause of death. Spanish police confirmed that a body was found of a gunshot victim in the town, but did not disclose the victim’s identity. A source at Spain’s Guardia Civil police force told the Reuters news agency that the victim could have been living under a fake identity. Spain’s La Informacion newspaper, which first reported the shooting, said investigators were searching for two suspects who had fled in a vehicle that was later found burned out in a nearby town. Kuzminov’s defection to Ukraine was presented last year as a major coup for Kyiv. The pilot said the GUR had lured him into defecting. “I contacted representatives of the Ukrainian intelligence service, explained my situation. I was offered security guarantees, new documents, monetary compensation, remuneration. We discussed the details and started planning my flight,” Kuzminov said, according to a report by Interfax Ukraine. EFE, citing a GUR source, said Kuzminov had decided to go live in Spain instead of staying in Ukraine.

Ukraine accuses Russia of killing unarmed prisoners after fall of Avdiivka,Security Service of Ukraine announces probe after footage of alleged executions circulates on Telegram messaging app.,"Ukraine has launched an investigation into allegations that Russian forces executed eight unarmed Ukrainian soldiers after they took control of the city of Avdiivka. The Security Service of Ukraine, under the guidance of the Donetsk Regional Prosecutor’s Office, opened a pre-trial investigation into the alleged killing of unarmed prisoners of war in Avdiivka and the village of Vesele, state-run media outlet Ukrinform said on Monday. “Under the procedural supervision of the Donetsk Regional Prosecutor’s Office, a pre-trial investigation has been initiated into the violation of the laws and customs of war combined with premeditated murder (Part 2 of Article 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine),” Ukrinform quoted the security agency as saying in a statement. Ukrinform said evidence of the killings was shared on the Telegram messaging app, including footage showing a Russian soldier shooting two captured Ukrainian soldiers at close range. Moscow has not publicly responded to the claims. Ukraine has repeatedly accused Russia of unlawful killings and other war crimes since Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of its neighbour in February 2022. Russia has also accused Ukraine of committing violations of international law. Russia on Saturday announced that it had taken fullcontrol of Avdiivkaafter the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces  in the biggest gain for Moscow since thefall of Bakhmutlast May. Russian President Vladimir Putin hailed the capture of the city as “an important victory” in the nearly two-year-long war. Ukraine’s military said on Sunday that Russian forces launched multiple attacks to the west of Avdiivka to build on their territorial gains, including unsuccessful assaults on the village of Lastochkyne. “The enemy is trying to actively develop its offensive,” Ukrainian military spokesman Dmytro Lykhoviy said on state TV. Ukrainian forces’ retreat from Avdiivka came after they were forced to ration ammunition due to dwindling supplies, which the administration of United States President Joe Biden has blamed on Congress’s failure to swiftly approve a package of military aid for Kyiv.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/19/ukraine-accuses-russia-of-executing-prisoners-after-fall-of-avdviivka
"Russia claims full control of Avdiivka, says Ukrainian troops still in town",Russia makes its biggest gain since capturing Bakhmut in May as war with Ukraine is set to enter its third year.,"Russia says it has full control of the Ukrainian town of Avdiivka after Ukraine withdrew, adding that some Ukrainian troops are still holed up in a vast Soviet-era coke plant following one of the most intense battles of the war. The fall of Avdiivka is Russia’sbiggest gainsince capturing the city ofBakhmutin May 2023 and comes almost two years to the day since President Vladimir Putin triggered a full-scale war by ordering the invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s Ministry of Defence on Sunday said its troops had advanced 8.6km (5.3 miles) in that part of the 1,000km (621-mile) front line, and that Russian troops were pressing forward after a deadly urban battle that has left the town an almost completely depopulated wreck. Putin hailed the fall of Avdiivka as an important victory and congratulated Russian troops. “The head of state congratulated Russian soldiers on this success, an important victory,” the Kremlin said in a statement on its website.    Ukraine said it had withdrawn its soldiers to save troops from being fully surrounded after months of fierce fighting. Moscow has been trying to grind down Ukrainian forces just as Kyiv ponders a major new mobilisation and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appoints anew commanderto run the war. But Russia said some Ukrainian forces were still holed up at the Soviet-era coke plant, once one of Europe’s biggest, in Avdiivka, which is key to Russia’s aim of securing full control of the industrial Donbas region. “Measures are being taken to completely clear the town of militants and to block Ukrainian units that have left the town and are entrenched at the Avdiivka Coke and Chemical Plant,” Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said. Russian state television showed blue-and-yellow Ukrainian flags being taken down in Avdiivka and Russia’s white, blue and red tricolour flag raised, including over the coke plant. There was no public comment yet by Ukrainian authorities on this. Putin sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February 2022, triggering the full-scale war after eight years of conflict in eastern Ukraine between Ukrainian forces on the one side and pro-Russian Ukrainians and Russian proxies on the other. Avdiivka, which is called Avdeyevka by Russians, has endured a decade of conflict. It holds particular symbolism for Russia as it was briefly taken in 2014 by Moscow-backed separatists who seized a swath of eastern Ukraine but was then recaptured by Ukrainian troops who built extensive fortifications. Control over the city was key to Moscow’s efforts to secure full control of the industrial Donbas region. Losing Avdiivka represents a significant blow for Ukraine which has been facing growing challenges in repelling Russian forces amid great ammunition shortages and limited manpower. Capturing Avdiivka is likely to provide a morale boost for Russia ahead of Putin’s bid for re-election next month, which he is almost certain to win. It is also seen as another step towards securing Moscow’s hold on the regional centre of Donetsk, about 20km (12.4 miles) to the east, held by Russian and pro-Russian forces since 2014.

Biden says he told Zelenskyy he’s ‘confident’ US will renew aid to Ukraine,US president warns of further losses of Ukrainian territory if Congress does not renew military aid.,"United States President Joe Biden has said he assured Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy that he is confident Congress will renew military aid to repel Russia after its forces captured the Ukrainian stronghold of Avdiivka. “I spoke with Zelenskyy this afternoon to let him know that I was confident we’re going to get that money,” Biden told reporters on Saturday. Biden said he was not confident another Ukrainian city would not fall to Russian forces without US support and that it would be  “absurd” and “unethical” for lawmakers not to approve a new package of military aid. “I find it contrary to everything we are as a country,” he said. Biden spoke to Zelenskyy in a call hours after Russia announced thecapture of Avdiivkafollowing the earlier withdrawal of Kyiv’s forces, which the Ukrainian leader described as “a professional decision that will save many Ukrainian lives”. Russian President Vladimir Putin hailed the capture of Avdiivka, an industrial hub located some 10km (6.2 miles) north of the city of Donetsk, as an “important victory” in the war, which is nearing the two-year mark. The White House said in a statement after the call that Ukrainian forces withdrew after being forced to “ration ammunition due to dwindling supplies as a result of congressional inaction, resulting in Russia’s first notable gains in months”. Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram after the call that he was “glad that I can count on the full support of the American president” and that he had faith in the “wise decision of the US Congress.” US Vice President Kamala Harris also took aim at Republicans for holding up aid on Saturday, accusing them of “political gamesmanship” after meeting with Zelenskyy on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference in Germany. Democrats and Republicans have been sharply divided over continuing support for Kyiv, with allies of former US President Donald Trump insisting the funds be spent on domestic issues, including border security. While the US Senate passed a $95bn package of aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan earlier this week, the bill faces a difficult road in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson has slammed the bill for not addressing security on the US-Mexico border, which he has described as the “most pressing issue facing our country”, and insisted the House will not be rushed to approve the aid. On Friday, Biden blasted House Republicans for taking a two-week recess, saying it was “time they step up” and assuage concerns about the US being a reliable ally.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/18/biden-tells-zelenskyy-hes-confident-us-will-renew-aid-to-ukraine
Russia claims capture of Avdiivka after Ukraine withdraws from key city,President Putin hailed ‘important victory’ for Russia after Ukraine said it withdrew to preserve its soldiers’ lives.,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has hailed his army’s capture of the eastern Ukrainian town of Avdiivka as an “important victory”, following an earlier withdrawal by Kyiv’s forces. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu informed Putin about the seizure of the front-line town in a meeting at the Kremlin on Saturday, his ministry said in a statement. Avdiivka was a “powerful defensive hub” for Ukraine’s armed forces and its capture would “move the front line away from Donetsk [city],” reducing Ukraine’s ability to shell the Russian stronghold, the defence ministry said. “The President congratulated our military and fighters on such an important victory, on such a success,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told state news agencies. Ukrainian troops earlier withdrew from Avdiivka, the newarmy chiefannounced, after months of heavy fighting and little progress in repelling Russian forces on the country’s eastern front. “I decided to withdraw our units from the town and move to defence from more favourable lines in order to avoid encirclement and preserve the lives and health of servicemen,” Oleksandr Syrskii said on Saturday, days after taking the helm of the Ukrainian military in amajor shake-up. The battle for the industrial hub, less than 10km (six miles) north of the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk, has been one of the bloodiest of the two-year war. Many compare it withthe battle for Bakhmut,in which tens of thousands of soldiers were killed. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that pulling out troops “was a professional decision that will save many Ukrainian lives”. “Our actions are limited only by the sufficiency and length of range of our strength,” he added, pointing to the situation in Avdiivka. Russia had been trying to capture the city since October and had surrounded it on three sides, leaving limited resupply routes for Ukrainian forces before they withdrew. Avdiivka had about 34,000 inhabitants before the Russian invasion. Most of the city has been since destroyed but an estimated 1,000 residents remain, according to local authorities. Videos on social media showed a town left in rubble.    Before issuing orders to pull out of Avdiivka, Oleksandr Tarnavsky, Ukraine’s army’s commander in the area, said on Friday that several Ukrainian soldiers had been captured by Russian forces. Avdiivka lies in the Donetsk region of Ukraine, which the Kremlin has claimed to be part of Russia since a 2022 annexation that remains unrecognised by nearly all United Nations members. The city has important symbolic value and Moscow hopes its capture will make Ukraine’s bombing of Donetsk more difficult. Ukraine’s withdrawal and Russia’s capture of Avdiivka have come in advance of Russian presidential elections scheduled for March in which incumbentPutinis set to win a fifth term, allowing him to continue leading the invasion of Ukraine. At the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, Zelenskyy pushed for countries to give Ukraine longer-range weapons and more air defence systems. “Unfortunately, keeping Ukraine in the artificial deficit of weapons, particularly in the deficit of artillery and long-range capabilities, allows Putin to adapt to the current intensity of the war,” Zelenskyy said in Germany. “The self-weakening of democracy over time undermines our joint results.” He also promised “to surprise Russia” later this year with new drone systems and electronic warfare. Zelenskyy on Friday signed security pacts with France and Germany to lock in support for Kyiv. He was also expected to make further pleas for financing and armaments at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday. All 27 European Union countries this month agreed on an additional 50-billion-euro ($54bn)aid package for Ukraine. United States President Joe Biden said on Thursday that Avdiivka risked falling to Russian forces because of ammunition shortages following months of Republican congressionalopposition to a new US military aid packagefor Kyiv.

Ukraine signs French security pact after similar agreement with Germany,"Deal with France promises $3.23bn in military aid to Ukraine, while pact with Germany secures $1.22bn support package.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has signed a new long-term security pact with France, hours after securing a similar deal and aid from Germany. France and Ukraine signed a bilateral security agreement seeking to help Kyiv in its war against Russia, the Elysee said on Friday. Signed by Zelenskyy and French President Emmanuel Macron, the pact includes pledges from Paris to deliver more arms, train soldiers in Ukraine and send up to three billion euros ($3.23bn) in military aid. The pact is set to run for 10 years and will not only strengthen cooperation in the area of artillery but also help pave the way towards Ukraine’s future integration into the European Union and NATO, Macron and Zelenskyy said. “Our cooperation yields results in the protection of life in Ukraine and our entire Europe,” Zelenskyy said on his social media platforms, shortly before meeting Macron. Париж. Запланована зустріч із Президентом Макроном і важлива угода. Наша співпраця дає результати в захисті життя України та всієї нашої Європи. 🇺🇦🇫🇷 — Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa)February 16, 2024  Earlier on Friday, the German Ministry of Defence announced that a deal had been signed between Zelenskyy and Chancellor Olaf Scholz. The German security pact, which will last for 10 years, commits Germany to supporting Ukraine with military assistance and hitting Russia with sanctions and export controls, and ensuring that Russian assets remain frozen. Berlin also prepared another immediate support package worth 1.13 billion euros ($1.22bn) that is focused on air defence and artillery. “The document’s importance cannot be overestimated. It makes clear that Germany will continue to support an independent Ukraine in its defence against the Russian invasion,” Scholz said. “And if in the future there is another Russian aggression, we have agreed on detailed diplomatic, economic and military support,” he added. Zelenskyy’s visit to France and Germany is part of hismini-European tourwhere he was attempting to secure much-needed aid for Ukraine as Russia’s war in the country rages on, edging closer to its third year. On Friday, Ukrainian troops were trying to hold back Russian forces closing in on the eastern town of Avdiivka. The Ukrainian army said it was pulling back from a position on the southern outskirts of the front-line city, but that its forces were taking up “new positions”. Avdiivka, which Russia has been trying to capture since October, is a main target for Moscow ahead of the second anniversary of the start of the Ukraine war. To tackle battlefield challenges, Ukraine has been facing a shortage of ammunition stockpiles amid delays in Western military assistance. “We are doing everything we can to ensure that our warriors have enough managerial and technological capabilities to save as many Ukrainian lives as possible,” Zelenskyy said on arriving in Germany. In January, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak also signed a security accord with Ukraine. Meanwhile, across the pond in Washington, DC, US President Joe Biden has repeatedly been stressing the importance of sending more aid to Ukraine. On Tuesday, the US Senatepasseda $61bn aid bill for Ukraine. But the bill still faces an uncertain fate with several right-wing US Republicans in the House already saying they will block it as the money should be spent on domestic issues. On Friday, Biden highlighted that the reported death of Russian anticorruption activistAlexey Navalnybrings new urgency to the need for Congress to approve funds for Ukraine to stave off Moscow’s invasion. “The failure to support Ukraine at this critical moment will never be forgotten,” Biden said. “And the clock is ticking. This has to happen. We have to help now.”   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/16/ukraine-signs-french-security-pact-after-similar-agreement-with-germany
"Zelenskyy seeks German, French support as Russia tightens noose on Avdiivka","Ukraine president’s trip to Berlin and Paris comes as battle for eastern city, one of the bloodiest in near two-year war, rages.","Ukraine’s army says heavy battles are raging withpressing Russian forcesin the front-line city of Avdiivka, as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy embarked on a mini-European tour in a new attempt to secure much-needed aid. The army said on Friday its forces were taking up “new positions” in the eastern city as the second anniversary of the war finds Ukraine faced with battlefield challenges and a shortage of ammunition stockpiles amid delays in Western military assistance. “Fierce battles are taking place within the city,” Ukrainian General Oleksandr Tarnavskiy said on social media. “Our troops are using all available forces and means to restrain the enemy,” he added, calling the situation “difficult but controlled”. “New positions have been prepared and powerful fortifications continue to be prepared, taking into account all possible scenarios,” said Tarnavskiy, adding that commanders have been tasked to “stabilise the situation”. Russia has been trying to capture the city since October and has surrounded it on three sides, leaving limited resupply routes for Ukrainian forces. The fraught situation and questions on Ukraine’s ability to hold Avdiivka have fuelled speculation that Russia hopes to take control of it before the Russian presidential election next month, where Vladimir Putin is set to be re-elected. Capturing Avdiivka is a crucial aim for Russia as it would allow it complete control of the two eastern Donbas provinces – Donetsk and Luhansk. But Zelenskyy, who arrived in Germany on Friday before heading to France later in the day, said his government was sending to the region as much support as possible. “We are doing everything we can to ensure that our warriors have enough managerial and technological capabilities to save as many Ukrainian lives as possible,” Zelenskyy, who last weekreplacedhis popular army chief and reshuffled his military command, said during his evening address. The army has also rushed reserve fighters from its Third Assault Brigade, comprised of assault infantry and one of Ukraine’s most prominent fighting groups, to the eastern town. On Thursday, the unit said on Telegram that the situation in Avdiivka was “hell” and “threatening and unstable”. “The situation at the moment the brigade was brought in was extremely critical.” The brigade added that it had conducted a raid against Russian forces in parts of the city and inflicted heavy casualties. Reporting from the city of Kharkiv, further north, Al Jazeera’s Rob McBride said the situation looked “increasingly precarious” for Ukrainian soldiers defending Avdiivka. “At some point, and we may be reaching that point, the Ukrainians may have to decide it’s not worth holding on to something for the sake of the lives of their men and it’s time maybe to pull back,” he said. US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby also told reporters in Washington on Thursday night that “Avdiivka is at risk of falling into Russian control,” citing Ukrainian reports.    The battle for the city has been one of the bloodiest fighting zones since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022. Many have compared it with the fight forBakhmut, where tens of thousands of soldiers were killed and Russia seized control. However, Ukrainian leaders have highlighted the increasingly tricky situation on the eastern front lines because of ammunition shortages. A possible$60bn package of military aidhas been held up in the United States since last year because of wrangling in Congress. Alongside with the US stalling, the European Union has admitted that it will only be able to send half of the one million artillery shells it promised by March. During Zelenskyy’s talks in Berlin and Paris on Friday, the Ukrainian president will attempt to secure guarantees for his country when the war ends. The German defence ministry announced that a deal had been signed between Zelenskyy and Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Friday and that Berlin has prepared a military support package worth 1.13 billion euros ($1.22 bn) that is focused on air defence and artillery. “Our security agreement with Ukraine is historic. For the first time in its history, the Federal Republic of Germany is acting as a guarantor state,” said Defence Minister Boris Pistorius in a statement from the ministry.

"Kyiv aims to use more Ukrainian drones; Trump, Biden clash on NATO",Ukraine’s new military command wants to use the armed forces more efficiently and build up defence industries.,"Ukraine changed its military leadership and announced a change of tactics in the past week, as a vote in the US Senate brought renewed hope of US aid for the embattled country. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyyappointedground forces commander Oleksandr Syrskii as commander-in-chief of the armed forces on February 8. Zelenskyy reportedly asked the outgoingValery Zaluzhnyto “continue to be part of the team”, without specifying what that meant. “We stood against a vile and powerful enemy. Endured together,” wrote Zaluzhny, an immensely popular general who stopped Russia’s invasion in February 2022 and ordered a counterattack in August that year, which claimed more than 1,500sq km (580sq miles) Since then, Ukrainian forces have become bogged down in positional warfare. A counteroffensive last summer failed to achieve its goal of cutting the Russian front in two. “The tasks of 2022 are different from the tasks of 2024,” Zaluzhny wrote.  In his first meeting with Rustem Umyerov, the defence minister, the following day Syrskii said drones and electronic warfare would play a greater role – something Zaluzhnyhad also saidshortly before his dismissal. Ukraine has set a goal of building a million small drones – essentially flying bombs – this year. Prime Minister Denys Shmyal said the government’s primary goal was to develop high-tech defence industries during a budget meeting on Tuesday, with $1bn going to drones alone. “We are talking about the developments of the Defence Tech cluster, scaling up the production of drones of various categories, electronic warfare,” Shmyal said. Mykhailo Fedorov, minister for digital transformation, told Reuters the number and range of Ukraine’s domestically built drones were dramatically increasing. “In December alone, drone deliveries were 50 times higher than in the entire 2022,” he said. Ukraine’s defence ministry launched a web form for Ukrainians to become involved in a community of innovators to “help solve the most difficult challenges at the front”, and is seeking to build a 10:1 technological advantage over Russia. This strategy has been showing results. Two long-range drones struck Russian oil refineries in Ilsky and Afipsky in Krasnodar Krai on Friday. Geolocated footage showed smoke rising from the refineries. Ukrainian naval drones sank the Russian Landing shipCaesar Kunikovoff the southern tip of the Crimean Peninsula on Wednesday. Ukrainian military intelligence’s Group 13 used Magura-V surface drones in the attack. It was the fifth Russian landing ship in the Black Sea Ukraine sank or disabled. Nocturnal video shot by the drones showed the Caesar Kunikov being struck and capsizing to port. A week earlier, Ukraine’s military intelligence used six Magura drones to sink the Ivanovets, a missile corvette.  Bringing greater efficiency to logistics, to keep front lines better supplied, and restoring Ukraine’s units with rest, new troops and training, was also a priority, Syrskii said. Ukraine has almost a million troops under arms. Syrskii also sought to overcome his image as “the butcher”, earned when he ordered a stout defence of the eastern town of Bakhmut that was costly in lives. “Of course, we need to improve tactics. For us, the main task and value is the life of our soldier,” he told Germany’s ZDF television. “I would rather leave, perhaps some position, but I will not allow the death of the entire personnel,” Syrksyii said. He emphasised self-reliance, saying “We, first of all, have to rely on our own strength. Not only on partners.” As these words aired, the US Senate passed a bipartisan national security bill approving $60.6bn in financial and military aid to Ukraine by a vote of 70 to 29. The bill also contained $35bn in aid for Israel and Taiwan. The bill must also pass the House of Representatives, but House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican ally of presidential hopeful Donald Trump, has said he will not consider aid to Ukraine, even though 84 percent of the appropriations would go to US defence manufacturers. “There is no question that if the Senate bill was put on the floor in the House of Representatives, it would pass,” US President Joe Biden said. “So, I call on the speaker to let the full House speak its mind and not allow a minority of the most extreme voices in the House to block this bill even from being voted on.”  Trump has campaigned on cutting US defence costs in Europe, including the cost of defending NATO allies who, he believes, should spend more on defence. “One of the presidents of a big [NATO] country stood up, said, if we don’t pay and we’re attacked by Russia, will you protect us?,” he told students at Coastal Carolina University on Saturday. “No, I will not protect you, in fact, I would encourage [the Russians] to do whatever the hell they want. You gotta pay,” he said to cheers. Biden responded, saying, Trump “gave an invitation” to Russian President Vladimir Putin to invade the US’s NATO allies. “When he looks at NATO, he doesn’t see the alliance that protects America and the world. He sees a protection racket,”said the president. Trump peppered his speech with inaccuracies. He put the bill of US aid to Ukraine thus far at $200bn, and Europe’s contribution at $25bn. In fact, the US has contributed $113bn in financial and military aid, and Europe 88.3 billion euros ($95bn), but Europe has approved a further 39.5 billion euros ($42.5bn) in financial and military aid for this year. Trump’s influence over House Republicans means there are no US appropriations for Ukraine so far this year. The Financial Times reported that Ukraine is already facing artillery shortages. The New York Times reported that Ukraine’s air defence missiles will run out by March unless replenished.    Russian forces, meanwhile, continued to rage against Ukrainian defenders in the east, launching as many as 100 assaults a day. Ukraine’s armed forces estimated they were killing or wounding about 1,000 enemy troops across the front each day – a figure that could not be verified. Tavria group commander Brig-Gen Oleksandr Tarnavskyi said Russia’s aim was to capture Avdiivka. “The enemy is increasingly adding armoured groups to assault infantry groups,” he said. Syrskii made his first trip as commander-in-chief to the eastern front, accompanied by Umyerov. He said troops faced “extremely difficult conditions”. Umerov said drones and electronic warfare reinforcements were on their way. “Avdiivka, Kupiansk, Lyman are extremely important areas on which all our attention is concentrated,” said Umerov.

NATO chief warns US aid delay harming Ukraine’s battle against Russia,"A $95bn aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan requires approval from the US House of Representatives.","NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has warned that the delay in approving United States military aid to Ukraine is harming Kyiv’s forces as they battle against Russia’s invading troops. Before a meeting of NATO defence ministers on Thursday, Stoltenberg said he “expects” the US Congress to agree to “continued support to Ukraine”. On Tuesday, the US Senate approved a$95bn aid packagefor Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, but SpeakerMike Johnson, an ally of former President Donald Trump, has yet to put it to a vote in the lower chamber, the House of Representatives. Stoltenberg said if Russia were to win the war, “it will not only be bad for the Ukrainians, a tragedy for Ukrainians, but also be dangerous for us. It will make the world even more dangerous and us more vulnerable.” Earlier, Russia launched missiles on Ukraine, hitting infrastructure and damaging residential and commercial buildings, injuring at least 11 people in different parts of the country. The Ukrainian military said seven Ukrainian regions were targeted, including the capital, Kyiv, and the cities of Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia and Lviv. The air force said air defence systems shot down 13 of the 26 Russian-launched missiles. On Thursday, military spokesman Dmytro Lykhoviy said the army is withdrawing some troops from the eastern town of Avdiivka to “more advantageous positions” to push Russian forces out of the country. “The key announcement with regards to all this is that supplies to Avdiivka and evacuations from there are difficult,” he said, adding that they had prepared a “reserve logistics artery” in advance. Since last year, Avdiivka has become a significant battleground after Russian forces nearly encircled it and made attempts to enter it. The commander-in-chief of Ukraine’s military, Oleksandr Syrskii, described the situation as “extremely difficult” after a visit to soldiers around the town. Meanwhile, at least six people, including a child, were killed and 18 wounded in a Ukrainian missile attack on the Russian city of Belgorod, Russian officials said. Roman Starovoit, governor of the neighbouring Kursk region, called the attack “a new crime of the Ukrainian Nazis” and said a shopping mall, an outdoor sports facility and residential areas were hit. Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of the Belgorod region, which borders Ukraine, said on social media that five children were among the wounded. There was no immediate comment from Ukraine regarding the reported attack. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is to meet French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday to sign a security agreement at Elysee Palace, the French presidency said. “As Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine will soon enter its third year, this visit will be an opportunity for the President of the Republic to reaffirm France’s determination to continue to provide, in the long term and with all of its partners, unwavering support for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people,” Macron’s office said on Thursday. His office said details would be announced during a press conference. The accord is to outline the framework for long-term humanitarian and financial aid, support for reconstruction and military assistance. According to two diplomats aware of the talks, France is expected to announce a 200-million-euro ($214.7m) fund for civilian projects to be carried out by French companies.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/15/nato-chief-warns-us-aid-delay-harming-ukraines-battle-against-russia

Russia’s Putin signs law to seize assets of those who discredit military,Latest attempt to crush dissent comes into effect ahead of presidential elections in March.,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a law allowing authorities to confiscate the assets of people convicted of spreading “deliberately false information” about the military. The law, which was signed on Wednesday, targets individuals convicted of a range of offences which include “discrediting” the government and spreading “deliberately false information” about the army, threatening them with the loss of money, property, assets and valuables. It would also apply to those convicted of publicly inciting “extremist activities” and calling for actions harmful to state security. The measure wasquickly approvedby the lower and upper houses of parliament. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the law, which could potentially target exiled critics with property at home, had “absolutely” nothing to do with Soviet-style confiscations and said fears it could be misused in practice were “groundless”. Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin had previously said it targets “scoundrels and traitors, those who today spit on the backs of our soldiers, who have betrayed their homeland”. An existing law against “discrediting” the military was adopted as part of a sweeping government crackdown on dissent afterRussia invaded Ukrainein February 2022. It covers offences such as “justifying terrorism” and spreading “fake news” about the military, and has been used extensively to silence Putin’s critics. Thousands of activists, bloggers and other Russians have received long jail terms, or been detained or fined for speaking out against the war amid an escalatingcrackdown on free speechand opposition to Putin. The new law goes into effect just ahead of the second anniversary of the Ukraine offensive andpresidential elections in Marchthat Putin is almost certain to win. Putin has not allowed real electoral opposition during his 24-year leadership of Russia, with rivals such as opposition leaderAlexey Navalnybehind bars. Presidential hopefulBoris Nadezhdin, a prominent critic of the war in Ukraine, has seen his bid to run blocked.

"Ukraine claims critical strike on Caesar Kunikov, Russian Black Sea warship",The attack near occupied Crimea came as Ukraine’s new military chief toured the front lines.,"Ukraine reported its forces have critically damaged a large Russian warship off occupied Crimea, landing a new blow on its foe’s Black Sea fleet. Ukraine’s armed forces said on Wednesday that the attack with naval drones had “destroyed” the Caesar Kunikov landing ship. The strike came as Kyiv’s new military chief toured the front lines, describing the situation as “complex”. The military said via the Telegram messaging app that it had acted in concert with defence ministry intelligence to target the ship, which was in Ukrainian territorial waters near Alupka as it was hit. The Ukrainska Pravda media outlet published videos showing a column of smoke over the sea off the southern coast of Crimea, and helicopters flying over the water. Ukraine has mounted a series of attacks on Russia’s Black Sea Fleet in recent months. Pushing its ships out of the sea’s western waters would help free up a key export route. InFebruary, Ukrainian forces used sea drones to attack and destroy a Russian warship. Cruise missiles struck a large Russian landing warship inDecember. There was no immediate comment from Russia on the latest attack. On land, the pair continues to swapcross-border air strikes. Russia launched several missile attacks on the town of Selydove in the eastern Donetsk region overnight, killing three people, injuring a dozen, and damaging a hospital and several apartments, Ukrainian officials said. Donetsk Governor Vadym Filashkin said on the Telegram messaging app that 100 patients were evacuated after a wing of the town’s hospital was damaged. Several apartments in a five-storey residential building were destroyed, he added, injuring at least four people, including two children. Russian state agency RIA reported that Moscow’s air defence systems destroyed nine Ukraine-launched drones over the Belgorod and Voronezh regions, as well as over the Black Sea. Russia and Ukraine both deny targeting civilians in their attacks on each other’s territories. The use of air strikes has grown as the front line has become largely bogged down in recent months. Nevertheless, fierce fighting continues in the country’s east. Visiting the area, newly appointed Ukrainian military chiefOleksandr Syrskyiidescribed the situation as “extremely complex and stressful”. Syrskyii, who was accompanied by Defence Minister Rustem Umerov, said in a social media statement that the Russian occupiers had “a numerical advantage in personnel”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/14/ukraine-strikes-russian-ship
Biden slams Trump criticism of NATO as ‘shameful’ and ‘un-American’,The Republican frontrunner had questioned the United States’ willingness to support its NATO allies if they were attacked.,"United States President Joe Biden has condemned comments about NATO by his likely 2024 election opponent and former President Donald Trump as “dangerous” and “un-American”, and said they raised the stakes for the US Congress to approve new funding to support Ukraine. Speaking at the White House, the Democratic president on Tuesday criticisedTrump’s comment over the weekendcalling into question the US’s willingness to support members of the Western defence alliance if they were attacked. Biden said the comments by Trump, the Republican frontrunner in the presidential race, made it more urgent that Congress pass his long-stalled funding request to support Ukraine in its war against Russia. “The stakes were already high for American security before this bill waspassed in the Senate,” he said. “But in recent days, those stakes have risen. And that’s because the former president has sent a dangerous, and shockingly, frankly un-American signal to the world.” At a rally in the state of South Carolina on Saturday Trump blasted what he called “delinquent” payments by NATO members and recounted what he said was a past conversation with the head of “a big country” about a potential attack by Russia. “No, I would not protect you. In fact I would encourage them [Russia] to do whatever the hell they want. You gotta pay,” Trump claimed he told the unnamed leader. Biden said Trump’s remarks amounted to an invitation to Russia to invade US allies. “Can you imagine a former president of the United States saying that? The whole world heard it. And the worst thing is he means it,” Biden said. “No other president in our history has ever bowed down to a Russian dictator. Well, let me say this as clearly as I can: I never will.”    In remarks calling for Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson to bring a Senate-passed $95.34bn military aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan to a vote in the House of Representatives, Biden said of Trump’s comments: “For God’s sake, it’s dumb, it’s shameful, it’s dangerous, it’s un-American.” Failing to support Ukraine war funding would amount to support for Vladimir Putin, Biden said, adding that the Russian president’s attacks may move beyond Ukraine’s borders deeper into Europe. NATO, a military alliance of 29 European and two North American countries, has a provision in its statute that says it must defend any member that is attacked. This is not the first time Trump has criticised the alliance. When president, Trump threatened to pull the US out of NATO. He also suggested he could cut Washington’s funding of the organisation, and repeatedly complained thatthe US pays more than it should. As the war in Ukraine nears its second year, concerns have mounted over the ramifications of a potential Trump victory in November.

Ukraine’s new army chief is known as the ‘butcher’. Can he beat Russia?,"New commander-in-chief, Oleksandr Syrskyii, has a strong history of tactical success, but much hinges on US military aid.","The new commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Colonel General Oleksandr Syrskyi has built a fearsome reputation as a military commander in the war with Russia, but he faces some major challenges, including how to mobilise new forces and combat corruption in the ranks. Over the past week, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has fired most of his top generals in an attempt to “reset” management of the country’s decimated, undermanned and undersupplied armed forces. The list of 15 dismissed generals includes the popular commander-in-chief,Valerii Zaluzhnyi, who has been replaced by Syrskyi – described by some as a “butcher” with little regard for loss of human life. Some heads of combined forces, military reserve, ground and airborne forces, along with some of their deputies and advisers, have survived the cull. “The first thought is that this is an absolutely unprecedented action,” said Nikolay Mitrokhin of Germany’s Bremen University, who has been writing detailed analyses of the Russia-Ukraine war since the conflict began in 2022. “Apparently, it was coordinated with the new commander-in-chief, Syrskyi, who named the people he would want to work with as a team,” Mitrokhin told Al Jazeera. The wave of dismissals follows the failure of last year’s counteroffensive to regain Russian-occupied areas in southern and eastern Ukraine, corruption scandals, dire delays to Western military aid and chaotic management of the armed forces. However, the scale of dismissals reflects the way Zelenskyy has been managing Ukraine since coming to power in 2019. “It’s very much in Zelenskyy’s style with his decision to ‘fire ’em all’, not only those who failed their work, but even those who belong to the wrong generation or team,” Mitrokhin said. The only top officers who have kept their jobs are the ones who commandedsuccessful operationsagainst the Russian fleet on the Black Sea, along with some heads of the air force and air defence force who “demonstrate success or stability in repelling Russian attacks”, he said. The new top brass faces a string of challenges – and mobilisation is number one. Kyiv does not disclose its battlefield casualties, but Washington believes Ukraine has lost at least 70,000 servicemen. The now-dismissed Zaluzhnyi had wanted to mobilise 500,000 men, but Zelenskyy rejected the idea fearing popular protests and citing limitations in training, housing and arming. Thousands of Ukrainian men of fighting age are believed to have bribed their way out of the country – or crossed Ukraine’s borders illegally, either by land or even by swimming across the ice-cold waters of the Prut River near Moldova. Some conscription officers have been arrested after receiving bribes of thousands or tens of thousands of dollars to “free” someone from military service and have now amassed enormous assets in Ukraine and abroad. Zelenskyy fired each regional conscription officer, replacing them with battle-tested veterans vetted by intelligence services. But the new appointees failed to mobilise enough men for the 1,000km-long front line amid devastating losses of manpower. Meanwhile, some servicemen are snubbing the shake-up of Ukraine’s top brass. One seasoned veteran who enlisted in 2014, after pro-Russian separatists took up arms against Kyiv in the southeastern Donbas region, and had just returned from the front line, was especially dismissive about new top general Syrskyi. “This man sent me to die as if I were meat,” he told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity, saying the servicemen who complain about their superiors or corruption end up dispatched to the most dangerous front-line spots to be killed. He claimed that medical doctors are instructed to ignore life-threatening wounds and injuries. “A man lost two legs and still was deemed fit for service,” he said. Other servicemen have reportedly complained about Syrskyi’s “butcher” tactics of neglecting human losses. Syrskyi addressed these concerns in his first public speech on the new job. “The life and health of servicemen has always been and is the main value of the Ukrainian army,” Syrskyi said on February 9. The former deputy chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said Syrskyi is indeed “harsher” than his predecessor. “Judging by his previous actions, he has a harsher approach in preparing and organising action and in holding his subordinates accountable,” Lieutenant-General Ihor Romanenko told Al Jazeera. However, Syrskyi “is very scrupulous in preparing for hostilities, he goes into details, thoroughly studies matters of supply and so on”, Romanenko said. While heading land forces, Syrskyi has been credited with two significant successes. One was the defence of Kyiv in February and March 2022, when tens of thousands of Russian soldiers tried to encircle the capital from the north. Under Syrskyi’s command, small and highly autonomous groups of servicemen and irregular forces attacked Russian troops and armoured vehicles, cut off their supply lines and used drones for reconnaissance and surprise attacks. One such serviceman was Bohdan Yavorsky, whose group of two dozen men ambushed a column of armoured vehicles in the northern Kyiv suburb of Bucha. They immobilised the column by bombing the first and last vehicles and showering the rest with grenades and Molotov cocktails before speeding away and calling in an air raid to destroy the rest of the vehicles. “This crap was stinking in the centre of Bucha for a month until it was removed,” Yavorsky told Al Jazeera in August 2022. Syrskyi’s second big success was also in 2022, when he clandestinely amassed light infantry in the eastern Kharkiv region to break through Russian defences and liberate the entire region despite Russia’s superiority in artillery. Another major challenge for Ukraine’s new top brass is delays in Western aid. The 27 member states of the European Union agreed earlier this month to unblock 50 billion euros (about $54bn) in aid, but Republicans in the US Congress aligned with GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump still object to a $60bn package from the United States. “It’s obvious [the EU] won’t solve everything without the Americans. That’s why the American conundrum has been going on for too long, which is definitely not positive for us,” Romanenko said. The delay is not ruining Ukraine’s economy but is absolutely crucial for the military. “The economy is not going to crash until the year’s end,” Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kushch told Al Jazeera. “The main problem is the supply of arms and ammo. Without US aid there’s not enough money for that.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/13/who-is-ukraine-armys-new-commander-in-chief-and-what-challenges-does-he-fa
Russia puts Baltic officials on wanted list as Estonia warns of war plans,"As Estonian PM Kaja Kallas is targeted by Russian police, intel chief warns Russian war on West coming in ‘next decade’.","Russia has put top officials from the Baltic states on its wanted list as tension continues to simmer amid the war in Ukraine. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Tuesday that Estonian Prime MinisterKaja Kallasand two other top Baltic officials have been added to the country’s wanted list. The move coincided with the release of an Estonian intelligence report warning that Russia is gearing up to wage war on the West in the coming decade. Kallas, Estonian State Secretary Taimar Peterkop and Lithuanian Culture Minister Simonas Kairys have been listed on the interior ministry’s database due to the “destruction” of monuments to Soviet soldiers. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have removed numerous Soviet-era memorials since they gained independence as the Soviet Union broke up in 1991. That process, which had already soured relations with Moscow, has gained momentum since Russia invaded Ukraine. Following up, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov accused Kallas of conducting hostile actions against Russia. Like her counterparts in Latvia and Lithuania, theEstonian leaderis among Europe’s most outspoken supporters of Ukraine. “The regime is doing what it has always done: it is trying to stifle freedom … and to continue to create its own version that is at odds with facts or logic,” said Kairys in a statement relayed via AFP. The same day, Estonia’s chief of intelligence claimed that Russia is “anticipating a possible conflict withNATOwithin the next decade or so”. Unveiling the country’s annual report on national security threats, Kaupo Rosin said the assessment was based on Russia’s plans to double the number of troops stationed along its border with the Baltic states and Finland, all of which are NATO members. However, the report noted that with Russian forces bogged down in Ukraine, a direct military attack on the West in the short term is “highly unlikely”. At the same time, the intelligence chief noted United States presidential candidateDonald Trump’s commentsthat he would not defend allies who don’t spend enough on defence, saying “such statements are never helpful”. Estonia and the other Baltic States have increased their military spending to more than 2 percent of gross domestic product since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, and NATO allies have raised their presence in those countries. Germany plans to have 4,800 combat-ready troops in the region by 2027, in its first permanent foreign deployment since World War II.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/13/russia-declares-estonian-pm-and-other-baltic-officials
Global defence spending jumped to record $2.2 trillion last year: Report,"Spending set to rise in 2024 with Israel’s war on Gaza, Russia-Ukraine conflict, tensions in Indo-Pacific.","Global defence spending jumped 9 percent to a record $2.2 trillion last year, a British military think tank said, and is set to rise in 2024 with Israel’swar on Gaza, the conflict in Ukraine and rising tensions in the Indo-Pacific region. A new report on Tuesday from the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) also mentioned growing unease in the Arctic, North Korea’s pursuit of nuclear weapons, concerns over China and the rise of military regimes in the Sahel region of Africa as contributing to the world entering “a highly volatile security environment”. “The current military-security situation heralds what is likely to be a more dangerous decade, characterised by the brazen application by some of military power to pursue claims,” read the annual report which the IISS has been compiling annually for the past 65 years. The “era of insecurity” is resetting the global defence-industrial landscape, with the United States and Europe ramping up production of missiles and ammunition “after decades of underinvestment”, the report added. Driven in part by NATO member states’ response to Russia’sinvasion of Ukraine, global military spending reached a record $2.2 trillion, it noted. The alliance’s non-US members have boosted military spending by 32 percent since Russia invaded Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014, the institute found. Wars in Ukraine and Gaza, Iran’s use of networks of influence, and China’s more assertive foreign and security policy all contribute to a picture of global strategic instability and a new era of contested power |@B_Giegerich#MilitaryBalancehttps://t.co/fOs6Itoa6X — IISS News (@IISS_org)February 13, 2024  The report comes days after Republican frontrunner Donald Trump said he had previously told an unspecified NATO member’s leader that he would“encourage” Russiato do “whatever the hell they want” in that country if it had not met its financial obligations to the military alliance. “You got to pay. You got to pay your bills,” Trump said at a campaign rally in South Carolina on Saturday. Ten members of the alliance met the goal of spending 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) on defence, up from just two members in 2014. According to IISS figures, 19 members increased spending last year. “Russia’s actions have reinvigorated NATO, with Finland completing its rapid alliance accession process in April 2023,” the report noted. “Russia’s border with NATO members is now more than 1,300 kilometres [800 miles] longer.”    The report said that Iran’s supply of missiles to Houthi rebels in Yemen and drones to Russia highlightedTehran’s growing influence in conflict zones. China had also demonstrated “increased power-projection capacity”, it added. The conflicts are not just overlapping, but they are also involving an increasing number of non-Western countries compared to two decades ago, said Samir Puri, a visiting lecturer in war studies from King’s College London. “The West was leading the sort of military involvement of normal armed forces rather than insurgents,” Puri told Al Jazeera. “Twenty years later, there’s a much wider range of countries that are involved in conflicts, countries like Russia and Turkey, and indeed Saudi Arabia and others have become much more interventionist, much more active,” Puri said. Defence spending is also being fueled byrising tensions in Asiawhere countries are arming themselves for deterrence, but also by the growing demand for modern technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and Global Position Systems (GPS). “Everything else that requires a lot of research and development spending,” Puri added.    One of the report’s key findings was that Russia has lost some 3,000 main battle tanks during the fighting in Ukraine, or roughly as many as it had in its active inventory before the full-scale invasion began in February 2022. While Moscow has replenished its forces by pulling 2,000 older tanks out of storage, the Ukrainian government is relying on Western nations to provide the ammunition and weaponry it needs to hold off its bigger neighbour. Lessons learned from the war in Ukraine are starting to influence military planning in other countries, the IISS said, with many countries recognising that they need to increase production of military hardware and build up bigger stockpiles in case they are forced to fight a protracted war.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/13/global-defence-spending-jumped-to-record-2-2-trillion-last-year-report
Elon Musk denies selling Starlink to Russia after Ukraine claims use in war,Moscow says SpaceX’s internet service ‘cannot be officially used here in any way’.,"Elon Musk has denied selling his Starlink internet service to Russia after Ukraine claimed the terminals were being used by Russian troops on the front lines of the war. “A number of false news reports claim that SpaceX is selling Starlink terminals to Russia. This is categorically false,” Musk, who leads SpaceX and several other companies including Tesla, said in the post on X on Monday. “To the best of our knowledge, no Starlinks have been sold directly or indirectly to Russia.” Moscow also rejected Kyiv’s claim that Starlink terminals had been smuggled into Russia and were being used on a “systematic” basis in Russian-occupied Donetsk. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Starlink is not certified for use in Russia. “It cannot be officially supplied here and is not officially supplied here,” Peskov told reporters on Monday. On Sunday,Ukraine’s military intelligence agency GUR said that intercepted conversations among Russian forces revealed that Starlink terminals had been deployed among troops operating near the towns of Klishchiivka and Andriivka. GUR spokesman Andriy Yusov said on state TV that Starlink terminals were entering Russia through parallel importing, not official channels. Starlink said in a post on X last week that it “does not do business of any kind with the Russian Government or its military” and the service “will not work” in the country. Ukraine’s military has credited Starlink for allowing its forces to communicate, gather intelligence and coordinate attacks more quickly and securely than would be possible using radio or phone communications. Last year, Musk came under scrutiny after it emerged that he had refused a request by Ukraine to activate Starlink to assist in a surprise attack on Russia’s fleet in Crimea’s port of Sevastopol. Musk said he had refused the request, which was first reported in extracts of Walter Isaacson’s biography about the billionaire because it would have made him “explicitly complicit in a major act of war and conflict escalation”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/13/elon-musk-denies-selling-starlink-to-russia-after-ukraine-claims-use-in-war
"US House speaker blasts aid deal for Israel, Ukraine as Senate backs bill",Republican Mike Johnson says the bill does not address the ‘most pressing’ issue of security at the US-Mexico border.,"United States House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson has cast doubt on the fate of a $95.3bn aid package for countries including Ukraine and Israel as the Senate voted to advance the legislation aimed at reassuring Washington’s allies. Johnson, the top Republican in the House, said the Senate had “failed to meet the moment” by not addressing security on the US-Mexico border, which he described as the “most pressing issue facing our country”. “The mandate of national security supplemental legislation was to secure America’s own border before sending additional foreign aid around the world,” Johnson said in a statement on Monday. “It is what the American people demand and deserve.” Johnson previously said that anearlier version of the bill would be “dead on arrival”as curbs it placed on unauthorised migration did not go far enough. Last week, a majority of Senate Republicans voted to kill a bipartisan bill that included the most comprehensive immigration reforms in years amid opposition by former President Donald Trump, who has led his party to adopt more sceptical stances towards immigration and intervention overseas. After stripping out the immigration provisions from the legislation, the Democratic-led Senate on Monday voted 66-33 to bring the military aid package closer to a final vote that could come as soon as Wednesday. Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer said the deal reflected “our security, our values, our democracy” and would be a “down payment for the survival of Western democracy and the survival of Western values”. “The entire world is going to remember what the Senate does in the next few days,” Schumer said. US President Joe Biden has urged Congress to quickly approve additional military aid for Ukraine, Israel and Asia Pacific allies including Taiwan. Conservative Republicans in the House have resisted Biden’s calls, insisting on measures to tackle “illegal” immigration at the southern border and questioning the need to continue support for Ukraine. Senator JD Vance, an Ohio Republican, on Monday blasted the push to support Ukraine as a “fetish”. “There are some Republicans for whom Ukraine is the most important issue confronting the country,” Vance said in an interview with former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. “And I just say, even if you’re pro Ukraine funding, and obviously I’m not, don’t we have 10 more important issues confronting this nation, between the border problem, the debt problem? Why are we so obsessed with this?”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/13/us-house-speaker-casts-doubt-on-israel-ukraine-aid-package-as-senate-advances-bill

"Russia slaps sanctions on British officials, historians and academics",Moscow says UK bears responsibility for ‘crimes against civilians’ for assisting Ukraine to repel Russia’s invasion.,"Russia has imposed sanctions on 18 British citizens including officials, academics and Russia experts for what Moscow says is an attempt to demonise Russia and fan the war in Ukraine. “We are forced to state that Russophobically charged British representatives do not shy away trying to discredit the constitutional system and socio-political processes in our country,” Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Monday. “The so-called brain trusts operating on the basis of the largest British and Western educational institutions make a significant contribution to the subversive work of London in the Russian direction.” The Russian Foreign Ministry also said the United Kingdom’s strategy on Ukraine has led to further escalation and loss of life in the war. “By pushing the [President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy regime to continue the bloodshed, the British must realise that, along with Ukrainian neo-Nazis, they bear responsibility for crimes against civilians,” the ministry alleged. Personal sanctions were announced against British Deputy Defence Minister James Cartlidge, Deputy National Security Adviser Sarah MacIntosh and Director of Submarines Simon Asquith. Others targeted included Stuart Peach, the British prime minister’s special envoy to the Western Balkans, as well as Lords Dan Hannan and Michael Ashcroft. The academics sanctioned included historians Orlando Figes, Norman Davies, Timothy Garton Ash, Rob Johnson, David Abulafia and experts including Roy Allison of the University of Oxford, Graeme Robertson of the University of North Carolina, Calder Walton of Harvard University and James Sherr of the International Centre for Defence & Security in Tallinn. There was no immediate comment from the British government. The UK has provided military and financial aid to Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. In January, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the country will increase its military aid to Ukraine in the next financial year to 2.5 billion pounds ($3.15bn), an increase of 200 million pounds ($252m) on the previous two years. Sunak and Zelenskyy also signed a security agreement that the Ukrainian leader said would remain in place until Kyiv joined the NATO military alliance. Ukraine had been fighting for the principles of freedom and democracy for two years, Sunak said in a statement in January. “We will stand with Ukraine in their darkest hours and in the better times to come,” he promised.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/12/russia-slaps-sanctions-on-british-officials-historians-and-academics
Ukraine protests destruction of grain exports by Polish farmers,"Farmers continue to protest that cheap grain imports, mandated by the European Union, are hurting them, despite financial support.","Ukraine has condemned what it called the “destruction” of its grain by protesting Polish farmers amid a long-running spat over imports of cheap grain. The agriculture ministry said on Monday said Kyiv “strongly condemns the deliberate destruction of Ukrainian grain by Polish protesters”. With Russia’s invasion limiting Ukraine’s grain exports via the Black Sea, Brussels mandated tariff-free access to European Union markets. However, farmers in eastern member states have complained that the imports undercut them. Kyiv’s anger follows the emergence of images and videos online showing demonstrators on the border between Ukraine and Poland dumping grain from trucks onto the road in a show of protest. Polish truckers and farmers have been staging protests at multiple border crossings with the neighbouring country for several months. They have expressed anger towards EU officials, demanding they scrap rules that allow cheap Ukrainian grain to enter the bloc. The acceptance of the cheap Ukrainian grain is part of policies adopted by the bloc tosupport Kyiv’s economy amid the ongoing warwith Russia, but protesters have said this has harmed their livelihoods. Despite having been one of Ukraine’s staunchest supporters amid the Russian invasion, Poland – as well as several other countries in the region, such as Romania – imposed temporary bans last year on imports of Ukrainian grain. The EU has condemned such measures, instead offering financial assistance to help make up for the losses. But some farmers have remained defiant,using their tractorsto block border crossings and destroying grain. After launching its invasion two years ago, Moscow initially blocked shipping routes from Black Sea ports to stall Ukrainian vessels from transporting grain and other agricultural products. The blockade eventually ended, but the war has had a significant impact on grain supplies across the world, with both Russia and Ukraine major exporters.

"For Ukraine’s defence industry goals against Russia, the sky’s the limit","To defeat Russia’s might and allies’ political flicker, Ukraine wants to build the defence workshop of the world.","As Ukraine approaches the second anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion, it plans to produce more if its own ammunition and key weapons systems. The goal of greater self-sufficiency comes as Ukraine’s Western allies meet increasing political resistance to military aid and Russia ramps up weapons production. Last month, Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said the country plans to increase its domestic weapons production sixfold this year. Ukraine’s defence industry has already begun to expand. Strategic industries minister Oleksandr Kamyshin said Ukraine last year doubled its ammunition production for NATO-calibre artillery systems. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said it had produced three times more equipment and weapons than in the first year of the war. That included armored vehicles and anti-tank missile systems. But it’s in unmanned systems that Ukraine aims to be a global pioneer. Almost 200 companies produced drones in Ukraine last year, up from seven in 2022, and their production increased 100-fold, said Shmyal. That meant Ukraine was already producing 90 percent of the drones it uses, Zelenskyy said during a meeting with the joint chiefs this month. The armed forces approved eight new models for procurement last month alone. On Tuesday, Zelenskyy explained why. He founded  the Unmanned Systems Forces, suggesting “special units” would be embedded in the army, air force and navy, and promised “constant scaling of production” to keep them supplied. “Our task this year is not only to bolster our sky shield and Ukraine’s long-range capabilities to the fullest extent possible, but also to inflict maximum systemic losses on Russia,” Zelenskyy said. As part of that goal, Ukraine plans to produce a million light drones and 11,000 medium- and long-range drones, the latter with a range of more than 1,000km (620 miles), said Kamyshin. Ukraine had “established production” and a  “financing plan” to achieve this, Rustem Umyerov, defence minister, told a meeting of the G7 representatives in Kyiv last December. Days before he was dismissed,Valerii Zaluzhny, commander in chief,  wrote that unmanned systems were “almost the only tool” to break the current stalemate, making up for Russia’s superiority in heavy equipment and personnel. Experts tell Al Jazeera Ukraine’s ambitions are realistic. “Kyiv certainly has the capacity to mass produce FPV [first person viewer] UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles] given that many of these are based on commercial or hobbyist products,” Douglas Barrie, senior fellow for military aerospace at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), a think tank, told Al Jazeera. “Manufacturing larger multi-role UAVs is more demanding, but again Kyiv has the ability to do this, if on a far smaller scale,” Barrie said. “After the fall of the USSR, [Ukraine] was one of few countries that had a functioning aircraft engine industry,” Pieter Wezeman, senior researcher at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), told Al Jazeera. “They can use that knowledge to rebuild a missile or a drone production capacity. It’s not coming from nowhere,” said Wezeman, whose research focuses on arms transfers and military production. Early in the war, Ukraine repurposed commercially available FPV drones to drop grenades into the hatches of parked Russian tanks, instantly killing their crews. They offered an added propaganda bonus: drones could beam back video of the kills, allowing Ukraine to humiliate the Russian armed forces while boosting their own morale. Ukraine believes building these drones more cheaply by itself would offer it more bang for the buck, cycle military expenditure back into its tax base and one day produce export revenue. “Basically, they want to build a million flying munition pieces,” said Wezeman. “They will need some foreign components – a little chip, a camera like the one in a mobile phone… it’s not as extreme as it may sound.” Oleksiy Danilov, who heads Ukraine’s National Defence and Security Council, recently claimed that Ukraine was already among the top three drone manufacturers in the world. Russia’s plans to produce more than 32,000 drones each year by 2030 seem tame in comparison to Ukraine’s. Unable to match Ukraine’s production, Russia agreed to pay Iran $1.75bn for 6,000 Shahed drones, Ukrainian hackers recently revealed. Suddenly last summer, Ukraine used a concert of unmanned systems to strike the occupied Crimean Peninsula with devastating effect. On August 23, it destroyed a Russian S-400 anti-aircraft missile system 120km (74 miles) from the front line. On September 12, a combination of 10 drones and cruise missiles crippled a Russian submarine and a landing ship undergoing maintenance at the Sevastopol dry docks. Two days later, surface dronesstruck two patrol shipsand a missile corvette, while missiles destroyed a second S-400 battery in western Crimea’s Yevpatoria. The reason for the escalation wasRussia’s withdrawalfrom the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which allowed Ukraine to export agricultural goods. These are a lifeline for its economy and war effort, bringing it $23bn last year. The most crippling strikes were yet to come. On September 20,Ukraine destroyedhalf the Black Sea Fleet’s communications headquarters in Verkhnosadove northeast of the fleet base in Sevastopol, and two days later hit the fleet command headquarters in Sevastopol itself, claiming to have killed 34 officers, including fleet commander Admiral Viktor Sokolov. Ukraine built up a sense of mystique around its weapons systems during this time, claiming to have developed a missile capable of travelling 700km (435 miles) and to have put variants of its naval drone into experimental operational use with success. “The missiles used against Crimea may very well go back to missiles Ukraine developed before the war started,” said Wezeman. Ukraine was known to be developing the Hrim-2, a short-range ballistic missile for Saudi Arabia. “They may have continued that project and used prototypes of that or other preproduction missiles,” said Wezeman. Ukraine’s ranged strikes have continued. Last month, Ukraine sent drones 1,250km (780 miles) to blow up aNovatek gas processing plantnear the Russian city of St Petersburg, forcing the company to suspend operations. Last week, a wolf pack of six droneshunted down and sankthe missile corvette Ivanovets off Crimea. The astonishing success of this remote warfare is that lacking a fleet, Ukraine has nonetheless managed to secure a corridor for grain ships in the Black Sea. More than 600 ships have safely used it since Russia announced it was shutting down traffic to Ukraine’s ports. Defence minister Umerov last year invited Western defence companies to invest in Ukraine, enticing them with a $7bn procurement budget for the year. Apart from low labour costs, Ukraine offers the world’s largest and most active battlefield to test new designs. Although Israel’s war in Gaza now claims much of the world’s attention, large numbers of personnel from the Russian and Ukrainian sides are reportedly dying on Ukraine’s battlefields every day. “The Western companies want to have access to the battlefield so they can have feedback on their systems. They need to know if they are ready for the future wars … so Ukraine is leveraging this to create the industrial base,” Tymofiy Mylovanov, the director of the Kyiv School of Economics, told Al Jazeera. Ukrainians are themselves rushing to cash in on the industry, he said. “We have… a lot of garage, Steve Jobs-style innovators, some [in] hardware, some software, some just assembly, but we’re talking hundreds if not thousands of companies,” he said. “This area is really booming right now… The talent from the entire economy went into miltech,” he said, using shorthand for military technology. Proximity to the battlefield offers the industry a quick feedback loop. “There’s also a lot of military personnel being advisers, co-owners, members of startup teams,” said Mylovanov. “People who are engineers themselves are on the front lines deploying their own equipment and immediately fixing it.” Domestic production would also tighten the loop to market, he said. “I have seen Polish military companies adjust their products by several generations already in two years, just to respond to what’s happening,” said Mylovanov. “There’s definitely been a level of openness on the part of many, many Western defence companies taking the first step and entering into very basic level discussions with the Ukrainians,” Elisabeth Gosselin Malo, a defence correspondent for Defence News, told Al Jazeera. But the safety of personnel is a concern, she said. Whereas last winter Russia attempted to destroy Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, since December 29, it has used drones and missiles to target defence industries. “We’ve seen cooperation increase in smaller steps – first entering into a cooperation agreement, providing them with systems, then maybe sending a few operators to train people there, and a few companies took it a little further, maybe assembling a few parts in Kyiv,” said Gosselin Malo.    For this reason, some contractors have recently opted to base production facilities in nearby Poland and Lithuania, which are under NATO’s security umbrella. Ukrainians have decided to cope differently. One manufacturer, TAF Drones, dispersed production to a dozen locations in six cities and changes those locations every three months, CEO Oleksandr Yakovenko recently told the TV channel Espresso. Despite such difficulties, Turkishdrone manufacturer Baykarrecently revealed it was building a factory in Ukraine to produce about 120 drones a year. Germany’s Rheinmetall, among the world’s 30 largest defence industries, last year established a joint venture to build armoured vehicles in Ukraine “to assure its strategic autonomy”. Finnish armoured vehicle maker Patria is also said to be considering a joint venture in Ukraine. Others may follow, including Belgium and France. United States President Joe Biden met with leaders of venture capital firms at the White House last month to encourage investment in Ukraine. Perhaps the most difficult period of this war for Ukraine came after it defeated Russia’s initial assault to take Kyiv and the entire southern littoral in early 2022. Russia dug in and imposed on Ukraine a war of attrition, steamrolling over a series of eastern cities – Severodonetsk, Lysychansk and Bakhmut – with relentless manned assaults that produced a huge loss of life. Ukraine allowed itself to be drawn into this urban warfare, reasoning that it killed far more attackers than defenders and expecting Russian President Vladimir Putin to hit a wall recruiting new troops. But Putin raised half a million new troops without much political backlash last year and expects to do the same this year.  Zaluzhny’s insistence that Ukraine do the same may have brought him a step closer to dismissal on February 9. “Russia has taken a different approach by not thinking in terms of smart arms but in terms of manpower and surface warfare and large kill offensives – old style,” said Wezeman. “They have failed but it has put Ukraine in a very hard position.” Ukraine’s position, he said, was, “We need the smart weapons because we’re not going to sacrifice our soldiers in the same way as Russia.” So, Ukraine is innovating. In January it unveiled the Sirko-S1, a four-wheeled robot that autonomously follows troops into battle, conducts reconnaissance and helps evacuate the wounded. In December, Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) revealed the Mamai, a new surface drone with a top speed of 110km/h (68 miles/h), claiming it was “the fastest object on the Black Sea to date”. Given Russia’s highly developed electronic warfare, which disables guided munitions by scrambling their satellite positioning signals, Ukraine is focusing on developing ballistic munitions. “A smart platform gets close enough so it can use a dumb, non-suppressible weapon to actually hit precisely enough,” explained Mylovanov. He saw a bright unmanned future made in Ukraine, whose youth will fight in the lab, not in the mud. “I think in a couple of years, [the world will have] walking or self-driving platforms with a sniper rifle that get deployed for surgical strikes.” “But yes,” he said, recalling the present. “We need bullets, we need shells.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/12/for-ukraines-defence-industry-ambitions-the-skys-the-limit

Ukraine aid package approval gains momentum after key US Senate vote,"Despite opposition from former US President Donald Trump, senators moved closer to passing a foreign aid bill.","A narrowly divided US Senate moved closer to passing a $95.34bn aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, showing undiminished bipartisanship despite mounting opposition from Republican hardliners and former US President Donald Trump. On Sunday, the Democratic-led Senate voted 67-27 to clear the latest procedural hurdle and moved the foreign aid measure towards an ultimate vote on passage in the coming days. Eighteen Republicans backed the legislation after Trump, the dominant Republican White House candidate, criticised the bill on social media by saying that the foreign aid should take the form of a loan. Democratic President Joe Biden, who has been seeking the aid for months, on Friday said Congress would be guilty of “neglect” if it failed to pass the measure. The bill includes $61bn for Ukraine, $14bn for Israel in its war against Hamas and $4.83bn to support partners in the Indo-Pacific, including Taiwan, and deter aggression by China. It also would provide $9.15bn in humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza and the West Bank, Ukraine and other conflict zones around the globe. The money is viewed as crucial by Kyiv, as it grinds toward the second anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Passage of the bill in the US Senate would send the legislation on to the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, where it faces an uncertain future. During a visit to Kyiv on Friday, a bipartisan delegation of House lawmakers vowed to do their part to pass the measure. Senate Republicans believe bipartisan passage would help stir support among Republicans in the House. “It will shape the environment such that … more Republicans will feel comfortable advancing the bill,” Senator Todd Young, an Indiana Republican, told reporters. Republicans want amendments that could address the increase in migration across the US-Mexico border and forgo humanitarian assistance provisions by restricting foreign aid to weapons and materiels. But some Republicans who oppose further aid to Ukraine have vowed to delay consideration by forcing the Senate to comply with a labyrinth of time-consuming parliamentary rules. “It is necessary to maintain American support. And I am grateful to our American partners who recognise this. We cannot let Russian war and evil spread,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksyy said in a statement on his social media platforms on Saturday. “[Russian President Vladimir] Putin sobers up only when he sees strength in front of him. Strength is required. I am grateful to everyone who helps us increase it,” Zelenskyy said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/11/ukraine-aid-package-approval-gains-momentum-after-key-us-senate-vote
Ukraine intelligence ‘confirms’ Russian forces using Starlink,"Starlink terminals, which provide high-speed communications, have been vital in giving Ukraine’s military an edge over invading Russian troops.","Ukrainian intelligence said it has confirmed that Russian forces are using satellite internet service Starlink on the battlefield in occupied areas in the east of the country. Releasing what it said on Sunday was proof, Ukraine’s military intelligence said it has confirmed earlier reports that of the “systemic” use by Russian troops of terminals of Elon Musk’s satellite communications system. Starlink systems have been vital for Ukraine‘s battlefield communications in Russia’s nearly two-year-old invasion as Kyiv has faced a larger and better-equipped military. The personal control of Starlink by the US billionaire, who has regularly repeated Kremlin talking points regarding the conflict, remains a concern for Kyiv and its allies. The terminals were rushed in to help Ukraine after Russia’s February 2022invasionand have been vital to Kyiv’s battlefield communications. Following reports in Ukraine, Space X said last week that it “does not do business of any kind with the Russian government or its military”. However, the Ministry of Defence’s Main Directorate of Intelligence (GUR) posted an audio clip on Telegram which it said featured Russian troops discussing setting up the terminals in eastern Ukraine. “Cases of the Russian occupiers’ use of the given devices have been registered. It is beginning to take on a systemic nature,” GUR quoted spokesman Andriy Yusov as saying. In a statement, the agency said the terminals were being used by units like Russia’s 83rd Air Assault Brigade, which is fighting near the embattled towns of Klishchiivka and Andriivka in the partially-occupied eastern region of Donetsk. Reports from Ukraine last week claimed that Russia has been sourcing Starlink equipment in spots such as Dubai. Western tech components have regularly been found among Russia’s arsenal as Moscow has become more skilled at evading sanctions, often importing goods via third countries.    Russian forces launched 45 drones at Ukraine overnight, Kyiv reported on Sunday. The five-and-a-half-hour attack targeted agricultural facilities and coastal infrastructure, officials for Ukraine’s southern defence forces wrote on Telegram. They added that a strike in the Mykolaiv region had injured one person, sparking a fire and damaging nearby residential buildings. Another person was injured in Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk region when a blaze broke out due to falling debris from a destroyed drone, said the head of the region’s military administration, Serhiy Lysak. The strikes come as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy continues his shakeup of military commanders in a bid to maintain momentum against attacking Russian forces. Kyiv announced that former Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Pavlyuk would become the new commander of Ukraine’s ground forces. The post was previously held byOleksandr Syrsky, who was named Thursdayas the replacement for Ukraine’soutgoing military chief, Valerii Zaluzhny. New presidential decrees also named Yurii Sodol, the former head of Ukraine’s marine corps, as the new commander of Ukraine’s combined forces; Ihor Skibiuk as commander of Ukraine’s air assault forces; and Ihor Plahuta as commander of Ukraine’s territorial defence forces. Incoming commander-in-chief Syrsky has signalled that his immediate goals include improving troop rotation at the front lines and harnessing the power of new technology at a time when Kyiv’s forces are largely on the defensive.

Overnight Russian drone attack kills at least seven in Ukraine’s Kharkiv,"Three children among the dead, says official, as the Russian attack triggers fire and damages homes.","An overnight Russian drone attack has killed at least seven people, including three children, in Ukraine’s eastern city of Kharkiv, officials say. Regional Governor Oleg Synegubov said on Telegram on Saturday three children, aged seven, four, and six months, were among the victims after the strikes hit at least 15 houses, causing large-scale fires. Kharkiv, about 30km (18 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border, has often felt the brunt of Russia’s winter campaign of long-range strikes that commonly hit civilian areas. On January 23,a barrage of missiles struck Kharkivand two other Ukrainian cities in one of the heaviest bombardments since the start of the year. At least 11 people were killed as about 5,000 windows in 222 buildings were broken by the blasts and shockwaves throughout the region, officials said. It marked what the United Nations called “an alarming reversal” of a trend last year that saw a drop in civilian casualties from Moscow’s attacks. The city with a pre-war population of 1.5 million is Ukraine’s most vulnerable urban centre. Russia lies north and east of it, and the border of Moscow-annexed Luhansk region is about 150km (90 miles) to the southeast.    Since day one of the full-scale invasion in February 2022, Russian forces have tried to seize Kharkiv, dispatching armed personnel carriers almost to the city centre. Moscow has deployed strategic bombers, ballistic or cruise missiles, and Iranian or Russian-made drones that take just minutes to reach the city from across the border. Unlike the capital, Kyiv, which received advanced Western air defence systems within months, Kharkiv remains almost defenceless. Residents and authorities have had to adapt quickly as any delays mean lost lives. Russian strikes keep Ukrainians on edge while the 1,500-km (930-mile) front line has barely budged. Both sides’inability to deliver major gainson the battlefield has pushed the fighting towards trench and artillery warfare. Ukraine’s struggles with ammunition and personnel come on the heels of a failed counteroffensive last summer and as European allies try to bump up their military production. To shake things up, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursdayappointed Oleksandr Syrskyas the new head of Ukraine’s armed forces. The move amounted to the most serious change of the top military brass since the start of the war.

"Who is Colonel General Oleksandr Syrsky, Ukraine’s new army chief?","Syrsky, who replaces General Valerii Zaluzhny, has been called ‘Snow Leopard’ and ‘Hero of Ukraine’ for his battlefield successes.","Colonel General Oleksandr Syrsky, the man President Volodymyr Zelenskyyhas chosento lead Ukraine’s military, has played a key role in some of the country’s biggest victories in its war with Russia, including overseeing the successful defence of the capital, Kyiv, in the early days of the invasion. Like most senior officers of his generation, Syrsky was born in Soviet Russia, in July 1965, and studied at a Red Army academy in Moscow. In the 1980s he was deployed to Ukraine, then part of the Soviet Union. But when the Soviet Union collapsed, he remained in Ukraine, studying at the National Defence University in Kyiv and joining the ranks of the newly independent Ukrainian army. The choice of Syrsky as commander-in-chief is hardly a surprise because few in the Ukrainian military have the experience and know-how to be able to fill the shoes of his popular predecessor, General Valerii Zaluzhny. In 2014, he commanded Ukrainian troops fighting a Moscow-backed insurgency in the eastern Donetsk region and was given the call sign “Snow Leopard”. In 2019, he became head of Ukraine’s land forces and led the country into war when Russia invaded in February 2022. In the early months of the war, he was named a “Hero of Ukraine”, the country’s highest honour, because of his successful defence of Kyiv. In July 2022, Syrsky planned and executed a lightning counteroffensive that pushed Russian troops away from the northern city of Kharkiv and retook swathes of land in the east and southeast. Two months later, Syrsky was credited with orchestrating the counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region, which was the most significant Ukrainian victory in the war and enabled Kyiv to retake the cities of Kupiansk and Izyum from the Russians. He has also led the Bakhmut operation, which was the war’s longest and bloodiest and has been criticised because of the high losses suffered by Ukrainian forces. The tactic to pin Russian forces in the strategically insignificant salt-mining town in eastern Ukraine also exhausted Russian troops and resources, sapping their ability to forge major breakthroughs elsewhere. Some military analysts believe his battlefield tactics reflect his hierarchical Soviet training. His successes on the front lines have earned him the backing of his soldiers, who have been locked in grinding battles for two years. He says his priority is the morale of his soldiers, whom he is regularly pictured visiting at the front. But as triumphs turned to attrition in the war, Syrsky has had to oversee the most difficult phase of the conflict, which will enter its third year this month. Shortages of ammunition and fresh personnel threaten to weaken the Ukrainian lines as Russians eye an advance. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian forces’ main goal this winter has been holding the territory it controls, as much-needed United States military aid is held up in Congress.

Decoding Putin’s ‘obsessive ideas’ in the Tucker Carlson interview,"In a two-hour talk, the pair covered history, politics and war. Ukrainians and Russia watchers say it was simply propaganda.","Russian President Vladimir Putin has told conservative US journalist Tucker Carlson that ending Moscow’s almost two-year-old invasion of Ukraine is “simple”. In his first interview with a Western reporter since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began two years ago, the Kremlin handpicked Carlson, a former Fox News superstar-turned-online commentator. The reason is obvious – Carlson has characterised the Russia-Ukraine war as a “border dispute”, called on Americans to cut off multibillion aid packages to Kyiv, and compared Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to a “rat” and a “pimp”. During the two-hour interview recorded in a Kremlin audience hall with gilded furniture, Carlson did not pressure Putin the way he used to sandbag the pro-Democrat guests on the Fox News show he wasfired from last year. Putin’s goal appears obvious – he wanted Carlson to urge Republicans to stop supporting Ukraine and concentrate on domestic problems. “You have issues on the border, issues with migration, issues with the national debt,” Putin told Carlson, who looked gullible and sheepish for most of their sit-down. “You have nothing better to do, so you should fight in Ukraine? Wouldn’t it be better to negotiate with Russia?” When Carlson asked whether Putin could just call US President Joe Biden to “work it out”, Putin refused – but said the solution was “very simple”. “If you really want to stop fighting, you need to stop supplying weapons. It will be over within a few weeks. That’s it. Then we can agree on some terms,” he said. Carlson did not even try to refute Putin’s outlandish and ungrounded claims. One was Putin’s belief that elected leaders do not run the United States. “So, twice you’ve described US presidents making decisions and then being undercut by their agency heads. So, it sounds like you’re describing a system that’s not run by the people who are elected in your telling,” Carlson said. “That’s right,” Putin said without offering further explanation – and Carlson readily agreed. Then he asked Putin who was behind the 2022explosionin the Baltic Sea that damagedNord Stream, a natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany that was crucial for Moscow’s coffers. Carlson called it “the biggest act of industrial terrorism ever”, but did not dispute Putin’s claim that it was the CIA that had allegedly blown up the pipeline – and presented no concrete evidence whatsoever. Putin began the interview with a lengthy lecture on Eastern Europe’s history, in which he reiterated the Kremlin’s manipulative view onKyivan Rus, a medieval superpower whose disintegration spawned today’s Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. Carlson seemed completely ignorant about the issue – and just kept nodding in bewilderment when Putin told him about a Viking prince named Ruric whose descendants ruled Kyivan Rus. One of them, Prince Vladimir, converted to Orthodox Christianity a millennium ago. According to Putin’s logic, Russia was the only legitimate successor to Kyivan Rus, and the very idea of Ukraine was “invented” by czarist Russia’s archrival – Austria. “Before World War I, Austrian general staff relied on the ideas of Ukrainianisation and started actively promoting the ideas of Ukraine and the Ukrainianisation,” Putin said. To Carlson’s audience and many in the West, the lecture may seem boring and irrelevant. But to Ukrainians, Putin’s interpretation of events is a sobering and threatening reminder that the Kremlin denies Ukraine’s very right to exist. “Because all of these anecdotes about Prince Vladimir and Rurik have to tell all sceptics just one thing – this man has obsessive ideas,” said Maria Kucherenko, from Come Back Alive, a Kyiv-based charity. “And he won’t stop at anything to make them real,” she told Al Jazeera. Ukrainian officials and public figures who have met with Putin face to face have long maintained that the Russian president is determined to subjugate and annihilate Ukraine no matter what. “He is tough and he behaves like he has this almost divine power, over Ukraine in particular,” Yuriy Vitrenko, who headed Naftogaz, Ukraine’s state energy company, at the time, told this reporter in 2021 recalling his encounters with Putin. Putin reiterated his old claims that today’s Ukraine is an “artificial state” created by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin who annexed areas in Poland, Hungary and Romania making them part of Soviet Ukraine. Putin also suggested that Hungary, whose nationalist helmsman Viktor Orban remains the most pro-Russian leader within the European Union, “has the right to take back its lands.” An observer compared Putin’s intention to those of Nazi dicatator Adolf Hitler who triggered World War II by annexing areas in Eastern Europe that were populated by ethnic Germans. “I think that the response to his Hitlerism on the part of North American and European elites will resolutely be harsh and will lead to more military aid to Ukraine,” Nikolay Mitrokhin of Germany’s Bremen University told Al Jazeera. “Here Putin worked for Biden by trying to animate Trump’s audience.” To other Ukrainian observers, the interview offered nothing but tired Kremlin tropes. “The only remarkable thing in this interview is the size of the table – it’s tiny! The rest we have seen and heard a gazillion times,” Svetlana Chunikhina, vice president of the Association of Political Psychologists, a group in Kyiv, told Al Jazeera. “Tucker goddamned Carlson served very well as a microphone stand for the crazy maniac who for two hours rambled about how he loves to kill Ukrainians.” To a Russian observer, the interview is a Kremlin public relations stunt designed to convince average Russians that Putin’s war did not turn their nation into an international pariah spurned by the West. “They want to show that Russia doesn’t confront the civilised world but only separate elites within it. To sort of emphasise that there are other elites, and here’s a well-known journalist interviewing [Putin],” said Sergey Biziyukin, an exiled opposition activist from the western Russian city of Ryazan. “And that once [these elites] win elections, the West will admit that Russia is right,” he told Al Jazeera referring to Donald Trump’s possible victory in the November presidential vote and to the recent success of several nationalist and far-right groups in Europe. The interview’s timing was critical for Ukraine. On Wednesday, Republicans blocked a multibillion aid package that was critical for Kyiv – while Zelenskyy announced his highly divisive decision to fireValerii Zaluzhnyi, the highly trusted and influential top general. However, to Ukrainian servicemen, the interview is nothing but a demonstration of weakness. “They’re two losers trying to support each other, trying to voice their conspiracy theories,” said Valentin, a Ukrainian drone operator stationed in the eastern region of Donetsk who watched parts of the interview on his cellphone. “They can’t face the truth about Ukraine that is real and will prevail,” he told Al Jazeera by phone.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/9/decoding-putins-obsessive-ideas-in-the-tucker-carlson-interview
"‘God of war’: Russian Orthodox Church stands by Putin, but at what cost?","The head of the Russian Orthodox Church is the president’s spiritual leader, but he risks losing global clout.","A masked, uniformed, gun-toting soldier hasthe letter Z, a Kremlin-approved symbol of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, on his shoulder. Jesus Christ, frail and devoid of aggression, is portrayed right behind him. Both are depicted on the billboard that reads “Christ triumphed over hell, and Russia will too”. This image is part of an outdoor art exhibition in central Moscow that urges Russian men to enlist. Moscow Patriarch Kirill, head of the world’s largest Orthodox Christian Church whose clout transcends Russia’s borders to believers in former Soviet republics and diasporas, hasdefended the Kremlin’s “right”to start the war. Russia has “the right to stand on the side of light, on the side of God’s truth”, he said days after the invasion began in February 2022. The white-bearded 78-year-old known for his eloquence and business acumen promised eternal salvation to Russian servicemen fighting in Ukraine against “corrupting” Western values. “[The West’s] goal was to take us with bare hands, without any war, to fool us, to make us part of their world, to inoculate us with their values,” Kirill said last April. The Russian Orthodox Church (ROC), helmed by Kirill since 2009, has tens of thousands of parishes in Russia and elsewhere, from California to Kazakhstan to Ukraine’s Kyiv. Ukraine was the ROC’s second-largest “canonical territory” with some 12,000 church communities – and remains paramount to one of the ideological pillars of Russian statehood. A millennia ago, Orthodox priests from Constantinople baptised Prince Vladimir, whose state,Kyivan Rus, became the progenitor of Ukraine, Belarus and Russia. Once dubbed “the Second Rome”, Constantinople fell to the Turks, and Russian czars proclaimed Moscow “the Third Rome”. The political and canonical loss of Ukraine, the heartland of Kyivan Rus, nullifies the concept. Today’s ROC is the largest of the world’s 16 Orthodox sees that claims 100 million Russians as its flock – although experts say the real figure is much lower. It is also the world’s richest Orthodox Church that gets multimillion state subsidies, and donations from businessmen and believers, and runs hundreds of tax-exempt businesses such as publishing houses, hotels and jewellery stores. Kirill is no stranger to luxury. Once spotted wearing a $30,000 Breguet wristwatch, he travels by a personal jet and a custom-made, bulletproof limousine guarded by Kremlin-paid security. The Kremlin eagerly persecutes any “rival” Christian denominations – making the ROC a moral police of sorts that sanctifies persecution of ideological and political foes. The Kremlinneeds the ROCfor ideological backing, said fugitive opposition activist Sergey Biziyukin, and gives it privileges such as real estate, state funds and “a chance to keep competitors on a short leash”. But Nikolay Mitrokhin, a Russia expert and fellow of Germany’s University of Bremen, told Al Jazeera that the ROC’s participation in the war means it “faces the prospect of losing its ‘universal character’ and clout, and of reducing its borders to those of [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s political empire”. In a detailed report, Mitrokhin concluded that the backing of Putin’s war “directly results in the boost of Kirill’s short-term clout and the defection of most of autonomous churches”. Kirill instructed some 20,000 clerics from the Baltic to the Pacific to deliver a prayer “for peace” – and urged their parishioners to complain about any sermon they considered pro-Ukrainian. Father Andrey Kordochkin fell victim to one such complaint. The Oxford-educated theologian spent two decades serving his parish in the Spanish capital, Madrid. The white-walled, golden-domed Church of St Mary of Magdalene whose construction he oversaw was endorsed by the descendants of the Romanov czars who replaced Kyivan Prince Vladimir’s descendants. But Kordochkin’s flock largely consisted of Ukrainian labour migrants who prayed next to believers from Georgia, Moldova and Bulgaria. Very few of his parishioners took part in an online campaign against him that ended up with a petition to Kirill in November that complained Kordochkin denounced the war and said that the Z symbol stood for “zombies”. The 46-year-old priest left his parish and the ROC’s jurisdiction for the Istanbul-based Constantinople Patriarchate and moved to Germany to resume theological studies. But he is still bitter about the fate of his parish – and Orthodoxy in Russia. Kordochkin thinks that Kirill and Putin transgressed to the veneration of a “god of war” that has little to do with Christianity’s message. “He’s far from harmless, this god demands human sacrifices, and the problem is that he never gets enough,” Kordochkin told Al Jazeera. He was one of almost 300 Russian clerics to sign an antiwar petition in March 2022. Almost all of them have been persecuted, while other antiwar priests are in a precarious position because of large families and no secular jobs to fall back on. “I’d be out in the cold with my whole family without a job and a place to live,” said a dissenting priest, who lives in Russia, but did not sign the petition. He withheld his last name and exact location, fearing for his safety. After the officially atheist USSR collapsed in 1991, tens of millions of Russians embraced their forefathers’ Orthodox faith. “This was the time of a huge upheaval, of great expectation. Many people were spiritually reborn at that time,” Kordochkin recalled. But after Putin came to power in 2000, the resurgent ROC gradually tilted towards his party line and turned a blind eye to unpopular steps such as the elimination of benefits for the elderly, the largest group of believers. Its clericsconsecratednuclear missiles calling them Russia’s “guardian angels”, and blessed the persecution of dissidents. Theycondemnedsame-sex marriages, abortions, sex education and HIV prevention programmes that kept Russia’s aids epidemic at bay. “They’ve devolved into the Orthodox Taliban,” Father Gleb Yakunin, who spent five years in Soviet jails for documenting the persecution of believers, told this reporter in 2012. In 1991, Yakunin led a parliamentary commission that published documents listing future Patriarch Kirill and other hierarchs as KGB informers. The Church defrocked and excommunicated Yakunin, and unknown assailants beat him up several times. Putin “independently interprets spiritual matters while the Church acts as an interpreter”, he said. However, experts say that the subservience and belligerence are already knocking down the ROC’s clout in ex-Soviet republics and among Russian diasporas worldwide. Kirill’s warcry was not approved by the Holy Synod, the ROC’s nominal ruling body that consists of Russian hierarchs and the leaders of autonomous but not independent churches in Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova and Central Asia. Only Belarusian Metropolitan Veniamin said in August 2022 that the West “endorses a modern-day Nazi regime” in Ukraine. The Holy Synod fell short of denouncing Kiriil’s truculence – while other Orthodox sees, including the Constantinople Patriarchate, lambasted it. Back in 2019, its Patriarch Bartholomew, the “first among equals” of Orthodox leaders, approved the establishment of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church independent of Kirill. The “older” Ukrainian Church kept most of its parishes but severed ties with the ROC in May 2022. The Latvian and Lithuanian Churches followed suit. Kirill even fell out with Pope Francis after trying to convince him the war was “justified”. “I spoke with Kirill for 40 minutes on Zoom. For the first 20 minutes, he read from a piece of paper he was holding in his hand all the reasons that justify the Russian invasion,” Pope Francis told an Italian newspaper in March 2022.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/9/far-from-harmless-patriarch-kirill-backs-putins-war-but-at-what-cost
Russia and Ukraine exchange 100 prisoners each after UAE mediation,"President Zelenskyy says a total of 3,135 Ukrainians were freed from Russian captivity and hopes exchanges continue.","Russia and Ukraine have exchanged 100 prisoners of war (POWs) each following mediation by the United Arab Emirates. In announcing the exchange as a “success”, the Gulf nation’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Friday that it was its third mediation effort between Moscow and Kyiv since December as it called for dialogue and de-escalation. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country “will make every effort to continue prisoner exchanges”, in a Friday post on X. Ukraine returns its people and will make every effort to continue prisoner exchanges. So that our people can come back home.

So far, 3,135 Ukrainian POWs have been freed from Russian captivity, Zelenskyy said on social media on Thursday night. Kyrylo Budanov, head of the intelligence directorate at the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence, urged Ukrainians to disregard scepticism about the time involved in a complicated process. “As you can see, it has taken a bit of time, but the only thing that matters is the result. Look over there and you have the answer to your question,” Budanov said at the undisclosed site of the servicemen’s return. In January, the two countries exchanged 195 POWs each, in the first prisoner swap since the crash of a Russian military transport plane that Moscow said was carrying 65 Ukrainian soldiers. The Il-76 transport plane was downed in Russia’s Belgorod region. Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Ukraine of downing the plane using a US Patriot missile. Ukraine has neither confirmed nor denied that it downed the plane and has demanded proof of who was on board. Both sides have carried out periodic prisoner swaps via intermediaries since the war began nearly two years ago, despite the absence of any peace talks between them since the early months of the conflict. The biggest exchange was on January 3, when they traded a total of 478 captives following mediation by the UAE. Putin warned in an interview that defeating Russia in Ukraine was “impossible by definition”, but insisted he was not seeking to expand the war to neighbouring countries such as Poland and Latvia. He repeated his claim that invading Ukraine was necessary to stop the country from threatening Russia by joining NATO, denied that he had territorial ambitions across Europe, and insisted he would only send troops into neighbouring countries if attacked first.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/9/russia-and-ukraine-exchange-100-prisoners-each-after-uae-mediation
What did Vladimir Putin say to Tucker Carlson? Five key takeaways,"Bill Clinton flip-flopping, releasing detained US journalist and US military aid to Ukraine were all on the agenda.","On Thursday, President Vladimir Putinspent two hoursbeing quizzed by former Fox News host Tucker Carlson in a highly anticipated TV interview. Theinterviewtook place just ahead of the second anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and at a time when United States politicians are pushing to restore military funding to Ukraine. Here are the five key takeaways: Putin revealed that, at some point, former US President Bill Clinton told him that Russia would have an opportunity to be welcomed into the military alliance, NATO. “At a meeting here in the Kremlin with the outgoing President Bill Clinton, right here in the next room, I said to him, I asked him: ‘Bill, do you think if Russia asked to join NATO, do you think it would happen?’ Suddenly he said, ‘You know, it’s interesting. I think so,’” said Putin who was speaking through an interpreter. “But in the evening, when we met for dinner, he said: ‘You know, I’ve talked to my team, no, no, it’s not possible now.’ You can ask him. I think he will watch our interview, he’ll confirm it,” the Russian president said. “I wouldn’t have said anything like that if it hadn’t happened. Okay, well, it’s impossible now,” he added. “Would you have joined NATO?” Carlson asked. “Look, I asked the question, is it possible, or not, and the answer I got was no,” Putin said. “But if he had said yes, would you have joined NATO?” Carlson said. “If he had said yes, the process of rapprochement would have commenced, and eventually it might have happened if we had seen some sincere wish on the other side of our partners. But it didn’t happen. Well, no means no. Okay, fine,” Putin said. Putin also highlighted that they were promised that NATO would not expand to the East. “Not an inch to the East … and then what? They said, ‘Well, it’s not enshrined on paper, so we’ll expand.'” “There were five waves of expansion. We tolerated all that. We were trying to persuade them. We were saying, ‘Please don’t. We are as bourgeois now as you are. We are a market economy, and there is no Communist Party power. Let’s negotiate’,” Putin added. Putin said that it might be possible to free Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who is awaiting trial on spying charges, in exchange for a Russian prisoner. The Russian president suggested that, in return, Moscow wanted Germany to free Vadim Krasikov, who was convicted of the 2019 murder of a Chechen dissident in Berlin. Gershkovichwas arrestedon March 29, 2023 in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg and accused of trying to obtain defence secrets. He and his newspaper strongly reject the charges and the US government has designated him as wrongfully detained. “We are willing to solve it but there are certain terms being discussed via special services channels. I believe an agreement can be reached,” said Putin, stressing that Western powers will have to take what he called “reciprocal steps”. “There have been many successful examples of these talks crowned with success. Probably this is going to be crowned with success as well but we have to come to an agreement,” said Putin. Russia and the US have agreed high-profile prisoner swaps in the past – most recently in December 2022 when Moscow traded Brittney Griner, a US basketball star convicted of a drugs offence in Russia, for Russian arms trafficker Viktor Bout. Carlson asked Putin: “Can you imagine a scenario where Russia is ready to send troops to Poland?” “Only in one case if Poland attacks Russia, why? Because we have no interest in Poland, Latvia or anywhere else,” Putin said. US politicians have said we “have to continue to fund the Ukrainian effort, or US soldier citizens could wind up fighting there. How do you assess that?” Carlson asked. That argument is based on the fact that Poland and the Baltic states are NATO members, and the alliance’s principle of collective security would kick in if any if them were attacked, necessitating US forces to intervene directly. “This is a provocation. I do not understand why American soldiers should fight in Ukraine,” Putin said. “Well, if somebody has the desire to send regular troops, that would certainly bring humanity to the brink of a very serious global conflict. This is obvious,” Putin added. “Do the United States need this? What for? Thousands of miles away from your national territory. Don’t you have anything better to do? You’ve issues on the border, issues with migration, issues with the national debt… you have nothing better to do, so you should fight in Ukraine? “Wouldn’t it be better to negotiate with Russia? Make an agreement. Already understanding the situation that is developing today, realising that Russia will fight for its interests to the end.” Putin also said a solution would be possible if the US stopped supplying weapons. “If you really want to stop fighting, you need to stop supplying weapons. It will be over within a few weeks, that’s it, and then we can agree on some terms. Before you do that, stop,” Putin said. Putin also blamed the CIA for the explosions of theNord Stream pipelines, cutting off a major route for Russian gas exports to Europe and fuelling geopolitical tensions. “Who blew up Nord Stream?” Carlson asked. Putin replied: “You, for sure.” Carlson jokingly responded, “I was busy that day”. Putin said, “You personally might have an alibi, but the CIA has not such alibi”. “Do you have evidence that NATO or the CIA did it,” Carlson said. The Russian president responded he “won’t get into details” but you should “look for someone who is interested” and who “has capabilities”. Many people might be interested but not all “of them are capable of sinking to the bottom of the Baltic Sea and carrying out this explosion”, Putin said. Putin said the world is changing faster than “during the collapse of the Roman Empire”. He also said: “Mankind is currently facing many threats due to the genetic researchers – it is now possible to create this superhuman. A specialised human being. A genetically engineered athlete, scientist, military man. There are reports that Elon Musk has already had the chip implanted in the human brain in the US.” “What do you think of that?” Carlson asked “I think there’s no stopping Elon Musk. He will do as he sees fit,” Putin said. “Nevertheless, you need to find some common ground with him, search for ways to persuade him,” Putin explained. He said that humanity needed to think about what to do about the advances in genetics and artificial intelligence and suggested the nuclear arms control treaties of the Cold War could be a guide. “When there arises an understanding that the boundless and uncontrolled development of artificial intelligence or genetics or some other modern trends, cannot be stopped, that these researches will still exist just as it was impossible to hide gunpowder from humanity… when humanity feels a threat to itself, to humanity as a whole, then, it seems to me, there will come a period to negotiate at the interstate level on how we will regulate this,” Putin added.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/9/five-key-moments-from-tucker-carlsons-interview-with-vladimir-putin

Russia’s Putin and China’s Xi denounce US ‘interference’,"Kremlin said the two spoke about creating a ‘multipolar, fairer world order’ in face of US-led efforts to contain their countries.","Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping have rejected what they call US interference in the affairs of other countries, the Kremlin has said. During an hour-long phone call on Thursday, Xi and Putin denounced the “US policy of interfering in the internal affairs of other states”, Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov told journalists. The two leaders spoke about creating a “multipolar, fairer world order” in the face of US-led efforts to contain both of Washington’s biggest adversaries, he said. “The leaders of the two countries realise that the US is practically implementing a policy of double containment, [toward] both Russia and China,” he added. The West has viewed Moscow and Beijing, both of whom are seeking to expand their global influence, with increased anxiety over the past two years as theyramp up tiesin trade and defence. Moscow has looked to Beijing as a crucial economic lifeline since the West hit Russia with unprecedented sanctions over its military assault on Ukraine. China has, meanwhile, benefitted from cheap Russian energy imports and access to vast natural resources, including steady gas shipments via the Power of Siberia pipeline. Trade between the two countries has surged in the last two years, hitting $218.2bn during January-November, according to Chinese customs data, achieving a goal set by the two countries in 2019 a year ahead of schedule.    Moscow and Beijing have also increasingly carried out trade in roubles and yuan as they move to phase out trade in US dollars. Putin and Xi stressed on their call that it was important to build a “financial infrastructure that ensures reliability of payments”, Ushakov said. Putin and Xi also discussed the situation in Ukraine and conflict resolution in theMiddle Eastand see eye to eye on those conflicts, Ushakov said, without elaborating. Beijing and Moscow declared a “no limits” partnership days before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and the two have expanded ties even as most Western countries turned their back on Moscow. China has itself been criticised, notably by the US, over a number of thorny issues, including its behaviour towards self-ruled democratic Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its territory. “In discussing the situation in the Asia-Pacific region, the Russian President reaffirmed his principled position on the Taiwan issue, which is to support the ‘one China’ policy,” the Kremlin said in its statement about the call. Xi told Putin the two “should closely collaborate strategically, defend the sovereignty, security and development interests of their respective countries”, according to a readout from Chinese state broadcaster CCTV. Xi also emphasised that both sides should “resolutely oppose interference in internal affairs by external forces”, CCTV said. Putin and Ximettwice last year. Ushakov said the two leaders would continue to have “close personal interaction” but there were no plans for reciprocal visits right now.

Ukraine’s Zelenskyy names new army chief after dismissing Zaluzhny,"President Zelenskyy thanks General Valerii Zaluzhny for his service, says he should remain ‘on his team’.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has appointed Oleksandr Syrsky, who has led Ukraine’s ground forces since 2019, as the new head of Ukraine’s armed forces, after he dismissed General Valerii Zaluzhny. In a post on X, Zelenskyy on Thursday thanked Zaluzhny for his two years of service, and said that the time had come for changes in the military leadership. Zelenskyy said Zaluzhny should remain “on his team”. I met with General Valerii Zaluzhnyi.I thanked him for the two years of defending Ukraine.We discussed the renewal that the Armed Forces of Ukraine require.We also discussed who could be part of the renewed leadership of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.The time for such a renewal…pic.twitter.com/tMnUEZ3BCX — Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa)February 8, 2024  Zaluzhny conceded that the country’s military strategy “must change” almost two years into Russia’s invasion. “The tasks of 2022 are different from those of 2024. Therefore, everyone must change and adapt to the new realities as well in order to win together,” he said after his long-rumoured dismissal was announced. The move amounts to the most serious shakeup of the top military brass since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in Febraury 2022. “The war does not remain the same. War changes and demands change. New approaches and new strategies are needed. Today, a decision was made on the need to change the leadership of the Armed Forces of Ukraine,” Ukraine’s Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said. Zelenskyy said the new armed forces leadership team will be taking over on Thursday. He called on the country’s new military leadership to devise a strategy for this year to beat back Russian forces. “A realistic, detailed action plan for the Armed Forces of Ukraine for 2024 should be on the table, taking into account the real situation on the battlefield now and the prospects,” Zelenskyy said. Last year, he said, Ukraine managed to “regain control” of the sky, but said failed to reach objectives “on the ground”. Zelenskyy said the country needs “working rotation systems”, and a new approach to mobilisation and recruitment. Al Jazeera’s Rob McBride, reporting from Kyiv, said there has been “deepening speculation” for a number of weeks about disagreements between Zelenskyy and his top soldiers, “especially over the conduct of the war”. “Zaluzhny is not an easy man to remove. He’s widely seen here as a military hero and also as a potential political rival for Zelenskyy here in the future,” McBride said. Zaluzhny was credited with thwarting the full-scale Russian invasion two years ago, but is also being blamed for “recent military setbacks”, he said. “It’s being presented as an amicable separation, but I think everybody accepts that this is Zaluzhny’s dismissal,” McBride said. Ukraine’s struggles with ammunition and personnel come on the heels of a failed counteroffensive last summer and as European allies try to bump up their military production. At the same time, a political standoff in the United States is holding up further aid from Ukraine’s main supplier. Zelenskyy’s announcement comes as the Kremlin’s forces push harder to take the eastern Ukraine city of Avdiivka, throwing more troops into the four-month battle and bombarding Ukrainian defences, as they stretch Kyiv’s resources. Some analysts warned that Zaluzhny’s exit could bring unwelcome disruption, potentially driving a wedge between the Ukrainian army and politicians, and fuelling uncertainty among Kyiv’s Western allies. There has been little change in positions along the 1,500km (930-mile) front line over the winter, though the Kremlin’s forces have kept up their attacks at certain points. Faced with a shortfall in anticipated supplies of Western weaponry, Ukraine has been digging defences, while Moscow has put its economy on a war footing to give its military more muscle. Retired Australian General Mick Ryan, a fellow of the Center for Strategic and International Studies think-tank in Washington, DC, described Zaluzhny as “a charismatic and popular military leader” who would be hard to replace.    His replacement will have to build personal relationships with US and NATO military chiefs, while the perception of government instability “is a real danger area for” Zelenskyy, Ryan wrote recently in an article posted online. Earlier Thursday, Ukrainian forces claimed to have shot down a Russian attack helicopter in eastern Ukraine near Avdiivka, where soldiers are fighting from street to street. Avdiivka has become “a primary focus” of Moscow’s forces, the UK Defence Ministry said in an assessment Thursday. The General Staff of Ukraine’s armed forces reported Thursday that its troops had fended off 40 enemy assaults around Avdiivka over the previous 24 hours. That is roughly double the number of daily Russian assaults at other points along the front line. Ukraine has built multiple defenses in Avdiivka, complete with concrete fortifications and a network of tunnels. Despite massive losses of personnel and equipment, Russian troops have slowly advanced since October.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/8/ukraines-zelenskyy-names-new-army-chief-after-dismissing-zaluzhnyi
UN committee urges Russia to end ‘forcible transfer’ of Ukrainian children,"Kyiv claims 20,000 children have been taken from Ukraine to Russia without families’ or guardians’ consent.","The United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child has urged Russia to end the forcible transfer of children from occupied areas of Ukraine and return them to their families. Last month, a panel of 18 independent experts pressed Russia on deportation allegations while reviewing its record. Their conclusions, published on Thursday, called on Russia to “put an end to the forcible transfer or deportation of children from occupied Ukrainian territory”. Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, has argued that “placements for evacuated children are arranged, first and foremost, at their request and with their consent”. Yet Kyiv has alleged that 20,000 children have been taken from Ukraine to Russia without the consent of their families or guardians, and theInternational Criminal Court(ICC) is seeking the arrest of Russian President Vladimir Putin for alleged illegal deportation of children, an accusation the Kremlin denies. Russia’s commissioner for children’s rights, Maria Lvova-Belova, is also accused of abducting children from Ukraine and has been issued an arrest warrant by the ICC. The UN committee demanded that Moscow investigate war crimes allegations against Lvova-Belova but did not mention Putin. The committee also asked Moscow to provide information about how many children were taken from Ukraine and where they are living, so “parents or legal representatives can track them, including through identification of such children and registration of their parentage, and ensure that children are returned to their families and communities as soon as possible”. They expressed concern at the impact that Russia’s war in Ukraine is having on children, outlining the “killings and injuries of hundreds of children as a result of indiscriminate attacks … with explosive weapons”. However, Russia has argued that it has only been protecting vulnerable children from a warzone. In January’s hearing in Geneva, the head of the Russian delegation, Alexey Vovchenko, the labour and social protection deputy minister, denied that any Ukrainians were forcibly removed from their country. He said 4.8 million residents of Ukraine, including 770,000 children, had been taken in by Russia. But UN committee chairperson Ann Skelton said the committee members and the Russian delegation had been “talking past one another” at the meeting. “We found often in the dialogue that we were using one type of terminology and they were using another,” she said. “We were using the word ‘adoption’, and they were denying that it’s adoption and talking about ‘fostering children’.” Last year, the UN added Russia to a list of countries that violate children’s rights in conflicts, referencing boys and girls who were killed during attacks on schools and hospitals in Ukraine.

Putin’s antiwar rival blocked from contesting Russia presidential election,"Boris Nadezhdin, who has won support for his criticism of the Ukraine war, vows to challenge poll commission’s decision.","Russia’s presidential hopefulBoris Nadezhdinhas said his bid to run in elections in March has been blocked, and that he will challenge the decision of the election commission in the country’s highest court. Nadezhdin, a prominent critic of thewar in Ukraine, is intent on unseating incumbent Vladimir Putin. But his bid was stymied by the Central Election Commission (CEC), which refused to register him as a candidate, he said on Thursday on Telegram, adding that he would launch an appeal in the country’s Supreme Court. Running on the ticket of the small centre-right Civic Initiative party, Nadezhdin last month submitted the 100,000 signatures required to register as a candidate for the election to be held on March 15-17. However, the CEC had informed Nadezhdin on Monday that it had foundflawsin 15 percent of signatures he had collected in support of his candidacy, and that some of the purported signatures were those of dead people. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that the decision by election officials was in line with the rules. “I collected more than 200,000 signatures across Russia. We conducted the collection openly and honestly – the queues at our headquarters and collection points were watched by the whole world,” Nadezhdin said. “Taking part in the presidential election in 2024 is the most important political decision of my life. I am not giving up on my intentions.”    ‘Fatal mistake’ Nadezhdin, a 60-year-old municipal councillor who is known for his criticism of Putin, had caught the attention of Russia’s small opposition forces with promises to end the war in Ukraine. Born in Soviet-ruled Uzbekistan to a Jewish mother who was a music teacher and a physicist father – he has spent the last 30 years in Russian politics, working as a councillor in the town of Dolgoprudny outside Moscow. He says Putin, 71, made a “fatal mistake” by launching the invasion and has pledged to end it via negotiation. It was already thought that authorities would not welcome a candidate who would introduce antiwar rhetoric in the race. Putin is almost certain to win re-election to extend his 24-year leadership of Russia, including eight years as prime minister, for at least another six years. He has not allowed real electoral opposition during his rule, with rivals such as opposition leaderAlexey Navalnybehind bars. Putin will be running as an independent, rather than as the candidate of the governing United Russia party, meaning he needs 300,000 signatures to support his candidacy. He has already collected more than 3.5 million, according to his supporters.   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/8/putins-anti-war-rival-blocked-from-contesting-russia-presidential-election
"Russia-Ukraine war: List of key events, day 715","As the war enters its 715th day, these are the main developments.","Here is the situation on Thursday, February 8, 2024.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/8/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-715
Ukraine’s Zaluzhny touts drones as path to victory; Russia suffers strikes,"In the past week of war, Ukraine strikes a missile corvette, an airfield and an oil refinery with missiles and drones.","Ukraine’s commander-in-chief has outlined a plan to massively scale up the use of unmanned systems to overcome Russia’s advantages in manpower and materiel and break the deadlock in this war. The effectiveness of such systems was proved again last week as they sank a Russian missile corvette, grounded three planes and set an oil refinery on fire. Russia, too, continued to attack Ukraine with drones and missiles, but it failed to capture new territory despite its superior resources and constant assaults on the eastern city of Avdiivka and Ukraine’s stronghold at Krynky on the left bank of the Dnipro River in the Kherson region. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s Western allies made progress on securing funding for the war. The European Unionfinally approveda 50-billion-euro ($63bn) aid package for Ukraine, and the United States Senate unveiled a $118bn bill that includes $60bn for Ukraine. “Unmanned systems … are almost the only tool for withdrawing from military operations of a positional form,” Ukrainian commander-in-chiefValerii Zaluzhnywrote in a doctrinal paper on Thursday, because traditional heavy armour and manpower are “increasingly a dream” for Ukraine’s armed forces. He called for a “completely new state system of technological rearmament” that could “take up to five months”. Zaluzhny’s new military doctrine dovetailed with the government’s pledge late last year to build 1 million first-person viewer drones and 11,000 medium- and long-range drones this year. Ukraine has used such systems with devastating effect.  On January 31, Ukraine struck the Belbek airfield in western Crimea. Russia’s Ministry of Defence said it intercepted 20 air-launched missiles, but Russians in Crimea filmed some of the missiles flying undisturbed directly over dormant air defence systems. The following day, Ukraine struck Belbek again, this time damaging or destroying three Russian fighter planes on the ground, according to southern forces spokesperson Natalia Humenyuk. One Russian military reporter described it as a complex, two-day operation targeting three airfields and involving decoy missiles, HARM radar-seeking missiles, Storm Shadow attack missiles and surface drones. Those surface drones sank a Russian warship near Lake Donuzlav off western Crimea. Footage released by Ukraine’s armed forces showed them repeatedly striking the Ivanovets, a 480-tonne missile corvette, crippling it and then destroying it in a pair of massive explosions. It was reportedly one of only three still operating in Russia’s Black Sea Fleet. Ukrainian military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said his service’s drone unit Group 13 sank the Ivanovets using Magura V5 surface drones. “There were six direct hits to the hull. … The ship overturned on its stern and sank,” he said. Two days later, Ukraine’s Security Service struck the Rosneft refinery in Volgograd, one of the largest in Russia, apparently using two aerial drones. Footage showed at least four burning oil tanks destroyed. Budanov said he believes the number of attacks would increase. “Hypothetically, there is a plan by which all this happens. I believe that this plan includes all the main objects of critical infrastructure and objects of military infrastructure of the Russian Federation,” Budanov said. Ukrainian air force spokesman Yuri Ignat suggested attacks on Crimea would continue to target airfields. “Russia uses not only Belbek. About five airfields are actively used for attacks on Ukraine. These are planes of various modifications: MiG-31, … MiG-29, Su-27 and helicopters,” he said.  Ukraine has pursued other forms of asymmetric warfare. Its military intelligence said a Russian Tu-95 bomber, who had reportedly taken part in raids on Ukraine, was shot dead in Russia. Ukrainian hackers from the Prana Network broke into a Russian Defence Ministry server, stealing documents that revealed Russia had agreed to pay Iran $1.75bn for 6,000 Shahed drones. Russia kept those drones flying into Ukraine throughout the week, accompanied by missiles. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Dnipropetrovsk was one of Russia’s main targets for those attacks. “The danger is constant, high. Russia considers the region as one of the main targets for terrorist attacks. It is our enterprises, our economic potential, this region,” he said. Dnipropetrovsk lies at the heart of Ukraine’s territories on the left bank of the Dnipro River and sits among the contested regions of Kharkiv, Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia and Kherson. As if to vindicate Zaluzhny’s turn from conventional battlefield weapons, EU leaders confirmed they would not be able to provide Ukraine with 1 million artillery shells by March as promised. European foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said 330,000 had been delivered and the number would reach about 524,000 by March. “By the end of the year, the planned deliveries will reach more than 1 million because the figure in the pipeline amounts to 630,000,” Borrell said. Some estimates have put Russian artillery shell production capacity at 6 million to 7 million a year. North Korea has reportedly delivered an additional 1 million more shells. There was some good news for Ukraine on the financial front. European leaders overcame objections from Hungary to approve 50 billion euros ($54bn) in financial aid for Ukraine over the next four years. The first 4.5 billion euros ($4.85bn) was to arrive in Ukraine in March as part of a total of 18 billion euros ($19bn) for Kyiv this year. That left the EU with 20 billion euros ($21.5bn) in military aid still to approve. US senators on Sunday released a $118bn national security bill for discussion that included $60bn for Ukraine this year. US President Joe Biden, a Democrat, requested the sum late last year, but congressional Republicans had tied any Ukraine aid to increased security on the border with Mexico.  Months of bipartisan negotiations produced sweeping reforms to asylum procedures, presidential parole to migrants and funding for border security. “Now all indications are this bill won’t even move forward to the Senate floor,” said Biden on Tuesday, blaming Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump. “He’s done nothing, I’m told, than reach out to Republicans in the House and Senate and threaten and intimidate them to vote against this proposal. And it looks like they’re caving, but they owe it to the American people to show some spine,” Biden said in a White House briefing. Despite leading Ukraine’s armed forces to some spectacular successes, there was speculation that Zaluzhny was due to be replaced after Zelenskyy hinted at major changes in an interview that aired on Sunday night. “A reset, a new beginning is necessary,” Zelenskyy told Italy’s state television Rai News. “If we want to win, we must all push in the same direction, convinced of victory. We cannot be discouraged, let our arms fall. … That’s why I’m talking about restarting, replacement. I have something serious in mind, which is not about a single person but about the direction of the country’s leadership,” Zelenskyy said.

Ukraine lawmakers pass first reading of mobilisation bill,The legislation would tighten draft conditions as Kyiv struggles to replenish its ranks as Russian war grinds on.,"Ukrainian lawmakers have passed the first reading of a revised mobilisation bill after difficulties in pushing through legislation aimed at increasing its military ranks. The parliament tentatively backed the revised draft of the bill on Wednesday. The legislation would lower the age of military service and make it harder to avoid the draft as Kyiv struggles to find enough soldiers to maintain its defences againstRussia’s invasion. In its current form, the legislation would lower the age at which people can be mobilised for combat duty by two years to 25. It would also require potential military personnel who are abroad to have up-to-date military registrations. Obtaining such a document would be a prerequisite to receiving consular services. Tighter sanctions for draft evasion, including an asset freeze, are also included. While the bill would also allow soldiers who have served continuously for 36 months during the war to be discharged, this would not be automatic. As the war with Russia has dragged on, Kyiv has found it increasingly difficult to find new soldiers to relieve its troops on the front lines. That has helped stoketensionbetween President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who warned in December that the military wanted to mobilise up to half a million people, and military chiefs. Lawmakers in the Verkhovna Rada last month refused to debate the mobilisation bill as fierce criticism from a war-weary public encouraged a wary approach. Although MPs gave the bill its first green light on Wednesday, it is clear that changes will be made before it is passed. The Ministry of Defence said it would closely cooperate with the appropriate parliamentary committee to ensure necessary amendments are made by the second reading. “This is not a final decision,” lawmaker Oleksiy Goncharenko said on Telegram. “There will be a second reading, amendments will be made to it.” Enacting the legislation is, therefore, still expected to take weeks. Kyiv has kept its military losses secret, but the latest US estimates published in August put the death toll at nearly 70,000 and the number of wounded at up to 120,000.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/7/ukraine-aims-to-bolster-troops-with-new-law
‘It’s healthy to be on war alert’: Sweden’s conscription push gathers pace,"As it prepares to join NATO with the Ukraine war yet raging, Sweden’s long-held neutrality will soon become a principle of the past.","Gotland, Sweden –Conscript Linus pokes his head out of the commander’s hatch, eases himself through the opening, and lifts himself atop the tank. Most of his days in the Swedish army are not so exciting, “but today, when we are shooting, it’s fun”, he says, holding an automatic rifle in his arms. At 18, he is part of a new generation of conscripts that is hoped to boost the armed forces andremilitarise Sweden. He is doing his service on Gotland, an island controlling the passage through the Baltic Sea, 275km (170 miles) from the Russian port of Kaliningrad. Gotland represents the challenges facing Sweden as a whole. The regiment here was disbanded militarily in 2005, when Russia was no longer seen as a threat. Now rearmament is taking place at pace, and the number of conscripts is tripling. “This is a very special time in Swedish history, both for the nation and the armed forces, coming from neutrality and non-alliance, and then shifting towards collective defence within NATO. It’s a big step,” said Colonel Dan Rasmussen, commander of the Gotland Regiment. He cast the situation as a societal awakening that began with Russia’s invasions of Georgia in 2008, Crimea in 2014, and finally the 2022 full-scale attack on Ukraine. “We needed that final push to realise that it isn’t getting better, and now we are preparing for the worst.” Cold War-era military service was dropped in 2010 as the country drastically reduced its armed forces. Its reintroduction in 2018 was accelerated by the war in Ukraine and Sweden’s NATO application. Conscription is up 30 percent this year, and the armed forces’ budget is up by 28 percent – giving them another $2.5bn. In early 2023, Bloomberg reported that Sweden plans todouble the number of conscripts to 10,000 by 2030. Earlier this year, Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said at the National Conference of Defence that Sweden “can’t sit around investigating things year after year. Now it’s important to get things done”. Former NATO director of policy planning, Fabrice Pothier, agrees, saying Sweden went “too far in neglecting Gotland”. “It is healthy to be on war alert and war readiness footing rather than in denial.” He said Sweden’s neutrality in recent times has endangered the country. However, a warning by Commander-in-Chief Michael Byden last month, that “all Swedes should mentally prepare for war”, stirred fears, especially among young people. “Many young people and parents are calling us, worried that their kids will be sent to do conscription. ‘Will our kids have to fight for NATO? Are we in war?’ That’s the kind of questions they have,” said Kerstin Bergea, president of the Swedish Peace and Arbitration Society. “Even our own armed forces say the risk of a military attack on Sweden is low. So to have such a huge build-up isn’t the right way to go. It doesn’t make Sweden or the world safer.” Behind conscript Linus another tank starts moving, muddying the ground on its way to the shooting field. Linus explains he wanted to follow in his father’s footsteps and be conscripted, but not all who are called up do it by choice. About 10 percent are there against their will. More than 100,000 teenagers born in 2006 are being sent their muster papers this year. Caspar Sperling is one of them, now waiting to see if he will be called. Petting the family’s cat, he shows the forms he had to fill out on his laptop. “It feels a bit scary that I might have to be away for nine months and not have a choice, risking going to jail if I don’t obey,” he said. “[But] it feels important to do this, to contribute during the situation that we have now,” he says, continuing: “The fact that Russia has started a war again is scary.” With Turkey having ratified Sweden’s application to NATO, the Nordic country is now waiting for only Hungary to do the same before it can become a full member of the alliance. Not everyone is happy with this new reality. “Sweden will leave 200 years of peace and enter a nuclear weapon alliance, NATO,” said Bergea. Back on Gotland, tank driver Julia, another conscript, stops to load up on more ammunition. “With the worldwide situation of today, I think it’s important,” she said. She left home to live on Gotland for a year. The island is usually known for long beaches and sunny days, but on this frigid February day, the harsh wind blows in from the sea as tanks fire live ammunition across the fields. Few truly believe these weapons will be needed for real. But Sweden is not taking any chances. In any case, these could be the last days of the country deciding its military direction – before NATO takes the reins.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/7/its-healthy-to-be-on-war-alert-swedens-conscription-push-gathers-pace

According to Mayor Vitalii Klitschko, 13 people were injured in Kyiv, including a pregnant woman. Apartment buildings caught fire in multiple Kyiv districts, he said. Oleksandr Senkevich, the mayor of Mykolaiv, said the attack had stripped roofs of 20 houses and damaged gas and water pipes in the port city, killing one man. In Kharkiv, in northeastern Ukraine, a 52-year-old woman was slightly injured in an S-300 missile attack, according to the regional governor, Oleh Syniehubov. Missiles hit as far away as the Lviv region of western Ukraine, where a fire broke out, officials said. The attacks in Kyiv sent Josep Borrell, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, into an air raid shelter in his hotel, the AFP news agency reported. Borrell is visiting to underline the bloc’s “unwavering support” to Ukraine as the war nears its third year. All 27 EU countries agreed on an additional50-billion-euro($54bn) aid package for Ukraine last week. Western help is desperately needed by Ukraine, which is struggling with ammunition and personnel shortages. Though the roughly 1,500km (900-mile) front line has barely budged in recent months, Russian forces have the upper hand in stocks of missiles and artillery ammunition used for long-range strikes. The latest barrage follows a pattern of attacks targeting civilians and critical infrastructure. Vadym Filashkin, the governor of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, said Russia was firing between 1,500 and 2,500 shells and missiles at the area every day. He said Russia had dropped 200 guided aerial bombs on the front-line town of Avdiivka over the past month and was “totally destroying it”. The town’s population has dropped from 32,000 before the war to fewer than 1,000, according to local officials.

US House rejects Israel-only bill; Ukraine-Israel-border bill shaky,Republicans harden positions as probable presidential candidate Donald Trump increases pressure.,"The United States House of Representatives has rejected a Republican-led bill to provide $17.6bn in assistance to Israel as a wider bipartisan bill that would also help Ukraine and ensure more money for border security looked to be in trouble as well. The Tuesday vote on the Israel bill, which needed a two-thirds majority to advance, was largely along party lines. Aid for Israel – one of the largest recipients of US foreign aid – has traditionally received strong bipartisan support. However, the bill’s opponents said it was a Republican ploy to distract from their opposition to the$118bn Senate billcombining an overhaul of US immigration policy and new funding for border security – measures Republicans had demanded – with billions of dollars in emergency aid for Ukraine, Israel and partners in the Asia Pacific. House Democratic leaders called the Israel bill a “nakedly obvious and cynical attempt” to undermine the larger package, hammered out at the weekend after months of negotiations by a bipartisan group of senators. Support for that bill has dwindled among Republicans with former President Donald Trump – who is likely to be the Republican candidate for November’s presidential election – pressuring them to avoid handing President Joe Biden, his probable Democrat rival, a legislative victory ahead of the poll. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said the Senate bill was “dead on arrival” in the chamber even before it was introduced. Senate Republican leaders said on Tuesday they did not think the measure would receive enough votes to pass. “It looks to me and to most of our members that we have no real chance here to make a law,” Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters. Biden, who supports the Senate bill, had promised to veto the House’s Israel-only measure if it were passed. On Tuesday, he urged lawmakers to back the wider bill, saying the clock was “ticking” for Ukraine two years since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered afull-scale invasionof his country’s neighbour. He called on them to “show some spine” and stand up to Trump. Out of funds, the Pentagon is sending no more arms shipments to Kyiv even as Ukraine is struggling with ammunition and personnel shortages as Russia mounts relentless attacks. “Every week, every month that passes without new aid to Ukraine means fewer artillery shells, fewer air defence systems, fewer tools for Ukraine to defend itself against this Russian onslaught,” Biden said. “We can’t walk away now. That’s what Putin’s betting on,” Biden said. “Supporting this bill is standing up to Putin. Opposing this bill is playing into his hands.” The immigration portion of the legislation, Biden added, included the “toughest set of reforms to secure the border ever”. The Israel bill’s supporters insisted it was not a political stunt, saying it was important to move quickly to support the country, which launched anoffensive on Gazaafter members of the Hamas armed group launched an unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people and taking dozens captive. At least 27,585 Palestinians have been killed in theIsraeli onslaught, with thousands more injured. “This bill simply provides necessary resources to our closest ally in the region and our own military,” said Republican Ken Calvert, who introduced the measure. Some Democrats also condemned the House bill for failing to provide humanitarian assistance for Palestinian civilians. Members of Congress have been struggling for months to reach an agreement on sending security assistance overseas, particularly to Ukraine. Biden has twice sent Congress requests for emergency spending bills, most recently in October. The Republican-majority House passed an Israel-only bill in November but it was never taken up in the Democratic-led Senate. Negotiators had worked on Biden’s request for a broader emergency security package and Republican demands that any security assistance be combined with changes in immigration policy and security at the border with Mexico. The failed Israel House vote was the second in quick succession for Johnson’s Republican majority on Tuesday. It came immediately after the chamber voted against impeaching Biden’s top border official, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/7/us-republican-led-israel-only-bill-fails-ukraine-israel-border-bill-shaky

Russian court orders arrest of novelist Boris Akunin,The 67-year-old was charged in December with ‘justifying terrorism’ after expressing support for Ukraine in a prank call made to him.,"A Moscow court has ordered the arrest in absentia of best-selling detective writerBoris Akuninas part of an ongoing crackdown on critics of itswar in Ukraine. Moscow’s Basmanny District Court ordered the arrest of Akunin, the pen name of Grigory Chkhartishvili, on Tuesday. The 67-year-old was charged in December with “justifying terrorism” after expressing support for Ukraine in a prank call staged by pro-Kremlin activists. Akunin, who currently resides in London, is to be detained and taken into custody if he sets foot in Russia. The pranksters, known as Vovan and Lexus, posed as Ukrainian officials in their call last December, one of them pretending to be Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. A criminal case was opened against Akunin for “discrediting the army” — specifically for “justifying terrorism” and spreading “fake news” about the Russian military. Moscow made disparagement of its military illegal weeks after launching its full-scale assault on Ukraine in February 2022, and has detained thousands of people for criticising the war. Many prominent cultural figures have since fled the country. Akunin, best known for his historical detective novels, is one of Russia’s most widely read contemporary authors. A long-standing critic of the Kremlin, he denounced Moscow’s assault on Ukraine as “absurd” shortly after the offensive began in February 2022. Prior to this, he had already been labelled a “foreign agent” by Moscow. One of Russia’s leading publishers, AST, responded by announcing it was suspending the printing and sale of Akunin’s books. In an online statement, Akunin described his publisher’s move as “an important milestone”, saying that Russian writers had not been accused of terrorism since Soviet leader Josef Stalin’s purges.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/6/russian-court-orders-arrest-of-novelist-boris-akunin

Hungary’s ruling party boycotts parliament session on Sweden’s NATO bid,Hungary is the only NATO member yet to approve Sweden’s accession to the military alliance.,"Lawmakers from Hungary’s ruling party have boycotted an emergency parliament session in which a vote on Sweden’s bid to join NATO was on the agenda. At Monday’s session, which was supported by six opposition parties, Fidesz lawmakers didn’t attend, scuttling the attempt to place a vote on the National Assembly’s schedule. Turkey’s parliamentvotedto approve Sweden’s accession in January, making Hungary the last of the world’s largest military alliance’s 31 members not to do so. Sweden had pursued a policy of military non-alignment since the Cold War. However,Russia’s full-scale invasionof its neighbour Ukraine in 2022 caused upheaval in geopolitical calculations, and Stockholm applied to become a NATO member that same year. Hungary has maintained close ties with Russia since its invasion of Ukraine, and while it has said it supports the Swedish bid in principle, Budapest has been dragging its feet for months. Prime Minister Viktor Orban told NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg last month that he would urge his Fidesz party to ratify the bid “at the first possible opportunity”. On Friday, the United States embassy reminded Orban in a statement that he promised to act “at the first opportunity” and “Monday’s session provides him with one”. Several ambassadors from NATO member countries attended Monday’s proceedings, including US Ambassador David Pressman. In brief comments to the media after the session, Pressman said the US looks forward to “watching this closely and to Hungary acting expeditiously”. “Sweden’s NATO accession is an issue that directly affects the United States’s national security and affects the security of our alliance as a whole,” he said, reminding Orban of his pledge. Orban is delaying the vote due to his “personal vanity”, Agnes Vadai from the biggest opposition party told the Agence France-Presse news agency. She accused the prime minister of seeking to “make headlines in the international press while making a gesture to Russian President Vladimir Putin by undermining the unity of NATO and the EU”. In a separate statement, US senator Ben Cardin, a Maryland Democrat and chairperson of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, raised the prospect of imposing sanctions on Hungary for its conduct and called Orban “the least reliable member of NATO”. Hungarian officials have indicated that Fidesz lawmakers won’t support holding a vote on Sweden’s NATO bid until Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson accepts an invitation by Orban to visit Budapest to negotiate the matter. Kristerssonsaid he will make the trip but only after Hungary approves his country’s NATO membership. Fidesz said in a statement on Monday that ratification of Sweden’s NATO accession can take place during a regular session of parliament, “but we are expecting the Swedish prime minister to visit Hungary first.” “If this is an important issue for the Swedes, the Swedish prime minister will obviously come to Budapest,” the party said. Hungary’s National Assembly is scheduled to reconvene on February 26, and ratification could take place quickly once it has received Orban’s approval.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/5/hungarys-ruling-party-boycotts-parliament-session-on-swedens-nato-bid
Ukraine’s president confirms plans for military shake-up,Speculation over the future of army chief Valery Zaluzhny has been rife as war’s second anniversary nears.,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he plans to reshuffle Ukraine’s military and political leadership. The comments, on Italian RAI TV in an interview broadcast late on Sunday, follow weeks of speculation that Zelenskyy intends to dismissValery Zaluzhny, commander-in-chief of Ukraine’s military. “A reset, a new beginning is necessary” and it is “not about a single person but about the direction of the country’s leadership”, Zelenskyy said. “I’m thinking about this replacement,” he said, “but you can’t say here we replaced a single person.” Zaluzhny, who was appointed by Zelenskyy months before Russia invaded in February 2022, is popular with troops and the wider population. He has denied speculation that he has political ambitions. He and the president have been at odds for some time over the conduct of the war, as the country grapples with low ammunition, personnel shortages after a failed counteroffensive, and the need for more troops. Zelenskyy sought to downplay the implications during his comments on the reshuffle. “When we talk about this, I mean a replacement of a series of state leaders, not just in a single sector like the military,” he said. “If we want to win, we must all push in the same direction, convinced of victory; we cannot be discouraged, let our arms fall; we must have the right positive energy,” the president continued as he spoke of Kyiv’s struggle to oust Russian forces following the 2014 annexation of Crimea, the occupation of parts of the Donbas, and the invasion of February 2022. Ukrainian news outlet Ukrainska Pravda reported the same day that Zelenskyy is also considering removing General Staff Chief Serhii Shaptala. Zaluzhny, meanwhile, congratulated Shaptala on his birthday and posted a picture of them together on Facebook. Speculation has gripped Ukraine for weeks over Zaluzhny’s position and relationship with the president as the war against the Russian invasion nears its second anniversary. At the end of last year, Zelenskyy said he had rejected a request by the military to mobilise up to 500,000 people and demanded to know how it would be organised and paid for. Tensions between the two men were also publicised last year after the general told The Economist in an interview that the war had entered a stalemate. The claim earned a furious denial from Zelenskyy. Unconfirmed media reports last week said that the general had refused a presidential request for his resignation. Oleksandr Syrsky, commander of land forces, and Kyrylo Budanov, head of the Ukrainian defence ministry’s intelligence directorate, are the two leading candidates to replace Zaluzhny as commander-in-chief, according to speculation.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/5/ukraines-president-confirms-plans-for-military-shake-up
Russian authorities cast doubt on antiwar hopeful’s election bid,Russian officials accused Boris Nadezhdin to have submitted invalid signatures to run against President Putin in March.,"The  Central Election Commission (CEC) of Russia has found flaws in documents backing Boris Nadezhdin’s bid to run in next month’s presidential vote, he has said. The CEC informed the aspiring antiwar candidate on Monday that it had found 15 percent of the signatures hesubmitted to access the electoral raceto be invalid, Nadezhdin said. The commission could now block his bid to enter the election. The municipal councillor, a prominent critic of President Vladimir Putin, has caught the attention of Russia’s small opposition forces with promises to end thewar in Ukraine. He has virtually no chance of unseating Putin, but it is thought that authorities would not welcome a candidate who would introduce antiwar rhetoric in the race for the March 15 election. Nadezhdin, running on the ticket of the small centre-right Civic Initiative party, last week submitted the 100,000 signatures required to register. However, the CEC does not tolerate more than a 5 percent error. “The CEC working group reported 15 percent of defects in the signatures that I have submitted on January 31,” Nadezhdin said on his Telegram channel. Such a level of invalid signatures would provide grounds for the CEC to disqualify him from running. “If the Central Electoral Commission refuses to register me I will appeal the decision to the Supreme Court,” Nadezhdin said. The CEC’s final ruling on the matter is expected on Wednesday, a spokesperson for Nadezhdin said. Putin will be running as an independent, rather than as the candidate of the governing United Russia party, meaning he needs 300,000 signatures to support his candidacy. He has already collected more than 3.5 million, according to his supporters. It is thought virtually certain that Putin will win re-election to extend his rule over Russia for at least another six years.    Officials had already expressed doubt over the validity of 60-year-old Nadezhdin’s bid on Friday. “When we see dozens of people who are no longer on this earth and they add a signature, that poses questions about the ethical standards being used … including by the person collecting them,” Nikolay Bulayev, CEC’s deputy chairman, said. Nadezhdin denied the accusations, posting photographs on Telegram of people queueing to submit signatures. Nobody expects Nadezhdin to win even if he is allowed to participate, given Putin’s long dominance and control of the state. The Kremlin chief is almost certain to win his fifth term as president, extending his 24-year leadership of Russia, including eight years as prime minister. But Nadezhdin’s campaign has captured people’s attention because of his strong opposition to what the Kremlin calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine. He says Putin made a “fatal mistake” by launching the conflict and has pledged to end it via negotiation. Nadezhdin – born in Soviet-ruled Uzbekistan to a Jewish mother who was a music teacher and a physicist father – has spent the last 30 years in Russian politics, working as a councillor in the town of Dolgoprudny outside Moscow. His bid raises the question of just how far the Kremlin would let him go at a time when speaking out against the conflict is politically fraught, often landing critics in prison. Putin has not allowed real electoral opposition in his 24-year rule, with rivals such as opposition leaderAlexey Navalnybehind bars. Navalny’s wife Yuliya signed her name in support of Nadezhdin in a symbolic photo posted by the jailed critic’s ally.

Russia says at least 28 killed in Ukraine shelling of bakery in Lysychansk,Russia says at least 28 people were killed after Ukrainian forces shelled a bakery in Lysychansk city.,"Russia says at least 28 people have been killed after Ukrainian forces shelled a bakery in the city of Lysychansk in the occupied eastern region of Luhansk, with the Ministry of Civil Defence, Emergencies and Disaster Relief saying at least one child was among the deceased. Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Maria Zakharova said on Sunday that “dozens of civilians” were inside the building when Ukraine hit it using the US-supplied High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS). The Emergencies Ministry had released a video late on Saturday of first responders finding dead bodies and taking away bloodied people on stretchers out of the ruins of the one-storey building that appeared to be destroyed. The building appeared to have housed a restaurant named Adriatic, which local authorities said was known to offer fresh bread during the weekends, attracting many Russians. Foreign Ministry’s Zakharova also said Moscow expects “quick and unconditional condemnation” from international organisations. Ukraine has not officially commented on the incident. Almost two years into the war, the front in eastern Ukraine where Luhansk is located has barely moved in months, but battles continue to rage, with both sides launching deadly attacks during the winter. Lysychansk had a population of about 110,000 before Moscow’s offensive. The city fell to Russian forces after a deadly battle in 2022.

People detained at Russia protest calling for troops to return from Ukraine,Reports say journalists were briefly held at protest by wives of Russian soldiers calling for their return from Ukraine.,"About two dozen people, mostly journalists, were briefly detained at a protest in central Moscow, as wives and other relatives of Russian servicemen mobilised to fight in Ukraine called for their return, according to media reports. The soldiers’ relatives gathered on Saturday to lay flowers at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, just outside the Kremlin walls. They marked 500 days since Russian President Vladimir Putin in September 2022 ordered a “partial mobilisation” of up to 300,000 reservists in Moscow’s war against Ukraine. The call-up was widely unpopular and wives and relatives of some of the reservists have campaigned for them to be discharged and replaced with contract soldiers. Saturday’s demonstration was organised by one such campaign group, The Way Home, that on Friday posted on Telegram calling on “wives, mothers, sisters and children” of reservists from across Russia to come to Moscow to “demonstrate [their] unity”. “We want our husbands back alive,” one of the protesters, who only gave her name as Antonina for fear of reprisals, is heard saying in a video published by independent Russian news outlet SOTAvision. Antonina insisted she does not want compensation from the Russian government if her husband is killed, and said she would instead “either go to a convent or follow him”.    Saturday’s demonstration was the ninth and largest of similar weekly gatherings organised by The Way Home. One popular Russian Telegram news channel estimated that some 200 people turned out. The Reuters news agency reported that about 20 people were detained and then released at the protest, including a Reuters journalist who was covering the story and an AFP video journalist. According to OVD-Info, an independent website that monitors political arrests in Russia, police detained 27 people during the protest, mostly journalists. Police had detained the group of Russian and foreign reporters – all men – outside Red Square and took them to a police station. According to SOTA, most were later released, although a male protester was still in detention on Saturday evening. Additionally, a number of people were also detained at other locations in central Moscow, also protesting against the mobilisation, OVD-Info said. Allies of jailed Kremlin foe Alexey Navalny and Russian opposition politician Maksim Kats voiced support for the protest on Friday, while the Moscow prosecutor’s office early on Saturday warned Russians not to participate in “unauthorised mass events”.    Calls from wives and relatives to bring mobilised Russian reservists home have been ignored by the state-controlled media, and some pro-Kremlin politicians have sought to cast them as Western stooges. Protesters on Saturday angrily rejected the accusation. Maria Andreyeva, whose husband and brother are fighting in Ukraine, told SOTAvision that she saw the fighting in Ukraine as “a great tragedy that happened between two brotherly peoples”. “Almost every Russian has relatives in Ukraine, close and distant, so … this is a situation that has struck us to the core. After the second world war, it seemed to us that our grandfathers died so that there would never be another [conflict],” Andreyeva said. Saturday’s protest came weeks before the Russian presidential election, scheduled to take place in March, that Putin is all but assured to win. After Andreyeva and others laid flowers at the monument, they headed to Putin’s campaign headquarters to present their demands to him. Last month, another Russian presidential hopeful met with Andreyeva and other soldiers’ relatives campaigning for their return. Former local legislator Boris Nadezhdin, who openly opposes the war in Ukraine, criticised the Kremlin’s decision to keep them in the ranks as long as the fighting continues. “We want [the authorities] to treat people who are doing their duty in a decent way,” Nadezhdin said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/3/people-detained-at-russia-protest-calling-for-troops-to-return-from-ukraine

ICJ rules that it will hear part of Ukraine-Russia genocide case,UN’s top court will not address aspects of case accusing Russia of violating Genocide Convention by falsely alleging genocide.,"The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has ruled that parts of Ukraine’s case against Russia arguing that Moscow baselessly accused Kyiv of genocide to justify the 2022 invasion can move forward. However, the ICJ ruled on Friday that it will not addresswhether Russiaviolated the 1948 Genocide Convention by using what Ukraine says were trumped-up genocide charges as a pretext for the war, even if the invasion may have violated international law broadly. Instead, the case will proceed to assess whether Ukraine committed genocide in the eastern parts of the country, as Russia claims – a matter where judges ruled that they have jurisdiction. When Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion on February 24, 2022, part of his argument was that pro-Russian people in eastern Ukraine had been “subjected to bullying and genocide by the Kyiv regime”. Ukraine filed a suit at the ICJ, “emphatically denying” this and arguing that Russia’s use of “genocide” as a pretext for invasion went against the Genocide Convention. “In the present case, even if the Russian Federation had, in bad faith, alleged that Ukraine committed genocide and taken certain measures against it under such a pretext, which the respondent [Ukraine] contends, this would not in itself constitute a violation of obligations” under the genocide convention, the ICJ said in the ruling read out by its president, Joan Donoghue on Friday. The ICJ, known asthe World Court, said it did not have jurisdiction to rule on whether Russia’s invasion violated the Genocide Convention, or on whether Moscow’s recognition of Donetsk and Luhansk, two breakaway republics in eastern Ukraine, amounted to a breach of the convention. But the judges said they would allow Ukraine’s request for the court to rule that there was no “credible evidence that Ukraine is committing genocide in violation of the Genocide Convention” in eastern Ukraine. Kyiv is seeking a declaration from the ICJ that it did not commit genocide. A final, legally binding decision is likely still years away.    Before Russia’s all-outinvasion of Ukrainein 2022, Ukraine had been battling Russian-backed separatist forces in the east of the country since 2014. But Kyiv insists that there was no risk of genocide there. As well as citing an alleged “genocide” against the Russian-speaking residents of Donetsk and Luhansk to justify its invasion, Moscow also invoked NATO’s eastwardexpansionas one of the reasons behind the conflict. Triestino Mariniello, a law professor at Liverpool John Moores University, said Friday’s ruling is important because it moves the case to the merits stage. “It has confirmed that there is a dispute between Russia and Ukraine in relation to the application, interpretation and fulfilment of the Genocide Convention, and that the court has jurisdiction in particular in establishing in the merits case that Ukraine has not committed genocide in this specific areas of Luhansk and Donetsk in Ukrainian territory,” Mariniello told Al Jazeera. Last month, the ICJ dismissedlarge partsof a Ukraine petition accusing Russia of “terrorism”. In March 2022, shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine, the UN’s top court ordered Moscow to halt its military offensive. But while the court’s decisions are legally binding, it lacks an enforcement mechanism. “It’s upon individual states – in this case Russia – or international organisations like the [UN] Security Council to implement such decisions or judgements,” Mariniello said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/2/icj-rules-that-it-will-hear-part-of-ukraine-russia-genocide-case
"Russia, Ukraine clash over bodies of military plane crash victims","There has been no official confirmation on who downed the plane, but Russia accuses Ukraine.","Russia and Ukraine are locked in a dispute about the bodies of people killed in the crash of a Russian military transport plane who Moscow says were Ukrainian prisoners of war. A Ukrainian intelligence official said in televised remarks late on Thursday that Kyiv has urged Moscow to hand over the bodies of those killed in theJanuary 24 crash, which Russia has blamed on Ukraine. He said Moscow has refused. Andrii Yusov, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s military intelligence, reiterated Kyiv’scall for an international investigationinto the crash over the Russian region of Belgorod to determine whether the cargo plane carried weapons or passengers along with the crew. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the state RIA Novosti news agency on Friday that the Kremlin hadn’t received a Ukrainian request to hand over the bodies. Russia would not only welcome but also “insist” on an international inquiry into the plane’s downing,Putin saidthis week as he described the crash as a “crime” by Ukraine. Ukraine has neither confirmed nor denied that its forces downed the Ilyushin Il-76 plane that Russia says was carrying 65 Ukrainian POWs. Russia’s claim about the prisoners couldn’t be independently verified. Russia’s Investigative Committee, its main state criminal investigation agency, said the plane was brought down by the US-made Patriot missile defence system, which Western allies have supplied to Kyiv for thewar against Russia. The committee said it has recovered 116 fragments of two missiles that were fired from a Patriot system near the village of Lyptsi in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region, which sits on the other side of the border from Belgorod. It had a video that purported to show some missile fragments lying in the snow with markings said to prove their origin. It also said it has identified all the crash victims. Russian officials said there were 74 people on board – 65 Ukrainian POWs, six crew members and three Russian servicemen – all of whom were killed. Despite the crash, the two countriescompleted a prisoner exchangeon Wednesday, each swapping 195 POWs. The war between Russia and Ukraine, which is nearing its two-year mark, continues to rage, with Russia carrying out long-range strikes on Ukraine with missiles and drones. Ukraine on Thursday said it used sea drones toattack and destroy a Russian warshipin the Black Sea near the Russian-annexed Crimean Peninsula. In Kryvyi Rih, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s hometown, a drone strike damaged an energy facility, leaving 100,000 recipients without electricity and 113 coal miners stranded underground in two mines. Oleksandr Vilkul, the head of the central city’s defence council, said all the miners were brought to safety after power was partially restored.

What do Ukrainian refugees make of Israel’s war on Gaza?,"While some who have fled Russia’s invasion side with Israel, others say the conflict is more complex than they thought.","Glasgow, United Kingdom –Civilians have been bombed, killed and injured in their thousands. Infrastructure has been shelled – and millions displaced. Today, these images of conflict evoke Gaza, but 120 days ago were more associated with Ukraine following the Russian invasion of the former Soviet republic in February 2022. For months, the millions of Ukrainians forced to flee their homes for countries across Europe have championed the cause of their besieged nation-state from afar. However, after the deadly Hamas attack on southern Israel on October 7 last year, and the brutal campaign of Israeli air strikes that followed and has killed 27,000 Palestinians, some Ukrainian refugees fear that Kyiv’s struggle against Vladimir Putin’s Russia – once the Western world’s primary focus – has been overshadowed. “The support for Ukraine and the attention from the media and people regarding the war in Ukraine is losing momentum, which saddens me and all Ukrainian citizens,” said Ukrainian refugee Maria Pankova, who lives in Scotland. “For instance, my Scottish friends, who never shared fundraisers or news on social media to support Ukraine, are now actively doing so to support Gaza.” More than 250,000 UK visas have been issued to Ukrainian refugees since the start of the conflict in Eastern Europe. Scattered across Britain’s four constituent nations of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, most have taken solace in their host country’s political support for Ukraine. But despite Thursday’s agreement by the European Union to supply Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy with a 50-billion-euro ($54bn) aid package, many refugees share Pankova’s fear that, with another major conflict vying for global attention, Ukraine’s push to repel and ultimately defeat Russia has got much harder. “As a Ukrainian, I think a lot about the amount of [international] resources and attention which are now divided in two directions,” said Yana, who withheld her surname. Yana’s greatest fear is that more global instability could lead to the eruption of another world war. She lives in southeast England having fled in May 2022 with her son, who she said suffers from mental anguish following the Russian invasion. The idea that Israel’s onslaught on Gaza has muddied Western efforts to support Ukraine has also been raised by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who relies heavily on military aid from the West, most notably from the United States. Quick to condemn the Hamas attack on Israel in October, he has said competing with a fresh war in the Middle East for international attention was detrimental to his cause. In December, he lamented the distracting nature of the Israeli offensive: “You see, attention equals help. No attention will mean no help. We fight for every bit of attention.” At the end of last year, the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) published a poll on Israel’s war on Gaza, which indicated that 69 percent of Ukrainians sided with Israel over the Palestinians. Iliya Kusa, a Kyiv-based author and analyst of international relations with the Ukrainian Institute for the Future,wrotelast year that for most Ukrainians, the Arab world is seen as “something distant and foreign” while there are many sociocultural and business ties between Ukraine and Israel. “Israel is broadly seen as a good example of a state that has successfully repelled attacks from aggressors for decades and at the same time is prosperous and technologically advanced: everything that Ukrainians would like their own country to be,” he wrote. Olena Hich, now in England after fleeing Ukraine with her daughter nearly two years ago, told Al Jazeera that her sympathy lay with Israel. “War is always bad for both sides. Most civilians are innocent, but Hamas is a terrorist [group] that needs to be destroyed and Israel has the right to defend its territory and its people,” said Hich, who is from Zaporizhzhia, southeastern Ukraine. Yana explained that she also feels more affinity with Israel and said that, growing up in Ukraine, she was not exposed to any information about Palestine. Other Ukrainian refugees in the United Kingdom have, however, taken time to examine Israel’s war on Gaza in more detail. Masters graduates Anastasiia and Vadym live in the Scottish capital, Edinburgh. The couple, from the port city of Odesa, spoke of their shock after learning of the Hamas attack on Israel, during which 1,139 people were killed – but later explored the context of the assault. “In less than a month, and when we saw what was happening in Gaza, we thought, ‘Okay, this is not black and white at all’,” Anastasiia said. Vadym said “it was crucial to highlight the deaths of civilians” in the Palestinian enclave, despite his main focus being on the fortunes of his own native land. Despite the International Court of Justice in The Hague last month ordering Israel to take “all measures within its power” to prevent genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, the devastation wreaked on the enclave by the US-supplied Israeli military continues unabated. “We Ukrainians were not ready for [our war], although our hidden conflict with Russia has lasted for centuries,” Irina Tyazhkorob, another Ukrainian refugee living in England, told Al Jazeera. “Our only difference is that the people of Gaza lived with the expectation of open confrontation, and probably could have foreseen it.  Although, to be honest, no one can be mentally prepared for war.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/2/ukrainian-refugees-divided-on-israels-war-on-gaza-but-feel-for-civilians
Ukraine says ‘destroyed’ Russian ship in underwater drone attack off Crimea,Military intelligence releases nighttime video showing sinking of ship it said was the missile boat Ivanovets.,"Ukraine has said it used sea drones to attack and destroy a Russian warship in the Black Sea near the Russian-annexed Crimean peninsula. The military intelligence agency, known by its Ukrainian acronym GUR, published a video on Thursday that it said depicted a naval drone attack on the missile-armed corvette Ivanovets the night before. The grainy footage, running about 2 and a half minutes and accompanied by a dramatic soundtrack, showed a number of explosions, and the ship eventually listing to one side. It ended with the vessel sinking stern-first into the sea. “As a result of a number of direct hits to the hull, the Russian ship suffered damage incompatible with further movement,” the intelligence agency said in a statement accompanying the video, apparently made up of live feeds from the drones. #працюєГУР 🔥 «Івановєц» на дні ― внаслідок спецоперації ГУР МО знищено ракетний корабель ворога 🔗https://t.co/b8MQb3KJrkpic.twitter.com/Tu6uuaF2rt — Defence intelligence of Ukraine (@DI_Ukraine)February 1, 2024 The GUR said the attack had been carried out by its Group 13 unit and took place while the Ivanovets was on patrol on Lake Donuzlav in western Crimea. The lake was connected to the Black Sea by a channel in 1961. There was no official response from Russia whose Black Sea Fleet has come under attack by Ukraine before, most notably with thesinkingof the flagship Moskva in April 2022. On that occasion, Moscow eventually acknowledged the loss of the ship and said the Moskva sank as it was being towed to port after “detonation of ammunition” caused a fire. Ukraine said it had sunk the Soviet-era ship with a cruise missile, and the United States backed up the claim. It was not possible to verify the sinking of the Ivanovets, but Russian military bloggers reported the area had come under attack from naval drones during the night, and that the Ivanovets had been hit. Disinformation has become a key feature of thewar, which marks its second anniversary on February 24, and it was not possible to independently verify the footage or claims. The private security firm Ambrey said Ukraine has used up to six sea drones, each of which usually carry 300 kilogrammes (660 pounds) of explosives, in the attack. A Western official also backed the Ukrainian account, telling the Associated Press news agency that it was “highly likely that uncrewed surface vessels were responsible for the strike on the Ivanovets”. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence. The Ukrainian navy said the loss of the Ivanovets, thought to have a crew of about 40 sailors, would be “significant” because Russia has only three ships of the same class in its Black Sea Fleet. Crimea, which was invaded and annexed by Moscow in 2014, has come under increasing attack by Ukrainian drones and missiles. On Thursday, Russia said it had destroyed 20 Ukrainian missiles over the area.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/2/ukraine-says-destroyed-russian-ship-in-underwater-drone-attack-off-crimea

"In a sign of commitment, EU unlocks aid for Ukraine as it fights off Russia","The deal will help Ukraine cover its massive wartime deficit, but experts question what concessions were made to assure its passage.","European Union leaders have overcome objections fromHungaryto approve a50 billion euro ($54bn) planto support Ukraine for the next four years. The unanimous decision came on Thursday, as Ukrainecontinues its struggleto repel a full-scale Russian invasion that began nearly two years ago. Lawmakers and experts hailed the deal as an important buttress for the continued stability of the war-torn Eastern European country, whose economy is heavily reliant on Western aid. “The EU showed commitment to the continuous support of Ukraine under difficult geopolitical and internal circumstances … and despite alleged public impatience with this support,” European Institute lecturer George Tzogopoulos told Al Jazeera. Thursday’s deal, known as the “Ukraine Facility“, consists of 17 billion euros ($18.5bn) in grants and 33 billion euros ($35.8bn) in loans, designed to help Ukraine rebuild and recover from the war. The funding is also expected to help Ukraine make reforms on its path to eventual EU membership. EU leaders officially invited Ukraine to become amemberin December, but around the same time,Hungary vetoed the aid package, saying Ukraine funding should not be grafted onto the EU multi-annual budget. The aid’s eventual passage on Thursday was met with cheers fromUkrainian officials. Deputy Prime Minister Yuliya Svyrydenko wrote on Facebook that, with the funding, Ukraine had “come one step closer to economic stability for the next four years”. Ukraine faces a $43bn budget deficit this year and expects the EU aid will cover just under half of it. EU leaders, meanwhile, hailed the aid package asa means of ensuring stabilityand democracy in Eastern Europe. “This locks in steadfast, long-term, predictable funding forUkraine. EU is taking leadership & responsibility in support for Ukraine; we know what is at stake,” European Council President Charles Michelwroteon the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen likewisecalledit “a good day for Europe”. Thursday’s agreement also marked a moment of relative unity for EU members, some of whom, like the Baltic states, are rearming againstRussia. Others, like Italy, have been more wary of alienating Russia. “The EU stands behind you long-term, until victory,”wroteEstonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas. “Ukraine’s security is Europe’s security,” Italian prime minister Roberta Metsolaechoedon social media. Leaders also agreed on an addition to the EU budget of two billion euros ($2.17bn) for border security, 7.6 billion euros ($8.26bn) for regional aid and 1.5 billion euros ($1.6bn) for the European Defence Fund, an initiative to ensure cooperation among member countries’ armed forces. Key aspects of the Ukraine aid deal, however, remained murky. It was not clear if EU leaders had also approved a separate military aid fund for Ukraine worth 20 billion euros ($21.7bn), proposed last July. Nor was it clear if they would move forward with the five billion euros ($5.43bn) in military aid proposed by Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign policy chief. Questions also linger over what concessions were made to Hungary in order to lift its veto of the Ukraine funding package. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has consistently questioned the continued support for Ukraine, downplaying the threat Russia poses and calling for an annual review of any expenditures. “We need to closely monitor the details of the compromise because the EU does not need to show that it accepted Orban’s demands, given how sensitive an issue the rule of law remains,” Tzogopoulos, the European Institute lecturer, said. Hungary was indeed offered some concessions in exchange for its support, in the form of an opportunity to veto the spending deal next year if Ukraine fails to live up to its conditions. Those conditions require Ukraine to uphold “effective democratic mechanisms”, such as multi-party parliamentary democracy, the rule of law and respect for minorities. In the days leading up to Thursday’s deal, though, tensions between Hungary and EU leaders had reached a boiling point. Earlier this week, media reports emerged that the European Commission threatened to “sabotage” Hungary’s economy if it persisted in vetoing Ukraine aid. There has also been backlash against what critics consider Hungary’s democratic backsliding. EU leaders hadsuspended20 billion euros ($21.7bn) in support funds to Hungary over concerns about media freedom and the rule of law in Hungary. They also suspended 10 billion euros ($10.8bn) due to concerns about judicial independence, but released those last December. The European Parliament wants EU leaders to reconsider that decision. The impasse over Ukraine funding has been further exacerbated by ethnic tensions with Hungary, its neighbour to the west. An estimated 150,000 ethnic Hungarians live in western Ukraine. But in 2017 and 2019, Ukraine passed laws forbidding the teaching of minority languages in schools and their use in local government, leading to outcry in the Hungarian community. “It was, of course, directed against the Russian language but … all minorities suffered,” Katalin Miklossy, an expert on Eastern Europe at the University of Helsinki, told Al Jazeera. Hungarian Prime Minister Orban decried the measures as impinging on Hungarian rights in Ukraine, a factor that contributed to his decision to veto military aid for the country. For its part, Ukraine attempted to quell any concerns with reforms to the laws, as it sought membership in the EU. “Ukraine in 2023 backed off the minority laws as a favour to Hungary, to facilitate its application to the EU,” said Miklossy. “They reframed the law so that it was again possible to study minority rights in schools.” Romania also protested the language laws: More than 100,000 ethnic Romanians live in Ukraine. But experts say that Romania’s overall reaction to Ukraine has served as a counterpoint to Hungary’s. It has been a major export route for Ukrainian grain, both by sea and through the Danube River. Whereas Hungary has refused to contribute weapons or allow Ukrainian forces to pass through its territory, Romania has sent arms to Ukraine and been a conduit. Hungary has long been considered a fly in the ointment for EU foreign policy. In early 2003, for instance — shortly after it secured EU membership — it publicly backed the US’s war in Iraq, breaking from EU consensus at the time. Individual EU members retain the right to veto budgetary and foreign policy decisions, which require unanimity. Attempts to introduce qualified majority voting failed at an EU summit in 2002, as well as in French and Dutch referendums in 2005. Hungary’s decision, however, to ultimately lift its veto on Thursday has come at a pivotal time for Ukraine. The country is nearing the second anniversary of Russia’s invasion on February 24. In the first year of the invasion alone, Ukraine’s gross domestic product (GDP) dropped by an estimated 30 percent — its largest decline since the country achieved independence. Experts have predicted Ukraine’s economy will rebound in the coming years, but the long slog of war has depleted its finances, making it increasingly dependent on foreign aid. The longevity of that aid, however, is far from guaranteed. While the EU successfully reached an aid deal on Thursday, the US hasstruggledto cobble together its own congressional aid package, amid staunch opposition fromRepublicans. The news of the EU funding agreement came just as Ukraine — desperate to show that Western money is helping to win its war with Russia — scored a new victory in theBlack Sea. Footage released by Ukrainian armed forces showedsurface dronesrepeatedly striking the Ivanovets, a 480-tonne missile corvette, crippling it and then destroying it completely. Video sent by drones as they approached the ship revealed gaping holes in its hull from previous attacks. The footage included a wide-angle shot of a massive explosion as missiles were fired at the Ivanovets, and a later shot captured the bow of the ship sticking out of the water, confirming it sank stern-first. Ukraine has been attacking Russia’s Black Sea Fleet since the beginning of the war, and more intensively since last year, to protect a safe corridor through which it exports grain. Agricultural goods brought Ukraine more than $23bn last year, its agriculture ministry said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/1/in-a-sign-of-commitment-eu-unlocks-aid-for-ukraine-as-it-fights-off-russia
Russian court extends detention of US journalist Kurmasheva until April,Russian-American journalist is accused of failing to register as a ‘foreign agent’ and spreading ‘false information’.,"A court in Russia has extended the pre-trial detention of Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva, who has been in custody since October. On Thursday, the court in the city of Kazan ruled thatKurmashevamust stay behind bars until April 5. The Prague-based editor has been charged with failing to register as a “foreign agent” and spreading “false information” aboutRussia’s military campaign in Ukraine, said her employer, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). Funded by the United States Congress, RFE/RL is designated by Russia as a foreign agent, a charge levelled on the basis that it receives foreign funding for activity deemed to be political. RFE/RL has reported that Kurmasheva could face a maximum combined sentence of15 yearsin prison as it has called her detention unjust and politically motivated. Kurmasheva, who has both US and Russian passports, entered Russia in May to deal with a family emergency. She was initially detained on June 2 at an airport while awaiting her return flight, and her passports were confiscated. According to court documents, the journalist was fined 10,000 roubles ($103) in October for failing to register her US passport with Russian authorities. She was subsequently slapped with the “foreign agent” charges and has been in custody since October 18. In December, a state-affiliated media outlet said Russian investigators had opened a new case against Kurmasheva, accusing her of spreading false information about the Russian army. Her husband, Pavel Butorin, who also works for RFE/RL, said that charge related to a book that she had edited. While not unexpected, today’s unmerciful ruling by Judge Sergei Aptulin of Kazan’s Sovietsky District Court to extend#Alsu’s detention for another two months stands to prove once again that the spurious criminal charges brought against my wife are merely a pretext for Russia to…pic.twitter.com/gdjcPFzlfd — Pavel Butorin (@PashaButorin)February 1, 2024  He posted on X that while Thursday’s “unmerciful” ruling was “not unexpected”, it showed that “the spurious criminal charges brought against my wife are merely a pretext for Russia to continue holding her hostage as an American”. Kurmasheva is the second US journalist to be arrested and charged in Russia since its invasion of Ukraine two years ago. Evan Gershkovich, a reporter with The Wall Street Journal, was detained in March and is awaiting trial on spying charges that he, his newspaper and the US government strongly deny. This week, a court in Moscow extended the pretrial detention of Gershkovich until the end of March, meaning the journalist will spend at least a year behind bars in Russia. Gershkovich andPaul Whelan, an American convicted of spying in 2020 and jailed in Russia for 16 years, have been designated by the US government as “wrongfully detained”. The designation means Washington considers the charges against them bogus and is committed to working for their release. Kurmasheva’s supporters have been lobbying Washington for the same status for her.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/1/russian-court-extends-detention-of-us-journalist-kurmasheva-until-april
European Union agrees on new $54bn aid package for Ukraine,Hungary previously vetoed the measure and criticised the bloc’s military support for Ukraine.,"All 27 European Union countries have agreed on an additional 50-billion-euro ($54bn) aid package for Ukraine, despite threats from Hungary to veto the move. “We have a deal,” European Council President Charles Michel said in a post on X on Thursday, just an hour into a special summit of EU leaders in Brussels. Michel said the move “locks in steadfast, long-term, predictable funding for Ukraine” and demonstrates that the “EU is taking leadership and responsibility in support for Ukraine; we know what isat stake“. We have a deal.#Unity All 27 leaders agreed on an additional €50 billion support package for Ukraine within the EU budget. This locks in steadfast, long-term, predictable funding for#Ukraine. EU is taking leadership & responsibility in support for Ukraine; we know what is… — Charles Michel (@CharlesMichel)February 1, 2024  Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the EU’s approval of the aid package would strengthen long-term economic and financial stability as the war with Russia approaches its third year. “It is very important that the decision was made by all 27 leaders, which once again proves strong EU unity,” he posted on X. Ukraine has become increasingly desperate to secure funding from Western countries in recent months, with political delays to both US and EU aid bolstering Russian confidence amid the bogged-down war. Grateful to@CharlesMicheland EU leaders for establishing the €50 billion Ukraine Facility for 2024-2027. It is very important that the decision was made by all 27 leaders, which once again proves strong EU unity. Continued EU financial support for Ukraine will strengthen… — Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa)February 1, 2024  In December, the bloc agreed on the latest aid package, which would run through to 2027, and decided to make Ukraine a candidate for EU membership, which Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban reluctantly accepted. But Orban, who has close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, was angry at the European Commission’s decision to block his government’s access to some of the bloc’s funds, which they did over concerns about possible threats to the EU budget by Hungary. In response to the lack of access, Orban vetoed several issues at the EU.    “I don’t want to use the word blackmail, but I don’t know what other better word” might fit, Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas told reporters as she arrived for Thursday’s crunch meeting. “Hungary needs Europe,” she said. “He should also look into what it is in it for Hungary, being in Europe,” added Kallas, referring to Orban. After the deal was sealed, Kallas noted that it was an “important signal to Ukraine that the EU stands behind you long-term, until victory”. Latvia’s Prime Minister Evika Silina also posted on X that the agreement was “excellent news for the security of Latvia and all of Europe”. Ukraine expects to receive the first tranche of 4.5 billion euros ($4.9bn) from the EU facility in March, the Ministry of Economy said on Thursday. Reporting from Kyiv, Al Jazeera’s Rob McBride said there was “a great sense of relief” in Ukraine after the announcement of the deal. “This guarantees funding for four years, so it gives a longer-term sense of security. There’s also a lot of talk here about some of these funds going into an investment fund to try to attract private sector investment,” he added. Orban said that he had received guarantees about billions of euros in suspended EU aid in return for lifting Hungary’s veto. “We finally negotiated a control mechanism to guarantee that the money would be used sensibly, and we received a guarantee that Hungary’s money would not end up in Ukraine” he said. Reporting from Brussels, Al Jazeera’s Natacha Butler said the EU were keen to send a message of unity. It was important for the EU “to send the message to Moscow that they are united when it comes to Ukraine, particularly in a difficult year in which we have the US elections – they know there is a lot of uncertainty ahead”, she added. The EU funding is especially significant as a similaraid package from the UScontinues to be blocked due to internal political disputes and is further complicated by the presidential election in November. “US funding to Ukraine became a hostage of domestic US politics,” Hlib Vyshlinsky, executive director of the Centre for Economic Strategy, told Al Jazeera. “It was very hard for Ukraine to do anything with it in a year of presidential elections in the United States.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/1/european-union-agrees-on-new-54bn-aid-package-for-ukraine
"Ukraine, Russia fight from the skies as Kyiv’s EU aid hangs in the balance","As a key summit focuses on aid, Russia says it will increase air defence missile production as air wars are fought over Ukraine.","The European Union is gripped by acrucial summiton Thursday that will be dominated by a second attempt to pass a 50-billion-euro ($54bn) amendment to the bloc’s budget that will help finance Ukraine over the next four years. That amendment was vetoed by Hungary at last December’s regular summit, along with 20 billion euros ($22bn) in military aid to Ukraine for 2024. The EU’s executive, the European Commission, was reportedly hoping to bring Hungary on board by offering Prime Minister Viktor Orban an opportunity to block a continuation of the support next year, when the EU would re-evaluate whether Ukraine still meets the requirements to receive the money. That tenor of conciliation changed by Sunday, when the Financial Times reported the EU also had a plan to sabotage Hungary’s economy if it refused to cooperate. Details of the plan were secret, but the EU has leverage. Its internal market buys roughly 90 percent of Hungary’s exports, and the EU is withholding 30 billion euros ($32bn) in aid to Hungary, of which it promised to release 10 billion euros ($11bn) last December in return for Orban walking out of the room where the remaining 26heads of government votedto give Ukraine and Moldova official candidate status to the EU. Orban’s political director said Hungary was ready to consider cooperating on Monday and Orban reportedly confirmed that in remarks to Le Point on Tuesday. But EU officials said a deal was still uncertain. Meanwhile, a $60bn US aid package to Ukraine remained stalled in the US Senate, where Republicans loyal to presidential hopeful Donald Trump were reportedly holding out for a deal with the administration of President Joe Biden on border security with Mexico. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said the bloc was close to agreeing to a 5-billion-euro ($5.4bn) emergency funding stopgap from its European Peace Facility. “The moment has not come to weaken our support to Ukraine … we need on the contrary to do more and faster with financial resources, with military equipment, by training soldiers,” Borrell said. The EU established the EPF in 2021 to help finance global military operations. EU aid is crucial to Ukraine, which faces a $43bn budgetdeficitthis year, and expects to cover $41bn from international aid. Ukraine said a Russian winter offensive to recapture lost territory inKharkivand Luhansk, and to complete the conquest of Donetsk, was ongoing. But most of the action was in the air – some of it focused on the line of contact as part of a Russian effort to hobble Ukraine’s defences. In a rare appearance touring defence industries, Russia’s Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said he hoped to increase the production of air defence missiles, used to intercept drones, missiles and planes. He said air defence missile production had already doubled during the Ukraine war, but that was not enough. “There are some key issues we need to address … There is the question of engines, and there is the question of the establishment of launcher production,” Shoigu said in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg. Shoigu’s comments came as Ukraine seemed to have scored a new hit against a Russian target. Geolocated footage showed a fire at the Rosneft oil refinery in Tuapse, on the east coast of the Black Sea, on January 24. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) claimed responsibility for the attack. Local residents reported several explosions, and footage showed drones had been operating in the area. The SBU has been developing long-distance surface and air drones, and used them successfully to attack Russia’s Black Sea Fleet and targets in Crimea. This year, it has focused on energy infrastructure. On January 21, it struck a Novatek gas condensate processing plant near Saint Petersburg. Russian authorities said they had downed 21 Ukrainian drones launched against Crimea on January 30.    Russia, too, continued waves of missile and drone strikes against Ukraine, which it has sharply stepped up since December 29. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia had launched 330 missiles and 600 drones this year. On January 25, Ukraine shot down 10 out of 14 Shahed drones launched by Russia. Four S-300 missiles got through. Three days later, Ukraine shot down four out of eight Shahed drones launched by Russia and a Kh-59 cruise missile. Two Iskander missiles and three S-300 missiles got through. Ukraine said it downed all eight Shahed drones launched the following day, but six S-300 missiles got through. The biggest barrage came on January 30, when Ukraine shot down 15 out of 35 drones along with two S-300 missiles. Ukraine’s military intelligence said it scored a big cyber-victory in Russia’s far east. Its cyberattack against the Russian “Planet” Scientific Research Centre of Space Hydrometeorology’s far east branch destroyed the centre’s 280 servers. Ukraine estimated it had destroyed 2 petabytes worth of “unique research developed over the years”. Ukraine’s military intelligence (GUR) said the centre received satellite data and provided information to at least 50 Russian government agencies, including the  Ministry of Defence (MoD), which in turn passed it on to defence contractors. “Dozens of strategic companies of the Russian Federation, which work for ‘defence’ and play a key role in supporting the Russian occupation forces, will remain without critically important information and services for a long time,” GUR said. GUR estimated it had done $10m of structural damage through lost servers and software, which cannot be replaced under sanctions. Russia has proven quite adept at circumventing sanctions so far. Bloomberg News cited classified Russian customs service data showing that Russia had imported $1bn worth of US and European microchips last year despite sanctions – down from $2.5bn in 2022 but still sizeable. Russia was active in the information sphere. Geolocated footage posted on January 24 showed a Russian Ilyushin-76 transport plane crashing in Belgorod, a Russian region bordering Ukraine. The Russian MoD said Ukraine had shot the plane down using two air defence missiles tracked by Russian radar, killing its six crew, three military personnel and 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war intended for an exchange. “The Ukrainian leadership knew very well that, according to established practice, today Ukrainian military personnel would be transported by military transport aircraft to the Belgorod airfield for exchange,” Russia’s MoD said. “According to the previously reached agreement, this event was to take place in the afternoon at the Kolotilovka checkpoint on the Russian-Ukrainian border.” Ukraine shot the plane down regardless, Moscow said, “pursuing the goal of blaming Russia for the destruction of the Ukrainian military”. Russian President Vladimir Putin repeated the allegations two days later. Ukraine’s military intelligence confirmed a prisoner exchange was to take place and said it was investigating the circumstances of the crash. Russia might have had a motive for an information campaign in which it accused Ukraine of “terrorism”. The top court of the United Nations, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), will rule on Friday whether Russia violated international law by invading Ukraine. Ukraine brought the case to the ICJ days after the February 2022 invasion, arguing that Russia broke international law by falsely claiming genocide against ethnic Russians living in Ukraine as a basis. Russia unsuccessfully tried to have the case thrown out. If the ICJ rules against Russia, it will be its second high-profile condemnation after convicting Putin in March last year as personally responsible for organising the kidnapping of Ukrainian children.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/1/vital-ukraine-aid-hangs-in-the-balance-as-eu-leaders-round-on-hungary
Thailand deports dissident Russian rockers to Israel,Human rights advocates warned against sending Bi-2 to Russia where they could be persecuted for opposing Ukraine war.,"Thailand has deported members of a dissident Russian-Belarusian rock band critical of Moscow’s war in Ukraine to Israel after they were detained for performing without a permit. Members ofBi-2left “safely” for Tel Aviv on Wednesday night, they said on theirFacebookpage. Human rights advocates had warned the group would face severe persecution for speaking out againstRussia’s war in Ukraineif they were sent back to Russia. Thai authorities had detained the members of Bi-2 for working at the resort island of Phuket without a permit. The fate of the band provoked an international outcry, leading Thai immigration officials to give the band the choice of being deported to another destination if they felt unsafe to return to Russia. Thailand’s National Security Council, chaired by Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin, took charge of the case on Wednesday. Several members of the self-exiled group, which had been based in Israel in the 1990s, have dual nationalities, including Israeli and Australian. Deputy Police Chief Surachate Hakparn confirmed the band had requested to be deported to Israel. The band was detained last week after they played a gig on Phuket, a southern island popular with Russian holidaymakers. Thai officials said they were held for performing without the correct work permits and transferred to an immigration detention centre in Bangkok. VPI Event, the organisers of the band’s Thailand concerts – which also included a show in Pattaya – said all the necessary permits were obtained, but the band had been issued tourist visas in error. VPI accused the Russian consulate of having waged a campaign to cancel the concerts since December and said they had faced “unprecedented pressure” as they sought the band’s release. Bi-2, which was founded in Minsk, Belarus, is popular in Russia. Russia’s Ministry of Justice labelled lead singer Yegor Bortnick a “foreign agent” after he criticised President Vladimir Putin online last year. One of the band’s founders has openly denounced the Putin government, saying it makes him feel “only disgust” and accusing the long-serving leader of having “destroyed” Russia. Several of their concerts were cancelled in 2022 after they refused to play at a venue with banners supporting the war in Ukraine, after which they left Russia. “Even though they [are] all safe, we still want Thai authorities to respect arrest procedures strictly,” human rights lawyer Pornpen Khongkachonkiet told the AFP news agency. “It could [have] happened to me, you, and others without international attention as this case got.” Phil Robertson, the deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch (HRW), said Thailand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs had recognised “the importance of upholding human rights principles” by not sending the band to “face persecution” in Russia.

ICJ rejects most of Ukraine’s ‘terrorism’ case against Russia,Kyiv had accused Moscow of being a ‘terrorist’ state and claimed it funded separatists in eastern Ukraine.,"The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has rejected much of a case filed by Ukraine that accused Russia of funding separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine a decade ago, saying only that Moscow had failed to investigate alleged breaches. Kyiv had accused Moscow of being a “terrorist state” whose support for pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine was a harbinger of thefull-fledged2022 invasion. Ukraine also wanted Russia to compensate all civilians caught up in the conflict, as well as victims from Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, which was shot down over eastern Ukraine on July 17, 2014. The top United Nations court declined to rule specifically on alleged Russian responsibility for the shooting down of the plane. The ICJ tossed out most of Ukraine’s pleas, ruling only that Russia was “failing to take measures to investigate facts … regarding persons who have allegedly committed an offence”. The court added that only cash transfers could be considered as support for alleged “terrorist” groups under the terms of the international convention on terrorism financing. This “does not include the means used to commit acts of terrorism, including weapons or training camps”, the court ruled on Wednesday. “Consequently, the alleged supply of weapons to various armed groups operating in Ukraine … fall outside the material scope of the ICSFT” convention, the ICJ said. The 16-judge panel once again ordered Russia to investigate any plausible allegations of “terrorism” financing. Russia was also in the dock for alleged breaches of an international convention on racial discrimination due to its treatment of the Tatar minority and Ukrainian speakers in occupied Crimea. Here the court found that Russia had not taken sufficient measures to enable education in Ukrainian. During hearings on the case, Alexander Shulgin, Russia’s ambassador to the Netherlands, accused Ukraine of “blatant lies and false accusations … even to this court”. Top Ukrainian diplomat Anton Korynevych retorted that Russia was trying to “wipe us off the map”. “Beginning in 2014, Russia illegally occupied Crimea and then engaged in a campaign of cultural erasure, taking aim at ethnic Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars,” said Korynevych. On Friday, the ICJ will rule in another case in which Kyiv has accused Moscow of falsely applying the UN’s 1948 Genocide Convention to justify its February 24, 2022, invasion of Ukraine. The court’s judgements are final and without appeal but it has no way to enforce its rulings.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/31/icj-rejects-most-of-ukraines-terrorism-case-against-russia
Is Zelenskyy planning to fire Ukraine’s popular top army commander?,Valerii Zaluzhnyi has been blamed for last year’s anticlimactic counteroffensive against Russian troops.,"Kyiv, Ukraine –Rumours and allegations have swirled in recent weeks over the dismissal of Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine’s army chief. Last week, several lawmakers and insiders claimed the taciturn and immensely popular 50-year-old four-star general was dismissed and set to lead Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy decided to fire him in early December after Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin visited Kyiv, the Ukrainska Pravda newspaper reported, citing an unnamed source. But on Monday, Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said: “This is not true.” Even though the ministry does not hold sway over Zaluzhnyi, in the case of a potential firing, it would have to submit a “recommendation” for his dismissal to Zelenskyy, Ukraine’s nominal commander-in-chief. “There’s nothing to talk about. There was no dismissal. I have nothing to add,” Zelenskyy’s spokesperson Serhiy Nikiforov said in televised remarks on Monday. But several observers have doubts. “There was an attempt to convince Zaluzhnyi to switch to another job voluntarily, on his own. The attempt wasn’t very successful, so the matter has been postponed,” Kyiv-based analyst Volodymyr Fesenko told Al Jazeera. But the dismissal “is a matter of time and circumstances”, he said. There is “psychological tension” between Zaluzhnyi and the president, who remains dissatisfied with thefailures of last year’s counterattack, Fesenko said. Several counterstrikes in late 2022 liberated almost half of Russia-occupied areas and assured the Ukrainian public that the 2023 summer campaign in the east and south would succeed. But Russia used a lull in hostilities to build multilayer defence installations along the 1,000km-long (621-mile) front line and deployed hundreds of thousands of newly mobilised servicemen to man them. Zaluzhnyi’s months-long counterattackmorphedinto a World War I-like trench war as his forces gained, lost and regained tiny patches of land amid harrowing losses of soldiers and Western-supplied weaponry. Even the failed mutiny and disbandment of the Wagner mercenary group, which spearheaded Russia’s advance,didn’t helpthe Ukrainian counterattacks. The failure was variously blamed on Zaluzhnyi’s tactical mistakes and delays in the supply of Western weaponry such as fighter jets and missiles. As Zaluzhnyi has not come up with a new action plan for 2024, Zelenskyy has occasionally bypassed him in managing the armed forces, Fesenko said. But Zaluzhnyi’s authority among the top brass and servicemen remains sky high. In early 2022, as Ukrainian politicians were adamant that Russian President Vladimir Putin was bluffing and would not dare invade,Zaluzhnyi, who has headed the armed forces since July 2021, worked hard to prepare. “In the political sphere, there were different views, but the military with him at the helm tried hard to get ready, and he demonstrated success,” Lieutenant General Ihor Romanenko, former deputy chief of Ukraine’s General Staff, told Al Jazeera. Once a little-known figure, Zaluzhnyi rarely speaks to the press and shuns publicity. He is by far the most trusted person in wartime Ukraine. He is more popular than Zelenskyy – an astronomical 88 percent of Ukrainians trust him, a recent poll found, while 62 percent trust the president. Seventy-two percent said they are against his dismissal while 2 percent would support it, according to the survey by the Kyiv International Sociology Institute conducted in early December. But popularity won’t necessarily translate into political success. Ukraine’s elites and public do not typically view the military and law enforcement agencies as a source of political and presidential material. Ukraine’s second president, Leonid Kuchma, appointed former intelligence chief Evhen Marchuk as prime minister in 1995 but soon fired him for “trying to form his own political image”. Another wannabe president, former Interior Minister Yuri Kravchenko, died in 2005 of two gunshots to the head that were officially deemed suicide. Former intelligence chief Ihor Smeshko and ex-Defence Minister Anatoly Hritsenko formed their own political parties but gained minimal support in their attempts to run for president. In Ukraine, the army is “not a political institution with a special vision of development like in Latin America”, Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kuschch told Al Jazeera. So should Zaluzhnyi choose to leave the military for politics, he would be a “good sparring partner” for Zelenskyy but would not be elected president, said Igar Tyshkevich of the Ukrainian Institute for the Future, a think-tank in Kyiv. “But it’s almost guaranteed that he would head one of the largest fractions in the Verkhovna Rada,” Ukraine’s lower house of parliament, Tyshkevich told Al Jazeera. He dismissed concerns that protests might erupt if Zaluzhnyi is fired. Media leaks have named two generals who may replace Zaluzhnyi. One is Kyrylo Budanov, a 38-year-old who led small intelligence groups that landed in annexed Crimea before the war and now heads the Main Directorate of Intelligence in the Ministry of Defence. His agency sent helicopters to aid Ukrainian servicemen fighting in the besieged Azovstal plant in Mariupol in 2022. It has conducted drone attacks on bombers, warships, air defence systems and military bases deep inside Russia and annexed Crimea. Budanov’s men have assassinated pro-Russian strongmen and disloyal Ukrainian politicians in separatist-held and Russia-occupied areas. Another possible replacement for Zaluzhnyi is Oleksandr Syrsky, a seasoned military veteran who defended Kyiv in early 2022 and kicked Russian forces out of the eastern region ofKharkivlater that year. If either fills Zaluzhnyi’s shoes, there is sure to be bitter public feelings towards Zelenskyy, but if an upcoming counteroffensive is successful, they would “dissolve within months”, Tyshkevich said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/31/is-zelenskyy-planning-to-fire-ukraines-popular-top-army-commander
Russia and Ukraine complete first prisoner exchange since plane crash,The crash of a plane carrying prisoners of war had cast doubt on the future of prisoner exchanges.,"Russia and Ukraine have exchanged hundreds of prisoners of war, in the first prisoner swap since thecrashlast week of a Russian military transport plane that Moscow says was carrying 65 Ukrainian soldiers. The Russian Ministry of Defence said that each side got 195 soldiers back and that its soldiers would be flown to Moscow to receive medical and psychological treatment. “On January 31, as a result of the negotiation process, 195 Russian servicemen who were in mortal danger in captivity were returned from territory controlled by the Kyiv regime. In return, exactly 195 prisoners from the armed forces of Ukraine were handed over,” the Defence Ministry said in a statement. It was cited by the RIA state news agency as saying that the United Arab Emirates had played a role in brokering the deal. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on his official account on X that it was one of the biggest swaps so far. He gave a slightly higher number for the number of Ukrainians returned. “Our people are back. 207 of them. We return them home no matter what,” said Zelenskyy. Ukraine’s governmental body in charge of POWs said that this was the 50th prisoner exchange of its kind. It returned home soldiers involved in the defence of the cities of Mariupol and Kherson, as well as soldiers captured by Russia on Snake Island in the Black Sea. The body said marines and combat medics were among those handed back and that 36 of the returned Ukrainians had injuries or serious illnesses. The two countries have carried out periodic prisoner swaps via intermediaries since the war began nearly two years ago, despite the absence of any peace talks between them since the early months of the conflict. The latest and biggest exchange was on January 3, when they traded a total of 478 captives following mediation by the UAE. The crash on January 24 of a Russian Ilyushin Il-76 plane in a field before a similar planned swap had thrown doubt on the future of prisoner exchanges between the two sides. Moscow said Ukrainian soldiers being carried to a scheduled exchange were killed when the plane was shot down by Kyiv’s forces. Kyiv has not outright denied Moscow’s version of events but questioned whether captured Ukrainian soldiers were actually on board. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday said that a US-made Patriot missile was used to shoot down the military cargo plane. “The plane was shot down, it has already been established for certain, by an American Patriot system,” Putin said in a televised appearance.

Russia lawmakers pass bill to confiscate assets of those who discredit army,"It allows seizure of money, valuables, other assets of those convicted of spreading ‘false information’ about military.","Lawmakers in Russia’s lower house of parliament have approved a bill that will allow authorities to confiscate the assets of those convicted of spreading “deliberately false information” about the military. The State Duma passedthe measureon Wednesday and the bill is expected to be approved by the upper house before being signed by President Vladimir Putin. Once it becomes a law, the legislation will enable the government to seize money, valuables and other assets of thosecriticising the war in Ukraine. The new law would apply to those convicted of publicly inciting “extremist activities,” calling for actions that would hurt the security of the state or “discrediting” the armed forces. Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin said the bill targets “scoundrels and traitors, those who today spit on the backs of our soldiers, who have betrayed their homeland, who transfer money to the armed forces of a country that is at war with us”.    “Discrediting” the armed forces is a criminal offence under an existing law that was adopted as part of a sweeping government crackdown on dissent afterRussia invaded Ukrainein February 2022. It covers offences such as “justifying terrorism” and spreading “fake news” about the military, and has been used extensively to silence Putin’s critics. Thousands of activists, bloggers and other Russians have received long jail terms, or been detained or fined forspeaking out against the waramid an escalating crackdown on free speech and opposition to Putin. Popular writer Dmitry Glukhovsky was handed an eight-year jail term in absentia after a Moscow court found him guilty in August of deliberately spreading false information about Russia’s armed forces. Grigory Chkhartishvili, among the country’s bestselling novelists and known under the pen nameBoris Akunin, was charged under the law and added to the Russian register of “extremists and terrorists” in December. In November, a court in St Petersburg jailedSasha Skochilenko, an artist and musician, for seven years for swapping supermarket price tags with antiwar messages. The month before, Russian blogger Aleksandr Nozdrinov received an 8.5-year term for posting photos of destroyed buildings in Kyiv, along with a caption implying that Russian troops were responsible. Despite the crackdown on dissent, the Kremlin has repeatedly claimed that Russian society is united in backing the war.

Ukraine war critic submits bid to challenge Putin for Russia’s presidency,"Putin win seen as forgone conclusion, but Boris Nadezhdin’s opposition to Russia’s war in Ukraine has won him significant support.","Boris Nadezhdin, a prominent critic of the Kremlin, has submitted the documents needed to register as a candidate for Russia’s presidential elections in March. The 60-year-old local councillor, who has promised to end Russia’swar in Ukraine, said on Wednesday that he had collected more than 100,000 signatures of support across 40 regions and submitted them and other documents to the Central Election Commission (CEC), which is technically enough to challenge President Vladimir Putin. Election officials will next check the authenticity of the signatures submitted by Nadezhdin and other potential candidates and announce next month who will join Putin on the ballot for the March 15-17 elections. The electoral body has in the past uncovered what it claimed wereirregularitiesin signatures or documents collected by some candidates and disqualified them. Putin, who will be running as an independent rather than as the candidate of the ruling United Russia party, needs 300,000 signatures but has already collected more than 3.5 million, according to his supporters. InDecember, the 71-year-old incumbent announced his decision to seek to extend his rule. He is almost certain to win a fifth term as president, extending his 24-year leadership of Russia, including eight years as prime minister.    Nadezhdin, who has criticised the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 as a “fatal mistake”, was born in Soviet-ruled Uzbekistan to a Jewish mother who was a music teacher and a physicist father. He has spent the last 30 years in Russian politics, working as a councillor in the town of Dolgoprudny outside Moscow. He will be standing as a candidate for the Civic Initiative party. He shot to fame with his calls to end the war, bringing out crowds of Russians across the country eager to add their signatures to his bid to get on the ballot. After a series of heating outages across Russia during an unusually cold winter, Nadezhdin said earlier this month that the country would be able to afford to spend more on its citizens if it was not pouring so much money into the military.    He described the war as “catastrophic” in an interview with the AFP news agency, and said he wanted to “free political prisoners” in Russia. “This is my pride,” he said of the signatures collected, as he thanked his supporters in a statement posted on his official Telegram account. “The work of thousands of people going without sleep over many days. The result of the queues you stood in, in the cold, is in the boxes. It will be very difficult for the CEC and the authorities to say: ‘I didn’t notice the elephant in the room’!” He also posted a video from the CEC’s headquarters showing papers containing the signatures piled up on tables ready to be checked by officials, describing which region each stack had come from. Nadezhdin’s bid raises the question of just how far the Kremlin would let him go, at a time when speaking out against the conflict is politically fraught, often landing critics in prison. Putin has not allowed real electoral opposition in his 24-year rule, with rivals such as opposition leaderAlexei Navalnybehind bars. Navalny’s wife Yuliya signed her name in support of Nadezhdin in a symbolic photo posted by the jailed critic’s ally.

Russian rock band critical of Ukraine war faces deportation from Thailand,"Bi-2 members, held for performing without permits, have criticised Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and President Vladimir Putin.","Members of a dissident Russian-Belarusian rock band critical of Moscow’s war in Ukraine have been jailed in Thailand, with growing calls to not deport them to Russia. Progressive rock group Bi-2’s members remained locked up on Wednesday after being detained for performing without work permits in Thailand. The group has spoken out againstRussia’s invasion of Ukraineand Russian President Vladimir Putin. The group was detained last week after it played a gig in Phuket, a southern Thai island popular with foreign tourists including many Russians. Human Rights Watch (HRW) said Bi-2 will face “persecution” if returned to Russia, and referred to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson accusing the band of “sponsoring terrorism”. A post on the seven-member band’s official Telegram channel on Wednesday said singer Yegor Bortnik, known by his stage name Lyova, had left Thailand. “Lyova Bi-2 flew to Israel, the rest of the group members are still in a migration prison in a cramped cell for 80 people,” the post read. The detained musicians “include Russian citizens as well as dual nationals of Russia and other countries, including Israel and Australia,” HRW said in a statement on Tuesday. Those holding only Russian citizenship are thought to be most at risk. Thai officials confirmed the band’s arrest last week and said they now face possible deportation. “This usually results in deportation to their country of origin but there is some discretion [about the destination],” said Kriangkrai Ariyaying, the superintendent of Phuket’s Immigration Bureau. The country’s National Security Council “is looking into the matter, seeing what are details including the band members’ names and nationalities,” Foreign Minister Parnpree Bahiddha-Nukara told reporters on Wednesday. VPI Event, which organises concerts in Thailand, said all the necessary permits were obtained, but the band had been given tourist visas in error. “Typically, in such cases, migration services contact the organiser of the event to apply appropriate sanctions. But in this case, the attention of the migration services was focused exclusively on the artists,” VPI said, adding that the Russian consulate had attempted to cancel Bi-2’s concerts in December. HRW said Thailand has an international legal obligation to not forcibly return anyone who faces the threat of torture if returned. “Under no circumstances should they be deported to Russia, where they could face arrest or worse for their outspoken criticisms” of Putin and the war, said Elaine Pearson, HRW’s Asia director. HRW also said that “amid repression in Russia reaching new heights, Russian authorities have used transnational repression – abuses committed against nationals beyond a government’s jurisdiction – to target activists and government critics abroad with violence and other unlawful actions”. Bi-2 is popular in Russia. Several of its concerts were cancelled in 2022 after the band refused to play at a venue with banners supporting the war in Ukraine, following which the group left Russia. One of the band’s founders has openly denounced the Putin government, saying it makes him feel “only disgust” and accusing the leader of having “destroyed” Russia. Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya urged Thailand to “find a solution” to the band’s visa issue. I'm worried about the 🇹🇭 situation involving the Belarus-born rock band Bi-2. It's now absolutely clear that Russia is behind the operation to deport the band. I urge the Royal Thai Government & democratic nations to find a solution to ensure the freedom of these brave musicians.pic.twitter.com/IJeQApQxbm — Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya (@Tsihanouskaya)January 30, 2024  “I’m worried about the situation involving the Belarus-born rock band Bi-2,” she wrote on X. “It’s now absolutely clear that Russia is behind the operation to deport the band.” Bi-2 has more than one million subscribers to its YouTube channel and 376,000 monthly listeners on Spotify.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/31/russian-rock-band-critical-of-ukraine-war-faces-deportation-from-thailand

‘We are obliged to end the war’: A new Russian unit fights for Ukraine,The Siberian Battalion features a diverse set of fighters who risk Russia’s wrath by joining the ‘enemy’.,"Kyiv, Ukraine –When Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, 32-year-old Johnny, from St Petersburg, set himself a goal. He wanted to overthrow Vladimir Putin’s administration. In fact, he would have liked to kill the Russian president with his own hands, he told Al Jazeera in a cafe at a remote petrol station on the outskirts of Ukraine’s capital. In October, Johnny joined otherRussians fighting for Ukraineand against their homeland as part of the Siberian Battalion, a unit formed last summer by the Civic Council, a Russian opposition group based in Poland. “We want to democratise Russia. And it won’t be possible in the current state. Russia must fall apart into smaller pieces. I don’t care if it’s going to be small like Belgium … Places like Yakutia and Chechnya and other regions should be able to secede if they choose to,” Johnny said. According to Denis Sokolov, 54, the group’s coordinator, 50 fighters from the unit are currently in training or battling in Ukraine. Another 40 are being checked over by Ukraine’s security services as they wait to cross the border. He said there are thousands of other Russians willing to join the fight against Moscow, boasting that the Civic Council receives up to 10 applications per day. Those who want to sign up must first depart for a third country for safety reasons. And from there, it takes months to process an application. “Ukrainians do not trust Russians, and there are reasons for this. But this war was unleashed by the regime in our name, and we are obliged to end it,” Sokolov said. At the time of publishing, neither Polish nor Ukrainian authorities had responded to Al Jazeera’s request for comment on the Civil Council and Siberian Battalion.  Since the onset of the war, hundreds of Russians have turned on their country and bolstered Ukraine’s forces. According to the International Crisis Group, their motives are diverse. “Most of the recruits from the Russian Federation hail from the North Caucasus – majority-Muslim regions that have a long history of advocating for separation from the central government,” the group said in October. “There are also, however, ethnic Russians fighting on behalf of Ukraine. Some are simply sympathetic to the Ukrainian cause or see joining it as a part of their own struggle against Russian President Vladimir Putin. “Others, however, are far-right activists who hope the war will end with not just the collapse of Putin’s government but also the creation of a new, ethnically homogeneous Russian state.” The far-right fighters, the think tank said, are the “most battle-ready” of the Russian units. Russian troops are officially part of Ukraine’s international legion, fighting with the permission of its defence ministry, and using Ukraine’s weaponry. According to Russian law, the definition of high treason was extended in April to include fighting for enemies – a crime that could result in life imprisonment. In contrast, the Kremlin has reportedly offered citizenship to foreigners who choose to fight alongside Russian forces. Johnny, which is a nom de guerre he adopted after joining the unit, waited for seven months to enter Ukraine. He contacted the Civic Council in March when the group was helping recruit fighters for the Russian Volunteer Corps, a far-right unit behind incursions into Russia inMarchandMay. The two groups have since parted ways. The Civic Council decided to form a new, more inclusive unit that would accept non-white and non-Christian Russian citizens. The Siberian Battalion is made up of an array of people and groups, including anarchists, Muslims and members of the Free Ingria Movement fighting for the liberation of the St Petersburg region. “People are different. We are of different ages. Our values differ. But we all want to defeat Russia. And we believe that this is possible only by armed means,” said Johnny, who has not told his family about his fighting or whereabouts. The Siberian Battalion was named after the vast Russian region rich in natural resources, stretching from the Ural Mountains in the west to the Pacific Ocean in the east. “We understand that all of Moscow’s wealth comes from Siberia and that Moscow – and the rest of Russia – live off of Siberian money,” Sokolov said. “Taking these resources away from the regime is important because, first, without them the empire will be less aggressive. Secondly, the peoples of Siberia have the right to manage their resources independently, not just Indigenous peoples, but everyone who lives in Siberia.” The Siberian Battalion accepts people from other regions too, like 26-year-old Siziy, the unit’s medic-in-training who was born in Moscow. The former customs official, who also ran his own business, arrived in Ukraine on the same day as Johnny and heard about the Civic Council when the organisation was recruiting for the Russian Volunteer Corps. But Siziy, which is a nom de guerre meaning “grey blue” in Russian, does not associate with far-right nationalism. In April 2022, he converted to Islam. His parents found out about his decision when he was already in Ukraine. He has cut contact with everyone he knew in Russia. While it was not easy to accept that her only child went to war, Siziy said, his mother has not protested against his decision. “Everyone makes decisions for themselves. I realised that there is something more important than material wealth in this life,” Siziy said. “If there’s one thing to die for, it is freedom. And Ukraine is fighting for existence.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/30/we-are-obliged-to-end-the-war-a-new-russian-battalion-fights-for-ukraine

"Ukraine funding, Orban’s opposition set to dominate crucial EU summit",Resistance to further aid for Kyiv is growing ahead of meeting that comes almost two years into Russia’s war in Ukraine.,"European Union leaders are preparing for a crucial meeting that will be dominated by a second attempt at passing a 50-billion-euro ($54bn) amendment to the EU budget that will help finance Ukraine over the next four years. That amendment was vetoed by Hungary at December’s regular summit along with 20 billion euros ($21.7bn) in military aid to Ukraine for 2024. The EU’s executive, the European Commission, is reportedly hoping to bring Hungary on board at Thursday’s meeting by offering Prime Minister Viktor Orban an opportunity to block a continuation of the support next year when the EU would evaluate whether Ukraine still needs the money and meets requirements to receive it. EU support has been key to Ukraine’s war effort. The bloc has spent more than 40 billion euros ($43bn) to support Ukraine’s budget and 27 billion euros ($29bn) in military aid since the war began almost two years ago in addition to 17 billion euros ($18.4bn) supporting millions of Ukrainian refugees in Europe. This year, Ukraine’s budget faces a $48 billion shortfall. There is a more coercive approach. This month, the European Parliament condemned Orban’s December veto and asked the European Council of EU government leaders to investigate Hungary for “serious and persistent breaches of EU values”. That obliges the council, which still wields ultimate power in the EU, to invoke proceedings that could ultimately suspend Hungary’s voting rights and deprive it of its veto. But Europe initiated such proceedings, known as Article 7, against Hungary in 2018, and they failed because the system requires unanimity in the council and Poland supported Hungary. Poland has a new, centre-left government that is friendly to Ukraine and no longer aligned with Orban, but Slovakia last year brought Robert Fico’s Smer Party to power to Orban’s undisguised delight. Both men are Eurosceptics and share an adversarial relationship with Brussels. Fico immediately ceased supplying military aid to Ukraine upon taking office and this month voiced his support for Orban. “I will never agree that a country should be punished for fighting for its sovereignty. I will never agree with such an attack on Hungary,” he said in a joint press conference with Orban. “Article 7 would need a consensus that every member state would support it, but Slovakia won’t, and almost certainly the Netherlands won’t. So I would argue that it won’t go through,” University of Helsinki lecturer in Eastern European studies Katalin Miklossy told Al Jazeera. The top vote-getter in Dutch parliamentary elections last year was the party of far-right leader Gert Wilders, who has yet to form a government but has also said aid to Ukraine should be cut. EU members could continue to provide aid through a special vehicle that lies outside their regular budget, something Orban has said he would not oppose, or by allowing member states to help Ukraine bilaterally. These approaches have disadvantages. They are more expensive and deprive the EU of a single voice in foreign policy, making it appear weak as war rages on European soil. They fail to address problems in Hungary itself, which the European Parliament described as an “electoral autocracy” that defies EU values. It has already seen 30 billion euros ($32.5bn) in EU aid suspended for manipulating the judiciary and suppressing free speech and minority rights. Most importantly from a practical point of view, these approaches do not lock in the aid at a time when the EU is mostly comprised of governments and a European legislature willing to help Ukraine. Many observers expect European Parliament elections in June to produce a legislature less well-disposed towards Kyiv – and that could be what Orban is banking on. “Victor Orban reads the cards right, unfortunately,” Miklossy said. “He understands the wind in the EU is changing. There are more and more voices in the EU that want the Ukrainians to just sit down at the table and negotiate peace with the Russians because we cannot afford to support Ukraine forever.” In this view, Orban lies in wait for a Eurosceptic government in Austria this autumn, where the far-right Freedom Party has led polls for a year, and in Germany next year, where the far-right Alternative for Germany has doubled its following in the past 18 months and now comes second in polls to the Christian Democratic Union. Orban may be right about European trends, according to a poll the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) published this month. It found that climate change, pandemics, immigration and fears of global financial instability all trounced Ukraine as existential fears in nine European countries polled. “Our worry was that there will be politicians that would surely try to follow the trend and would be outspoken about the need to stop supporting Ukraine because they believe this is the way the trend is going and where they can find future voters,” the ECFR’s Pawel Zerka told Al Jazeera. Orban, Fico and Wilders have all posed as peacemakers. In a May 2022 poll, the ECFR found a larger group of Europeans in favour of peace at the cost of partitioning Ukraine than in favour of justice whereby Ukraine would fight to regain all its lands. In March last year, the justice camp beat the peace camp 38-29. The ECFR attributed this to Ukraine’s battlefield successes, unity of the left and right on Ukraine, and the strength of US leadership. Now the pendulum appears to be swinging back in the peace camp’s favour, Zerka said, because two of those factors, the US role and battlefield success, “have started to evaporate”. Like the EU, the US has delayed approving military aid for Ukraine this year. British historian Mark Galeotti agreed that the US factor is key. “I think that if the Americans start to genuinely scale down their support for Ukraine, it will be an excuse for a lot of European countries to say, ‘Well, there’s nothing much we can do,’ rather than thinking, ‘We should actually rise to the challenge. This is, after all, our continent,’” Galeotti recently told the podcast Futucast. Hungary has made different choices For Hungary, at least, opposition to Ukraine is about more than picking up votes. Hungary has been wooing Chinese and Russian investment since Orban came to power in 2010. In 2013, Hungary became the first country other than China to sell a renminbi-denominated bond on the international market. Four years later, it became the first Eastern European country to sell a renminbi bond in China itself. Placing itself in financial parlance with China paid dividends, Jens Bastian, a fellow with the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, told Al Jazeera. “[Hungary and Serbia] are the leading recipients of Chinese foreign direct investment in 2023 in Central and Eastern Europe,” Bastian said. China is building and partly financing a Budapest-Belgrade high-speed railway. Chinese electrical vehicle battery manufacturer CATL is investing $7.6bn in the Hungarian city of Debrecen for the construction of a battery plant. “It would be Europe’s largest electrical battery facility. It would be CATL’s single-largest overseas investment and its second facility in Hungary,” Bastian said. As it invests in a manufacturing economy, Hungary seeks cheap energy, Miklossy said, and is one of a group of landlocked EU members (with Slovakia, Austria and the Czech Republic) that successfully fought for exemptions from a 2022 ban on Russian oil imports. Some of these countries, Bastian said, amount to “an axis of the unwilling among EU and NATO members who are in effect doing Putin’s bidding”. For example, in addition to vetoing Ukraine aid, last month Orban also forced Bulgaria to lift transit fees on Russian gas bound for Serbia and Hungary. But what looks like economic interests also has political importance, Bastian said. “They are showing the EU, multilateral organisations like the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Monetary Fund, the European Investment Bank, ‘We are looking for and are successfully finding alternatives.’” Why? Because “Orban and Fico want to see a very different EU … not based on rule of law,” Tymofiy Mylovanov, director of the Kyiv School of Economics, told Al Jazeera. “It’s … a collection of countries with authoritarian populist leaders. They don’t want to exit the EU. They want to change the rules. They don’t want to play by the Brussels rules.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/29/eu-seeks-to-goad-persuade-or-bypass-hungary-in-a-crucial-summit
Russia and Ukraine bicker over tiny front-line village,The dispute illustrates how bogged down the front line has become in the conflict.,"Russia has claimed its forces have taken control of the village of Tabaivka in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region, but Kyiv has denied the claim. Moscow claimed it had taken the tiny village on Monday in a defence ministry statement. However, Ukrainian officials quickly asserted on national TV that Kyiv remains in control. The disagreement illustrates the state of the bogged-down and muddled front line in conflict, which has now been ongoing fornearly two years. The Russian army said it has “liberated” Tabaivka, but Volodymyr Fityo, head of communications for Ukraine’s ground forces, said: “This does not correspond to reality. There are battles taking place near this locality.” Fityo added that Moscow nevertheless was “trying to advance in all directions”. The village of Tabaivka lies near the border with the Luhansk region and had a population of 34 people before Moscow’s invasion.    Both the Kremlin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy have denied the conflict has reached a deadlock, despite the sprawling front line barely moving in months. Russia has for months been trying to advance into the Kharkiv region, hitting its main city several times and killing 11 people in an attack last week. Ukraine’s major counteroffensive in the summer failed to push the invading Russian forces back significantly. Kyiv is now seeking additional soldiers for the front, in contrast to during the early days of the war in 2022 when droves of patriotic volunteers were seen. With the front line largely at a standstill, the two foes have concentrated in recent weeks on air strikes, with cities and infrastructure in Ukraine and Russia targeted. Moscow hit large swathes of Ukraine with drone and missile attacks, Kyiv’s Air Force said on Sunday. The Russian Air Force said Moscow attacked the central Poltava region with two missiles fired from its Iskander ballistic missile system. It also launched three surface-to-air missiles over the Donetsk region in the east.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/29/russia-and-ukraine-in-spat-over-control-of-village-in-ukraines-kharkiv
‘Kharkiv is their priority’: Deadly Russian attacks hit Ukraine’s northeast,"Ukrainians mourn, rebuild, and rebrand a street named after Pushkin as Russian forces intensify their bombing campaign.","Kharkiv, Ukraine –Like an enormous scalpel out of a surreal horror movie, a Russian missile sliced off an entire section of a five-storey apartment building, killing 10 people and wounding 60. After putting out the fire in last week’s predawn attack, rescue workers found the victims buried in the rubble that used to be the walls, ceilings and furniture of their apartments. “We dug out a guy, alive, but his family – a wife and an eight-year-old daughter – were dead,” one of the distressed rescue workers, with his hands and uniform black from the soot and dust, told Al Jazeera on Wednesday. The strike hit Building 7 on Proskury Street in northern Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city that sits only 40km (25 miles) from the Russian border. Ukrainian officials said Kharkiv was targeted by 15 Russian missiles of three types in one of the largest attacks on the city since the war began 23 months ago. There were remodelled S-300 missiles, parts of air defence systems that intercept and destroy other missiles midair, and X-22 hypersonic missiles designed to destroy warships. The largest and most lethal weapons were Iskanders, 7-metre-long monsters that cost $3m, weigh almost 4 tonnes and carry up to 480kg (1,058 pounds) of explosives – or a nuclear warhead. Ukrainian officials have not yet specified what missile type hit Building 7, but a military expert said Russia “most likely” used an S-300 missile. “They’re not precise, this is moral and psychological pressure to destroy the city further,” Lieutenant-General Ihor Romanenko, former deputy chief of Ukraine’s General Staff of the Armed Forces, told Al Jazeera. “Kharkiv is their priority, because [President Vladimir] Putin can’t forgive the fact that a Russian-speaking city didn’t want to become part of the Russian world,” he said. Moscow habitually denies it targeted civilians. Russia “doesn’t hit civilian infrastructure and residential areas, unlike the Kyiv regime”, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. The Itar Tass news agency reported that Russia delivered “pinpointed strikes on the quarters for mercenaries”. The city with a pre-war population of 1.5 million is Ukraine’s most vulnerable urban centre. Russia lies north and east of it, and the border of Moscow-annexed Luhansk region is about 150km (90 miles) to the southeast. Almost 5,000 windows in 222 buildings were broken by the blasts and shockwaves throughout the region on January 23, officials said. In Building 7, communal workers, working quickly and efficiently, yanked out razor-sharp glass shards and covered each gaping hole with yellow, honeycomb-like rectangles of strand board to keep the biting cold away. They checked each apartment for natural gas leaks, fixed damaged entrance doors and started removing bricks the blast broke in half, pieces of glass, plastic and other debris. It was business as usual on the verge of exhaustion. “Their salaries are 5,400 hryvnia [$145] a month, but the amount of work is colossal – to collect it all, load [onto trucks] and take away,” district head of communal services Vera Fyodorovna told Al Jazeera. Two excavators were fumbling for the debris near Building 7, just 30 metres (about 100 feet) away from where another Russian bomb landed in April 2022. Since day one of the full-scale invasion, Russian forces have tried to seize Kharkiv, dispatching armed personnel carriers almost to the city centre. Moscow has deployed strategic bombers, ballistic or cruise missiles, and Iranian or Russian-made drones that only take minutes to reach the city from across the border. Unlike the capital, Kyiv, which received advanced Western air defence systems within months, Kharkiv remains almost defenceless. Residents and authorities have had to adapt quickly as any delays mean lost lives. The city’s subway system served as a 24/7 bomb shelter – and some stations occasionally became classrooms for the schoolchildren waiting out the air raids. Public gatherings, museum exhibitions and even classes in community centres were banned. Gyms and swimming pools warn their patrons about each air raid, but let them decide whether to leave or stay. Daring Ukrainian missile and drone attacks forced Moscow to relocate the strategic bombers to airfields hundreds of kilometres away from the border. They do not cross into Ukrainian airspace any more, but their speed gives an additional boost to the missiles they launch. Each time satellites spot their takeoff, Kharkiv residents receive warnings and information on possible trajectories via Telegram or Viber channels. Old-fashioned air raid sirens also begin howling – but many residents are so used to their high-pitched sound that they simply do not wake up. That is why Tamara Karnaukhova woke up only when her balcony door fell on her bed. The retired 76-year-old did not know whether to stay in her modest one-bedroom apartment in Building 7 or run away. The shockwave crumbled most of the windows and damaged the front door. “I wasn’t scared, I was confused,” she told Al Jazeera. After the blast, she ran downstairs as smoke gushed from broken windows and glass cracked under her feet. While she was at her neighbour’s, marauders sneaked into her apartment, rummaging in the kitchen but taking no valuables. Karnaukhova still cannot fathom why Russia invaded. “Do they need land? Resources?” she wondered aloud. “They already have it all.” When the war began, Valerii Ivakhno joined a volunteer group that rides around in a minivan and hands out hot drinks, snacks and porridge to shelling victims. His 85-year-old mother’s apartment in central Kharkiv was heavily damaged in 2022, and he spent all of his savings to renovate it. But on Tuesday morning, the brand-new windows were knocked out. Luckily, his mother knew the “be between two walls” rule and rushed to the corridor seconds before the shards of glass showered her bed. Ivakhno said he is glad his father did not live to see the invasion. He was buried on February 23, 2022, one day before it began. “Dear God took him away so that he wouldn’t see this shame and horror,” Ivakhno said while pouring porridge into a paper cup and handing it to a rescue worker in central Kharkiv. Each visit to yet another shelled location is a recurring nightmare for his team. “I’ve lost count of how many times we have done it, how many people we’ve helped,” his colleague Svtlana Stetsenko said, standing next to a historic building of a law school damaged by Tuesday’s attack and the resulting fire. The street they were on was named after Alexander Pushkin, Russia’s most celebrated 19th-century poet whose cult is seen by most Ukrainians as “cultural imperialism”. On that very day of the attack, Kharkiv authorities decided to rename the street and the nearby subway station after Ukrainian philosopher and educator Hrigory Skovoroda.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/29/kharkiv-ukraine-intensified-shelling

Ukraine says it uncovers $40m arms corruption scheme,"The Security Service of Ukraine says five charged over plot to embezzle funds earmarked to buy 100,000 mortar shells.","Employees from a Ukrainian arms firm conspired with Ministry of Defence officials to embezzle almost $40m earmarked to buy 100,000 mortar shells for the war with Russia, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has reported. The SBU said late Saturday that five people have been charged, with one person detained while trying to cross the Ukrainian border. If found guilty, they face up to 12 years in prison. The announcement, which was confirmed by Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence, will have a deep impact on a country beleaguered byRussia’s nearly two-year-old invasion. The SBU said an investigation had “exposed officials of the Ministry of Defence and managers of arms supplier Lviv Arsenal, who stole nearly 1.5 billion hryvnias [$40m] in the purchase of shells.” “According to the investigation, former and current high-ranking officials of the Ministry of Defence and heads of affiliated companies are involved in the embezzlement,” the SBU said. The deal involved the purchase of 100,000 mortar shells for the military, with a contract secured in August 2022 and payment made in advance. But no arms were ever provided, the SBU statement said, with some funds then moved to other foreign accounts.    Five people have been given “notices of suspicion” – the first stage in Ukrainian legal proceedings – both in the ministry and the arms supplier, according to the security service’s statement. One suspect, the SBU said, was detained while trying to cross the Ukrainian border. Officials accused of participating in the scheme include the current and former heads of the defence ministry’s Department of Military and Technical Policy, Development of Armaments and Military Equipment, as well as the head of Lviv Arsenal. According to Ukraine’s prosecutor general, the stolen funds have been seized and will be returned to the defence budget. Corruption within Kyiv’s military has been a thorny issue both as it tries to maintain wartime public morale and present itscase to join the European Union. Last September, Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov was dismissed amid various corruption cases. The announcement came as Russia launched drone and missile attacks hitting both civilian and critical infrastructure across Ukraine, Kyiv’s Air Force said on Sunday. The Air Force said Moscow attacked the central Poltava region with two ballistic missiles fired from its Iskander ballistic missile system. It also launched three surface-to-air missiles over the Donetsk region in the east. In the southeast Zaporizhia region, Governor Yuri Malashko said an infrastructure site had been hit in a drone attack. Filip Pronin, governor of the Poltava region, wrote on Telegram that the attack there hit an industrial site in the city of Kremenchuk, igniting a fire. There were no preliminary reports of casualties, Kyiv said.   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/28/ukraine-unearths-40-million-embezzlement-scheme-involving-its-military

Russia’s Putin says ‘obvious’ Ukraine shot down plane over Belgorod,"Moscow and Kyiv trade blame after Ilyushin Il-76 plane crashed, reportedly killing 65 Ukrainian POWs said to be on board.","Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that Ukrainian air defences shot down the Russian military plane that crashed near its border with Ukraine this week. In his first comments about Wednesday’s crash, Putin said that the results of Moscow’s investigation would be published in two to three days, but preliminary results suggested that the missiles that hit the plane were either American or French. Putin also accused Ukraine of knowing that the Ilyushin Il-76 plane was carrying 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war. “I don’t know if they did it on purpose or by mistake, but it is obvious that they did it,” Putin said in televised comments on Friday. “In any case, what happened is a crime. Either through negligence or on purpose, but in any case, it is a crime.” The Russian defence ministry said six Russian crew members and three Russian soldiers were also on board the flight to undertake the latest prisoner swap with Ukraine. Ukraine has not confirmed nor denied whether it shot down the plane and has challenged Moscow’s account of who was on board and what occurred. Kyiv has refuted Moscow’s claim that it was warned that a plane carrying Ukrainian POWs would be flying over Russia’s Belgorod region at that time. It also said there were discrepancies in a list of names published by Russian media of the 65 Ukrainians who were reportedly on board. However, Putin said the plane could not have been brought down by Russian “friendly fire” since its air defence systems have safeguards in place to prevent them from attacking their aircraft. “There are ‘friend or foe’ systems there, and no matter how much the operator presses the button, our air defence systems would not work,” he said.    On Thursday, Ukraine called for an internationalinvestigationinto the blast. “Regarding an international investigation, I believe that we will do our part to make it happen. But I am convinced that … the Russians will make loud statements but will not allow anyone in,” Dmytro Lubinets, the Ukrainian parliament commissioner for human rights, told national television, adding he would send letters to the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross. “They will not hand over any materials for analysis and will simply blame Ukraine,” he added. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also called for an emergency session of the UN Security Council to discuss the downed plane on Thursday. At the session, Moscow and Kyiv both sought to pin the blame on the other. “All of the information that we have today shows that we are dealing with a premeditated, thought-through crime,” said Russia’s deputy ambassador to the UN, Dmitry Polyanskiy, adding that Ukraine’s leaders “knew the route very well, knew about the way the soldiers were going to be transported to the place of exchange”. He accused Kyiv of sacrificing its own troops “to Western geopolitical interests”. Ukraine’s Deputy Ambassador Khrystyna Hayovyshyn in turn rejected the accusation, saying that “Ukraine was not informed about the number of vehicles, roads and means of transportation of the captives”. “This alone may constitute intentional actions by Russia to endanger the lives and safety of the prisoners,” she said.

"‘Propaganda, provocation’: Did Ukraine down a plane with its POWs aboard?","Confusion abounds days after a Russian military jet crashed near the Ukrainian border, reportedly killing dozens of people.","Kyiv, Ukraine –Two days after a Russian military cargo planewas shot downnear the Ukrainian border, unanswered questions loom as Moscow and Kyiv offer starkly conflicting versions – and insufficient proof. Moscow claimed the Il-76, with 65 Ukrainian war prisoners on board, was about to land in the western city of Belgorod on Wednesday in advance of a swap later that day. It purported that Ukrainian air defence forces in the nearby Kharkiv region shot the plane down with two missiles. Russian lawmaker Andrey Kartapolov claimed three missiles were shot either from a US-made Patriot air defence complex or from a German-made Iris T system. “Ukrainian leaders knew very well about the swap, were informed how they prisoners would be delivered, but the Il-76 plane was shot down by three missiles,” he reportedly said. Moscow alleged that all the Ukrainian prisoners, three Russian guards that escorted them, and six crew members had been killed when the plane crashed near the village of Yablonova. The Ukrainska Pravda news website quoted an unnamed military official saying that the downed plane was “their job”, but the laconic report was soon removed. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy did not say who or what could have downed the plane, but called for an internal investigation and accused Russia of “playing with the lives of Ukrainian prisoners”. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov retorted by saying that “if [Zelenksyy] means an international investigation into the criminal actions of the Kyiv regime – then one is indeed needed”. Margarita Simonyan, one of the main Kremlin backers who heads the media network Russia Today, posted the alleged list of 65 POWs on her Telegram channel. Kyiv said that it had planned a prisoner exchange that day, It did not confirm the authenticity of the list shared by Simonyan, but said that one person on it had already been swapped earlier this month. Ukraine insisted Russia provided no information about the plane that in fact had been carrying missiles for S-300 air defence systems. Mobile phone videos presumably shot near the crash site showed the burning plane and traces of smoke allegedly left by a Ukrainian missile. Anothervideoof the plane’s alleged debris showed no traces of bodies. Meanwhile, allegations abounded that Russia would kill captured Ukrainian servicemen kept in Russian prisons and place their remnants in the downed plane’s debris to “provide” proof of Kyiv’s war crime. “They have the prisoners on the ground and would have to kill them, mess up their bodies and mix the remnants with the plane’s debris,” a Ukrainian military official told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity. A top Ukrainian military expert agreed. “To prove their point, Russians may go very far, including the liquidation of these war prisoners and the dismemberment of their bodies,” Lieutenant General Ihor Romanenko, former deputy chief of Ukraine’s general staff of armed forces, told Al Jazeera. He said that there is a “high probability” that Ukrainian air defence forces downed the plane, but there was too little evidence to prove it – and to say for sure who and what was on board the plane before it was shot down. But Romanenko, who spent decades in in air defence forces, said that he had personally seen how two missiles from an S-200 or S-300 complex can fit into an Il-76 cargo plane, a seasoned Soviet warhorse that can carry up to 40 tonnes. He said that Moscow staged a “provocation” with the plane and will hardly agree to conduct an independent investigation. The incident reminded him of the July 17, 2014, downing of the Malaysian MH-17 plane with 298 passengers and crew on board by pro-Moscow separatists in the Donbas region. The separatists and pro-Russian residents in the area said days after the disaster that the CIA “loaded” hundreds of dead and “pre-frozen” bodies onto the plane to “frame” Moscow. An international investigation based on the analysis of wreckage and intercepted phone calls concluded that the plane was destroyed by the Russia-supplied BUK surface-to-air missile. Investigatorssaidlater that there were “strong indications” that Russian President Vladimir Putin approved the delivery of the BUK complex to the separatists. Another Ukrainian analyst said that after losing the plane this week, Russia decided to start a propaganda “campaign” while hiding evidence of what really had happened. “What we see is Russian propaganda statements, an obvious information-psychological campaign against Ukraine and a lack of proof of the Russian version,” Volodymyr Fesenko, head of the Penta think tank in Kyiv, told Al Jazeera. Russia did not present the bodies of the 65 POWs, and Ukrainian intelligence official Andiry Yusov said that only five bodies had been delivered to the Belgorod morgue. Moscow also said that only three guards escorted five dozen war prisoners, something that contradicts information about earlier prisoner swaps when each Russian guard escorted three or four Ukrainians. “There are way too many inconsistencies,” Fesenko said. To him and other observers, Russia’s claim were reminiscent of the July 2022 incident in the Olinivka camp for war prisoners near the Moscow-occupied city of Donetsk. Moscow claimed that Ukraine launched a US-made HIMARS missile that hit the camp killing 62 and wounding 130 Ukrainians. Pro-Kremlin media claimed that Kyiv deliberately killed the POWs who could have testified about the war crimes they had allegedly committed during the 2022 siege of Mariupol. But Moscow refused to allow finding missions sent by the United Nations and the International Red Cross to enter the facility. Meanwhile, media analyses based on satellite imagery and post-explosion photos and videos of the prison indicated that Russia’s claims were fabricated and the building was destroyed by a bomb blown up inside the building. However, an international observer offered a sobering explanation of how the latest disaster could have been caused by a dire lack of coordination between Ukrainian military agencies. “One military agency was preparing the usually-secret prisoner swap. Another military agency in a no-less-secret mode moved a Patriot or something similar to the Russian border because it knew that something big and heavy was flying beyond it,” Nikolay Mitrokhin of Germany’s Bremen University told Al Jazeera. “And as soon as they saw [the Il-76 plane] on their monitors, it didn’t occur to anyone to call Kyiv and ask whether a prisoner swap was in the works and could [the prisoners] be on that plane,” he said. Meanwhile, a Russian lawmaker claimed that some of the Ukrainian war prisoners on the plane had lambasted Kyiv’s war policies, and that Kyiv deliberately destroyed the plane to warn Ukrainian servicemen not to surrender. “Ukraine created the provocation deliberately so that its nationals don’t surrender,” Russian lawmaker Aleksey Zhuravlyov reportedly said on Wednesday.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/26/propaganda-provocation-did-ukraine-down-a-plane-with-servicemen-aboard

Russian court jails woman for 27 years over killing of pro-Kremlin blogger,"Darya Trepova was found guilty of killing Vladlen Tatarsky, who died in a blast at a St Petersburg cafe in April 2023.","A Russian court has sentenced antiwar activist Darya Trepova to 27 years in prison for killing a prominent ultra-nationalist blogger in an attack that Moscow said was orchestrated by Ukraine. In April last year, Vladlen Tatarskywas killed in a St Petersburg cafeafter Trepova gave him a miniature statue rigged with explosives. As he accepted the gift, the outspoken commentator was killed on the spot. The court in St Petersburg convicted Trepova on “terrorism” charges on Thursday. The 26-year-old defended herself saying she did not purposefully kill Tatarsky, whose real name is Maxim Fomin, but was induced to believe the object she handed him was a secret listening device. Earlier this week, the activist told the court she was acting under orders from a man in Ukraine whom she knew as “Gestalt” (German for “Shape”), who had been sending her money and instructions for several months. “I feel great pain and shame that my gullibility and my naivety led to such catastrophic consequences. I didn’t want to hurt anyone,” Trepova said. Her decision to collaborate with Ukrainians was motivated by her opposition toRussia’s military offensive in Ukraine, she said. More than 30 other people were injured in the blast, which tore off the facade of the St Petersburg cafe. Tremova told the court she had explicitly asked her handler in Ukraine if the statue was a bomb. “I was very scared and asked Gestalt: ‘Isn’t this the same as with Daria Dugina?’” she said, referring to the daughter of an influential pro-war Russian nationalistwho was assassinatedin a car bombing attack in the Russian capital in 2022. Tatarsky was an influential military blogger, one of the most prominent among a group of hardline correspondents that have gained a huge following since Russia launched its offensive in Ukraine in February 2022. They publish exclusive information about the campaign from front-line sources and occasionally criticise Moscow’s military tactics, pushing for a more aggressive assault. Born in eastern Ukraine, Tatarsky was a convicted bank robber who escaped from prison to fight with Russian-backed separatists against Ukraine’s armed forces when the conflict in the east first broke out in 2014. He advocated for a much more aggressive military campaign against Ukraine. Putin posthumously bestowed a top award, the Order of Courage, on Tatarsky, citing his “courage and bravery shown during professional duty”. After his murder, Russian authorities accused Ukraine of orchestrating the killing. Senior Ukrainian officials have neither claimed responsibility nor denied involvement, with presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak describing it as “internal terrorism”. Moscow has accused Ukraine of staging several attacks and assassinations inside Russia, including the killing of Dugina and the failed car bombing attack against pro-Kremlin writer Zakhar Prilepin.

Swedish PM Kristersson agrees to meet Hungary’s Orban for talks on NATO bid,"After ratification by Turkey, Hungary is the only country left effectively holding up Sweden’s NATO membership.","Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson has agreed to meet his counterpart from Hungary, the only NATO member yet to ratify his country’smembership in the military alliance. Swedish public television on Thursday published a letter Kristersson penned to Prime Minister Viktor Orban in which he said he accepted an invitation received this week to meet in Budapest “at a time convenient for both of us”. “The completion of the ratification process of Sweden’s NATO membership in the Hungarian parliament will create a solid foundation to move ahead in our bilateral relationship, and to reinforce mutual understanding and trust,” Kristersson said in the letter. He added that “a more intensive dialogue between our countries would be beneficial”, noting they would also have the opportunity to speak in Brussels on February 1 at a meeting of the European Council. The publication of the letter comes a day after Turkey’s parliamentapprovedSweden’s NATO membership. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is expected to add his signature in the coming days. Kristersson said after the vote in Ankara that Sweden was “one step closer” to joining the alliance. In a post on X on the same day, Orban wrote that his country supports Sweden’s membership and said he would urge lawmakers to approve its accession quickly.

It also  strengthened the defences of three small Baltic countries that joined the bloc after the collapse of the Soviet Union more than three decades ago.

Russia jails nationalist critic Igor Girkin for four years over ‘extremism’,Igor Girkin has accused President Vladimir Putin and the army top brass of not pursuing the Ukraine war effectively enough.,"A court in Russia has convicted prominent nationalist and former rebel commander Igor Girkin of “inciting extremism” and sentenced him to four years in a penal colony. Girkin has repeatedly criticised the Kremlin for its war strategy in Ukraine after Russia’s invasion in February 2022. The Moscow City Court on Thursdaysaid Girkin was guiltyof “public calls to carry out extremist activities”. Also known as Igor Strelkov, Girkin has accused President Vladimir Putin and army top brass of not pursuing theUkraine wareffectively enough. “I serve the Fatherland!” Girkin shouted after the verdict was read out. His followers had gathered outside the court and three of them were detained by police, the AFP news agency reported. “The accusation is absolutely absurd,” said his wife Miroslava Reginskaya. His lawyer Alexander Molokhov called the sentence “an ugly judicial act” that would be appealed immediately. Girkin’s case has been closely watched as an indication of how far the Kremlin would tolerate aggressive criticism of its war effort in Ukraine. Since the start of the conflict, described by Russia as a “special military operation”, the Kremlin has focused on persecuting antiwar activists. He was remanded in custody in July last year after setting up the “Club of Angry Patriots” to save Russia from what he said was the danger of systemic turmoil due to military failures in Ukraine and jostling in the elite to eventually succeed Putin. In one of his most outspoken rants in a post on July 18 on his Telegram channel, followed by more than 760,000 people, Girkin hurled personal insults at Putin and urged him to pass power “to someone truly capable and responsible”. A former officer for Russia’s FSB security service and battlefield commander, Girkin helped Russia to annexCrimea in 2014and, soon after, to organise pro-Russian militias who wrested part of eastern Ukraine out of Kyiv’s control – events that started the current conflict. He was handed a life sentence in absentia by a Dutch court in 2022 for his alleged role in the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flightMH17over eastern Ukraine in 2014, in which all 298 passengers and crew were killed. He denied wrongdoing at the time.   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/25/russia-jails-nationalist-critic-igor-girkin-for-four-years-over-extremism
Ukraine to probe Belgorod crash as Russia questions future prisoner swaps,"Russia claims Ukraine shot down military transport plane in Belgorod, killing 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war on board.","Ukraine has opened a criminal investigation into the downing of a Russian military transport plane that Moscow said killed 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) as the Kremlin raised questions about future prisoner exchanges. On Thursday, the Kremlin said that nobody could say how the IL-76 Russian Air Force plane crash in the Belgorod region would affect prisoner swaps shortly after Ukraine’s PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyaccused Russia of “playing with the lives” of prisoners. Ukraine has not said whether its captured soldiers were killed – or if it was involved – in Wednesday’s shooting down of the plane. In launching the probe, its SBU security service on Thursday said it was “currently taking a range of measures to clarify all the circumstances of the downing”. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called the incident a “monstrous act”. “Nobody can tell you how it would affect the prospects for extending this [exchange] process,” he was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. Russia hasaccused Ukraineof deliberately shooting down the aircraft carrying 65 POWs, six Russian crew members and three Russian soldiers as it travelled to Belgorod, near the border with Ukraine, on Wednesday. While Zelenskyy did not confirm or deny Russia’s claims in his Wednesday address, he said it had been a “very difficult day”. He also called for an international inquiry. “We need to establish all the clear facts. As much as possible, given that the downing of the plane occurred on Russian territory, which is beyond our control,” he said. Al Jazeera’s Rob McBride, reporting from Kyiv, said: “Establishing the truth has been made harder by the secrecy surrounding the highly sensitive exchanges of Russian and Ukrainian prisoners.” A video posted on Telegram by Baza, a channel linked to Russian security services, showed a large aircraft falling and exploding in a vast fireball. According to the Russian Ministry of Defence, the plane was hit as it was travelling from Moscow to Belgorod. Located 40km (25 miles) north of the border with Ukraine,Belgorod has been targetedin recent weeks by Ukrainian air strikes. The ministry claimed, without offering evidence, that radars had detected the launch of two Ukrainian missiles. Russian rescue services cited by the RIA Novosti news agency reported that both black boxes had been recovered from the plane. Russia’s claims were immediately treated with deep suspicion by Ukraine, which accuses it of conducting longstanding disinformation campaigns, said McBride. “Officially Ukraine says it has no evidence of its prisoners of war being on the plane, but a statement by military intelligence has hinted that if they were on board, Russia is responsible for their safety,” he added. “Kyiv also blamed Moscow for not informing it of transport arrangements for [the] prisoner swap and for flying POWs so close to an active war zone,” McBride reported. Ukraine’s GUR military intelligence agency had confirmed a swap was meant to take place, but said it had not been told of how Russia would bring the prisoners to the handover point and said Ukraine had not been asked to ensure airspace security around Belgorod. “On this basis, we may be talking about planned and deliberate actions by Russia to destabilise the situation in Ukraine and weaken international support for our state,” GUR said in a statement on Telegram. This month Russia and Ukraineexchanged hundreds of POWsin the biggest single release of captives since Russia’s invasion began in February 2022. Ukrainian officials said that 230 of its prisoners were released while Russia said 248 of its soldiers were returned after mediation by the United Arab Emirates. While the two sides have gone through several exchanges during the war, swap deals stalled in the latter half of last year. The latest exchange was the first in almost five months. Russian lawmaker Andrei Kartapolov on Thursday toned down the Kremlin’s statement on prisoner swaps, saying that Russia would talk with “even the devil” to bring back its captured soldiers, according to Interfax.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/25/ukraine-probes-plane-crash-accuses-russia-of-playing-with-lives-of-pows

Russian lawmakers approve bill to seize property from army critics,"The State Duma, parliament’s lower house, approved the bill by a 395-3 vote in the first of three required readings.","Russian lawmakers have approved a bill to confiscate properties, money and valuables of anyone convicted of spreading criticism of the Russian army. The State Duma, parliament’s lower house, passed the bill with 395 votes for and three against on Wednesday in the first of three required readings. Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin, who co-authoredthe bill, told lawmakers that the measure was “not enough” to stop the army’s critics. “They live comfortably, renting out property, continuing to receive royalties at the expense of Russian citizens. They use these funds to support the Nazi regime,” Volodin said. “The decision adopted should stop those who commit crimes against the security of our country, who consider it possible to insult our citizens, soldiers and officers, and who support the Nazis,” he added. Since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Moscow has banned any criticism of its military operation and detained thousands of Russians opposing the war. The current charge of spreading “false information” about the army carries ajail sentenceof up to 15 years. Information about the war in Ukraine that does not come from an official source may be deemed “false”. Several writers and activists have received long sentences due to the law, and some have been added to a list of “extremists and terrorists”. But the latest measure aims to further penalise those who speak up about the army and could affect Russians who have fled the country. Russian officials had for months been calling for stricter laws on those who speak critically about the situation in Ukraine, denouncing them as “traitors”. “We are showing goodwill that we are doing this only two years in,” said Andrey Lugovoy, a deputy from Russia’s right-wing Liberal Democratic Party of Russia. Lawmakers also decided to adopt a resolution condemning France for having “mercenaries” in Ukraine after days of tension between the two countries. Last week, Moscow summoned the French ambassador over what it said was Paris’s “growing involvement in the Ukraine conflict”. However, France has denied the allegation and said it has no mercenaries in the war or “anywhere else” and that the claims were part of a disinformation campaign.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/24/russian-lawmakers-approve-bill-to-seize-property-from-army-critics
Drones attack deep in Russia as Medvedev threatens Ukraine’s ‘existence’,"Ukraine attacks military and energy infrastructure in at least three cities deep inside Russia, showing new drone capabilities.","Russia and Ukraine traded deadly aerial attacks on civilian centres in the past week of the war, but Ukraine also scored hits on military and economic infrastructure deep in the Russian heartland, extending its reach to St Petersburg for the first time. Ukrainian military intelligence said it had struck an unspecified military target in St Petersburg on Thursday, using drones launched from Ukrainian soil. Ukrainian strategic industries minister Oleksandr Kamyshin confirmed the attack, telling theWorld Economic Forum in Davosthat the attack was carried out by a Ukrainian-built drone that had travelled 1,250km (780 miles) from Ukrainian soil. Russia’s defence ministry said three drones had been launched and it had downed all three over the Gulf of Finland that day, one near an oil terminal. On Sunday, Ukraine attacked again in several locations, and this time, the evidence of its success was clear. Russian gas producer Novatek said it was suspending operations at a plant and loading terminal in the port of Ust-Luga near St Petersburg, following a fire, which Ukrainian media credited to due to a drone attack, citing Security Service (SBU) sources. Novatek said it had resumed loading on Wednesday, but plant operations could take weeks or months to return to normal, analysts said. This meant the company would lose money, exporting low-value gas condensate rather than processed naphtha, jet fuel and gasoil. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said aerial defences were being strengthened following the attack. Ukraine also claimed to have attacked the Shcheglovsky Val plant in Tula, 150km (93 miles) south of Moscow, which reportedly manufactures the Pantsir-S and Pantsir-S1 air defence systems. Geolocated footage also showed smoke rising from the city of Smolensk, near the Russian border with Belarus, suggesting a possible third attack that day. Ukraine has been developing its own long-range aerial and surface drones at least since the middle of last year, when it attacked several military targets in Crimea and the Black Sea. Unlike donated Western weapons, they do not carry restrictions about their use on Russian soil. Ukrainian National Defence and Security Council Secretary Oleksiy Danilov claimed that Ukraine was among the top three drone manufacturers in the world. Ukraine is suspected of being responsible for the shelling of Donetsk city in its occupied east, which killedat least 27 peopleon Sunday, although it did not claim the attack. Russia has routinely targeted Ukrainian cities, and did so again with deadly results. Kharkiv bore the heaviest toll. Russian missiles killed 18 people and injured an estimated 130 in various cities on Tuesday, but eight of the dead were in Kharkiv, said its mayor, which suffered three waves of attacks. At least 100 high-rise blocks had been hit in the city. Ukraine defended its airspace from the repeated attacks. It shot down 19 out of 20 Shahed drones last Wednesday, 22 out of 33 drones on Thursday, and four out of seven drones on Saturday. In each case, Russia also used a small number of missiles, as it has been doing for months, copying a Ukrainian tactic designed to overload air defence systems. A Pentagon official said these were probing attacks as Russia looked for weaknesses in defences. “They’ve not succeeded so far. Ukrainians have a lot of experience over the last few years on how to cope with these kinds of Russian assaults,” Celeste Wallander, an assistant secretary of defense, told reporters. What made Tuesday’s attack different was that Russia used no drones. It launched 44 missiles of various types, half of which Ukraine intercepted, mostly over Kyiv. Ukraine’s Western allies continued to pledge weapons and ammunition, forecasting a third year of war, as defiant Russian rhetoric left little hope of negotiations any time soon. “The existence of Ukraine is mortally dangerous for Ukrainians,” wrote Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia’s powerful Security Council, on the Telegram messaging app. “The presence of an independent state on historical Russian territories will now be a constant reason for the resumption of hostilities,” he said, elucidating an irredentist policy towards all of Ukraine. “There is a 100 percent probability of a new conflict,” Medvedev said, even if Ukraine entered the EU and NATO. “This could happen in ten or fifty years.” Some in Europe took Russia at its word. “We hear threats from the Kremlin almost every day … so we have to take into account that Vladimir Putin might even attack a NATO country one day,” German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius told Tagesspiegel. “Our experts expect a period of five to eight years in which this could be possible,” Pistorius said. It was the latest in a series of ominous warnings. NATO’s military committeechief calledfor a “warfighting transformation” of NATO two weeks ago. And the commander-in-chief of Sweden, which came a step closer to NATO membership when Turkey’s parliament ratified its bid on Tuesday, last week told Swedes to prepare for war. Even Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who as recently as last September was saying Russia was ready for talks, said Russia “will achieve the goals of its ‘special military operation’ consistently and persistently.” Accordingly, Western governments have been stepping up ammunition production. Varying estimates give Russia an advantage of between 5:1 and 10:1 in artillery shells. There is concern that disparity could harm Ukraine’s stout defence. During the past week, for example, Ukraine has retreated some hundreds of yards in Kharkiv, where Russia has been assaulting the front lines relentlessly.    European internal market commissioner Thierry Breton said on Saturday that EU defence industries would be capable of producing a million artillery shells a year by April, up to 1.4 million by the end of the year and more next year. Defence industries have complained that they cannot increase production unless governments provide long-term contracts, and NATO on Tuesday made up for some of this shortfall with a $1.2bn contract to two manufacturers for 200,000 rounds of artillery ammunition. The NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA) struck the deal on behalf of allies who will either pass on the shells to Ukraine or use them to stock up their own depleted inventories. Polandbecame the latest EU member to sign a bilateral 2024 defence agreement with Ukraine on Monday, following Germany, Estonia and Latvia. Germany announced it would provide six Sea King helicopters to monitor coastal waters. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he expected a number of “strong” defence packages for Ukraine to be signed “on specific dates” this month and next These bilateral agreements have ignored a Hungarian veto to a four-year, 50-billion-euro EU financial support plan for Ukraine, and a 20-billion-euro defence support plan this year that would reimburse members for some of their donations. European lawmakers also took a step towards depriving Hungary of its voting rights in the EU last Thursday [January 18] when they asked the European Council of government leaders to look into whether Hungary had “committed serious and persistent breaches of EU values”. Suspending a member’s vote is possible under Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union, but it has never been invoked before.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/24/drones-strike-deep-in-russia-as-medvedev-threatens-ukraines-existence
Zelenskyy says Russia ‘playing with lives’ of Ukrainian POWs after crash,"Comments come after Russia accused Ukraine of shooting down transport plane, killing 65 Ukrainian POWs on board.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused Russia of “playing with the lives of Ukrainian prisoners” over the crash of a military transport plane that Moscow blamed on Ukraine. The Ilyushin Il-76 came down in the Russian border region of Belgorod on Wednesday, killing everyone on board. The Russian Ministry of Defence said 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) were on the plane in preparation for a prisoner swap, as well as six Russian crew and three Russian soldiers. “It is obvious that the Russians are playing with the lives of Ukrainian prisoners, with the feelings of their relatives and with the emotions of our society,” Zelenskyy said in his Wednesday evening address. He did not confirm or deny Russia’s claims, but said it had been a “very difficult day”. “We need to establish all the clear facts. As much as possible, given that the downing of the plane occurred on Russian territory, which is beyond our control,” he said. According to the Russian Ministry of Defence, the plane was hit as it was travelling from a military aerodrome near Moscow to Belgorod. Close to the border with Ukraine, Belgorod has been targeted in recent weeks by Ukrainian air strikes. The ministry claimed, without offering evidence, that radars had detected the launch of two Ukrainian missiles.    “On board were 65 captured Ukrainian army servicemen being transported to the Belgorod region for exchange, six crew members and three escorts,” state news agency RIA Novosti quoted the defence ministry as saying. It did not provide any evidence for the claim. A few hours afterwards, the Ukrainian military said it had noticed more Russian military transport aircraft landing in Belgorod, something it linked to continued Russian missile strikes on Kharkiv and other Ukrainian cities. “Ukraine has the right to defend itself and destroy the means of the aggressors’ aerial attack,” said Air Force Commander Mykola Oleshchuk. The Kremlin told reporters that it was investigating the reports on the plane, as Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called for an urgent meeting of the United Nations Security Council, saying Russia aimed to establish “the reasons behind the Ukrainian criminal act”. A French spokesperson at the UN said the meeting would be held at 5pm (22:00 GMT) on Thursday. Zelenskyy also called for an international investigation into the crash. Ukraine’s intelligence agency said in a statement it had no “reliable or comprehensive information” on who was on board the plane or in what number”. Andriy Yusov, a representative of the Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence, said that an exchange of prisoners between Russia and Ukraine had been prepared for Wednesday, Ukraine’s state broadcaster Suspilne reported, citing Radio Free Europe, a media outlet based in the Czech Republic. Yusov added that the prisoner exchange would not be going ahead. Military intelligence also said that Ukraine had not been asked to ensure airspace security around Belgorod in contrast to previous swaps and had not been informed about what means of transport would be used and which routes. “On this basis, we may be talking about planned and deliberate actions by Russia to destabilise the situation in Ukraine and weaken international support for our state,” it said in a statement on Telegram. A video posted on Telegram by Baza, a channel linked to Russian security services, showed a large aircraft falling and exploding in a fireball. Regional Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on social media that investigators and emergency workers had already arrived at a site in the Korochansky, a district in Belgorod Oblast. “The plane fell in a field near a populated area. Everyone on board died,” Gladkov said on his Telegram channel. The Il-76 is designed to airlift troops, cargo, military equipment and weapons. It usually has a crew of five and can carry as many as 90 passengers.  Kharkiv and Kyiv came under Russian aerial assault on Tuesday,killing at least 18 people. In December, Russia accused Ukraine of carrying out a “terrorist attack” on civilians in the city of Belgorod, after25 peoplewere killed. Last week, the Kremlin accused Kyiv ofkilling 27 peoplein an attack on the Russian-occupied Ukrainian city of Donetsk.

At least 18 killed in wave of Russian missile attacks on Ukraine,Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy promises strong response as rescuers scour rubble for survivors in sub-zero temperatures.,"At least 18 people have been killed and more than 130 injured after Russia hit Ukraine’s biggest cities with waves of missiles. Speaking in a sombre evening address, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia had launched some 40 missiles of varying types. More than 200 sites were hit, including 139 homes, with many deaths in “an ordinary high-rise apartment building”, Zelenskyy said. “Ordinary people lived there.” He promised a strong response. “The Russian war will inevitably be brought back home, back to where this evil came from, where it must be quelled,” he said. The northeastern city of Kharkiv suffered three waves of attacks. There were also attacks on the capital Kyiv and in central Ukraine while the southern region of Kherson was subject to constant shelling. Oleksandra Terekhovich ran into the corridor of her home in Kharkiv when she heard the first explosion. The second blast hit the building next door, shattering her windows and door, she said. “There are no more tears. Our country has been going through what has been happening for two years now. We live with horror inside of us,” she told the AFP news agency. The relentless Russian bombardment has kept Ukrainians on edge while the 1,500km (930 mile) front line, where soldiers are engaged in trench and artillery warfare, has barely moved. Analysts say Russia stockpiled missiles at the end of last year in preparation for the latest campaign that a US official said was an attempt to probe the weaknesses in Ukraine’s air defences. Kharkiv regional Governor Oleh Syniehubov said more than 100 high-rise apartment blocks had been damaged in the first two attacks on the city, with Russia using S-300, Kh-32 and hypersonic Iskander missiles. An attack later on Tuesday evening also hit a residential building and other infrastructure, causing more injuries. The city’s mayor, Ihor Terekhov, said people were trapped in the rubble with temperatures at -7C (19.4F). In Kyiv, emergency services said the destruction spread across four districts. At one site, rescuers tended to dazed and groaning residents as workers swept away debris and broken glass. “There was a very loud bang, and my mother was already running outside, shouting that we need to leave. We all went to the corridor,” 21-year-old Daniel Boliukh told the Reuters news agency. “Then, we went on the balcony to have a look and saw all these buildings were on fire.” Emergency services said apartment buildings as well as medical and educational institutions were damaged in the capital. Some of the damage occurred next to the United Nations office, resident coordinator Denise Brown said in a statement. Pavlohrad, an industrial city in the eastern Dnipro region, also came under attack. One person was killed and two schools and eight high-rise buildings were damaged, according to the presidential office. Ukraine’s General Staff said the country’s armed forces had destroyed 22 of the missiles with nearly 20 shot down over Kyiv, the city’s military administration said. The recent Russian attacks represent “an alarming reversal” of a trend last year, which saw a drop in civilian casualties from Kremlin attacks, according to the UN. More than 10,000 civilians have been killed and nearly 20,000 injured since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, the UN said. The Kremlin denied it targeted civilians in Wednesday’s bombardment.

Ukraine war ‘a battle of ammo’ says NATO as it agrees huge arms deal,Alliance seeks to bulk up Ukraine’s dwindling arsenal as Russia ramps up attacks.,"NATO has signed a large ammunition deal that it says would help it supply Ukraine with desperately needed stocks. The military alliance announced on Tuesday that it has signed a deal worth 1.1 billion euros ($1.2bn) to buy artillery shells. The move comes amid intensified exchanges of fire between Russia and Ukraine since the end of last year, which have depleted the latter’s weapons stockpiles. NATO greenlit the purchase of 220,000 rounds of 155mm ammunition, the most widely sought-after artillery shell, noting that bulk buying for member states should ensure lower prices. Sources said the ammunition would be supplied by French arms maker Nexter and Germany’s Junghans. “This is important to defend our own territory, to build up our own stocks, but also to continue to support Ukraine,” said NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. “The war in Ukraine has become a battle of ammunition,” he told reporters. “We cannot allow President [Vladimir] Putin to win in Ukraine … That would be a tragedy for the Ukrainians and dangerous for all of us.” As progress on the front line has stalled in recent months, Russia and Ukraine have doubled down on exchanges of fire using artillery, missiles and drones. However, Russia’s arms industry far outweighs Ukraine’s and Kyiv isstruggling to secureboth financing and weapons supplies from its Western allies needed to continue competing with Moscow’s firepower. According to European Union estimates, Ukraine was firing approximately 4,000 to 7,000 artillery shells each day last summer, while Russia was launching more than 20,000 shells daily in its neighbour’s territory. Drawing on its deep stockpiles, Russia has in recent weeksconcentrated on air raidsin a bid to drain Ukraine’s air defence systems. Officials in Kyiv say Russia launched 500 drones and missiles between December 29 and January 2. Ukraine and its allies are scrambling to keep up. Kyiv has said it intends to produce one million drones in 2024. Although the European Union fell short of its pledge to supply one million artillery rounds in 2023, officials have said that they expect the European defence industry to raise production by the end of this year. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Monday was the latest foreign leader to visit the country, announcing a loan to buy larger weapons and commitments on joint manufacturing. However, NATO noted that the shells bought under the new deal will not arrive for two to three years. And the United States, Ukraine’s main supplier, is currently unable to send Ukraine any ammunition or weapons as it waits for approval from Congress on budgetary needs. Russia launched its latest air assault against Ukraine on Tuesday, killing at least seven people, according to the UN and Ukrainian authorities. Ukraine said that the air raids included more than 40 ballistic, cruise, antiaircraft and guided missiles, in what the United Nations said appeared to be the heaviest bombardment since early January, when hundreds of Ukrainian civilians were killed. The recent Russian bombardment was “an alarming reversal” of a trend last year that saw a drop in civilian casualties from Kremlin attacks, the UN said. More than 10,000 civilians have been killed and nearly 20,000 injured since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, the UN said. Tuesday’s onslaught in Kharkiv, in northeastern Ukraine, killed six people and injured 57, including eight children, the UN said. The missiles damaged about 30 residential buildings and shattered hundreds of windows in icy weather, regional governor Oleh Syniehubov said. Russia used S-300, Kh-32 and hypersonic Iskander missiles in the attack, he said. A five-storey apartment building appeared to have been directly hit by several missiles around dawn, the UN Human Rights Mission in Ukraine said in a statement. An unknown number of people were trapped in the rubble with the temperature falling to minus seven degrees Celsius (19 degrees Fahrenheit), said Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov. Kharkiv, about 30 kilometres (18 miles) from the border, has often felt the brunt of Russia’s winter campaign of long-range attacks that often hit civilian areas. Four districts of Kyiv came under an attack that injured at least 20 people, including a 13-year-old boy, according to Mayor Vitalii Klitschko. Officials corrected initial reports that a civilian had been killed in the capital, saying the wounded person was hospitalised on life support. UN staff visited a Kyiv neighbourhood with a damaged residential building, a school, a sports centre and a kindergarten. A missile also killed a 43-year-old woman and damaged two schools and eight high-rise buildings in Pavlohrad, an industrial city in the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region, the country’s presidential office said. In Balakliya, in the Kharkiv region, an 88-year-old man and a 78-year-old woman were rescued from the rubble of a house after Russian shelling, it said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/23/nato-head-warns-war-in-ukraine-a-battle-of

Russian lawmakers consider bill to seize property of Ukraine war critics,The bill would allow the state to seize property from Russians who might have left the country and criticised the war in Ukraine.,"Russia’s parliament has begun considering abillthat would give the state the power to seize the property of those convicted of defamation of the security forces. “The State Duma has introduced amendments to the Criminal and Criminal Procedure Codes on the confiscation of property for public calls for activities directed against the security of the state, for discrediting the army and a number of other articles,” a statement by the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, said on Monday. The statement said multiple officials, including Vyacheslav Volodin, the speaker of the State Duma, co-authored the bill. The bill would allow the state to seize property from Russians who might have left the country and have criticised the war in Ukraine but still rely on revenue from renting out their houses or apartments in Russia. Since the beginning of the war in February 2022, criticising what Moscow calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine has effectively become a crime. Still, the new bill aims to make penalties harsher. Volodin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, has called the new bill “the scoundrel law”. “Everyone who tries to destroy Russia, betrays it, must suffer the deserved punishment and compensate for the damage inflicted on the country at the cost of their property,” Volodin said. He added that under the law, those found guilty of “discrediting” the army also face being stripped of honorary titles. The existing law against “discrediting” the Russian military, which covers offences such as “justifying terrorism” and spreading “fake news” about the army, is regularly used to target Putin’s critics. Multiple activists, bloggers and other Russians have received lengthy jail terms due to the law. Last month, Russian state media reported that one of the country’s best-selling novelists, Boris Akunin, had been charged under the law and added to a register of “extremists and terrorists”. Another famous writer, Dmitry Glukhovsky, was given an eight-year sentence in absentia after a Moscow court found him guilty of spreading false information about the army in August.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/22/russian-lawmakers-consider-bill-to-seize-property-of-ukraine-war-critics
Poland’s Tusk says Ukraine-Russia war a fight ‘between good and evil’,Donald Tusk meets President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv as Ukraine’s war with Russia nears two years.,"Poland’s Prime Minister Donald Tusk has promised to keep supporting Ukraine against Russia’s invasion and to resolve differences between Warsaw and Kyiv over grain shipments and trucking that soured ties between the neighbours. “Poland will do everything to increase Ukraine’s chances of victory in this war,” Tusk said at a joint media briefing with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv on Monday. “I am not ashamed to use these big words: it is here, in Ukraine, that the world front between good and evil runs,” he added. Tusk and Zelenskyy also hailed plans between their countries for joint arms production. On the social media platform X, Zelenskyy said that they had discussed “a new form of cooperation aimed at larger-scale arms purchases for Ukrainian needs.” Today, we had very productive talks in Kyiv with@DonaldTuskabout all aspects of Ukrainian-Polish bilateral relations. We appreciate Poland's unwavering support and the new military aid package for Ukraine, as well as a new form of cooperation aimed at larger-scale arms…pic.twitter.com/m5QCm67acD — Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa)January 22, 2024  Warsaw has emerged as a key ally for Kyiv as it defends itself against Russia and seeks more financial and military support from Western partners. Poland has also taken in more than one million Ukrainian refugees. Relations between the two had deteriorated last year as economic competition from Ukrainian food producers and truckers angered Poles who said their livelihoods were under threat. Polish farmers and truckers blocked border crossings, causing backups and threatening the flow of some aid to Ukraine. Polish farmers complained that imports of Ukrainian foods had caused prices to fall, hurting their incomes, while truckers said they were being undercut by their Ukrainian counterparts. The issue surfaced during the war as Ukrainian ports were blocked and food producers turned to road routes through Europe to get their products to market. The Polish truckersagreed last weekto suspend protests, which had been aimed at revoking Ukrainian truckers’ permit-free access to the European Union, until March 1. “There are some conflicts of interest, we know it well, and we will talk about them, but not only in the spirit of friendship, which is obvious, but with the attitude to solve these problems as soon as possible, not to maintain or multiply them,” Tusk said, according to comments released by his office. Tusk’s visit coincides with Ukraine’s Unity Day holiday, which celebrates the unification of western and eastern Ukraine in 1919. The visit also came as Zelenskyy announced draft legislation that could pave the way for foreigners fighting against Russia in his country to receive Ukrainian citizenship. The bill would formally allow Ukrainians to gain dual citizenship, with the exception of Russia. Thousands of foreigners rushed at the beginning of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to help fend off Moscow’s forces trying to wrest control of the country and topple Ukraine’s leadership. Meanwhile, the Kremlin on Monday blamed Ukraine for anattackthat started a fire over the weekend at a gas terminal at the Baltic port of Ust-Luga, more than 850km (530 miles) from the Ukraine border.    The gas facility belonging to Novatek, Russia’s largest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG), was set ablaze on Sunday in the western port town, close to Russia’s border with Estonia. “The Kyiv regime continues to show its bestial face. They are striking civil infrastructure, people,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday when asked about the incident. Tusk’s visit came a day after Moscow-installed officials in eastern Ukraine reported that Ukrainian shellingkilled at least 27 peopleon the outskirts of a Russian-occupied city. Peskov called the shelling outside Donetsk a “monstrous terrorist act”. The Ukrainian military denied it had anything to do with the attack. The two sides’ claims could not immediately be verified. Ukraine’s allies have in recent weeks sought to reassure the country that they are committed to its long-term defence against the Kremlin’s forces amid concerns that Western support could be sagging. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and France’s new Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne also travelled to Kyiv recently.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/22/poland-pm-visits-ukraine-in-latest-show-of-solidarity-in-war-against-russia
‘I no longer have a country’: Antiwar Russians who fled unlikely to return,Huge waves of Russians left after the Ukraine war began. Many still feel a sense of guilt over the conflict.,"Evgeniy Kosgorov, a 38-year-old from Krasnodar, left Russia in June 2022 with his wife and a one-month-old son in his arms. Since the invasion of Ukraine, he has seen his homeland as a villainous state bound to follow the path of Nazi Germany, a country with no future and one he wanted nothing to do with. But even in Tbilisi, Georgia’s capital and his adopted home, Russia kept haunting him. His passport and language identify him as a citizen of an aggressor state – someone who preferred to leave than confront the government. He has also been seen as someone who did not react when Russia was becoming the country it is now. “I understand perfectly well the general hatred for Russians and for everything Russian. I accept and understand it because what Russia is doing is wrong,” Kosgorov told Al Jazeera. “Every time I want to say that it’s difficult for the Russians who left, something inside me protests, because Ukrainians have it more difficult than us.” According to estimates, up to one million out of some 144 million Russians left the country in 2022 and 2023 in what has been the largest brain drain since the collapse of the Soviet Union. In a newstudy, based on several rounds of interviews with close to 10,000 Russian political exiles, Russian researchers Ivetta Sergeeva and Emil Kamalov found that 49 percent of respondents felt strong guilt for the war, while 59 percent felt strongly responsible for it. As the research suggests, most Russians left because of their opposition to the war in Ukraine and the ever-present narratives that portrayed Russia as a noble country fighting against Ukrainian “fascists”. They also expected further army mobilisation drives, further internal repressions, and a potential economic crisis. The research was conducted in waves, in March 2022, September 2022 and in May–July 2023. The department of political and social sciences at the European University Institute in Florence provided funding for preliminary work. Many decided to settle in countries from the former Soviet bloc, which continue having favourable regulations for Russians to live and work. Countries like Georgia, Armenia and Kazakhstan have already felt the economic and demographic effects of the mass influx of Russians, including rising prices. To many locals, it also brought back memories of Russia’s colonial past. But as the study suggests, fleeing Russia was not enough to escape its long shadow, as Kosgorov has found out. After a few months in Tbilisi, he opened UGallery, a bar with an art space where he hosts antiwar-themed exhibitions and organises fundraisers for Ukraine. But he has struggled to find peace. “I no longer have a country, I no longer have a homeland,” Kosgorov said. “This is a trivial, simple thing. But what I want is to feel the ground under my feet, and to understand what tomorrow will bring.” He donates his revenues to NGOs supporting Ukrainian refugees and has gathered a large community of like-minded people, but he knows that not everyone in Georgia welcomes the Russian arrivals; anti-Russian messages can be found graffitied on walls all around Tbilisi. But Kosgorov does not complain, because he does not feel he has a right to. He does acknowledge, however, that some of the criticism Russian exiles receive abroad is ill-founded. One of the arguments that he often hears is that they should all return home and dethrone President Vladimir Putin in a mass revolution. “If you look at the history, peaceful protests seldom brought autocracies down, contrary to military coups. Putin will not disappear from the simple fact that all these migrants who had left go back to Russia and stage a protest. Russia would simply have more political prisoners,” Kosgorov said. Sergey, a 40-year-old from Moscow who requested to withhold his full name, also feels guilty and hopeless at times. He left Russia in October 2022 with the help of his friends, who lent him money for a plane ticket to Yerevan, Armenia’s capital. “I certainly feel personal responsibility for what is going on. Russia has turned into a machine for destroying people’s lives. Both abroad and inside the country,” Sergey said. “And this did not happen overnight on February 24 [2022].” He managed to keep his job and now works remotely from Yerevan while feeling that nothing in his life is certain. What helps him deal with his emotional state is writing letters to Russian political prisoners he knew back in Moscow. “There are people who are worse off than me, who were imprisoned unfairly based on trumped-up charges,” he said. “Everyone is depressed. I don’t know how many Russian exiles are on antidepressants, but I am. There is an understanding that there are no clear prospects for us and that we must take each day as it comes.” According to Margarita Zavadskaya, a Finland-based political scientist who researches Russian political exiles, the latest wave of migration from Russia differs from previous instances in that it is more politicised. People trust each other more and form stronger communities, they are not afraid to speak up, and they get involved in activism, she said, which helps them regain dignity and a sense of purpose. “People feel depressed. They feel guilt, shame, sometimes anger. And they are trying to find themselves and reinvent themselves in the new circumstances,” she told Al Jazeera. “The irony of the situation is that the guilt is being felt by those who are against the regime and understand the scale of the tragedy.” Unlike previous migration waves, the new voluntary exiles are also more privileged, if not financially, then when it comes to resources they have at their disposal – knowledge, education, and creativity. They can survive and thrive outside of Russia, she said, and are also unlikely to go back home. When asked if they would like to return to Russia, both Evgeniy Kosgorov and Sergey took time to reply. Their answers were similar. They might return one day when the war is over, if and when Russia pays reparations to Ukraine, and when Putin’s administration is gone. Neither believes any of these events will happen in the foreseeable future.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/22/russian-exiles-unlikely-to-return
Russia hands down criminal charges following rare large protest,"Activists in Bashkortostan face 15 years in prison on charges of organising ‘mass riots’, assaulting public officials.","Russian authorities have laid serious criminal charges against four people following a large protest in the central region of Bashkortostan. Security forces in the city of Ufa, in the Urals mountains, arrested the fourth suspect on Sunday evening, local media reported. The charges follow protests by thousands last week over the jailing of an Indigenous rights activist. Police were swift to crack down on what was arare large showing of dissentin Russia since Moscow’s war against Ukraine started. Dim Davletkildin was detained after being summoned by police in the town of Baymak, the scene of the rally, which was sparked by the sentencing on Wednesday of Fail Alsynov to four years in a penal colony. Among the charges faced by Alsynov’s fellow activists are organisation of “mass riots” and assault of public officials, reported the OVN-Info monitoring group. The charges carry a potential sentence of 15 years. OVD-Info added that authorities have already opened dozens of lesser administrative cases, accusing demonstrators of joining unsanctioned rallies. The same court in Baymak, 1,400km (870 miles) east of Moscow, that last week sentenced Alsynov for inciting ethnic hatred has jailed several people for eight to 15 days for taking part in the protest, which saw police pelted with snowballs. The authorities responded with tear gas. The charges against Alsynov followed a speech he delivered last year as locals opposed plans for the development of a gold mine. The regional governor said the activist had made racist comments about people from Central Asia and the Caucasus. Alsynov claims that his words were mistranslated from the Bashkir language. The protesters said the verdict was delayed revenge for his role in protests years prior, when activists successfully blocked plans to mine for soda on a hill considered sacred by locals.    Large protests are rare in Russia due to the risks of arrests. Thousands of people have been detained in the past two years for opposingthe war. Often coming from regions with few economic prospects, Indigenous peoples from across Russia have been actively courted by recruitment officials and heavily represented in the ranks that Russia has sent to the front line in Ukraine. Alsynov was fined last year for criticising the invasion online, saying the war was not in Bashkortostan’s interests. He heads Bashkort, a grassroots movement working to preserve the culture, language and ethnic identity of the region’s people that was banned as an “extremist organisation” in 2020. Bashkortostan is an oil-producing region of 4.1 million people and is one of more than 80 entities that make up the Russian Federation. The Bashkir ethnic minority are among Russia’s 260,000 people who are recognised as Indigenous to Russia. Indigenous peoples living in Russia have long fought for their rights and to protect their traditional territory, which is often located in areas that are used for natural resource extraction, such as mining.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/22/russia-hands-down-criminal-charges-following-rare-large-protest

Russia says at least 27 killed in blast at Donetsk market,Authorities in Russian-occupied Donetsk accuse Ukraine of shelling a market on outskirts of city.,"At least 27 people have been killed and 25 injured after a market on the outskirts of the Russian-occupied city of Donetsk was shelled, local authorities said. Denis Pushilin, the head of the Moscow-installed authorities in Donetsk, blamed the attack on the suburb of Tekstilshchik on the Ukrainian military. Pushilin said that the area had been hit by 155mm calibre and 152mm calibre artillery and that the shells had been fired from the direction of Kurakhove and Krasnohorivka to the west. He announced a day of mourning on Monday. “These terrorist attacks by the Kyiv regime clearly demonstrate its lack of political will towards achieving peace and the settlement of this conflict by diplomatic means,” Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. There was no immediate comment from Ukraine. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres “strongly condemns all attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure, including today’s shelling of the city of Donetsk in Ukraine”, according to a UN spokesperson, adding that all such attacks were prohibited under international humanitarian law. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy did not address Tekstilshchik in his nightly video address but said that in a single day, Russia had shelled more than 100 cities, towns and villages in nine regions of Ukraine, and that the attacks in Donetsk region had been “particularly severe”. Ukraine’s forces in the Tavria, or southern zone, said in a Facebook post that soldiers under its command were not responsible for the market shelling. “Donetsk is Ukraine!” it said. “Russia will have to answer for taking lives of Ukrainians.” Moscow-backed separatists have controlled the southeastern Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, known collectively as the Donbas, since 2014. Russian President Vladimir Putin “recognised” them as separate republics shortly before launching his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and they were among four Ukrainian regionsRussia annexedin September 2022, in a movecondemnedas illegal at the United Nations General Assembly. Separately on Sunday, Russia’s Ministry of Defence said the country’s forces had taken control of the village of Krokhmalne in Ukraine’s northeastern Kharkiv region. Volodymyr Fityo, the spokesperson for the Ukrainian Ground Forces Command, told reporters that Kyiv’s forces had withdrawn from the area. Fityo said that Krokhmalne had a population of roughly 45 people before the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Reporting from Kyiv, Al Jazeea’s Rob McBride said Ukrainian authorities played down the significance of the withdrawal. “They [Ukrainians] say this was a small village and they gave up only a couple of kilometres to the Russians… they say it was of little consequence for the overall situation,” Al Jazeera’s McBride said. As Russia’s war in Ukraine nears its two-year mark, both Moscow and Kyiv’s forces have continued to fight from largely static positions along the roughly 1,500km (930-mile) front line throughout the winter. Recent Russian attacks have also tried to find gaps in Ukraine’s defences by using large numbers of various types of missiles in an apparent effort to saturate air defence systems.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/21/russia-says-at-least-25-killed-in-blast-at-donetsk-market

Russian lawmakers to debate seizing property of those who ‘discredit’ army,A bill to be voted on next week aims to confiscate assets of Russians spreading ‘deliberately false’ information amid Ukraine war.,"Russia’s parliament will consider a law allowing for the confiscation of money, valuables and other property from those deemed to spread “deliberately false information” about Moscow’s military actions, a senior lawmaker has said. Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the State Duma, wrote in a Telegram post on Saturday that a bill has been developed in an attempt to punish “scoundrels” who “pour mud” on Russia and its soldiers participating in thewar in Ukraine, which is approaching its two-year mark. He said the bill will be submitted to the Duma, which is Russia’s lower house of parliament, on Monday. The proposed measure would apply to those publicly inciting “extremist activities” or calling for the introduction ofsanctions against Russia, the speaker explained. It would also be applicable to those “discrediting” the armed forces, a criminal offence under a law adopted as part ofMoscow’s crackdown on dissentafter it sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022. Those found guilty also face being stripped of any honorary titles. “Everyone who tries to destroy Russia, betrays it, must suffer the deserved punishment and compensate for the damage inflicted on the country, at the cost of their property,” Volodin said. The existing law against “discrediting” the Russian military, which covers offences such as “justifying terrorism” and spreading “fake news” about the armed forces, is regularly used to silence critics of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Multiple activists, bloggers and general Russian citizens have received long jail terms under the existing law. Popular writerDmitry Glukhovskywas handed an eight-year jail term in absentia after a Moscow court found him guilty in August of deliberately spreading false information about Russia’s armed forces. One of the country’s bestselling novelists, known under the pen nameBoris Akunin, was charged under the law and added to the Russian register of “extremists and terrorists”. In November, a court in St Petersburg jailed Sasha Skochilenko, an artist and musician, for seven years for swapping supermarket price tags with antiwar messages. The month before, Russian blogger Aleksandr Nozdrinov received an 8.5-year term for posting photos of destroyed buildings in Kyiv, along with a caption implying that Russian troops were responsible. Meanwhile, attacks on the ground continue. On Saturday, Russian forces shelled the southern Ukrainian town of Huliaipole, local governor Yuriy Malashko wrote on Telegram. Earlier, regional Ukrainian officials reported that one person was killed when Russian forces shelled the southern Kherson region overnight. In southern Russia, close to the Ukrainian border, an exploding drone hit a gas pipeline on the outskirts of the city of Belgorod, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov reported on Telegram, blaming Ukraine for the attack. The European Union said it will drastically increase ammunition production this year in response to Ukraine’s growing pleas for support. It also aimed to impose a new round of sanctions on Russia next month to mark the second anniversary of Moscow’s invasion, adding to its previous 12 rounds of sanctions.

Palestinians in Ukraine decry ‘double standard’ as Kyiv supports Israel,"Ukraine has supported Israel throughout the latest conflict, upsetting Palestinians as war ravages Gaza.","Names marked with an asterisk* have been changed to protect identities. When Russia launched a full-scale war on Ukraine on February 24, 2022, Amer Aroggi, a 30-year-old journalist based in the Gaza Strip, felt compelled to report on the European conflict. Having lived through the Israeli occupation, he felt he could relate to the plight of the Ukrainians. The move was seamless, especially because his older brother had lived in Ukraine for many years. Aroggi quickly secured a new role for himself as a correspondent for a prominent news channel. Less than two years later, war broke out again in his homeland with the latest escalation of the Israel-Palestine conflict. To some observers, there were parallels between Russia and Israel and Ukraine and the Palestinians. But in a swift and unequivocal response to the outbreak of the war in Gaza, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy threw his support behind Israel, like much of theUkrainian population, and almost all Western leaders. “I saw a double standard. … The world helped the Ukrainians, and no one helped us. No one even helped me evacuate my mother and sister out of Gaza,” Aroggi told Al Jazeera. Ukrainians were the “victims of massive propaganda” during the first stages of the war, which is why they often supported Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, according to Aroggi. He said he would like to leave but is unable to because he has a Palestinian passport. He spends his days glued to the TV, fearing for his family in Gaza. “My mother asks me, ‘Are you OK? Is there a Russian bombing?’ I say to her, ‘Are you OK? Is there an Israeli bombing?'”    The latest escalation of the Israel-Palestine conflict began on October 7 when Hamas attacked southern Israel, killing 1,139 people and triggering a violent response. At this point in the war, at least 24,762 Palestinians had been reported killed by Israeli forces in Gaza. While Israel has said it aims to wipe out Hamas, which governs the besieged enclave, the toll on civilians and its conduct have been heavily criticised. Ukrainian first lady Olena Zelenska said on October 7 that Ukrainians understand and “share the pain” of the Israeli people as billboards across Kyiv lit up the capital with Israeli flags. Hashem*, a medical professional from Gaza who relocated to Ukraine nine years ago, remained resolute in his allegiance to his adopted home when Russia invaded Ukraine. Yet the Ukrainian reaction to Israel’s offensive in Gaza left him grappling with conflicting emotions in the initial months of the war, particularly since “Ukraine suffers from occupation like Palestine”, he said. The prevailing narrative in the national media favours Israel and influences public sentiment, he said. Hashem also suffered personally. He said he received threats and discriminatory messages full of hate from individuals who learned he was from Gaza but residing in Ukraine. Even so, he plans to stay in Ukraine. Now more than three months into the Middle East war, Hashem and Aroggi said they have witnessed some changes in public opinion. The constant stream of images of death and destruction in Gaza has had an impact, leading some Ukrainians to start openly criticising their government’s position. In November, more than 300 Ukrainian scholars, activists and artists expressed their solidarity with Palestinians in anopen letter. The letter emphasised the right of Palestinians to self-determination and resistance against Israel’s occupation, drawing parallels to Ukrainians resisting the Russian invasion. Hashem said some Ukrainians came to view the “Israeli narrative” as both “false and unfair” and he “began to feel moral support” for himself and the Palestinian people. Mounting pressure from pro-Palestinian segments of society eventually forced a gradual shift in the Ukrainian government’s position, he believes. He pointed to Ukraine’s backing of a UN resolution on November 12, urging the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to provide an opinion on the legal consequences of Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories. However, Ukraine chose to abstain from voting on a recent resolution advocating for a humanitarian ceasefire in war-torn Gaza. Yuliia Kishchuk, a researcher who signed the open letter, told Al Jazeera that Israel enjoys significant support from Ukrainian political liberals who view Israel as a democratic and progressive nation. “Israel is portrayed in Ukrainian media as this very democratic state that is defending itself against the autocracy of other Middle Eastern countries,” she said, adding that crucially “there is no Palestine in this narrative.” Kishchuk said the level of knowledge about Palestine, its history and the ongoing Israeli occupation has begun to increase. Leading Ukrainian opinion makers and intellectuals specialising in the Middle East have gained traction in the media, providing context about Ukraine’s historical support of Palestine. Kyiv had previously consistently backed UN resolutions denouncing Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories. Meanwhile, images depicting the “horrors” of Israel’s bombardment of Gaza have created a sense of empathy among Ukrainians who now are unable to ignore the parallels with their own experiences of war, she said. Kishchuk has also been buoyed by a change of tone among government officials in recent months. In December, in something of a shift, Zelenskyy said Ukraine recognises the independence of both the Israeli and Palestinian people.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/19/palestinians-in-ukraine-decry-double-standard-as-kyiv-supports-israel
France denies Russian claim of mercenaries in Ukraine,Moscow said on Wednesday that its forces had carried out a strike on a building housing ‘foreign fighters’ in Kharkiv.,"France has denied Russia’s claim that there were French mercenaries in Ukraine after Russia’s Ministry of Defence said its troops had killed “foreign fighters” earlier this week. “France helps Ukraine with supplies of military material and military training, in full compliance with international law, in order to help Ukraine in its fight to defend its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity,” France’s Ministry for Foreign Affairs said on Thursday. “France has no mercenaries, neither in Ukraine nor elsewhere, unlike certain others,” it added. On Thursday, Russia also summoned French ambassador to Moscow, Pierre Levy, to its foreign ministry regarding the alleged French mercenaries, Russian state news agency TASS reported. “In connection with the destruction by the Russian armed forces of a temporary deployment point of foreign fighters in Kharkiv, among whom were several dozen Frenchmen, the French ambassador has been summoned to the Foreign Ministry,” Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova was cited as saying. Moscow said on Wednesday that its forces had carried out a strike a day earlier on a building in Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv. “On the evening of 16 January, the armed forces of the Russian Federation carried out a precision strike on a temporary deployment point of foreign militants in the city of Kharkiv, the core of which were French mercenaries,” Russia’s Ministry of Defence said in a statement. It said the building was destroyed and more than 60 people were killed, though it did not provide evidence for the claim. After Tuesday’s strike on the Ukrainian city, Kharkiv region governor Oleh Syniehubov said there were no military targets in the area that Russia hit. Local authorities said that 17 civilians werewoundedin the attack. On Thursday, the chief of NATO’s military committee, Dutch Admiral Rob Bauer, criticised Russia’s recent attacks in Ukraine. “While Russia’s most recent attacks are devastating, they are not militarily effective,” he said. Bauer added that the war had reached a relative stalemate, and the conflict was in a phase where it was “not moving a lot”. “We should not expect a miracle happening on either side,” he added. Ukraine also warned on Thursday that the country was facing an ammunition shortage as its war with Russia nears the two-year mark. “A shortage of ammunition is a very real and pressing problem that our armed forces are facing,” Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said on the social media platform X. “The artillery coalition is aimed at solving this issue,” he said after speaking by video link to the Ramstein contact group, which gathers more than 50 countries supporting Ukraine. “We need to strengthen Ukrainian defence capabilities to protect the free world against Russian evil,” he added. The meeting came as Russia claimed its forces had pushed Ukrainian troops out of Vesele, a village near the city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine.

Ukraine’s harsh winter a memory but new Russian tactics sow destruction,"Ukraine’s latest winter hardly resembles the brutal cold season of 2022 that was beset by blackouts, but Russian shelling persists.","Kyiv, Ukraine –Artem Honcharuk turns off the lights and switches on two halogen lamps to illuminate the black plastic letters on his shop’s wall that read “copy centre” in Ukrainian. More than a year ago, he tinkered with these lamps so they could run on batteries and light up his print shop in an underground shopping mall in central Kyiv. “That’s the light I was working under,” the 31-year-old told Al Jazeera, standing next to a desktop computer, copy machines and printers. “I already forgot how it was.” In the winter of late 2022 and early 2023, Moscow rained hell on Ukraine, targeting civilian infrastructure to deprive residents of power, central heating, water – and the will to fight back. Andriy Kostin, the prosecutor general of Ukraine, called it “terrorism and war crimes” at the time. Each air raid began with dozens of slow, noisy, Iranian-made Shahed drones laden with up to 50kg (110 pounds) of explosives.  Experienced shooters took many down, but the drones were followed by ballistic missiles, and in some cases, supersonic cruise missiles launched from strategic bombers midair in western Russia. Bombing intensified after Russian forces withdrew from around Kyiv, northern Ukraine, and several areas in the east and south, losing tens of thousands of servicemen and faith in President Vladimir Putin’s blitzkrieg. Between October 10, 2022 and March 9, 2023, the shelling took place every single day, often lasting hours, killing and wounding hundreds and keepingmillions awakeand horrified. After depleting its stashes, Moscow struck less frequently – but would amass the missiles and drones to make each new onemore lethal. Many strikes succeeded – fully or partly – destroying power, transmission and central heating stations all over Ukraine, as well as apartment buildings and hospitals. The damage led to blackouts, disruptions of central heating, and water supply when entire districts went black, and cold, for several days. An average Ukrainian household went through five cumulative weeks without power in the winter of 2022-23, the United Nations said. Russia hit Ukrainian energy infrastructure 271 times, Herman Halushchenko, Ukraine’s energy minister, said in July 2023, adding that the overall damage was estimated at $11bn. What his ministry did not estimate is the damage to tens of thousands of small businesses, such as Honcharuk’s. Ukraine had been preparing for a similarly harsh winter, as Russia resumed the shelling in the autumn. Energy infrastructure was covered with sandbags, concrete slabs and metal cages or moved underground. Power supply to nine million people was restored. Kyiv now also has two Patriots, the most advanced US-made air defence systems that can intercept the hypersonic Kinzhal cruise missiles that Putin casts as “indestructible”. But each Patriot missile costs $4m, and the United States recently warned that there would be a shortage of supplies. Washington also supplied Hawks, the decades-old predecessors of Patriots, and Gepart antiaircraft tanks. Ukraine has US-made National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMs), too, just like the ones that protect the White House, as well as similar, German-made IRIS-T systems. Some analysts say the effectiveness of Russian strikes on Kyiv is minimal; there has not been a single blackout in Honcharuk’s shop and apartment building this winter. Even so, the shopkeeper got used to the deafening blasts of air defence missiles that guard his residential area. “Even if the missiles fly around loudly, I just turn and go back to sleep,” said Honcharuk. “There’s no more fear now, absolutely.” But the Kremlin has not given up on strikes and “looks for ways to improve effectiveness” by using various combinations of drones and missiles, a military expert said. Russians invent complicated routes for cruise missiles to zigzag over Ukraine bypassing areas covered by air defence and hitting their targets from unexpected directions, said Lieutenant-General Ihor Romanenko, the former deputy chief of Ukraine’s General Staff of the Armed Forces. Realising that Western air defence systems in Kyiv shoot down almost all of their missiles and drones, Russians focus on other urban areas such as the eastern cities of Dnipro and Kryvyi Rih, he said. “The morning of December 29 was horrendous,” Ihor Kolesnichenko, an engineer from Dnipro, told Al Jazeera, describing the air raid that killed six, wounded three dozen and damaged a maternity hospital. That day, Russia used 110 missiles and 36 drones to hit 18 cities and towns, killing 58 and wounding 158 in what became the most lethal attack of 2023, Ukrainian officials said. Russians started painting some drones black for night-time attacks, and replaced their propellers with jet engines so that they fly at 500kmph (310mph), Romanenko said. On December 30, theystarted launching short-range missilesallegedly made in North Korea. “They strike to pressure our citizens morally, psychologically so that they urge our leaders to start peace talks, to stop hostilities, which means the legalisation of occupation” in eastern and southern Ukraine, Romanenko said. Starting in late 2022, blackouts plunged Honcharuk’s print shop into darkness while prices for consumables such as printer ink surged three to four times. The cold was often paralysing with no central heating. But Honcharuk turned lemons into lemonade. Since his shop was underground, he did not have to close down during air raids, and people sitting them out would drop by to copy a document, get a printout or take a photo. He spent about $1,000 on a power generator, lamps and other accessories but did not raise prices because the mall’s owner gave him a discount on rent. “The most difficult part was to take people’s pictures in darkness. The flash blinds me and them, and I don’t see the second shot,” Honcharuk said. Two metres of soil and asphalt above his shop, the Western defence system near his apartment building in southwestern Kyiv, made him feel safe from the shelling, but not from the cold. Millions of Ukrainians had to sleep fully clothed with sweaters, coats and two pairs of socks. They stocked up on power banks, candles, flashlights and thermoses, and meticulously charged every gadget when electricity was back on, sometimes just for a couple of hours a day.    The winter sun set before 6pm, snow and ice turned dark streets into ice rinks, and only mobile phone flashlights saved people from falling. “It was the worst winter of our lives,” said Kateryna Ivanenko, a tax lawyer and mother-of-two whose six-year-old son Ihor barely survived pneumonia in February. “I want all Russians to live through a winter like that, that’s the very least they deserve.” During the blackouts, Ukrainians flocked to subway stations, shopping malls, or cafes that had power generators and often offered power sockets free of charge. They exchanged lifehacks on how to preserve food, such as hanging it in bags outside their windows or placing plastic bottles with water in their freezers. This winter, Honcharuk “expected the same”. “What kept me warm was that I was ready,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/18/ukraine-winter-shelling
Russia’s Lavrov rejects US proposal to resume nuclear arms talks,The foreign minister also warned that Ukraine must end its push to join NATO before any peace discussions can proceed.,"Russia’s top diplomat has rejected a United States proposal to resume a dialogue on nuclear arms control, saying that it is impossible while Washington offers military support to Ukraine. Speaking at a news conference on Thursday, Sergey Lavrov accused the West of fuelling global security risks by encouraging Ukraine to ramp up strikes on Russian territory and warned that Moscow will achieve its goals in the conflict regardless ofWestern supportfor Kyiv. Commenting on a US proposal to resume contacts in the sphere of nuclear arms control, Lavrov said that Moscow has rejected the offer. He said that for such talks to be held, Washington first needs to revise its current policy towards Russia. Lavrov charged that Washington’s push for the revival of nuclear talks has been driven by a desire to resume inspections of Russia’s nuclear weapons sites. He described such US demands as “indecent” in view of Ukraine’s attacks on Russian nuclear-capable bomber bases during the conflict. “Amid a ‘hybrid war’ waged by Washington against Russia, we aren’t seeing any basis, not only for any additional joint measures in the sphere of arms control and reduction of strategic risks, but for any discussion of strategic stability issues with the US,” he said. “We firmly link such possibility to the West fully renouncing its malicious course aimed at undermining Russia’s security and interests.” The minister said Washington’s push for restarting nuclear arms talks is rooted in a desire to “try to establish control over our nuclear arsenal and minimise nuclear risks for itself” but added that “those risks are emerging as a result of forceful pressure on our country.” He accused the West of blocking any talks on ending the conflict and inciting the ramping up of attacks on Russia. “Such encouragement and the transfer of relevant weapons shows that the West doesn’t want any constructive solution,” Lavrov said. “The West is pushing toward the escalation of the Ukrainian crisis, and that raises new strategic risks.” He reaffirmed that Russia will pursue what it calls the “special military operation” regardless of Western pressure. “We will consistently and persistently press the goals of the special military operation and we will achieve them,” he said. “They should have no hope that Russia could be defeated in any way. Those in the West who fantasise about it have failed to learn history lessons.”    The foreign minister’s comments come as tensions in thenearly two-year conflictshow no signs of abating, with Ukraine claiming the same day it struck an oil terminal in Saint Petersburg. A Russian-appointed official in occupied southeastern Ukraine earlier disputed this, saying that Ukraine had tried and failed to target a Russian Baltic Sea oil terminal with a drone overnight. Ukraine’s offensive lies on the heels of its continuous push to join NATO, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy most againcalling for membership at Davos, the World Economic Forum’s annual summit. NATO’s chief Jens Stoltenberg said at the summit that Kyiv is “closer to NATO than ever before”. During his press conference, Lavrov said that Ukraine must end its push to join NATO before any discussion of peace takes place.

EU rearms Ukraine as calls mount for higher defence spending,EU members weren’t letting Hungary’s objections stall bilateral military aid for Ukraine.,"As roughly $137bn in military and financial aid to Ukraine remained stalled in Washington and Brussels, individual European allies began to make bilateral pledges worth billions to ensure that Ukraine will remain capable of resisting Russia this year. That resistance remained in place during the past week, with ground troops holding a 1,000km (621-mile) line against Russian assaults in what their commander called an “active defence”, and Ukraine’s Air Force seizing an opportunity to destroy one of only a handful of Russian reconnaissance planes. Ukraine destroyed the Beriev A-50 on Monday somewhere over the Sea of Azov, killing all of its crew, its commander in chief said. An Ilyushin-22 command aircraft was also effectively destroyed, though it managed to land. Ukraine’s southern command said the A-50 was one of only three operational such aircraft and helped direct missile attacks. Russia had fired 40 drones and missiles into Ukraine two days earlier. Ukrainian defenders shot down eight missiles and said they disabled another 20 or so with electronic jamming. As if to prove missile capability after the downing of the A-50, Russia attacked again on Wednesday, wounding 17 people in central Kharkiv. Events in the air were perhaps the most kinetic in a week of static front lines. Ukrainian commander of ground forces Oleksandr Syrskiy said his troops were on “active defence” as Russia pressed for full control of the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk and the reconquest of Kharkiv and Kherson. “Our goals remain unchanged: holding our positions … exhausting the enemy by inflicting maximum losses,” Syrskiy said. Syrskiy’s remarks appeared to confirm that Russia had taken the initiative in attacking. “The initiative is completely in the hands of the Russian armed forces,” Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a meeting with local government leaders on Tuesday. “If [this] continues, Ukrainian statehood may suffer an irreparable, very serious blow,” Putin said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reacted to those remarks the following day as he addressed theWorld Economic Forum in Switzerland, saying Putin would never give up his maximalist goals in Ukraine. “If we have to fight Putin together, years in advance, isn’t it better to end him now, while our brave men and women are already doing it? They are the world’s chance,” Zelenskyy said. As the two leaders’ defiant positions suggested another year of bitter war in Ukraine and conflict persisted in Gaza and the Red Sea, rearmament was becoming a theme for Europe as well as Ukraine. “We need a warfighting transformation of NATO,” its Military Committee chief, Dutch Admiral Rob Bauer, said as he opened a two-day meeting of defence ministers in Brussels on Wednesday. NATO members were living in “an era in which anything can happen at any time, an era in which we need to expect the unexpected, an era in which we need to focus on effectiveness in order to be fully effective”, he said. That thinking was reflected in the European Commission, as well. Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton said last week that he would propose a 100-billion-euro ($109bn) European Defence Investment Programme next month, to expand capacity in European defence industries. Last March, the EU pledged a million artillery shells to Ukraine within a year. By November, they had delivered less than a third of that, but Breton confirmed they would fulfil their pledge by early this year, and the European Commission confirmed that EU production capacity would reach a million shells a year by early this year, matching US production capacity. Russian shell production capacity matched the US and EU combined, said the deputy head of Ukraine’s military intelligence Vadym Skibitskyi. Russia’s covert mobilisation had also enlisted half a million men last year, meaning that it had been able to overcome attrition to field 462,000 soldiers in Ukraine. Given these Russian capacities, Ukraine’s rearmament was an urgent matter, Zelenskyy said. Some $61bn in aid for 2024 remained stuck in Congressional deliberations in Washington due to Republican opposition, and two packages of 50 billion euros and 20 billion euros ($54bn to $22bn) were stalled in Brussels due to Hungarian opposition. US National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said the US had suspended security assistance to Ukraine as a result of the impasse. In Europe, individual countries chose to move ahead bilaterally. Estonian President Alar Karis said last week that Estonia would provide 1.2 billion euros ($1.3bn) in aid including howitzers and ammunition over the next four years. Estonia was committing 0.25 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) to Ukraine’s defence over the next four years, Prime Minister Kaja Kallas had said days earlier. A staunch Ukraine ally which also shares a border with Russia, Estonia last November said it was raising defence spending to 3 percent of GDP and urged other European nations to double their expenditure. Latvia on the same day pledged howitzers, shells, drones and helicopters, among other things. On Friday, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunaksignedan agreement with Kyiv to help develop Ukraine’s drone production capacity, and said he would spend $3.2bn in defence of Ukraine this year. French President Emmanuel Macron was due in Kyiv to make his own pledges next month. He told a news conference that long-range SCALP missiles would be included in defence deliveries already under way. “We are going to deliver a lot more equipment and help Ukraine with what it needs to defend its skies,” he said. Germany last month said it would double its military aid to Ukraine in 2024 to eight billion euros ($9bn). “Russia’s war in Ukraine, as a political issue, is slipping from the mainstream, and is now largely a preoccupation for those situated near Europe’s eastern border,” said the European Council on Foreign Relations. Though still well-resourced, Russia was not without its problems. Skibitskyi said it was having trouble building certain types of missiles due to sanctions. And secretive Russian enlistment of naturalised citizens – suspected to have begun in 2023 – may have contributed to a massive fire that destroyed a seven-hectare warehouse of online retailer Wildberries, in St Petersburg last week. Russian sources said the fire was preceded by a fight among migrant workers there, and a raid by authorities who pressed workers into service with the military.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/17/eu-rearms-ukraine-as-calls-mount-for-higher-defence-spending
Ukraine says controlling skies ‘priority’ in war against Russia,Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba says whoever controls the skies will define ‘when and how the war will end’.,"Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has said his country’s priority for 2024 is to gain control over its skies as Russia’s invasion nears its third year. Whoevercontrols the skieswill define “when and how the war will end”, Kuleba said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Ukraine has long called on the West to deliver advanced fighter jets tosupport its troopsentrenched in the south and the east of the country. “We are fighting a powerful enemy, a very big enemy that doesn’t sleep. It takes time,” Kuleba said. “We defeated them on the land in 2022. We defeated them in the sea in 2023 and we are completely focused on defeating them in the air in 2024.” Various NATO countries are currently training Ukrainian pilots on US-made F-16 fighter jets. Denmark said this month it will transfer 19 F-16s in the second quarter of this year. The United States had previously resisted allowing the jet transfers for fear of being deemed by Russia to be a direct belligerent in theUkraine war. The conflict has ground to a deadlock over the last year as Ukraine’s long-awaited counteroffensive failed to push back Russian forces. Kuleba also called for patience from his country’s key Western backers and insisted that, with the right support, Ukraine could be victorious. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed confidence on Wednesday that all European Union member states will agree to jointly extendmore financial aidto Ukraine. I am proud that our Union has answered Ukraine’s call. Ukraine’s democratic institutions are delivering on our recommendations and on the aspirations of their people. We will now start the screening process ↓pic.twitter.com/GQHjaASZHq — Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen)January 17, 2024  “I am proud that our union has answered Ukraine’s call,” she told the European Parliament. EU leaders last month agreed to start accession talks with Ukraine but Hungary vetoed granting 50 billion euros ($54bn) in aid for Kyiv through 2027. Hungary has resisted agreement on an aid package, raising the possibility of the other 26 countries giving funds to Ukraine under separate bilateral deals with Kyiv. The bloc’s 27 leaders will meet in Brussels on February 1 to try to agree on providing more financial assistance to Kyiv. At least17 people were injured, two of them seriously, after Russian missiles hit residential buildings in the city of Kharkiv overnight. Regional Governor Oleh Syniehubov said two S-300 missiles hit buildings in the centre of Ukraine’s second-biggest city on Tuesday night, and 14 people were sent to hospital. Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said the missiles struck “precisely where there is no military infrastructure and precisely where there are in fact residences”. “There are at least 10 damaged buildings. Rescue teams are continuing to go through the rubble,” he wrote on Telegram. “And there is plenty of rubble.” In the southern port city of Odesa, at least three people were injured, and residential buildings were damaged in the overnight drone attacks, according to Ukrainian authorities. The Ukrainian military said the Russian attack targeted Odesa and other southern regions for at least three hours. Meanwhile, Russia’s Ministry of Defence on Wednesday said its air defence forces destroyed seven Vilkha surface-to-air missiles and four drones over the Russian region of Belgorod.

At least 17 injured after Russian missiles hit Ukraine’s Kharkiv,Rescuers search rubble after two S-300 missiles hit the centre of Ukraine’s second-biggest city.,"At least 17 people have been injured, two of them seriously, after Russian missiles hit residential buildings in the city of Kharkiv. Regional Governor Oleh Syniehubov said that two S-300 missiles hit buildings in the centre of Ukraine’s second-biggest city late on Tuesday night, and 14 people had been sent to hospital. “Two women are in a serious condition,” he said in a post on Telegram. Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said the missiles struck “precisely where there is no military infrastructure and precisely where there are in fact residences”. “There are at least 10 damaged buildings. Rescue teams are continuing to go through the rubble,” he wrote on Telegram. “And there is plenty of rubble.” Ukraine’s Emergency Services said one of the missiles hit a three-storey building that had previously housed a medical centre. Kharkiv lies just 30km (19 miles) from the border with Russia in Ukraine’s northeast and has come under frequent bombardment since Moscow launched itsfull-scale invasionof the country in February 2022. There was no immediate comment from Moscow on the attack on Kharkiv but the Defence Ministry said its air defences destroyed seven Ukrainian missiles and four drones over Russia’s Belgorod region about 80km (50 miles) from Kharkiv. The region’s governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said there were no immediate reports of casualties.

Ukraine’s Zelenskyy urges Western allies to step up pressure on Russia,The Ukrainian leader says Western hesitation in backing Kyiv is costing time and lives and could prolong the fighting for years.,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urged the West to tighten sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin and step up its support for Kyiv to ensure that Moscow does not succeed in its war. Western hesitation in supporting Ukraine and fears of an escalation in the war with Russia are costing time and lives and could prolong the fighting by years, Zelenskyy said on Tuesday in an emotional speech at theWorld Economic Forumin Davos, Switzerland. With the West’s once-staunch wartimesupport for Kyiv now waveringamid political wrangling in Washington and Brussels, Zelenskyy said Europeans need to understand that Putin’s plans go beyond the war in Ukraine. “In fact, Putin embodies war. … He will not change. … We must change. We all must change to the extent that the madness that resides in this man’s head or any other aggressor’s head will not prevail,” the president said. Nearly two years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion, Zelenskyy said he strongly opposes freezing the conflict along its current lines. “Putin is a predator who is not satisfied with frozen products,” he said. He said sanctions on Moscow need to be enforced properly and the lack of sanctions on Russia’s nuclear sector are an illustration of the West’s weakness. European Union and NATO leaders echoed Zelenskyy’s concerns, telling the forum the West could not let up supplying  Ukraine with weapons and money if it wants Kyiv to prevail. “Ukrainians need predictable financing throughout 2024 and beyond. They need a sufficient and sustained supply of weapons to defend Ukraine and regain its rightful territory,” European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen advised. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, also speaking at Davos, said support for Ukraine was not charity but an investment in the alliance’s own security. “We just have to stand by Ukraine. At some stage, Russia will understand that they are paying too high a price and sit down and agree to some kind of just peace – but we need to stand by Ukraine,” he stated.    The forum is being held as Kyiv’s troops are going onto a more defensive footing after amajor counteroffensivelast year was unable to break through Russian defensive lines in Ukraine’s occupied south and east. Speaking hours after the Ukrainian president, Putin insisted his forces have the upper hand. “Not only has their counteroffensive failed, but the initiative is entirely in the hands of the Russian armed forces,” the Russian leader said in televised remarks. “If this continues, Ukraine’s statehood could be dealt an irreparable, very serious blow,” he added. Putin also shot down the possibility of peace talks with Ukraine, saying the country had advanced “prohibitive formulas for the peace process”.    Kyiv is now focused ontrying to secure Western assistanceheld up in the United States Congress and Brussels as it reforms its conscription effort to replenish manpower and addresses artillery shortages at the front. In a question-and-answer session after his speech, Zelenskyy said he had received “positive signals” about the unlocking of financial support from the EU. He said he hoped that the US would approve further aid within weeks. To drive home his point about the need to support Kyiv, he asked rhetorically what other European nation could provide a combat-ready army that could hold back Russian forces. “If anyone thinks this is only about Ukraine, they’re fundamentally mistaken. Possible directions and even timeline of a new Russian aggression beyond Ukraine become more and more obvious.” Zelenskyy met senior officials on the sidelines of the forum, including US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, Stoltenberg and international investors, such as executives from JPMorgan Chase.

Polish truckers agree to suspend border protest until March,"Truck drivers had blocked border since November, demanding restrictions be reintroduced for Ukrainian hauliers.","Polish truckers have agreed to suspend a protest that had blocked some border crossings with Ukraine sinceNovember, the infrastructure minister says. The hauliers confirmed the suspension until March but warned they would return to the border if their demands are not met. “We’ve signed an agreement. The outcome of the agreement will be the discontinuation of protests at road border crossings in three towns: Korczowa, Hrebenne, Dorohusk,” Infrastructure Minister Dariusz Klimczak said on Tuesday. He said that while drivers have agreed to stop protesting for nearly two months, talks were still ongoing. Truckers are demanding that the European Union reinstate a system for Ukrainian companies requiring a permit to operate in the bloc. The truckers also want empty trucks from the EU to be excluded from an electronic queueing system in Ukraine. The bloc waived the permit system after Russia mounted a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, but Polish hauliers said the move created unfair competition from Ukraine and took a toll on their earnings. Their protests created kilometres-long lines of trucks at the border as they tried to cross from Poland to Ukraine. Protest co-organiser Rafal Mekler confirmed the agreement to suspend the border protest. “The government is undertaking several commitments within the specific timeframe that are intended to fulfil the protest demands,” he said on X, formerly Twitter. “If we don’t manage to reach a solution, we will return to the border. … This is not capitulation but a strategic pause.” The agreement, which Mekler posted on X, sets out several actions the government committed to, including launching talks with the European Commission towards securing financial support for Polish hauliers. Another one of the organisers in Dorohusk, Edyta Ozygala, also warned that the action could be renewed at any time. “If the effects are unsatisfactory, we will come back,” she said. Ukraine says the protests have caused the country economic losses and affected its war efforts. It said cross-border transportation has increased because of the war and because its main export and import routes across the Black Sea have been blocked. “The key reason for the growth in the number of transportations by Ukrainian hauliers is the response to the consequences of the Russian armed aggression,” Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said on social media on Monday. “Transportations of fuel, humanitarian and military cargo take up about 20% of total traffic.” The main points of the agreement include monitoring of solutions worked out jointly by Poland and Ukraine to ease the situation of EU-registered drivers in Ukraine, talks with the EU on its agreement with Ukraine and talks with the European Commission on financial support for Polish haulage companies. The deal will provide more road checks to stop Ukrainian truckers from providing services not offered under the EU-Ukraine agreement.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/16/polish-truckers-agree-to-suspend-border-protest-until-march
"EU, US urge sustained support for Ukraine in war against Russia","European Commission chief warns West must not let up supplying Ukraine with weapons, money if it wants Kyiv to succeed.","The European Union and the United States have urged allies of Ukraine to keep up with their funding as the war with Russia nears the two-year mark, with no resolution to the fighting in sight. Secretary of State Antony Blinken promised sustained US support for Ukraine in a meeting on Tuesday withPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyydespite a row in the US Congress on approving new funding. “We are determined to sustain our support for Ukraine and we’re working very closely with Congress in order to work to do that. I know our European colleagues will do the same thing,” Blinken told Zelenskyy at theWorld Economic Forum in Davos. Jake Sullivan, US President Joe Biden’s national security adviser, joined the meeting and told Zelenskyy that the US and its allies were determined “to ensure that Russia fails and Ukraine wins”. Zelenskyy thanked the Biden administration and the “bipartisan support” in the US Congress. “We really count on your support – continuing your huge support,” he said.    The Ukrainian leader, who had addressed the Switzerland forum by video link in the past two years, showed up in person, as he faces increasing war fatigue in EU capitals and the US. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned on Tuesday that the West must not let up supplying Ukraine with weapons and money if it wants Kyiv to succeed. “Ukraine can prevail in this war but we must continue to empower their resistance,” she told business leaders at Davos. “Ukrainians need predictable financing throughout 2024 and beyond. They need a sufficient and sustained supply of weapons to defend Ukraine and regain its rightful territory.” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who also met Zelenskyy at the summit, said Ukraine “was closer to NATO than ever before”. It will be seen as an encouraging sign for Ukraine, which has long sought to join the military alliance and begundeveloping a reform planas part of its potential ascension. Stoltenberg also said there is “cause for optimism” in Ukraine’s two-year battle against Russia, despite a “serious battlefield situation”. As world leaders gathered in Davos to discuss how to rein in wars and embrace artificial intelligence,a state of emergencywas declared in the southern Russian city of Voronezh on Tuesday following a Ukrainian drone attack. Russia’s Ministry of Defence said five Ukrainian drones were destroyed by air defences over the Voronezh region. Yelena Fedyainova, whose six-year-old son was injured in one of the attacks, said the drones first struck at about 2:30am on Tuesday (23:30 GMT, Monday) and blew out the window of her apartment. “I grabbed the child – there were shards everywhere and smoke,” Fedyainova told journalists, the Reuters news agency reported. A girl was injured in the same attack, officials said. Voronezh, a city of more than one million people, lies some 250km (155 miles) from the border with Ukraine. The city’s mayor, Vadim Kstenin, said a state of emergency had been declared in the area to deal with the effect of the attack. Meanwhile, authorities in the northeastern Ukrainian region of Kharkiv urged residents of more than two dozen villages near the front line to evacuate, citing Russian attacks in the area. Russian forces captured swaths of the region shortly after invading Ukraine in February 2022 and have kept up efforts to wrest the region despite losing ground there. “Given the security situation, we are introducing mandatory evacuation of the population from the Kindrashivska and Kurylivska communities of the Kupyansk district,” the Kharkiv regional governor announced on social media. Governor Oleg Synegubov said the order would affect some 3,043 people in the settlements, including 279 children.

Ukraine says shot down two Russian command aircraft in blow to Moscow,The A-50 and IL-22 play a central role in orchestrating Russian battlefield movements in Ukraine.,"Ukraine has said it shot down an A-50 Russian reconnaissance plane and an Il-22 airborne command post in a potentially significant blow to the Kremlin’s forces. Ukrainian army chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi announced the aircraft had been hit on the Telegram messenger on Monday, posting a video of a tracking map suggesting the planes were struck over the Sea of Azov, which lies to the east of the Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula. “I am grateful to the air force for the excellently planned and conducted operation in Azov region!” Zaluzhnyi wrote. Hours after Zaluzhnyi’s statement, a Russian military blog posted an image of the shrapnel-riddled tail section of an Il-22 standing on the tarmac and lauded the crew as “real heroes”. Kyiv’s Air Force spokesman Yuriy Ignat reposted the image, saying the plane appeared to have made it to the Russian town of Anapa but that it was beyond repair as it had been on fire. He added that the A-50 had been Kyiv’s priority target. The A-50 is a Russian reconnaissance plane, equivalent to the AWACS (Airborne Warning and Control System) plane, used by NATO. Topped with a large radar, it typically has a crew of 15 and can scan an area of several hundred kilometres for enemy aircraft, ships and missiles. The Russian Air Force is thought to have nine of the planes in its fleet. Natalia Humeniuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern military command, told a briefing that Russia had used the plane extensively to prepare for and conduct long-rangemissile strikes on Ukraine. “We expect such a strike [on the A-50] to be fairly painful and, at least, to delay powerful missile strikes,” she said. The Il-22, meanwhile, oversees military operations and sends radio signals to troops on the front line. The Russian Air Force reportedly has a dozen such planes. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters he had “no information” on the attacks and that further questions should be directed to the Defence Ministry. Russia has largely maintained air dominance since launching afull-scale invasionof its neighbour nearly two years ago. The A-50 and IL-22 play a central role in orchestrating Russian battlefield movements in Ukraine. Their loss would be a landmark feat for Kyiv as well as a major blow to Moscow with fighting along the front line largely bogged down in trench and artillery warfare. Russian military bloggers with close army links did report an incident over the Azov Sea. “It will be another dark day for the Russian Aerospace Forces and Air Defense,” wrote Rybar, a blogger with nearly 1.2 million subscribers who supports and provides running commentary on Russia’s war in Ukraine. “There are not many A-50s. And the specialists operating them are generally rare. If an aircraft of this type is hit, the crew will not be able to escape.” Telegram channel WarGonzo acknowledged that the A-50 had been destroyed. “Unfortunately war is never without tragedies, and the death of our fighters always hurts. We express our condolences to the families and close ones of the crew,” it said. It too reported that the Il-22 was able to make it back to base. “According to reports, the pilots were able to land the damaged machine,” it said. A February 2023 drone attack at an airfield in Belarus damaged a parked A-50  but Russian and Belarusian officials described the damage as minor.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/16/ukraine-says-shot-down-two-russian-command-aircraft-in-blow-to-moscow

Russia dismisses Davos discussion on Ukrainian president’s peace plan,"Zelenskyy’s proposal, discussed by 83 delegations, calls for Russia to pull its troops back and face up to war crimes.","Russia has dismissed discussions on a peace plan proposed by Ukraine at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos in Switzerland as pointless. The talks in the Swiss mountain resort will achieve nothing without Moscow’s participation, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, insisted on Monday. Organisers said 83 delegations had been present at the meeting to discuss the plan the previous day. Put forward by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the 10-point peace plan, designed to end the war sparked by Russia’s invasion of its neighbour in February 2022, calls for the withdrawal of Russian troops, restoration of Ukraine’s state borders, and Russian accountability for war crimes. The proposal was discussed at a summit of national security advisers at the annual WEF meeting on Sunday. Zelenskyy’s plan has previously been discussed at three such gatherings. Andriy Yermak, the Ukrainian president’s chief of staff, called it a “good sign” that the number of participants in the string of conferences is expanding. While nearly half of the delegations present on Sunday were from Europe, there were 18 from Asia and 12 from Africa. “Countries from the Global South are increasingly getting involved in our work. It shows understanding that this European conflict is in fact a challenge for all humanity,” he wrote. However, Ukraine insists that it will not discuss the plan with Russia. Zelenskyy has decreed that any talks with Russia are illegal. That has motivated Russia, which controls a little less than a fifth of Ukrainian territory, to dismiss the idea as absurd. “This is simply talking for the sake of talking,” Peskov said. “This process cannot be aimed at achieving any specific results for the obvious reason – we are not participating. Without our participation, any discussions are devoid of any prospect of any results.” Ignazio Cassis, the Swiss foreign minister who co-hosted the peace plan discussion in Davos, said the meeting was part of a process aimed eventually at securing Russian participation, although he admitted that Moscow is far from ready to cooperate.  Zelenskyy also praised the discussion for including representatives from Latin America, Africa, and Asia. He arrived in Davos on Monday afternoon on a trip during which he will bid to rally support for Ukraineamid signs of fatiguein the United States and the European Union. He claimed that work on security guarantees and new support packages is progressing. “There are much-needed agreements on the joint production of weapons and shells, a particularly sensitive issue is drones. There will be more drones. We are preparing more good news on air defence. We keep in mind both missiles and electronic warfare – there will be more of them,” he said. With the war bogged down in tranches across the front line in eastern Ukraine, air attacks featuring planes, missiles and drones have intensified. Russian air defence systems destroyed three missiles launched by Ukraine over the southwest Kursk region early on Monday, the Russian Ministry of Defence said on its channel on Telegram messaging app. Ukraine, meanwhile, reported that it had downed two Russian military command aircraft over the Sea of Azov. The intensified air war has prompted Ukraine to press harder on Western allies for donations of missiles and air defence equipment. Meanwhile, Russia has been criticised for breaking international sanctions as it sources weapons from North Korea. Moscow and Pyongyang have denied arms deals but have declared deepening cooperation across the board. On Monday, Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov welcomed his North Korean counterpart, Choe Son-hui, as she arrived in Moscow on an official visit.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/15/russia-dismisses-davos-discussion-of-ukrainian-presidents-peace-plan

Ukraine says Russia launched barrage of missile attacks nationwide,Mass onslaught took place before France’s new foreign minister’s visit to Kyiv.,"Russia launched dozens of attacks acrossUkraineovernight, the Ukrainian air force said, as Kyiv continued its diplomatic efforts to ratchet up support and military aid. “A total of 40 means of enemy air attack were recorded,” the air force said on Saturday, adding that it destroyed eight missiles. “More than 20 devices” failed to reach their targets due to “active measures by means of electronic warfare”. Russia said it destroyed all targets in a barrage of attacks on facilities producing ammunition and drones in Ukraine. The defence ministry in Moscow said its armed forces “carried out a group strike … against facilities of the Ukrainian military-industrial complex”. It said it was targeting places producing shells, gunpowder and unmanned aerial vehicles. “All designated facilities were hit,” it added. No fatalities were reported so far, but Ukrainian authorities said a civilian was wounded in the northeastern Sumy region. According to the Ukrainian air force, Russia fired Kinzhal missiles, perhaps the toughest conventional Russian missile to shoot down, moving at several times the speed of sound. The missiles were shot down in at least five regions across Ukraine, according to local officials from those provinces. Police in the northern region of Chernihiv posted a picture of a large crater made by a downed missile. “As a result of being hit by the debris of an enemy missile, several private homes and non-residential buildings were damaged, one building was practically destroyed,” the police wrote, adding that a dog had been killed but no people were hurt. The air force in Ukraine’s neighbour Poland said it had briefly activated air defence systems due to the increased level of threat. The attacks took place as France’s newly appointed foreign minister, Stephane Sejourne, arrived in Kyiv on Saturday for his first official trip abroad, in a sign of support as the Russian invasion of Ukraine nears its second year. Speaking at a news conference in Kyiv, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba praised Sejourne for not “being intimidated by Russia’s latest large-scale missile attack” and reaching the Ukrainian capital so soon after his appointment on Thursday, which he said “says a lot about the priorities of France’s foreign policy”. Sejourne confirmed his visit was a “message to the Ukrainians”. “Ukraine is and will remain France’s priority,” he said. “Our resolve is intact and so is our admiration for the courage of the Ukrainian people during this difficult time.” He added that he would work in the coming days and weeks to fix European Union and bilateral legal issues to help French companies set up more military production facilities in Ukraine, without saying what these legal issues were. Sejourne also encouraged French companies to invest in Ukraine, mentioning the transport, energy, telecoms and water sectors. The visit follows that of British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Friday, where he unveiled new military funding for Ukraine and reassured the country that the West is still providing support. Sunak and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed abilateral security agreementfor the next 10 years. It will remain in effect until Ukraine acquires its hoped-for NATO membership, Zelenskyy said.

Putin waged a trade war long before bombing Ukraine. Which side is winning?,"Putin used tariffs, a naval blockade and bombed ports to target Ukrainian agricultural competition, but none worked.","Last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced he was shutting down the Black Sea to Ukrainian agricultural exports. The reason, ostensibly, was Ukraine’s second attempt to cripple the Kerch Bridge, Russia’s main artery to the Crimean Peninsula and key to its ammunition logistics. A massive explosion caught on camera in the small hours of July 17 left a section of road deck hanging askew over the Black Sea. In December, the head of Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU), Vasyl Malyuk, confirmed the SBU had developed the Sea Baby drones used in the operation. In retaliation, Russia said it was withdrawing from an agreement allowing the shipment of Ukrainian grain out of the Black Sea,brokereda year earlier by the United Nations and Turkey to prevent hunger among the world’s poorest. Marking its withdrawal, Moscow launched an overnight missile attack on Ukraine’s Odesa and Chernomorsk, two of the three ports authorised to export grain under the initiative, destroying grain silos, fuel oil and loading equipment. Two days later, Putin revealed the real reason for his change in strategy. In a staged conversation with his agriculture minister, Dmitry Patrushev, Putin said Russian farmers had lost $1.2bn and Russian fertiliser manufacturers $1.6bn, roughly half their profit margins, due to high costs for shipping, spare parts and financial transactions. Ukraine, too, has suffered from higher shipping costs stemming from Putin’s war and the conflict in Gaza, which has forced commercial shipping to detour around Africa. But Putin and Patrushev blamed the increase solely on Western sanctions. According to Putin, Russia showed “miracles of endurance and patience” hoping that its foreign colleagues would finally begin to “fully comply with the agreed and approved parameters and conditions”. Instead, Russia reaped “arrogance and impudence, promises and empty chatter”, he said. Although the West never sanctioned Russian grain or fertiliser, Putin’s argument was that sanctions on Russian banks and machinery imports effectively sanctioned agricultural industries. He also believed 200,000 tonnes of Russian fertiliser were being unofficially blocked in European ports. Russia sought to leverage Black Sea security to overturn Kyiv’s sanctions, as well. “He wants the fertiliser pipeline through Odesa to be reopened,” Kyiv School of Economics Director Tymofiy Mylovanov told Al Jazeera, referring to a pipeline built in 1981, when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union, to carry ammonia from the TogliattiAzot plant 500km (311 miles) east of Moscow to Odesa for export. A blast disabled the defunct pipeline last June. Russia accused Ukraine of sabotage. “There is no way Ukraine will reopen any kind of transit through Ukraine of any kind of Russian products,” Mylovanov said. “Russia is in a full-scale war with us and they want to trade through us. This is just not possible.” Russia’s very reason for agreeing to the grain initiative was to slow down Ukrainian exports, believed Mylovanov. Under the initiative Russia was entitled to inspect grain ships, but average daily inspections had fallen from 11 to five by early last year, said the UN, causing Ukrainian exports to fall from 4.3 million tonnes in October to 1.3 million tonnes in May. This was merely the latest tactic in a trade war that long predated Russia’s ground war, said Mylovanov. “Putin started placing … barriers to trade on Ukrainian agricultural products from grain to dairy as early as 2012,” he said. Russia “would impose certain tariffs and they would abandon them arbitrarily”. In doing this, Putin was weaponising uncertainty “to paralyse decision-making in agricultural companies and to deny investment in the capacity,” Mylovanov said. The construction of the Kerch Bridge may have been part of this trade war. The bridge “basically denied high-volume tankers [access] so Azov Sea ports became unavailable to Ukraine in 2016-2019. We had to rebuild our railroad routes to pass through Odesa, so farmers in the east were hurt by this”, he said. None of Putin’s tactics seemed to work. Ukraine’s goods, mainly agricultural, were becoming ever-more competitive with Russia’s. Exports rose from $33.5bn in 2016 to $63.1bn in 2021, World Bank data showed. Only the full-scale invasion changed that. Putin’s war cost the Ukrainian economy 29 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and 14 percent of its population. Its goods exports plummeted to $40.1bn. But Ukraine’s agriculture is now bouncing back, with a record harvest of 80 million tonnes – 58 million tonnes of it was grain. Russia harvested more than twice as much grain – 123 million tonnes – but its landmass is 28 times greater than Ukraine’s and its population five times greater. Ukraine is punching way above Russia’s weight. That is important because rising agricultural exports may now represent Ukraine’s best hope of prosecuting the war. Kyiv faces a gaping budget deficit of $43bn this year, which financial aid will only partly address and faces political hurdles in Brussels and Washington. Kyiv needs to maximise export revenues, and Russia is trying to starve it. “Ukraine, as today’s events show, cannot rely only on international grants and loans. You have to earn money yourself,” Odesa newspaper editor Oleg Suslov told Al Jazeera. “Russia understands this, too. Its desire to destroy the port infrastructure is aimed at reducing the flow of export earnings to Ukraine in the hope that this will destabilise the domestic economic situation and sow panic among the population,” he said. The longer-term strategy is geopolitical, said Mylovanov. “They want to get Ukraine off the market so … they can get monopoly positions and they can later weaponise or politicise them. For the Middle East, a lot of concerns are food security … If your major trading partner is just Russia, then they have some leverage.” In addition to attacking Ukraine’s Black Sea ports, Russia sent drones and missiles to destroy cranes and silos at Ukraine’s Danubian ports of Reni, Izmail and Vylkove, and damaged trucks at the ferry crossing of Orlivka. “In this way, Russia tried to demonstrate that it did not agree with the opening of a new grain corridor without its participation,” said Suslov. According to estimates by the Ukrainian government, from August to the end of 2023, Russia completely or partially destroyed about 180 port infrastructure facilities and 300,000 tonnes of grain. “To top it all off, Russia began to mine the sea channel [from Ukraine’s ports to Romania] with adjustable aerial bombs,” said Suslov. Russia also tried coercion. It fired warning shots at the Palau-flagged Sukru Okan, a merchant vessel, on August 14, as it tried to approach the Romanian port of Sulina – a major offloading point for freight floating down the Danube. When that did not work, it boarded it using a Ka-29 helicopter. With its financial lifeline at stake, Ukraine pushed back against Russia’s embargo with astounding success. On August 4, its naval drones attacked the Olenegorsky Gornyak, a Ropucha-class landing ship, just outside Novorossyisk harbour, supposedly a safe port to which Russia had relocated much of its Sevastopol-based fleet after Ukraine sank its Black Sea flagship in May. Daylight footage showed the Olenegorsky Gornyak listing severely to port as it was towed into harbour. The following night, Ukraine put a hole in the engine room of a Russian fuel tanker just south of the Kerch Bridge. Since both of these attacks happened off Russia’s Black Sea coast, they proved Ukraine’s claim that it could bottle up Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, deny Russia access to its territorial waters and provide a safe corridor for freight shipping until it reached NATO territorial waters off Romania and Bulgaria. When a German container ship, the Joseph Schulte, along with four other merchant ships, travelled safely from Ukrainian ports to Istanbul on August 15-17, Ukraine hailed it as proof of the naval operation’s success.    By the end of 2023, Ukraine had exported 15 million tonnes of goods through the corridor, two-thirds of them agricultural, in the six months since the deal with Russia collapsed, compared with 33 million tonnes for the entire year that the deal was in place. In other words, Russia’s departure from the Black Sea grain initiative has had virtually no impact. And Ukraine has not relied on the Black Sea alone. Last August, it opened a new border crossing to Romania along the Tisa River, with more to follow. In October, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced a new export route via rail through Moldova and Romania. Since its NATO airspace was immune to Russian attacks, Romania also suggested offloading grain at its Danubian ports of Braila and Galati onto barges that would take it to the port of Constanta on the Black Sea, where it can be reloaded onto ocean-going ships. Constanta’s port authority said it had reached its highest grain exports last year thanks to Ukrainian grain. Russia did not admit defeat. It attacked ships with missiles to drive up freight rates. One such attack on a Liberian-flagged tanker last November killed a sailor and raised rates by $20 a tonne overnight. The United Kingdom came to the rescue, negotiating with 14 shipping insurance companies a special mechanism to discount war risk insurance. Ukraine still isn’t out of the cornfield. Its truck convoys to European Union ports have encountered local opposition from farmers and truckers, who face competition from cheaper Ukrainian goods and services. Ukraine’s success in exporting grains has allowed world prices to drop, making it a victim of its own success. Ukraine’s wheat farmers were operating at a loss of $36 a tonne, Ukraine’s agriculture ministry said. And the onset of winter may bring mechanical and weather-related problems to export capacity. Still, Ukraine’s increasing share of the global market means it is winning against Russia’s trade war despite the embargo. Ukraine’s agriculture ministry said its overall exports last year were 7 percent higher in value compared with 2022, reaching $23bn, and its grain exports increased from 37 million tonnes to 43 million tonnes. “[Ukraine] has become a competitive player and if you look at the evolution of the share of global exports, Ukraine used to have 1-2 percent, and now in the top five grains it has 5, 8 sometimes 13 percent,” said Mylovanov. The results may affect Ukrainian optimism. “Many thought that the war would end in 2023,” said Suslov. “However, there is hope. Ukrainians believe in their Armed Forces, they believe in air defence. They believe in the support of partners. And they hope that the losses in manpower and military equipment that Russia received by the end of the second year of the war will finally reach those critical values that will force the aggressor to come to their senses and stop the massacre.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/12/long-before-bombing-ukraine-putin-waged-a-trade-war-he-is-still-losing-it
"Ukraine, Britain announce security agreement during Kyiv visit by PM Sunak",British prime minister also confirms 2.5 billion pounds ($3.2bn) in new aid for Ukraine for the next financial year.,"British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has signed a new security agreement with Ukraine’s president and announced an increase in military funding for the war-wracked country during a visit to Kyiv. Britain, one of Ukraine’s closest allies during the Russian invasion, will increase its support in the next financial year to 2.5 billion pounds ($3.2bn), an increase of 200 million pounds ($255m) on the previous two years, Sunak said on Friday. The funding would cover long-range missiles, air defence, artillery ammunition and maritime security. “Our opponents around the world believe that we have neither the patience nor resources for long wars, so waver now, and we embolden not just [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, but his allies in North Korea, Iran and elsewhere,” Sunak told a press conference. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukraine and Britain also signed an “unprecedented security agreement” on Friday, an accord that would remain in effect until Ukraine joins the NATO military alliance. “This is not simply a declaration. This is a reality that will come to fruition as a result of our cooperation, including security commitments from a major global power, the United Kingdom. If the UK and other countries had provided such a level of guarantees after 1991, there would have been no Russian aggression at all,” Zelenskyy wrote on the social media platform X. He added that the common goal was to ensure that an attack on Ukraine “will never happen again” once the war ends. I am glad to welcome@RishiSunakin Ukraine. Today marks a watershed moment in European history. Ukraine and the United Kingdom signed a new, unprecedented security agreement. This is not simply a declaration. This is a reality that will come to fruition as a result of our…pic.twitter.com/hRs9G1IM1P — Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa)January 12, 2024  During the press conference, Sunak urged his Western allies to maintain their support for Ukraine and warned that a Russian victory would encourage other authoritarian countries. “If Putin wins in Ukraine, he will not stop there,” Sunak said. Zelenskyy also told reporters that Ukraine was more positive now than in December about securing aid from the United States. Britain is the second-biggest donor of military aid to Ukraine after the US, giving a total of 4.6 billion pounds ($3.3bn) in 2022 and 2023. “I am here today with one message: The UK will also not falter,” Sunak said. “We will stand with Ukraine in their darkest hours and in the better times to come,” he added in his initial remarks after his arrival in the capital.    Sunak first visited Ukraine in November 2022, soon after he became prime minister. Britain has been one of Ukraine’s most vocal backers. Ahead of his visit, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev had warned that any move by Britain to deploy troops to Ukraine would be a “declaration of war against our country”. Both Ukraine and Russia are scrambling to replenish their weapons after 22 months of fighting and the potential for a protracted conflict. The roughly 1,500km (930-mile) front line has been largely static during winter, and both warring sides require artillery shells, missiles and drones that enable long-range strikes. Kyiv saysMoscow is receivingartillery shells and missiles from North Korea and drones from Iran. On January 4, the White House cited US intelligence officials as saying that Russia acquired ballistic missiles from North Korea and is seeking them from Iran. Zelenskyy is pushing his country’s Western allies to provide Ukraine with more support on top of the billions of dollars in military aid it has already received. This week he visited the Baltic countries Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia to rally support against Russia and search for new pledges. The Eastern European countries, which are also among Kyiv’s staunchest supporters, promised more missiles, drones, howitzers and artillery shells. Zelenskyy has warned that Ukraine particularly needs air defence systems to fend off recent Russian aerial barrages. More than 500 drones and missiles were fired at Ukraine from December 29 to January 2, according to officials in Kyiv. Sunak said the UK recognises that Ukrainian security “is our security”. “Today we are going further – increasing our military aid, delivering thousands of cutting-edge drones and signing a historic new security agreement to provide Ukraine with the assurances it needs for the long term,” he said. Elsewhere, however, support for Ukraine’s war effort is sputtering. A plan by US President Joe Biden’s administration to send $60bn in new funding to Kyiv is being held up in Congress. Europe’s pledge in March to provide 1 million artillery shells within 12 months has also fallen short with only about 300,000 delivered by the end of last year.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/12/uk-to-increase-military-funding-for-ukraine-as-pm-sunak-visits-kyiv
US imposes sanctions over transfer of North Korean missiles to Russia,"Measures target three Russian entities, one individual. US State Department says missiles for use in Ukraine war.","The United States has imposed sanctions on three Russian entities and one individual allegedly involved in the transfer and testing of North Korea’s ballistic missiles for alleged use by Moscow in itswar against Ukraine. The move comes after Washington and its allies criticisedthe exchangeof arms between North Korea and Russia. The US government denounced Russia’s acquisition of North Korean ballistic missiles and specified they were deployed against Ukraine on December 30 and January 2. “The DPRK’s transfer of ballistic missiles to Russia supports Russia’s war of aggression, increases the suffering of the Ukrainian people, and undermines the global nonproliferation regime,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said ina statementon Thursday, using the official acronym for North Korea, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. “We will not hesitate to take further actions,” he said. Since the start of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022, Moscow and Pyongyang have developed closer ties but have denied engaging in any arms deals. In September, North Korean leaderKim Jong Unheld a meeting with President Vladimir Putin in Russia’s Far East. High-ranking Russian officials have undertaken multiple visits to Pyongyang. Last week, the White House said Russia had used short-range ballistic missiles sourced from North Korea to conduct multiple strikes against Ukraine, citing newly declassified intelligence that was subsequently corroborated by a senior Ukrainian official. North Korea has been under a United Nations arms embargo since it first tested a nuclear bomb in 2006. UN Security Council resolutions, approved with Russian support, ban countries from trading weapons or other military equipment with North Korea.

"Russia doubles down on fast, cheap, unguided bombs to attack Ukraine","Russia produces more ballistic missiles, glide bombs and drones as Ukraine targets Russian military installations from afar.","Russia appears to be doubling down on glide bombs and ballistic missiles – unsophisticated, inexpensive bombs difficult to intercept – as well as drones, as its strategy for inflicting a new wave of destruction on Ukraine’s cities and infrastructure. Since December 29, Russia has launched almost daily barrages of drones and missiles of various types at Ukraine to probe for weaknesses in its aerial defences. Ukraine has been downing almost all of the drones and an impressive ratio of missiles. That changed on Monday, when Ukraine intercepted only 18 of a cocktail of 51 missiles Russia fired at the regions of Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhia and Khmelnytskyi. Those that got through killed at least four civilians. Part of Russia’s success appeared to be the use of six Iskander and eight Kinzhal ballistic missiles. These travel atterminal speedsof 9,000-12,000km/h (5,600 to 7,500mph) and are very difficult to intercept. Unlike cruise missiles, they can also be rendered immune to electronic warfare that interferes with GPS guidance because they carry inertial guidance systems that navigate by dead reckoning. Another reason for Russia’s success appeared to be that it had mapped weaknesses in Ukraine’s air defence over days of attacks. Ukrainian Air Force spokesman Yuri Ignat told reporters these two reasons explained the low kill rate on Monday. “The explanation is simple: they were flying on a ballistic trajectory, and into the regions where we can’t shoot them down,” Ignat said. Short-range ballistic missiles “appear to be more effective at penetrating or avoiding Ukrainian air defences,” said the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank. “Ukrainian air defences have intercepted 149 of a reported 166 Russian cruise missiles in intensified attacks since December 29, but have only intercepted a handful of the ballistic missiles that Russia has launched at Ukraine in the same period,” it said. Russia can only produce about 42 Iskander missiles and four Kinzhal missiles a month, said theISW, and was enlisting the production capabilities of Iran and North Korea to overwhelm Ukraine with firepower. US national security spokesman John Kirby told a White House briefing on January 4 Russia had used North Korean ballistic missiles against Ukraine on December 30 and January 2. Ukraine agreed. “There is no longer any disguise … as part of its outright genocidal war, the Russian Federation for the first time struck at the territory of Ukraine with missiles received from … North Korea,” said Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. A weapons expert told Reuters that the missile appeared to be a North Korean KN-23. “We are deeply concerned about the security implications that this cooperation has in Europe, on the Korean Peninsula, across the Indo-Pacific region, and around the world,” said a joint statement signed by the United States, United Kingdom, the European Union, Australia, Germany, Canada and nearly 40 other partner nations. There was further concern “that Russian negotiations to acquire close-range ballistic missiles from Iran are actively advancing”, Kirby told journalists. Such missiles could be traded for Russian long-range, nuclear-capable ballistic missile technology, Russia said last October. North Korea has also expressed interest in the technology. Russia has also experimented with glide bombs against Ukrainian front lines in the past few months with considerable success. These are air-launched free-fall bombs fitted with adjustable fins that enable them to fly further and navigate – but they are far cheaper to produce than guided missiles and are also immune to jamming. Glide bombs’ weakness is that aircraft must bring them to within about 25km (16 miles) of their target, exposing them to enemy fire. Ukraine seized such opportunities to down four Russian Sukhoi-34 bombers in the last week of December. But Russia evidently considers the bombs a success worth developing. On Wednesday, the state-owned TASS news agency said Russia would put a new glide bomb into production, without specifying its capabilities, suggesting that it has engineered improvements. The Drel glide bombs are to enter active service this year and may present a new challenge to Ukrainian defenders. Russia also said it will invest $7.7bn in almost tripling domestic drone production by 2030, said First Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov on January 6. “The annual production volume of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) – excluding educational UAVs – is planned at 32,500 units,” Belousov told TASS. “This is almost three times higher than current production volumes.” Put together, the three technologies – glide bombs, ballistic missiles and drones – could overwhelm Ukraine’s ability to intercept them. “It is clear that there is a shortage of anti-aircraft guided missiles, no one hides it,” Ukrainian Air Force spokesman Yuri Ignat told a news conference on Tuesday, after Russia had launched about 500 missiles and drones over several days, consuming intercept missiles. NATO’s Support and Procurement Agency said this week it would spend $5.5bn to support the procurement of 1,000 Patriot missiles for members and create a Patriot production plant in Germany, but it was not clear that any of the new missiles would go to Ukraine. To economise on Patriot missiles, Ukraine has increased its kill rate of Shahed drones using mobile air defence units carried on pick-up trucks. Sometimes, these are sophisticated man-portable air defence surface-to-air guided missiles. Sometimes, they are nothing more than World War II-era MG42 heavy machine guns. Ukraine also targeted Russian military installations from afar, setting its sights in particular on the Saky airfield on the Crimean Peninsula. Russia claimed to have fended off a large wave of Ukrainian drones and missiles targeting Saky on Friday. Ukraine claimed success in Saky on Saturday, when Ukraine’s defence intelligence and air force said they led an operation to take out Russian radar positions around the Saky airfield. Russian sources said up to four Storm Shadow cruise missiles struck an administrative building at the Saky airfield on the same day. The defence intelligence operation also destroyed an ammunition depot at the village of Hryshyne. There were other attempts to attack targets in Crimea during the week, some successful. Ukraine claimed to have destroyed a communications centre in the Crimean city of Yevpatoria, which co-ordinated Crimean air defence. Ukrainian missiles also struck a Russian command post near the Crimean port of Sevastopol on January 3. But much more damage was clearly intended. Russia claimed to have shot down 10 Ukrainian missiles over Crimea on January 3, another 36 Ukrainian drones over Crimea and a Neptune missile over the Black Sea on Friday, and another five drones and 10 missiles on January 6. Ukraine’s most important success of the week may have been destroying a bridge Russia was building to better supply its forces in southern Ukraine, disrupting a major intended logistics artery. “The Ukrainians … set back almost a half-year of serious Russian supply planning,” wrote Stefan Korsha, a senior defence correspondent at Kyiv Post. Petro Andriushchenko, adviser to the mayor of Mariupol, said, “Now the launch of a direct railway from Russia is closed for a long time.” Ukraine also scored successes in Russia itself. On January 4, a Ukrainian defence intelligence operation destroyed a Sukhoi-34 bomber on the Shagol airfield in Chelyabinsk, 1,500km (932 miles) east of Moscow, Ukraine said. The next day Ukraine’s defence intelligence said one of its units destroyed two Pantsir-S1 air defence units in the Russian region of Belgorod, north of Ukraine. And on Monday Russian media reported a blast on a section of railway near the city of Nizhny Tagil, 1,400km (870 miles) east of Moscow. Russia claimed to have shot down 10 airborne targets over the city of Belgorod on January 4.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/11/russia-doubles-down-on-fast-cheap-unguided-bombs-to-strike-ukraine
"NATO allies Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria sign deal to clear Black Sea mines","Initiative limited to three nations aims to make shipping safer, including for vessels transporting grain from Ukraine.","Turkey, Romania and Bulgaria have signed an agreement to clear mines drifting in the Black Sea that have posed a threat to shipping since the start ofRussia’s war in Ukraine. On Thursday, Turkish Defence Minister Yasar Guler said the deal establishes a Mine Countermeasures Task Group among the three NATO allies to deal with the mines as he met in Istanbul with his Romanian counterpart, Angel Tilvar, and Bulgarian Deputy Defence Minister Atanas Zapryanov. Zapryanov said mines pose a “danger to ports, communication networks and key water infrastructure” while Tilvar added that Russia’s “disdain for the norms of international law and its aggression in the Black Sea is not only a regional problem but also a problem with global consequences”. Sea mines have posed a threat to Ukraine’s Black Sea export routes since Russia’s invasion in February 2022, and several commercial ships have been hit, including a bulk carrier heading to a Danube River port to load grain in December. Ukraine has two main ports on the Danube – Reni and Izmail – which have become central to the country’s grain exports since Russia’s blockade of Ukraine’s Black Sea ports andMoscow’s withdrawalin July from a United Nations-backed agreement that had allowed grain shipments safe passage across the Black Sea. Three minehunting ships from each country and one command-control ship will be assigned to the initiative, a Turkish Ministry of National Defence official said. The initiative is open to only the three countries, whose naval commanders will form a committee to run the operation, Guler said, adding that it might include other Black Sea states after the war ends. Last week, Turkey said it would not allow two minehunter vessels donated toUkraine by Britainto transit its waters en route to the Black Sea because it would violate the 1936 Montreux Convention, an international pact concerning wartime passage of the Bosphorus and Dardanelles strait. At the start of the Ukraine war, Turkey enacted the convention to block the passage of Russian or Ukrainian ships through the two straits and also told non-Black Sea states not to send warships.

Zelenskyy says Western hesitation on aid emboldens Putin,President Zelenskyy says air defences must be strengthened and ammunition replenished during visit to Lithuania.,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned that Western hesitation on aid is emboldening Russia – comments he made during a visit to Lithuania as he embarked on a previously unannounced tour of three Baltic states. On Wednesday, Zelenskyy told his Lithuanian counterpart that Ukraine must strengthen its air defences and replenish its ammunition supplies as Russia intensifies its missile and drone attacks in its nearly two-year war on Ukraine. “We have proven that Russia can be stopped, that deterrence is possible,” he said after talks with Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda. “Sometimes, the insecurity of partners regarding financial and military aid to Ukraine only increases Russia’s courage and strength,” he said. “He [Russian President Vladimir Putin] won’t finish this [war] until we all finish him together,” Zelenskyy said, adding, “Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Moldova may be next.” The Ukrainian leader also thanked Lithuania for its military assistance and goodwill. “We know how tiring this long-running war is, and we are interested in Ukraine’s complete victory in it as soon as possible,” Nauseda told reporters.  He said Vilnius would send M577 armoured vehicles to Kyiv next month, part of a previously announced 200-million-euro ($220m) package of military aid. Announcing his arrival on social media on Wednesday, Zelenskyy said he would go on to Latvia and Estonia in the coming days. “Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are our reliable friends and principled partners. Today, I arrived in Vilnius before going to Tallinn and Riga,” Zelenskyy wrote on X. “Security, EU and NATO integration, cooperation on electronic warfare and drones, and further coordination of European support are all on the agenda.” Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are our reliable friends and principled partners.Today, I arrived in Vilnius before going to Tallinn and Riga.I will hold talks with the President, Prime Minister, Speaker of the Seimas, as well as meet with politicians, the media, and the… — Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa)January 10, 2024  In Estonia, Prime Minister Kaja Kallas reiterated the country’s support for Ukraine. “These are crucial times, and we need to keep our focus,” she said. Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said that Tallinn was ready “to allocate 0.25 percent of its GDP to military aid to Ukraine” over the next four years. “It’s way cheaper to support Ukraine now compared to the price the international community would have to pay if Russia would reach the goals of this merciless aggression,” said Tsahkna. The countries on the Baltic Sea are among Ukraine’s staunchest political, financial and military supporters. Zelenskyy’s visit comes ahead of the second anniversary of Russia’s February 2022 full-scaleinvasion of Ukraine. With the prospects of a protracted war growing, Ukraine has been appealing to its Western allies for more financial and military assistance. Ukraine has come under intenseRussian shellingin recent weeks and retaliated with strikes on Russia’s border city ofBelgorod. A European Union aid package worth 50 billion euros ($55bn) has been in limbo following a veto by Hungary, while the United States Congress remains divided on sending additional aid to Kyiv.

"US, Ukraine, dozens more condemn alleged Russia-North Korea arms transfers",Foreign ministers of nearly 50 countries say such activities breach UN sanctions on North Korea.,"Dozens of countries have joined Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States in condemning alleged ballistic missile transfers between North Korea and Russia, which they said were in breach of United Nations sanctions. In a joint statement, European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the foreign ministers from some 47 countries including Argentina, Australia, Guatemala, Japan and South Korea, condemned the alleged arms transfers in the “strongest possible terms”, saying the weapons had been used against Ukraine onDecember 30 and January 2. “The transfer of these weapons increases the suffering of the Ukrainian people, supports Russia’s war of aggression and undermines the global non-proliferation regime,” Wednesday’s statement said, noting such cooperation would also provide technical and military insights to North Korea. “We are deeply concerned about the security implications that this cooperation has in Europe, on the Korean Peninsula, across the Indo-Pacific region, and around the world,” it said. In a briefing earlier, US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Russia had since used more North Korean weapons in Ukraine, including one that landed in Kharkiv, the country’s second biggest city. The US and its allies plan to raise the issue with the UN Security Council (UNSC) on Wednesday, he added. The statement added that weapons procurement and supply between Pyongyang and Moscow was in breach of multiple UNSC resolutions imposed from 2006 in response to North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment when asked about the alleged weapons transfers. Reports emerged as early as 2022 that Russia was planning to buy weapons from North Korea for use in its invasion of Ukraine. In August last year, the US’s United Nations envoy Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the organisation that Moscow was negotiating “potential deals for significant quantities and multiple types of munitions”. Speculation intensified when the countries’ two leaders held a summit the following month at the Vostochny Cosmodrome, Russia’s most important satellite launch centre. Over some five hours, Vladimir Putin showed Kim Jong Un around the site in eastern Russia and said Moscow would help Pyongyang build satellites. Kim promised support for what he said was Russia’s “just fight”, in a comment that was viewed as being a reference to Ukraine. Kim later toured Russian weapons factories and was shown the country’s latest military equipment. Just two months later, North Korea announced the successful launch of its first military spy satellite, following the failure of two earlier attempts in May and August. It has said it plans to launchthree more this year. North Korea’s state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported on Tuesday that Kim was this week visiting arms factories where he emphasised the “strategic importance of the production of major weapons”. Kim also said the time has come to define South Korea as a state “most hostile” towards his country, according to the KCNA. He accused Seoul of inciting confrontation and an arms buildup while urging his country to step up its military capabilities for self-defence and its nuclear war deterrent. He described worsening relations on the divided peninsula as a “new phase of change” and “unavoidable reality”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/10/us-ukraine-dozens-more-condemn-alleged-russia-north-korea-arms-transfers

Russia begins city evacuation as it swaps cross-border strikes with Ukraine,Residents of Belgorod are moved away from the border while Ukraine deflects another barrage of drones and missiles.,"Russia has partially evacuated Belgorod and has requests for further removals following Ukrainian air strikes on the border city. About 300 residents from the city have been temporarily moved to safety further from the border, Belgorod region’s Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Monday. The evacuation comes as Russia and Ukraine increasingly trade drone and missile strikes. “Some 300 residents of Belgorod, who decided to temporarily evacuate, are at the moment being housed in temporary shelter centres in Stary Oskol, Gubkin and the Korochansky district,” which are further from the border, Gladkov said in a video posted on Telegram. Meanwhile, Ukraine reported on Monday that at least four people were killed as Russia launched more than 50 missiles and drones in the early hours. With the war on the front line in eastern Ukraine bogged down in winter trenches, Russia has concentrated on air strikes against Ukraine’s infrastructure, and what it says are military targets. However, civilian areas have been regularly hit. In response, Kyiv has begun sending its own drones and missiles at targets in the occupied east, as well as inside Russia itself. On December 30, 25 people were killed in Belgorod. It was the deadliest civilian toll in Russia since Moscow invaded its neighbour in February 2022. Ukraine has launchedfurther attackssince, spreading panic in the city, which sits about 30km (19 miles) from the border. The governor offered residents the option of evacuation on Friday. “Over the past 24 hours, we received 1,300 requests to send Belgorod children to school camps away from the city, in other regions,” Gladkov said.    Meanwhile, Russia continued its attacks on Ukraine on Monday, hitting residential areas and commercial sites as it launched more than 50 missiles and drones. At least four civilians were killed and some 30 injured, authorities reported, in the attacks in central and western parts of the country, as well as near the front lines. Ukraine’s air force said it had shot down 18 out of 51 projectiles overnight, including 32 cruise missiles and eight Iranian-made Shahed drones. “Critical infrastructure facilities, industrial civilian and military facilities were attacked,” the air force said. A shopping centre and more than two dozen private buildings were damaged in the southern city of Kryvyi Rih, Governor Serhiy Lysak reported, with one killed. “The mad enemy once again struck civilians,” Lysak wrote on the Telegram messaging app. “Directed missiles at people.” In the eastern city of Kharkiv, an industrial site and an educational facility were damaged in at least four missile strikes, Governor Oleh Synyehubov said. Four people were wounded in the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia, where Governor Yuriy Malashko reported five explosions and said residential areas had been hit. Officials in the western Khmelnytskyi region reported at least six blasts but gave no immediate details of the damage. A senior presidential adviser said one person had been killed, according to the Reuters news agency.

Putin praises Russian ‘defenders’ as Ukraine deflects another barrage,The Russian leader marked the eve of Orthodox Christmas with a call for ‘justice’ as drones and missiles struck Ukraine.,"Celebrating Orthodox Christmas, President Vladimir Putin has pledged to support soldiers defending Russia as his army sent another barrage of drones and missiles at Ukraine overnight. Speaking on the eve of Sunday’s Orthodox Christmas, the Kremlin chief promised military families that his government would offer increased backing to “Russian warriors” engaged in the invasion of Ukraine, launched in February 2022. Unlike last year, Putin did not call this year for a ceasefire. “Many of our men, our courageous, heroic guys, Russian warriors, even now, on this holiday, defend the interests of our country with arms in hand,” he said as he met bereaved families of Russian soldiers who have died in Ukraine. However, anger persists in some quarters over Russia’s treatment of its soldiers in the “meatgrinder” of Ukraine. In particular, following a mobilisation drive in September 2022, a lack of training and equipment was criticised. On Saturday, the wives of Russians mobilised to fight in Ukraine demanded the return of their husbands from the front. Many of those soldiers were spending Christmas in trenches, with the front-line war largely bogged down. Amid the stalemate, air raids have increased in frequency and intensity. Ukraine’s air force reported on Telegram on Sunday that it had shot down 21 out of 28 drones launched by Russia overnight, largely in the south and east of the country. Three cruise missiles also targeted the country, it said, without offering further details. “The enemy is shifting the focus of attack to the frontline territories – Kherson and Dnipropetrovsk regions were attacked by drones,” Air Force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat told national television. The drones were predominantly destroyed by mobile teams, saving “scarce” air defence missiles, he added. Dnipropetrovsk regional authorities said on Telegram that 12 people were injured in a drone attack in the city of Dnipro. The previous day, the Ukrainian authorities said a Russian missile attack killed 11 people and injured 10 in the eastern city of Pokrovsk. A Russian-installed official accused Kyiv of shelling parts of Donetsk now under Moscow’s control. Orthodox Christmas celebrations were cancelled in the Russia border city of Belgorod, where 25 people were killed on December 30 in Ukraine’s deadliest cross-border attack of the war. The city has come under further sporadic rocket attacks within the past week. In a separate greeting issued on the Kremlin’s website, Putin called on Russians to follow the “unshakable” values of “goodness, mercy and justice” and on the Russian Orthodox Church to help strengthen “the institution of families” and patriotism. Facing a presidential election in March, Putin has sought to further extol “traditional values”. The Orthodox Church has long been a reliable pillar of his regime and has helped stoke support for the invasion of Russia’s neighbour. Ukraine is also Orthodox, but this year it changed its tradition of joining Russia in celebrating Christmas on January 7. Instead, it officiallymarked the December 25 holidayfor the first time as part of an ongoing effort to remove Russian influence from the country. The change was enacted in a law signed by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in July, reflecting both the Ukrainians’ dismay with the 23-month-old Russian invasion and their assertion of anational identity.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/7/putin-praises-russian-defenders-as-ukraine-deflects-another-barrage

Ukraine says Russian missile attack kills 11 in eastern town,"Eight people were wounded after Russian forces hit the town of Pokrovsk with S-300 missiles, the regional governor said.","At least 11 people, including five children, have been killed by a Russian missile attack in and around the eastern Ukrainian town of Pokrovsk, according to the regional governor. Eight people were also wounded when Russian missiles hit the area, Vadym Filashkin, the governor of the Ukrainian-controlled part of the Donetsk region, said on Saturday. “The main blow was dealt to Pokrovsk and Rivne in the community of Myrnograd,” he wrote on the Telegram messaging app. He said S-300 missiles had been used in a series of attacks and one hit a house of a family of six. Filashkin released photographs showing rescuers working through the debris in the aftermath of the bombardment. He said the attack showed Russian forces were “trying to inflict as much grief as possible on our land”. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in his nightly video address, expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and accused Russia of once again deliberately targeting civilian objects. “And Russia must feel – feel every time – that none of these attacks will end without consequences for the terrorist state,” Zelenskyy said. The town of Pokrovsk, about 50km (30 miles) from the front line of the fighting, had already been hit by adeadly bombardment last August, which left at least eight people dead and 82 injured. Earlier on Saturday, Ukraine’s military claimed it successfully attacked the Saki military air base in the west of the Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula. “Saki airfield! All targets were hit!” Air Force commander Mykola Oleshchuk wrote on Telegram. Russian officials did not comment on the alleged attack but Russia’s Defence Ministry said in the early hours of Saturday that it had successfully downed four Ukrainian missiles over the peninsula overnight. Later on Saturday, the ministry reported that its air defence forces had shot down six anti-ship missiles over the Black Sea. Ukraine has targeted Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014, since the start of Moscow’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Meanwhile, as Russia’s nearly two-year-long war in Ukraine continues, the Kharkiv region prosecutor’s office provided evidence on Saturday that Russia attacked Ukraine with missiles supplied by North Korea, showcasing the fragments. Russia attacked Kharkiv with several missiles this week, killing two people and injuring more than 60 in one of its biggest missile and drone raids since the start of the war. “The production method is not very modern. There are deviations from standard Iskander missiles, which we previously saw during strikes on Kharkiv. This missile is similar to one of the North Korean missiles,” Dmytro Chubenko, the spokesperson for the prosecutor’s office, told media as he displayed the remnants. He said the missile was slightly bigger in diameter than the Russian Iskander missile, while its nozzle, internal electrical windings and rear parts were also different. On Friday, theUnited States saidRussia was using ballistic missiles from North Korea and seeking close-range ballistic missiles from Iran. In apost on Xon Friday, United Kingdom Defence Minister Grant Shapps warned, “The world has turned its back on Russia, forcing Putin into the humiliation of going cap in hand to North Korea to keep his illegal invasion going. In doing so, Russia has broken multiple UNSC resolutions and put the security of another world region at risk.” United Nations Security Council resolutions – approved with Russian support – ban countries from trading weapons or other military equipment with North Korea. While the Kremlin has not yet commented on the recent evidence, relations between Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un have warmed in recent months, with the two leaders also meeting in person in Russia last September.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/6/ukraine-says-russian-missile-attack-kills-11-in-eastern-town
"Russia used North Korean missiles in Ukraine, US says",The United States also expressed concerns that Russia is seeking close-range ballistic missiles from Iran.,"The United States has said that Russia is using ballistic missiles from North Korea and is seeking close-range ballistic missiles from Iran. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said on Thursday that recently declassified intelligence found that North Korea had provided Moscow with the weapons, at least one of which was fired into Ukraine on December 30, landing in an open field in the Zaporizhia region. Russia also launched “multiple” of the North Korean missiles onTuesdayduring an overnight attack, he added. Kirby also said that a Russia-Iran deal had not been completed but that the US “is concerned that Russia’s negotiations to acquire close-range ballistic missiles from Iran are actively advancing”. He said Washington and its allies will now raise the matter at the United Nations Security Council as it signals a breach of US sanctions against North Korea. The Biden administration has repeatedly looked to make the case that the Kremlin has become dependent on North Korea and Iran for the weapons it needs to continue its military operation in Ukraine and has disclosed findings it says prove that. So far, North Korea and Iran are largely isolated on the international stage for their nuclear programmes and human rights records. In October, the White House said that North Korea had delivered more than 1,000 containers of military equipment and munitions to Moscow. Britain on Thursday condemned Russia’s use of North Korean missiles in recent attacks against Ukraine. “We urge North Korea to cease its arms supply to Russia,” the UK’s Foreign Office spokesperson said in a statement. Earlier on Thursday, Ukraine announced that its air force had conducted a raid on a Russian command post near the occupied city of Sevastopol and hit a military unit in a separate attack on the Crimean Peninsula. Air Force Commander Mykola Oleshchuk posted a video on the Telegram app showing smoke rising from an explosion near Sevastopol, a Crimean port that serves as the main headquarters of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet. “Thanks again to the Air Force pilots and everyone who planned the operation for perfect combat work,” he said. The Moscow-installed governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhayev, described the attack as “the most massive in recent times”. He said one person was hospitalised after a piece of shrapnel struck. Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had foiled a Ukrainian attack, destroying 10 incoming missiles over the peninsula.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/4/russia-used-north-korean-missiles-in-ukraine-us-says

"Russia, Ukraine exchange hundreds of prisoners in largest release of war",More than 470 prisoners of war return home on both sides after the swap deals stalled in the latter half of 2023.,"Russia and Ukraine have exchanged hundreds of prisoners of war in the biggest single release of captives since Russia’s invasion began in February 2022. Ukrainian officials said on Wednesday that 230 of its prisoners were released while Russia said 248 of its soldiers were returned after mediation by the United Arab Emirates. While the two sides have gone through several exchanges during the war, swap deals stalled in the latter half of last year. The latest exchange was the first in almost five months. “More than 200 of our soldiers and civilians have been returned from Russian captivity,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced in a post on the Telegram messaging app that included a video of uniformed men celebrating. Ukraine’s human rights ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, said 230 Ukrainian prisoners, including six civilians, had been released, marking what he said was the 49th exchange between the two sides. Kyiv said this was the largest documented swap of troops so far. Some of the Ukrainians had been held since 2022. Among them were some who fought in milestone battles for Ukraine’s Snake Island and port city of Mariupol. The Russian Ministry of Defence said 248 of its soldiers had been returned after “complex” negotiations by the UAE. Russian officials offered no other details of the exchange. Also onWednesday, Russia said it shot down 12 missiles fired at one of its southern regions bordering Ukraine. The governor of Russia’s Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said the situation “continues to remain tense” after Ukraine launched repeated missile and drone attacks. While there have been no reports on casualty numbers from the latest attack, Gladkov said authorities were evacuating residents near possibly unexploded munitions with bomb disposal units called in to evaluate the danger. Defence Ministry technicians were working on disposing of an unexploded projectile, and about 600 residents from 323 houses within a 500-metre (550-yard) radius had been evacuated, he said. Gladkov added that several other villages also came under fire in Wednesday’s attack and a power line was knocked out. Russia’s Defence Ministry said Ukraine fired six Tochka-U ballistic missiles and six guided missiles from a Vilkha heavy multiple rocket launcher. Ukraine has escalated its attacks on Belgorod over the New Year period after Russia launched some of its most significant attacks on Ukraine since the war began. On Tuesday, Kyiv said Moscow had launched more than 300 attack drones and missiles of various kinds across Ukraine since Friday. Russian President Vladimir Putin has promised that Kyiv’s attacks on Belgorod would “not go unpunished”.

Ukrainian missiles target Russian border regions in retaliatory strikes,Recent escalation sees both sides deploying urban warfare tactics as renewed fighting erupts to the east in Bakhmut.,"Ukraine has launched air attacks on regions in Russia and occupied east Ukraine as the recent escalation of the war between the two countries continued. Russian officials reported on Wednesday that Ukrainian missiles targeted Belgorod and Kursk in southern Russia, as well as the Crimean Peninsula, annexed in 2014, in the latest in a series of deadly tit-for-tat attacks that began last week and have killed dozens of civilians. The overnight assault came a day after Russia struck Ukraine’s two largest cities, Kyiv and Kharkiv, with several dozen missiles and drones, killing five. Russia’s Ministry of Defence reported on Telegram that it had destroyed 12 Ukrainian missiles – six Tochka-U ballistic missiles and six guided missiles – over the Belgorod region. A Ukrainian attack the previous day had killed one person, said regional Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov. No casualties were reported from the latest attack, but the situation, he said, “continues to be tense”. Ukraine also hit the Kursk region, to the north of Belgorod, damaging infrastructure and causing power cuts, regional Governor Roman Starovoyt posted on Telegram. And, in occupied Crimea, the Russian-installed governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhaev, reported that a Ukrainian missile had been downed overnight. Ukraine rarely comments on its attacks on Russian soil. During the war, it has sporadically targeted border villages, launching missiles from an area blanketed by thick forests. As details on the Ukrainian strikes emerged, Yuriy Malashko, the head of Ukraine’s regional military administration, reported that the Zaporizhia region had been hit by 134 Russian strikes over the past 24 hours, killing two people. The spiral of tit-for-tat provocations started on Friday, when Russia launched one of its biggest attacks since the war started almost two years ago, its drones and missiles killing at least 31 people and damaging infrastructure. Despite insisting it only targets military infrastructure, Moscow appears to have shifted its focus to urban warfare, hitting civilians and destroying infrastructure, leaving many struggling to stay warm. Kyiv responded on Saturday, shelling Belgorod in an attack that killed more than two dozen people, according to Russia. President Vladimir Putin dubbed the assault a “terrorist” attack, saying it would “not go unpunished”. Ukraine said on Tuesday that Russia had launched more than 300 attack drones and missiles since the end of last year, including that day’s assault on Kyiv and Kharkiv. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pledged that Russia would have to “answer for every life taken away”. The spike in tensions comes against a backdrop of renewed fighting in eastern Ukraine, with the contested town of Bakhmut a hot point. Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander of the Ukrainian army’s ground forces, said on Telegram that Russia was on the offensive, striking the Lyman area with guided aerial bombs as its forces regroup. Amid the recent spate of attacks, Ukraine has been pressing to reinvigorate Western support, which has appeared to flag in recent months. Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski on Wednesday called for Western nations to supply Ukraine with long-range missiles to enable it to strike Russian launch sites and command centres. “We should respond to the latest onslaught on Ukraine in language that Putin understands: by tightening sanctions so that he cannot make new weapons with smuggled components,” he added. The Russian barrage of missiles and drones in recent days has drawn renewed condemnation from across Europe. Charles Michel, president of the European Council, reiterated the EU’s support for Ukraine, saying Russia’s air attacks showed it was not interested in peace talks. Norway announced it was clearing the direct sale of weapons to Ukraine. Norway’s Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said: “In the extraordinary security situation resulting from Russia’s war of aggression, it is crucial that we continue to support Ukraine.” The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) condemned the “continuing and intensifying aerial attacks by Russia in its war against Ukraine”. However, Russia’s permanent mission to the OSCE blasted the organisation, complaining that it had failed to condemn the “barbaric missile attacks in Belgorod”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/3/ukraine-targets-russian-border-regions-in-retaliatory-strikes

Russia continues to step up assault on Ukraine with missile barrage,Russia has escalated its attacks on Ukraine as its invasion enters a third calendar year.,"Russia has maintained its recent intensification of air attacks on Ukraine as it unleashed a huge overnight assault. Hundreds of Russian missiles and drones struck the capital, Kyiv, and Kharkiv on Tuesday. The intensified attack on the country’s two largest cities came just a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin pledged to exact “revenge” for adeadly assaulton the Russian city of Belgorod. However, the Russian strikes follow a trend that has seen itescalate its air attackson Ukraine in recent days. With the front line largely bogged down in trench warfare, Moscow has returned to its tactic from last winter, during which it targeted infrastructure, especially energy and heating, leaving millions of Ukrainians struggling to stay warm. That has seen a hike in civilian casualties amid numerous strikes in urban areas. Following Tuesday’s attacks, Russia’s Ministry of Defence claimed that it had destroyed all “military-industrial” installations targeted. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said four people had been killed and at least 92 injured in Tuesday’s attacks, noting that Russia had launched about 170 Shahed attack drones and dozens of different missiles at Ukraine since the last day of 2023. Russia, he said, would “answer for every life taken away”. Ukraine struck back shortly afterwards, sending four Alder MLRS missiles towards Belgorod. All were intercepted by Russian forces, according to regional Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov. Local authorities reported that one person had been hospitalised. “For the third day already, our air defenders are doing incredible work,” Zelenskyy said on Telegram messenger. “This is one of the most extensive strikes on the capital,” said Al Jazeera reporter Assed Baig from Kyiv. “We understand there are parts of the city without electricity and mobile connection.” The attacks on Kyiv came during peak hours. Sirens rang through the city as rescue services rushed to areas hit by debris from missiles downed by Ukraine’s air defence systems. Earlier, Ukraine’s air force said it had intercepted 35 drones that Russia launched after midnight, targeting several cities. Four strikes on Kharkiv killed at least one person and injured 41, according to Oleg Sinegubov, the governor of the Kharkiv region. The latest escalation in the war began late on Thursday, when Russia launched a drone and missile attack across Ukraine, killing at least 31 and injuring about 160 people. The Ukrainian forces said they had never seen so many locations attacked simultaneously. On Saturday, Ukraine shelled the border city of Belgorod. Russia said more than two dozen people had been killed, including five children, in the shelling. Ukraine’s officials have not accepted responsibility for a series of strikes on Russian territory. Describing the assault on Belgorod as a “terrorist attack”, Putin pledged to mete out punishment during a visit to a military hospital on Monday. By this point, Russia had already rung in the new year by launching a record 90 Shahed-style drones towards Ukraine. Most of the drones were downed by Ukrainian forces, but five people were reportedly killed and eight injured in the Black Sea port city of Odesa. In his New Year speech on Monday, Zelenskyy, who is struggling to secureincreased supportfrom the United States and the European Union, promised to raise Ukraine’s production of weapons. The country will build at least a million drones, he said, promising Russia will face the “wrath” of it. The increased intensity of the war could yet help Ukraine’s drive to convince its partners of the dangers posed by Russia and the need to send more funding and weapons. Following Tuesday’s attacks, Kyiv reiterated its desperate need. Ukraine’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement urging faster supplies of air defence systems, combat drones, and long-range missiles. Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called on European allies to cease contact with Russian diplomats and to transfer frozen Russian assets to serve Ukraine’s needs. Amid Tuesday’s barrage, Poland, which last weekreportedthat a Russian missile had briefly passed through its airspace, said it had mobilised two pairs of F-16 fighter jets and an air tanker. Later, the planes returned to the base, judging that the threat had diminished.

Putin vows to intensify strikes on Ukraine after deadly Belgorod attack,"At least five people are killed in New Year’s Day attacks on Odesa, southern Ukraine and Russian-occupied Donetsk.","Russian President Vladimir Putin has promised to intensify strikes on Ukraine after an unprecedented attack on the Russian city of Belgorod over the weekend. Saturday’s air attack killed at least 25 people and wounded more than 100, according to Russian officials. Russia has blamed Ukraine for the attack, which was one of the deadliest to take place on Russian soil since Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine started more than 22 months ago. “We’re going to intensify the strikes. No crime against civilians will rest unpunished – that’s for certain,” Putin said on Monday during a visit to a military hospital. He said Russia would continue hitting what he called “military installations”. “We are doing that today, and tomorrow, we will continue doing it,” Putin said. Putin previously called the destruction in Belgorod a “terrorist attack” and accused Ukrainian forces of targeting “the city centre, where people were walking before New Year’s Eve”. He said Ukraine was being used by the West to “settle its problems” and insisted the course of the war was changing in Russia’s favour. The Russian Ministry of Defence said Ukraine hit Belgorod with two missiles and several rockets. It said most of the weapons were shot down, but some debris fell on the city. Vyacheslav Gladkov, governor of the Belgorod region, said the attack damaged 30 apartment buildings and several houses and cars. Ukrainian officials rarely acknowledge responsibility for attacks on Russian territory. At least five people were killed inNew Year’s Day attackson southern Ukraine’s Odesa region and the Russian-occupied eastern city of Donetsk. A 15-year-old boy was killed and seven people were wounded when falling debris from one of 87 downed drones hit a residential building in the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa, the head of the region’s military administration, Oleh Kiper, said. In the western city of Lviv, Russian attacks severely damaged a museum dedicated to Roman Shukhevych, a Ukrainian nationalist and military commander who fought for Ukrainian independence during World War II. University buildings in the town of Dubliany were also damaged. Writing on social media, Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi described the strike as “symbolic and cynical”, adding, “This is a war for our history.” Four people were killed and 13 wounded in Ukrainian shelling of Russian-occupied areas of Donetsk, according to the region’s Kremlin-installed leader, Denis Pushilin. Russian state media reported that a journalist was among the victims but provided no details.

Denis Pushilin, the Russian-installed head of the broader Donetsk region, said four people had been killed in Donetsk, accusing Ukraine of “massive shelling from multiple launch rocket systems”. At least 14 people had been injured, he added. Oleh Kiper, the governor of the Odesa region, meanwhile, said one person had been killed after a Russian air raid on Odesa. Kiper said that Ukraine’s air defence systems were engaged in repelling the drone attack, but the falling debris caused several fires in residential buildings in different parts of the city, and at least three people had been injured. A social media video, posted by Odesa Mayor Henadii Trukhanov, showed him inspecting a damaged apartment with broken windows. “They say that how you welcome the New Year is how you will live the year,” Trukhanov said in the post. “Well, this year Ukraine will break this rule: We will persevere and we will win. Ukraine’s Air Force said that Russian air attacks also targeted the Mykolaiv and Dnipro regions, as well as the city of Lviv. Air attacks have escalated since Friday when Russia launched some 158 missiles and drones on Ukraine’s major cities in a barrage thatkilled at least 30people and injured more than 140. That was followed on Saturday by a Ukrainian attack on the Russian border town of Belgorod in which at least21 people were killed and 111 injured. With Moscow promising to retaliate, on Sunday it launched a new aerial bombardment of Ukraine, targeting Kharkiv, the country’s second biggest city, withsix missiles, as well as drones.

Russia targets Ukraine ‘military’ sites in retaliation for Belgorod attack,"Kharkiv, Kyiv and other cities attacked in the latest wave of attacks, while missile alert sounded in Russia’s Belgorod.","Russia says it has targeted Ukrainian military sites in the capital Kyiv and Kharkiv in a new wave of drone and missile attacks in days, in retaliation for a deadly attack a day earlier on the city of Belgorod. The Russian defence ministry said on Sunday it had struck “decision-making centres and military installations” in the northeastern city of Kharkhiv, after Kyiv said that residential buildings, a hotel and cafes had been hit. In the first wave of overnight attacks, at least six missiles hit Kharkiv, Ukraine’s National Police said on Sunday, injuring at least 22 people and hitting 12 apartment buildings, 13 residential houses and a kindergarten. Most drones were aimed at Ukraine’s first line of defence as well as at civilian, military and infrastructure in the Kharkiv, Kherson, Mykolaiv and Zaporizhia regions, the Ukrainian Air Force said, adding that it destroyed 21 out of 49 attack drones. Earlier, Ukrainian officials said that among those injured in Kharkiv were two boys aged 14 and 16 and a security adviser for a team of German journalists. Closer to midnight, as part of a wider bombardment of Ukraine that also targeted Kyiv, several waves of Russian drones hit residential buildings in Kharkiv’s centre, spouting fires, the mayor of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, said. “On the eve of the New Year, the Russians want to intimidate our city, but we are not scared – we are unbreakable and invincible!” Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. Russia accused Ukraine of carrying out a “terrorist attack” on Saturday on civilians in the city of Belgorod, including using controversial cluster munitions in strikes that killed at least 22 people and wounded dozens more. The governor of Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, called residents of the city of Belgorod to hide in shelters on Sunday as a missile threat alert was issued in the city, according to a post on his Telegram account. In his New Year’s Eve address on Sunday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia would “never back down” praising his country’s military personnel. “We have repeatedly proved that we are able to solve the most difficult tasks and will never retreat, because there is no force that can separate us,” Putin said. “To all those who are on duty, on the front line of the fight for truth and justice,” Putin said, “you are our heroes. Our hearts are with you. We are proud of you, we admire your courage.” Earlier, Moscow said the attack – which followed waves of rocket and drone strikes by Russian forces on Ukrainian cities – would “not go unpunished”. In an emergency meeting at the UN Security Council, demanded by Russia, envoy Vasily Nebenzya claimed Kyiv targeted a sports centre, an ice rink and a university. “[It was a] deliberate, indiscriminate attack against a civilian target,” Nebenzya said on Saturday. At least 40 people were killed on Friday in one of Russia’s biggest attacks on Ukraine since its invasion nearly two years ago. Nebenzya defended the attacks saying Moscow had targeted only military infrastructure and that Ukraine’s air defence systems were responsible for civilian casualties. Poland, a member of the NATO military alliance, on Fridaysaid a Russian missile briefly passed through its airspacebefore leaving, prompting concern from the country that borders Ukraine. Fighting between Russia and Ukraine has intensified over the past week amid speculations that the war has reached a stalemate. US President Joe Biden said on Saturday he would speak to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy after the latest attacks. Biden said on Friday that the assault demonstrates that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s goals in Ukraine “remain unchanged” nearly two years after Russia first launched its invasion. “He seeks to obliterate Ukraine and subjugate its people. He must be stopped,” Biden said in a statement. While support for Ukraine remains robust among Western countries, further military assistance has met growing pushback by conservative political forces in the US and Europe. The United States, Ukraine’s biggest single-country donor, has sent more than $40bn in aid since Russia’s invasion in February 2022. But right-wing congressional Republicans have expressed increasing scepticism towards approving more funds for Ukraine. The US Senate will vote on an aid package for Ukraine in 2024. But Congress could continue to hold up the money. The impasse over US aid to Kyiv is mirrored in the European Union, where Hungary is blocking a 50 billion euro ($55bn) aid package. The bloc is due to revisit the issue in January. The difficulties in securing the funds in Washington and Brussels have raised concerns in Kyiv that Western backers are experiencing “fatigue” with the drawn-out battle, as fighting on the front line becomes bogged down. Zelenskyy has noted that Kyiv’s “foreign policy will be active” with many international activities in January. “We make every effort to strengthen Ukraine and ensure that everyone is confident about the coming year, about military aid, macro-financial assistance, and political support,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/31/russia-targets-ukraine-military-sites-in-retaliation-for-belgorod-attack

Russia says 21 people killed in Ukrainian attack on Belgorod,"Moscow says it shot down 32 Ukrainian drones, a day after Russia launched one of its deadliest attacks on Ukraine since it began its invasion in 2022.","At least 21 people, including three children, have been killed and 111 more injured following a Ukrainian attack on the centre of the Russian provincial capital of Belgorod, according to the Russian Emergencies Ministry. Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Saturday that the attack on Belgorod, about 30km (19 miles) from the border with Ukraine, hit a residential area. In a Telegram post, he urged all residents to move to air raid shelters as sirens sounded. Belgorod borders Ukraine’s Luhansk, Sumy and Kharkiv regions, some of which were hit byRussian air raidson Ukraine on Friday in what was one of its deadliest attacks since Moscow began its full-scale invasion in February 2022. The death toll from those attacks, which damaged a maternity hospital, apartment blocks, and schools, has now risen to at least 41. Belgorod is about 600km (373 miles) from the Russian capital, Moscow, and has served as a vital base for the Kremlin’s forces to launch attacks towards Ukraine. Russia’s Defence Ministry said in a statement the attack would “not go unpunished”. The ministry said its anti-aircraft units had destroyed 13 Ukrainian rockets over the Belgorod region on Friday. Russian forces also shot down 32 Ukrainian drones across the country, Moscow officials said earlier on Saturday. Drones were seen in the skies over the Moscow, Bryansk, Oryol, and Kursk regions, the ministry said in a statement. All the drones had been destroyed by air defences, it added. Russia on Saturday requested a meeting of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) to discuss the deadly strike. It was “a terrorist attack by the Kyiv regime against a civilian city,” said Russia’s ambassador to the UN Vasily Nebenzya, claiming that Kyiv targeted a sports centre, an ice rink and a university. “[It was a] deliberate, indiscriminate attack against a civilian target.” Ukraine and its allies quickly retorted, saying Russia had started the war. “As long as this war, unleashed by the Kremlin dictator endures, the toll of death and suffering will continue to grow,” said Ukraine’s Ambassador to the UN Serhii Dvornyk. The United Kingdom’s envoy Thomas Phipps said the UK “deeply” regretted any civilian losses, but also noted it had been Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to start the war. “There are hundreds of thousands of Russian soldiers in Ukraine. There is not a single Ukrainian soldier in Russia,” he said. “If Russia wants someone to blame for the deaths of Russians in this war, it should start with President Putin.” Ukrainian officials never acknowledge responsibility for attacks on Russian territory or the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow seized and annexed from Ukraine in 2014. However, larger aerial attacks against Russia have previously followed heavy assaults on Ukrainian cities. Russia also rejects claims it targets civilians. Russian drone attacks against Ukraine continued on Saturday, with the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces reporting that 10 Iranian-made Shahed drones had been shot down across the Kherson, Khmelnytskyi, and Mykolaiv regions. On Friday, Moscow’s forces launched more than 100 missiles and dozens of drones across Ukraine, an onslaught described by a Ukrainian Air Force official as the biggest aerial barrage of the war. Rescuers continued to search through the rubble on Saturday. Relief operations in the aftermath of yesterday’s Russian attack continue. Almost 120 cities and villages have been affected, with hundreds of civilian objects damaged. I thank all of our State Emergency Service rescuers, municipal employees, police officers, and everyone who is…pic.twitter.com/bWFq2Wv0CU — Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa)December 30, 2023  “Relief operations in the aftermath of yesterday’s Russian attack continue. Almost 120 cities and villages have been affected, with hundreds of civilian objects damaged,” Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on X. January 1 will be declared a day of mourning in Kyiv, the capital, where at least 16 people were killed, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said. The UNSC criticised Russia for carrying out its huge air assault at a meeting on Friday. But Russia’s Nebenzya claimed Moscow had “exclusively only targeted military infrastructure in Ukraine”. Fighting along the front line is largely bogged down by winter weather after Ukraine’s summer counteroffensive failed to make a significant breakthrough along the roughly 1,000km (620-mile) front line. Russia’s continuing aerial attacks have also generated concern among Ukraine’s neighbours. Poland’s defence forces said on Friday that a Russian missile had brieflyentered its airspace, however, Russian sources said Warsaw had not given the Kremlin evidence of an airspace violation.

Poland says Russian missile briefly entered its airspace,NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg says organisation is ‘monitoring the situation’ as Poland says it has confirmed incident.,"Polish military authorities have said that a Russian missile briefly passed through the country’s airspace before leaving, prompting concern from the country thatborders Ukraineon the day Russia carried out attacks across several Ukrainian citieskilling at least 30 people. Poland, a member of the NATO military alliance, says that the object entered from the direction of Ukraine on Friday morning, entering about 40 kilometers (24 miles) before leaving after about three minutes. “Everything indicates that a Russian missile intruded in Poland’s airspace,” said Poland’s defence chief, General Wieslaw Kukula. “It was monitored by us on radars and left the airspace. We have confirmation of this on radars and from [NATO] allies.” The incident comes at a time of high tensions between Russia and European nations located near Ukraine, whichRussia invadedin February 2022. Spoke with President@AndrzejDudaabout the missile incident in#Poland.#NATOstands in solidarity with our valued Ally, is monitoring the situation & we will remain in contact as the facts are established. NATO remains vigilant. — Jens Stoltenberg (@jensstoltenberg)December 29, 2023  Polish officials say they are working to further verify their findings and rule out the possibility of a technical malfunction. The Russian news agency RIA quoted Russia’s charge d’affaires in the country, who was summoned by the Polish government, as stating that Poland had provided no proof of a border violation. In a social media post on Friday, NATO Secretary GeneralJens Stoltenbergsaid that the security alliance is monitoring the situation and communicating with Polish officials. “I spoke with President Andrzej Duda about the missile incident in Poland. NATO stands in solidarity with our valued ally, is monitoring the situation and we will remain in contact as the facts are established. NATO remains vigilant,” Stoltenberg said. Operational commander of the Polish army Maciej Klisz said that the country’s air defence network had been on high alert due to recent Russianmissile and drone attacksin Ukraine and that fighter jets were sent to intercept the missile before it left Polish territory. The military also said that a ground search was being carried out in the area where the missile disappeared off the radar. The White House on Friday said that US President Joe Biden was closely following the development in Poland. White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan “expressed the United States’ solidarity with Poland, our close NATO ally” and pledged technical assistance as needed in a call with Polish Secretary of State Jacek Siewiera, according to a statement from the White House.    The incident is not the first time that the war in Ukraine has threatened tospill overinto Polish territory. In November 2022, an errant Ukrainian airdefence missilekilled two civilians when it landed in the border village of Przewodow. Poland’s newly elected Prime MinisterDonald Tusk, who won the election with a bloc of pro-EU and pro-Ukraine parties that overthrew the country’s far-right government after eight years in power, has promised full support for Ukraine in its war against Russia. That war has ground on for nearly two years, with little end in sight as Ukraine fights to expel Russian forces that have established strong defences along the captured territory. While Ukraine still has substantial support from many Western governments, schisms havestarted to emergeover the provision of furthermilitary assistance, including in the US, which has provided more support than any other country. On Friday, the British defence ministry said that it would send 200 air defence missiles to Ukraine, which is currently under heavy bombardment from Russian forces. Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyysaid on Friday that he visited Avdiivka, an eastern town near the front line that has seen heavy fighting. “This is one of the most difficult areas of the front line,” he wrote on Telegram along with a video of him in front of a sign with the name of the town, giving medals to soldiers. “I thank all those who are at the first line [of fire] for their service, for this year during which the entire country survived thanks to its soldiers,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/29/poland-says-russian-missile-briefly-entered-its-airspace
Russian court hands Navalny ally long prison sentence,"Since the invasion of Ukraine, nearly all of the Kremlin’s critics have been jailed or gone into exile.","A Russian court has handed a nine-and-a-half-year prison sentence to an ally of Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny. Ksenia Fadeyeva, a lawyer and lawmaker in the Siberian city of Tomsk, was sent to prison for running an “extremist organisation”, her legal team said. She is the latest Russian opposition figure to be detained during the war in Ukraine. “The ‘judge’ Khudyakov has ordered a nine-year sentence against Ksenia Fadeyeva,” her supporters said on the social media site Telegram, adding that the sentence will be appealed. Russian authorities designated Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation “extremist” in 2021, effectively banning it and exposing its members to the risk of prosecution. Several have been hit with harsh penalties. Fadeyeva headed a local chapter of the organisation. In 2020, she was elected to the Tomsk municipal council in what was seen as a notable victory for opponents of President Vladimir Putin’s government, which has largely sought to bar challengers from elections. However, with the outlawing of the Anti-Corruption Foundation, she was banned from using the internet in December 2021 and has been under house arrest since October. The Kremlin has clamped down on the opposition since it launched its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and the majority of the Kremlin’s leading critics are now in exile or behind bars. Several regional heads of the Anti-Corruption Foundation have been jailed, including Lilia Chanysheva, Navalny’s ally in the central Bashkortostan Republic, who was handed seven and a half years in prison this summer. Navalny has been behind bars since January 2021 when he returned to Moscow after recuperating in Germany from nerve agent poisoning, which he blamed on the Kremlin. This month, his supporters reported they had lost contact with him. On Monday, it emerged that he had beenmoved to a remote Arctic prison. Before his arrest, Navalny had campaigned against corruption and organised major anti-Kremlin protests. He has since received three prison terms. In September, a court extended his sentence to19 yearson extremism charges and ruled that he be moved to a more secure, harsher prison. He has rejected all charges against him as politically motivated. Last week, former television journalist Yekaterina Duntsova, who had put her name forward as an independent candidate in Russia’s presidential election in March, wasbarred from running. The Central Electoral Commission rejected Duntsova’s application, filed on December 20, citing “mistakes in documents”. She had planned to run on a platform of ending thewar in Ukraineand freeingpolitical prisoners.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/29/russian-court-hands-navalny-ally-9-5-year-prison-sentence
Ukraine says at least 30 killed in massive Russian air assault,Cities across the country hit with Russian drones and missiles in one of the largest aerial barrages of the war.,"Ukrainian officials have said that at least 30 people have been killed and more than 140 wounded after Russia targeted cities across the war-torn country with a massive salvo of missiles and drones in one of the largest aerial assaults of the war. The Ukrainian military said on Friday that Russia has launched an estimated 158 missiles and drones in the wave of attacks, targeting cities such as Kyiv, Odesa, Kharkiv, Dnipro, and Lviv. Ukrainian officials say that most of the attacks have been intercepted. “Today, Russia hit us with almost everything it has in its arsenal,” President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said of the attacks. The assault illustrated Kyiv’s desperate need for additional defence capabilities, as residents sought shelter from the barrage of projectiles, which Air Force commander Mykola Oleshchuk called “the most massive aerial attack” since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. “There was an explosion, then flames,” Kateryna Ivanivna, a 72-year-old resident of the capital city of Kyiv, told The Associated Press. “I covered my head and got down in the street. Then, I ran into the subway station.” United States President Joe Biden said on Friday that the assault demonstrates that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s goals in Ukraine “remain unchanged” nearly two years after Russia first launched its invasion. “He seeks to obliterate Ukraine and subjugate its people. He must be stopped,” Biden said in a statement. While support for Ukraine remains robust among Western countries, further military assistance has met growing pushback by conservative political forces in the US and Europe. Biden has called on the US Congress to pass an additional assistance package for Ukraine, but that effort has been delayed until the new year as schisms emerge within the Republican Party over continued support. “Unless Congress takes urgent action in the new year, we will not be able to continue sending the weapons and vital air defense systems Ukraine needs to protect its people. Congress must step up and act without any further delay,” Biden’s statement reads. With the front line largely bogged down in trench warfare, Russia has in recent weeks returned to its tactic from last winter, during which it targeted infrastructure, especially energy and heating, leaving millions of Ukrainians struggling to stay warm. Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal noted that the barrage on Friday targeted critical infrastructure. The Ministry of Energy reported that four Ukrainian regions in the north and south were facing power cuts. Missiles and drones were also reported to have hit numerous civilian sites, including residential buildings. Falling debris caused fires in a residential building and a warehouse in Kyiv and blasts were heard in Lviv, officials said. A metro station building in Kyiv being used as a shelter was damaged, Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko said on the Telegram messaging app. Twenty-two Russian attacks were recorded in Kharkiv, damaging a hospital, residential buildings and an industrial facility, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. “We understand that four areas have been hit here in the capital, Kyiv,” Al Jazeera’s Assed Baig reported. Death and injuries were reported from Dnipro, Baig said, adding that two sites were hit in the western city of Lviv. Rescue teams were working through the damage, he said. Tensions also remain high in countries that border Ukraine, with Polish authorities reporting on Friday that aRussian missile had entered the country’s airspacefor several minutes before leaving. The surge in Russian attacks has been linked to a successful Ukrainian attack on a Russian warship in Crimea this week.    The Russian military confirmed on Friday that it had since launched dozens of attacks on Ukraine. “In the period from December 23 to 29, the armed forces of the Russian Federation carried out 50 group strikes and one massive strike … All targets were hit,” it said in a daily update. The Russian military claimed in that report that its attacks were aimed at military facilities. However, Kyiv pointed out the civilian deaths and damage caused by the barrage and said it illustrates its dire need for increased support from its Western allies, which has becomebogged downby political manoeuvring in Washington and Brussels. Hypersonic, cruise and ballistic missiles, including the X-22, which is hard to intercept, were used in the attacks, said Ukraine’s Air Force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat. “We have not had so many red enemy targets on our monitors for a long time.” “We are doing everything to strengthen our air shield, but the world needs to see that we need more support and strength to stop this terror,” presidential aide Andriy Yermak wrote on Telegram. Zelenskyythankedthe United States for releasing the last remaining package of weapons available for Ukraine under existing authorisation. But uncertainty surrounds further aid. The US, Ukraine’s biggest single-country donor, has sent more than $40bn since Russia’s invasion in February 2022, but right-wing Republicans are opposing President Joe Biden’s bid to win approval for additional spending. The impasse is mirrored in the European Union, where Hungary isblockinga 50-billion-euro ($55bn) aid package. The bloc is due to revisit the issue in January, but it is understood that it will be unable to uphold promises to send one million rounds of ammunition. Zelenskyy, meanwhile, continues to argue for the West to increase its support. “To defend freedom and security not only in Ukraine and Europe but also in the United States, we must continue to respond to ongoing Russian aggression,” he said. Western allies responded to the huge barrage on Friday by reiterating their support. The US ambassador to Kyiv wrote on X that the attacks showed “Ukraine needs funding now to continue to fight for freedom from such horror in 2024.” The European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell condemned Russia’s “cowardly and indiscriminate targeting” of civilians. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the assault illustrated that “Putin will stop at nothing to achieve his aim of eradicating freedom and democracy,” the UK’s defence ministry said on Friday that it was sending 200 air defence missiles to assist Ukraine. “We will not let him win,” added Sunak. “We must continue to stand with Ukraine – for as long as it takes.” The French Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs said in a statement, “Russia is continuing its strategy of terror aimed at destroying Ukrainian civilian infrastructure in order to undermine the resilience of the Ukrainian population.” “France will continue to support Ukraine and provide it with the necessary assistance to enable it to exercise its self-defence, in close coordination with its partners.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/29/ukraine-seeks-increased-support-amid-huge-russian-air-assault
"Ukraine drives Russia back at sea and in the air, but concedes land","Russia lost a landing ship and five planes this week, but took a flattened suburb.","Ukraine claimed anammunition-laden Russian shipand five Sukhoi fighters and bombers this week but made a tactical retreat in the east to preserve its fighting force. Ukrainian fighter planes launched cruise missiles against the Novocherkassk, a Ropucha-class landing ship at a port in Feodosia, on the eastern side of the Crimean peninsula, on the night of December 25-26. Ukrainian Air Force chief MykolaOleshchukposted video of a massive explosion that came after the initial impact of the missiles had set the ship alight, suggesting the Novocherkassk was laden with weapons or munitions that detonated. Russia’s defence ministry admitted only that the ship had been damaged, but daytime satellitepicturesshowed the burned ship half-submerged at its berth on December 27. “We can see how powerful the explosion was, what the detonation was like. After that, it’s very hard for a ship to survive, because this was not a rocket, this is the detonation of munitions,” Ukrainian Air Force spokesman Yuri Ignat told Radio Free Europe. Sergei Aksyonov, the Russian-installed governor of Crimea, said on Telegram that one person had been killed and the Russian RIA news agency said four people had been injured, but the death toll may have been as high as 80, theUkrainian navysaid, citing reports that 77 personnel were on board the ship at the time of the blast. The attack was an example of the success Ukraine has had this year in striking Russian assets at range, partly thanks to Storm Shadow and SCALP missiles it has received from Britain and France, and partly thanks to the aerial and surface drones it has been developing. On the day the Novocherkassk was hit, Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) unveiled the Mamai, a new surface drone with a top speed of 110km/h, claiming it was “the fastest object on the Black Sea to date”. Ukraine has already used Sea Baby drones successfully to damage Russian ships at Sevastopol and Novorossiysk ports, and to strike the Kerch Bridge. Ukraine also remained alert to opportunities to down Russian aircraft that stray too near the front. On December 23, Ukraine’s Air Force said it downed three Russian Sukhoi-34 bombers, two over Odesa and one in the direction of the Russian region of Bryansk. Air Force spokesman Ignat said the Russian pilots were caught unaware when they tried to fly close to Ukrainian combat lines to release glide bombs. “UAVs weighing 500kgs can fly 20–25 kilometres from the line of combat. When you need to strike further, you need to fly closer,” said Ignat. “But our defenders caught the invaders by surprise.” The following day Ukraine’s Air Force said it had downed a Russian Sukhoi-30 fighter and another Sukhoi-34 bomber, without specifying where or how. “What the Ukrainians used has not yet been confirmed, but the evidence points extremely strongly towards the use of Patriot anti-air missiles,” wrote strategy professor at St Andrews University Phillips O’Brien, citing an incident on May 12, when Ukraine shot down four Russian aircraft in Russian airspace. “What later emerged is that the Ukrainians had laid a trap for the Russians. They had secretly moved one of their new Patriot batteries [that had just become functional in Ukraine] very close to the Russian border in Kharkiv oblast. From there, the Ukrainians could reach into Russia itself and ambush the unsuspecting Russians.” If that assessment is accurate, it would explain why Moscow was so upset when Japan modified its laws to be able to export a Patriot system back to the United States. While it still refuses to export arms to an active war theatre, Japan’s move gives the US extra capacity in Patriot systems, allowing the US to ship the system to Ukraine. “It cannot be ruled out that under an already tested scheme Patriot missiles will end up in Ukraine,” Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova told a weekly briefing on December 27. Such a scenario would be “interpreted as unambiguously hostile actions against Russia and will lead to grave consequences for Japan”. Ukraine has also been doing extremely well in safeguarding its airspace from a nightly onslaught of Iranian-designed Shahed drones launched by Russia. During the week of December 21-27, it downed 154 drones of 177 launched by Russia, an 87 percent kill rate. The previous week it scored a 98 percent kill rate. Ignat recently said Ukraine has downed 2,900 out of 3,700 drones launched by Russia during the war. Both of the last two weekly scores were higher than the average kill rate of 78 percent, suggesting that Ukraine’s air defences are adapting. Ukraine is about to receive a boost to its air defences. “Today I informed President [Volodymyr] Zelenskyy of our government’s decision to prepare an initial 18 F-16 fighter aircraft for delivery to Ukraine,” Dutch caretaker prime minister Mark Rutte said in a post on social media platform X on December 22. It was not clear when the planes would be delivered, but a recent Estonian defence ministry strategy document said the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway and Belgium have already committed to donating F-16s to Ukraine “before the end of the year”. Ukrainian pilots have been training on F-16s in Britain, the US and Romania for much of this year. The ground war is where Ukraine faced difficulties. Russia claimed control ofMaryinka, a suburb of the occupied Donetsk city in the east, on December 24. “Our assault units … have today completely liberated the settlement of Maryinka,” Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu told Russian President Vladimir Putin in a televised meeting. “What is important is that we have quite significantly moved the work of artillery further from Donetsk to the west,” Shoigu said, offering Donetsk city a broader defensive envelope. Ukraine insisted it was still within the town’s administrative limits: Commander-in-Chief Valery Zaluzhny said a tactical decision had been made to give up most of Maryinka to save lives – except for a garrison left holding the north of the neighbourhood. “The method is absolutely the same as it was inBakhmut– our fighters are destroyed street by street, block by block – and after that we have what we have,” Zaluzhny said. Unlike in Bakhmut, Ukraine made a decision not to fight for every last square foot. Yet, as was the case in other cities Russia has taken –Mariupol, Bakhmut, Severdonetsk and Lysychansk – the fighting needed to capture Maryinka was so severe that nothing of the city remained. An aerialphotographcirculated by Anton Gerashchenko, a Ukrainian interior ministry adviser, showed the suburban Donetsk town, which had a pre-war population of 10,000, so destroyed that not a single building appeared habitable. One or two exterior walls were all that remained of most houses. In many cases, buildings had been bombed to their foundations. Russian leaders made much of this achievement. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu spoke of the difficulty of storming well-protected machine-gun positions connected by underground passages, and even aggrandised the event by pointing out that Maryinka was taken by the 150th motorised rifle Idritsa-Berlin Order of Kutuzov division, which seized the Reichstag building in 1945. Still, Maryinka is less than a kilometre from the pre-invasion front line of February 2022 and there are signs of Russian frustration at the glacial pace of its gains, despite Russia’s vastly greater resources. On the Left Bank of the Dnipro river in Kherson, where Ukrainian forces have established a small bridgehead during the autumn, neither Russian marines nor the newly formed 104th Air Assault Division have been able to dislodge them. In the 96th week of the war, Russia appears to have broken international law and used tear gas. Russia’s 810th Naval Infantry Brigade posted on December 23 that it had adopted a “radical change in tactics” near Krynky in Kherson, “dropping K-51 grenades from drones” onto Ukrainian positions. “K-51 aerosol grenades are filled with irritant CS gas, a type of tear gas used for riot control (also known as a Riot Control Agent [RCA]),” wrote the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War. “The Chemical Weapons Convention prohibits the use of RCAs as a method of warfare, and Russia has been a state party to the CWC since 1997,” it said. Ukraine is also suffering from fatigue in this war. Its parliament on December 25 posted a draft lawlowering the conscription agefrom 27 to 25. Zelenskyy had said in a recent press conference that the military wishes to raise 450,000-500,000 personnel next year to replenish losses, increase combat capacity and introduce rotation of front-line personnel. Russia wants to capture Avdiivka on the eastern front this year “at a minimum”, said Ukrainian Brigadier-General Oleksandr Tarnavskyi, who commands the Tavria group of forces, encompassing Avdiivka, Mariivka and Robotyne, in an interview with BBC Ukraine. “The enemy uses its strengths – manpower, minefields, prepared positions, as well as the readiness to mercilessly throw its personnel to [their] death,” he said. “I think that the next year will be, perhaps, even more difficult.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/29/ukraine-drives-russia-back-at-sea-and-in-the-air-but-concedes-land
Russian poets given long jail terms for reciting verses against Ukraine war,"Artyom Kamardin, 33, and Yegor Shtovba, 23, sentenced for ‘undermining national security’, ‘inciting hatred’.","A court in Moscow has sentenced two Russian men to several years in prison for reciting poetry against the war in Ukraine during an anti-mobilisation protest last year as the Kremlin presses on with its crackdown on dissent. Artyom Kamardin, 33, was sentenced to seven years in jail on Thursday after being convicted of making calls “undermining national security” and “inciting hatred”. The charges were linked to him reading his anti-war poems at the rally in Moscow in September 2022. The Tverskoy District Court also sentenced Yegor Shtovba, 23, to a five and a half year term on the same charges, after he participated in the event and recited Kamardin’s verses. The demonstration last year was held days after President Vladimir Putin ordered themobilisation of 300,000 reservistsamid Russia’s military setbacks in Ukraine. The widely unpopular move prompted hundreds of thousands to flee the country to avoid being recruited into the military. Kamardin read out his poem, “Kill me, militia man!”,  ending with the line, “Glory toKievan Rus, Novorossiya – suck!” – using the historic terms for Ukraine’s capital Kyiv and a term from days of the Russian Empire that Moscow uses for the area of southeastern Ukraine it is trying to annex, respectively. Days later, police stormed into the apartment Kamardin shared with his then-girlfriend, Alexandra Popova, and another activist. According to Amnesty International, Popova said police beat andviolated Kamardin with a dumbbellbefore forcing Popova to watch a video of the act. She also claimed that police super-glued stickers to her face and threatened to rape her. A clip later circulated on Telegram of the bruised and battered Kamardin apologising for his words. Authorities in Russia have detainedthousands of peopleunder wartime censorship laws for their simple acts of protest against theoffensive in Ukraine. Just before his sentencing, a smiling Kamardin recited a poem that refers to poetry as “gut-wrenching” and often disliked by “people accustomed to order”. Popova, now his wife, was escorted out of the courtroom by bailiffs after she shouted “Shame!” following the verdict. “It is a very harsh sentence. Seven years for poems, for a non-violent crime,” she told the AFP news agency, before being taken away by police officers. According to OVD-Info, a prominent rights group that monitors political arrests and provides legal aid, 19,834 Russians have been arrested between February 24, 2022, when Russia began its invasion, and late October 2023, for speaking out or demonstrating against the war.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/29/russian-poets-given-long-jail-terms-for-reciting-verses-against-ukraine-war
‘Almost naked’ celebrity party triggers backlash in wartime Russia,Rapper jailed and other partygoers under investigation amid conservative outrage over party at Moscow’s Mutabor nightclub.,"A rapper who partied at a Moscow nightclub wearing nothing but a strategically-placed sock has been jailed for 15 days, and several other Russian stars have issued public apologies after a celebrity party with the dress code “almost naked” triggered a storm of criticism and a slew of investigations. The crackdown came after pictures from the party, which took place on the night of December 20 and was organised by TV presenter and actress Anastasia Ivleeva, began circulating on social media. Amid the scantily-clad celebrities at the Mutabor nightclub was Vacio, the rapper, while Ivleeva was pictured flaunting an emerald-studded chain around her backside worth 23 million roubles ($251,000) at a time when some Russians are struggling to get by. Conservative legislators, bloggers and others were fiercely critical, contending the images were unseemly, even unpatriotic, for the country, which launched a full-scale invasion of neighbouring Ukraine in February 2022. The issue has dominated the headlines for days, pushing out stories about rising egg prices and other concerns. Maria Zakharova, a spokesperson for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that the event had “stained” those who took part, but that they now had a chance to work on themselves, the Ura.ru news outlet reported. Vacio, whose legal name is Nikolai Vasilyev, was jailed by a Moscow court for 15 days and fined 200,000 roubles ($2,182) under the LGBTQ “propaganda” law, which was toughened last year and bans positive information on lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender people. Ivleeva issued two public apology videos following the event, including one on Wednesday, where she said she regretted her actions and deserved everything she got but hoped she could be given “a second chance”. Her name has since disappeared as one of the public faces of major Russian mobile phone operator MTS, the tax authorities have opened an investigation that carries a potential five-year jail term, and a Moscow court has accepted a lawsuit from a group of more than 20 people demanding she pay out one billion roubles ($10.9m) for “moral suffering”. If successful, they want the money to go to a state fund that supports Russian veterans from the war in Ukraine. Russia’s flamboyant pop king Filipp Kirkorov also asked for forgiveness after footage circulated of him wearing a sparkling lace outfit with futuristic sunglasses. “In today’s difficult and heroic times, an artist of my calibre … cannot and should not be so irresponsible when participating in various events,” he said. Other partygoers have also recorded apologies, including journalist Ksenia Sobchak whose late father Anatoly was once a friend and boss of President Vladimir Putin. “To hold such events at a time when our guys are dying in the [Ukrainian] special military operation and many children are losing their fathers is cynical,” said Yekaterina Mizulina, director of Russia’s League for a Safe Internet, a body founded with the authorities’ support. Russia calls its invasion a “special military operation“. “Our soldiers on the front line are definitely not fighting for this.” The scandal comes when Putin, who is expected to comfortably win another six-year term in elections in March, has doubled down on social conservatism, repeatedly condemning Western countries for supposedly undermining “traditional values“. In November, Russia’s Supreme Court ruled that the “LGBT movement” should be designated as “extremists.” Standing outside the Bolshoi Theatre on Thursday, Nadezhda, one Moscow resident, told the Reuters news agency she was outraged and thought those who went to the party should be punished. “If you’re partying, at least don’t film it,” she said. “At such a difficult time [for Russia], they should at least be ashamed. Aren’t they ashamed before those who are fighting for us?”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/29/almost-naked-celebrity-party-triggers-backlash-in-wartime-russia

Ukraine welcomes latest US aid package as war nears two year mark,"The package, valued at $250m, will include air defence system components and artillery rounds.","Ukraine has welcomed the latest arms package from the United States to aid its fight against Russia as the war approaches the two-year mark. The package, valued at $250m and announced on Wednesday night, will include air defence system components, ammunition for HIMARS, 155mm and 105mm artillery rounds, stinger antiaircraft missiles, and medical equipment. “We are grateful to the American government and people for their unwavering support. Ukrainian people appreciate your leadership,” the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence said on X on Thursday.

But Republicans are refusing to approve the package without an agreement by the Democrats to tighten security around the US-Mexico border. The White House has warned that without the additional appropriation, US aid forUkraine’s fightagainst Russia will run out by the end of the year. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Thursday the West’s strategic defeat on Moscow had “completely failed”. Lavrov told Russian state media that the Group of Seven countries intend to discuss the “peace formula” proposed by Zelenskyy, which they agreed on at a “secret summit” held about 10 days ago. Meanwhile, a bulk carrier headed to a River Danube port to load grain hit a Russian mine in the Black Sea on Wednesday, injuring two crew members, Ukrainian officials said on Thursday. “A Panama-flagged civilian vessel was blown up on an enemy sea mine in the Black Sea … The vessel lost its course and control and a fire broke out on the upper deck,” Ukraine’s southern military command said on Telegram. A captain, sailor and an Egyptian citizen were injured, with the latter taken to hospital in the city of Izmail, the head of the Odesa regional prosecutors office said. Moscow has ramped up its attack in the Black Sea since leaving the United Nations-brokeredgrain dealin mid-July, which allowed for the safe passage of Ukrainian grain shipments. Ukraine has pushed back Russian warships in the western part of the Black Sea to allow some cargo ships in and out along a maritime corridor.

Russia accuses US of threatening global energy security,Moscow slams Washington’s sanctions on a new LNG plant in the Arctic as ‘unacceptable’.,"Russia has claimed that US sanctions levied against the Arctic LNG 2 project undermine global energy security. The Russian foreign ministry’s spokeswoman hit out on Wednesday at Washington’s “unacceptable” move to clamp down on the massive Arctic LNG 2. The sanctions are just the latest measure implemented as the West seeks to limit Moscow’s financial ability to wage war in Ukraine. The remarks came after Washington announced sanctions against the new liquefied natural gas plant that is under development on the Gydan Peninsula in the Arctic last month. “We consider such actions unacceptable, especially in relation to such large international commercial projects as Arctic LNG 2, which affect the energy balance of many states,” said foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova. “The situation around Arctic LNG 2 once again confirms the destructive role for global economic security played by Washington, which speaks of the need to maintain this security but in fact, by pursuing its own selfish interests, tries to oust competitors and destroy global energy security.” Russia is the fourth-largest producer of sea-borne LNG behind the United States, Qatar and Australia. The Arctic LNG 2 project is a key element in Russia’s efforts to boost its share of the global market to a fifth by 2030-2035 from 8 percent now. However, the sanctions saw partners from China, Japan and France who hold a combined 40 percent of the project suspend participation last week. Project developer Novatek was also forced to declare force majeure over LNG supplies from the project, which was slated to start production in early 2024. Western countries, seeking to cripple Moscow’s military might, have imposed wide-ranging sanctions against Russian firms and individuals following the Kremlin’s decision to send tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February last year. However, Russia insists that Europe has been hit harder by the sanctions due to raised energy prices, while it has been successful in swiftly finding new markets in Asia. Almost all of Russia’s oil exports this year have been shipped to China and India, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said on Wednesday. Russia hopes that the income from Asian energy customers can continue to help drive its invasion, as it eyes Ukraine’sstruggleto access funds and weapons from Western partners. On Wednesday, Ukrainian authorities said two people were killed after Russian forces sent a wave of attack drones against the country in an overnight raid. The Ukrainian air force said that 32 of 46 Iranian-made drones deployed by Russia had been shot down. The air force said the military had destroyed drones over parts of central, southern and western Ukraine. Most of those that got through defences struck near the front line, mainly in the southern Kherson region. Oleh Kiper, the governor of Ukraine’s Odesa region, said that a 35-year-old man was killed by debris from a downed drone in a residential area. Another man died in the hospital from his injuries. Four others, including a 17-year-old boy, were injured, according to Kiper. More than 10,000 civilians have been killed in Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion, with about half of recent deaths occurring far behind the front lines, according to the UN Human Rights Office.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/27/russia-says-us-threatens-global-energy-security-with-arctic-lng-2-sanctions

Ukraine says at least one killed in Russian attack on Kherson rail station,Ukrainian authorities say Russian shelling of a train station kills a police officer and injures four others.,"Ukrainian officials say at least one person has been killed and four others injured in a Russian attack on a rail station in the southern city of Kherson, as Russia’s invasion continues to take aheavy tollon Ukrainian civilians. Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenk said the Russian shelling struck the rail station on Tuesday as about 140 people there were preparing for an evacuation, killing a policeman. “Thanks to the clear actions of the police, everyone was successfully taken to safe places,” Klymenko said on Telegram. “Unfortunately, a police lieutenant from the Kirovohrad region lost his life due to the shelling … Two more police officers are in the hospital with shrapnel wounds.”    The city was captured by Russian forces after they first invaded Ukraine in February 2022, but were pushed out of the city by aUkrainian counteroffensivein November of the same year. But Russian forces have continued to bombard the city. Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyreported the shelling attack earlier on Tuesday, and two civilians are being treated at a hospital for shrapnel wounds alongside the two wounded police officers. The Ukrainian railway company Ukrzaliznytsya said in a message on Telegram that a train and the station were damaged but that “the situation is under control and the railway is ready to continue functioning.” Roman Mrochko, the head of the Kherson military administration, had said earlier on Tuesday that the city has been targeted for the last day by persistent Russian attacks.    The war in Ukraine has continued to kill and injure many civilians, and the conflict has shown few signs of abating soon. Ukrainian fighters struck aRussian shipin the Black Sea on Tuesday, boosting the morale of Ukrainian forces that have faced difficult questions after a much-anticipatedcounteroffensivefailed to win back substantial territory from Russia over the summer. “This latest destruction of Putin’s navy demonstrates that those who believe there’s a stalemate in the Ukraine war are wrong!” UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps wrote in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/26/ukraine-says-at-least-one-killed-in-russian-attack-on-kherson-rail-station
"Ukraine’s allies fall short of Russia’s on arms help, raising 2024 risks","Europe is supplying Ukraine only a fraction of the shells it needs, while North Korea has stepped up for Russia. That, say analysts, raises challenges for Kyiv next year.","In March of this year, Ukraine asked its European allies for a quarter of a million shells a month. Its full battle plan, then-Defence minister Oleksiy Reznikov said, required at least 350,000. Ukraine was then rationing itself to just 110,000 a month and needed Europe to help make up the difference. The European Union pledged a million shells within a year – a third of what Ukraine had requested. By the end of November, it haddelivered300,000 from the stockpiles of European armies. It has four months to make up the difference, but further deliveries have to come from new production, said Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign policy chief. Astonishingly, after almost two years of war on European soil, the EU has not taken stock of continental production capacity. “We would like to know today where we are and what can be the rhythm of production for this second track,” said Borrell on November 14 at a gathering of EU defence ministers. Russia, too, has been firing more shells than it can produce, and in September reached out for help to North Korea. Within a month, North Korea haddelivered 1,000 containersworth of ammunition, said White House spokesperson John Kirby. Estonian military intelligence chief Col AntsKiviselgsaid that translated into 300,000-350,000 shells — the same amount as that delivered by the EU to Ukraine, but in one month instead of eight. A Washington Post analysis of satellite photography suggested the number was higher because ships had been plying the route between the North Korean free trade zone port of Rason to Russia’s port of Dunai since August. Russia may have received additional North Korean shells via rail. The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) said satellite imagery showing that rail traffic between North Korea and Russia had “dramatically” increased since Russian President Vladimir Putin met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in September. “To the West’s great surprise, Russia proved more adept at securing what it wanted from the outside, including from China,” Yiorgos Margaritis, professor emeritus of history at the Aristotelian University of Thessaloniki, who has been monitoring the balance of artillery, told Al Jazeera. “The quantity of shells North Korea promised – 10 million – is monstrous. And they’ve already provided a 10th of that.” “[Russia] is well supplied, it does not care for the amount of losses, and it has third-party support which is not in doubt. All of these three elements are not the same on the Ukrainian side,” Jens Bastian, a fellow with the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, told Al Jazeera. The EU has been left fumbling for an answer. Borrell has suggested its defence industry default on contracts to overseas clients, who are currently buying 40 percent of its production. The US response was quicker and more dynamic. In February it decided to increase artillery shell production sixfold – a level not seen since the Korean War – to replenish stocks sent to Ukraine, supply Ukraine with more, and build up stocks for future conflicts. According to a New York Times report, the US Army was buying 14,400 shells a month in September 2022, when it tripled that, and in January 2023 doubled it again, to 90,000. But it will still take US defence contractors until the end of next year to reach that production capacity. What is the matter with Europe? The EU says it will match the US’s orderbook of a roughly million rounds of artillery ammunition, including missiles, per year by spring. “I am responsible for the production capacity of ammunition, so I can confirm that the goal of producing more than a million ammunition rounds annually … can be achieved,” EU internal market commissioner Thierry Breton was reported to have said at an EU defence ministers’ meeting on November 14. For that to happen, governments must place orders, he said. “It is the member states who must place the order for this ammunition, who must produce it, and who must ensure that it is produced primarily for Ukraine. All this is in the hands of the member countries,” said Breton. Yet, by December 6, EU members had placed orders for only 60,000 of the one million shells they promised Ukraine, Reuters news agency reported. Orders take a long time to fulfil, making it doubtful that the EU will come through by March on even the limited ones that have been placed. For example, German steel and weapons manufacturer Rheinmetall said on December 3 it had received a 142-million-euro ($156mn) order for shells intended for Ukraine, but these would be delivered in 2025. The EU’s lamentable state of coordination on defence has many reasons, say experts. Unlike areas such as banking, the green energy transition and transport, where EU member states have closely coordinated policies led by Brussels, defence and foreign policy remain national competencies. “We do not have an integrated European defence industry and also an integrated European defence policy, and Ukraine has highlighted that for two years,” said Bastian. “Mr Borrell is making clear that the failure at the EU level is also a failure of individual countries who do not have … the capacity to produce at scale within a defined period of time,” he said. Lack of coordination in foreign policy is just as challenging. “We don’t have one defined, shared threat perception, and therefore the countries have different priorities,” said Minna Alander, a research fellow at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. “Not everyone shares the view that Russia is an existential threat to Europe,” she told Al Jazeera. Europe’s divestment from heavy industry, including metals production, which reached a climax during the COVID-19 pandemic, contributed to a slim supply of raw materials for weapons. “If you want to build a bridge, 80 percent of your steel is going to come from China, India and one or two other countries in the east. The same applies for weapons production,” said Margaritis. “If you want to increase steel production, you need to make enormous changes,” he said, including the provision of cheap energy and plentiful labour. If Europe does not maintain at least some self-sufficiency in heavy industry, it risks its own security, say experts. “Europe needs an epochal shift in political thinking, coupled with significantly higher defence spending and a determined effort to reset public perceptions of the need for strong defence,” Bastian Giegerich, director-general of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a London-based think tank, and Tim Lawrenson, a defence industry consultant, recently wrote. “None of these requirements currently looks assured. Unless they are met, however, NATO’s vaunted deterrent may falter. Russia may no longer perceive Europe as having credible defences and become tempted to attack a NATO member.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/26/ukraines-allies-fall-short-of-russias-on-arms-help-raising-2024-risks
Russia confirms Ukraine destroyed its warship in Crimea attack,"One person reported killed in attack that targeted the Novocherkassk, which Ukraine said was being used to transport Russian drones.","Russia has acknowledged a Ukrainian attack has damaged a warship in the occupied Crimean port of Feodosia in what Ukraine and its Western allies called a major setback for the Russian navy. Ukraine’s air force said earlier that it had “destroyed” the Novocherkassk landing ship, with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy joking on social media that the vessel had now joined “the Russian underwater Black Sea fleet”. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu informed President Vladimir Putin “about the damage to our large landing ship” in what a “very detailed report”, the president’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists. The Novocherkassk is a large landing ship that can be used for transporting soldiers as well as tanks and armoured vehicles, and Ukraine said it attacked the vessel at a base in the southern coast ofRussian-occupied Crimea.Kyiv said it suspected the ship was transportingIranian-made explosive dronesthat Russia has used regularly to attack Ukraine since it began itsfull scale invasionin February 2022. One person was killed and four were injured in the attack, the Moscow-installed governor of Crimea, Sergey Aksyonov, said, adding that six buildings had been damaged and their residents evacuated. Aksyonov said the strike triggered a fire that had been brought under control. Russia annexedCrimea from Ukrainein 2014 in a move Ukraine and the West condemned as illegal, and has not been internationally recognised. Feodosia, which has a population of about 69,000 people.    Ukrainian officials celebrated the attack, which comes amid fierce fighting on the front line in the country’s east. Ukrainian commander Mykola Oleshchuk shared a video of an explosion at the Feodosia naval base and wrote: “The fleet in Russia is getting smaller and smaller! Thanks to the Air Force pilots and everyone involved for the filigree work!” On Telegram,Zelenskyywrote: “I am grateful to our Air Force for the impressive replenishment of the Russian underwater Black Sea fleet with another vessel. The occupiers will not have a single peaceful place in Ukraine.” The Black Sea, which Ukraine needs to export its grain, has been a key battleground in the continuing war. Russia’s Black Sea Fleet is based in the port of Sevastopol and Moscow has used the fleet to fire missiles at Ukrainian cities and to blockade Ukraine’s coastline. Ukraine has stepped up attacks on Crimea, helping it win back limited control of the Black Sea and, at times, push Russian warships further east. Yuriy Ihnat, Ukrainian Air Force spokesperson, said he thought it would be hard for the Novocherkassk to re-enter service. “We can see how powerful the explosion was, what the detonation was like. After that, it’s very hard for a ship to survive, because this was not a rocket, this is the detonation of munitions,” he told Radio Free Europe. Ukraine and Russia have often exaggerated the losses they claim to have inflicted on the other since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. In recent days, Moscow has claimed to have taken control of the eastern city ofMaryinka, which Kyiv has denied. Ukraine and Russia have also each claimed success in shooting down the other’s fighter planes, with each side denying any losses. In April 2022, Ukrainesank cruiser Moskva, the Soviet-era flagship of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet. Moscow said “a detonation of ammunition” triggered a fire and forced the crew to evacuate, and the ship sank as it was being towed to port. Sergei Markov, a former Kremlin adviser, said on Telegram it was obvious that Russia would not release detailed information about the attack at a time of war, but that it needed to do more to protect its assets in Crimea. “It’s clear that Crimea’s air defence systems must be strengthened. And it is clear that it [Ukraine] needs to be deprived of the opportunity to hit Russia,” Markov said.

Ukraine proposes lowering age for military conscription from 27 to 25,Draft bill proposed as military looks for hundreds of thousands of new recruits in its fight to eject Russia.,"Ukraine has proposed reducing the age of those who can be mobilised into the armed forces from 27 to 25 after the military said it needed as many as 500,000 more soldiers in its now 22-month-long war against Russia. The age reduction was in the text of a draft law posted on the website of Ukraine’s parliament late on Monday. The text detailed which Ukrainian citizens would be subject to enrolment for militaryregistration of conscriptsand said it would apply to those “who have reached the age of 25”. An explanatory note signed by Defence Minister Rustem Umerov summarised key provisions of the draft law, saying they included the “change of conscription age from 27 to 25 years”. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy revealed earlier this month that the military had proposed mobilising between 450,000 and 500,000 more Ukrainians but that it was a “highly sensitive” issue that the military and government would discuss before deciding whether to send the proposal to parliament. Zelenskyy, who has yet to back the proposal publicly, said on December 19 that he wanted to hear more arguments for mobilising additional people. “This is a very serious number,” he said. Ukraine’s troop numbers are not known but in the past, it has been said the country has about 1 million people under arms. US officials estimate that hundreds of thousands have been killed and wounded since Russia began itsfull-scale invasionof Ukraine in February 2022. Neither Ukraine nor Russia publishes its casualty figures. David Arakhamia, the head of Zelenskyy’s party in parliament, said the government was working on the bill at the request of the military and that it was due to be introduced on Monday. “The military needs a solution to its problems,” he said in a post on the Telegram messaging app. “Society wants to hear answers to all sensitive questions.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/26/ukraine-proposes-lowering-age-for-military-conscription-from-27-to-25

Ukraine officially celebrates Christmas on December 25 for the first time,The change reflects Ukrainians’ dismay at the 22-month-old Russian invasion and their assertion of a national identity.,"Ukrainians have celebrated Christmas on December 25 for the first time, as part of an ongoing effort to remove Russian influence from their country. The change was enacted in a law signed by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in July, reflecting both the Ukrainians’ dismay with the 22-month-old Russian invasion and their assertion of anational identity. Ukraine previously marked Christmas in January as the Russians do. “It’s historical justice,” said Yevhen Konyk, a 44-year-old serviceman who, along with his family, participated in traditional celebrations at an open-air museum in Kyiv. “We need to move forward not only with the world but also with the traditions of our country and overcome the imperial remnants we had.”    Ukraine is largely Orthodox Christian but the faith is divided between two churches, one of which has a long affiliation with the Russian Orthodox Church. TheOrthodox Churchof Ukraine, which does not recognise the authority of the Russian church and had been regarded as schismatic, was granted full recognition in 2019 by the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, Orthodoxy’s top authority. The Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which had been a branch of the Russian church, announced in 2022 after the start of the Russia-Ukraine war that it wasbreaking tieswith Moscow and becoming autonomous. Its parishes, however, continue to follow the same liturgical calendar as the Russian church and will observe Christmas on January 7.  Many Ukrainians embraced the move to celebrate Christmas on the date aligned with the rest of Western Europe with enthusiasm. Oksana Poviakel, the director of the Pyrohiv Museum of Folk Architecture and Life of Ukraine, where Christmas celebrations took place, said celebrating on December 25 is “another important factor of self-identification”. “We are separating ourselves from the neighbour who is currently trying to destroy our state, who is killing our people, destroying our homes, and burning our land,” she said. Asia Landarenko, 63, said she prays every day for her son who is in the military. “The state of war affects everything, including the mood. The real celebration of Christmas will be after the victory, but as the saviour was born, so will be our victory,” she said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/25/ukraine-officially-celebrates-christmas-on-december-25-for-the-first-time
Russia says it seizes Ukrainian town of Maryinka; Kyiv denies the claim,Putin hails Moscow’s biggest military success since the capture of Bakhmut in May.,"Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu says Russian troops have gained full control of the eastern Ukrainian town of Maryinka, registering their first major success since the capture of the strategic city ofBakhmutin May. Shoigu told President Vladimir Putin on Monday about the capture of what has now become a ghost town just southwest of the Russian-held regional capital of Donetsk during a video exchange shared by a Kremlin journalist. “I want to congratulate you. This is a success,” Putin is seen telling Shoigu in the video, saying it gives Russian troops “the opportunity to move into a wider operational area”. Piles of rubble and gutted apartment buildings could be seen in drone images shown on Russian television that were said to be of Maryinka, which was once home to 10,000 people. Putin had offered to award soldiers who had distinguished themselves in the battle for Maryinka, The Moscow Times reported.    The Ukrainian military denied Russia’s claims of Maryinka’s capture, which came at a difficult time for Kyiv. It has been struggling to make gains in recent months, and waning Western support, particularly critical US funding, threatens its fight against Russia. “It’s not correct to talk about seizing Maryinka,” Ukrainian military spokesperson Oleksandr Shtupun told Ukrainian national television. “Our forces are within the city,” he said. Russia’s last major success, the capture of Bakhmut, spurredUkraine to launch a counteroffensivein June. But Kyiv’s forces have made little progress against what is nowentrenched Russian resistancein the 22-month-old conflict. Russian troops have been intensifying ground and air attacks on the nearby town of Avdiivka since mid-October as they focus on expanding their slow-moving push through eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s air force on Monday reported that it had shot down two Russian fighter jets during the night along with two cruise missiles and 28 Shahed-type kamikaze drones. The report said the attacks were aimed at southern and central regions of Ukraine but that no casualties were immediately known. It said 31 drones were launched in all, but details of what the three that weren’t intercepted may have struck weren’t given.

Ukraine secures desperately needed funds from World Bank,"With US and EU funding delayed, Kyiv said the money would stabilise its economy as it continues to repel Russian attacks.","Ukraine has received a vital $1.34bn in funds from the World Bank. The funding has been paid out to support non-security related financial and economic stability, Ukraine’s Ministry of Finance said on Monday. The cash boost will be welcomed by Kyiv, which warns that its ability to defend against the Russian invasion could soon be impacted by delays in funding from the United States and the European Union. In astatement, the ministry noted that the financing, which is the Sixth Additional Financing under its Public Expenditures for Administrative Capacity Endurance in Ukraine (PEACE) project, consisted of a $1.086bn loan from the World Bank, a $190m grant from Norway, a $50m grant from the United States and a $20m grant from Switzerland. The funds are expected to be used to partially compensate for non-security and defence-related expenditures of the Ukrainian state budget, including old-age social payments and payments to employees of the state emergency service, the ministry added. “International financial assistance is a significant contribution to maintaining Ukraine’s financial and economic stability and allows us to provide priority social expenditures during the war,” said Ukrainian Finance Minister Serhiy Marchenko. “Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, the governments of Japan, the United States, Norway and Switzerland have repeatedly demonstrated their unwavering support and solidarity for Ukraine. I am grateful to our partners for their willingness to cooperate and help us at a crucial time for Ukraine.” It has been nearly two years since Russia invaded Ukraine, and as the war continues to rage uncertainty is growing overWestern backing for Ukraine. Earlier this month, the White House warned the United States Congress that funds designated for providing aid to Ukraine would run out by the end of the year, amid Russia’s intensifying campaign to knock out the country’s energy infrastructure. The US, Ukraine’s biggest single-country donor, has sent more than $40bn in aid since Russia’s invasion in February 2022. But right-wing congressional Republicans have expressed increasing scepticism towards approving more funds for Ukraine. The United States Senate has said they will vote on anaid packagefor Ukraine in 2024. But Congress could continue to hold up the money. The impasse over US aid to Kyiv is mirrored in the European Union, where Hungary isblockinga 50 billion euro ($55bn) aid package. The bloc is due to revisit the issue in January. The difficulties in securing the funds in Washington and Brussels have raised concerns in Kyiv that Western backers are experiencing “fatigue” with the drawn-out battle, as fighting on the front line becomesbogged down. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has noted that Kyiv’s “foreign policy will be active” with many international activities in January. “We make every effort to strengthen Ukraine and ensure that everyone is confident about the coming year, about military aid, macro-financial assistance, and political support,” he said. We continue to work with partners in order to maintain unity in support for Ukraine. With those in Europe, America, and around the world who support us, our state, and international law.Our foreign policy will be active in the coming weeks, and we are already planning…pic.twitter.com/YmNta6e5gV — Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa)December 15, 2023  Russian attacks against Ukraine continued over Christmas. On Monday, the Ukrainian military said that Russia launched 31 drones and two missiles from the annexed Crimean Peninsula overnight. The military said the attack mostly targeted the south of Ukraine. Kyiv’s air defences “destroyed 28 Shahed attack drones in Odesa, Kherson, Mykolaiv, Donetsk, Kirovohrad and Khmelnytskyi regions” and also destroyed the missiles, it said.

"Ukraine, Russia say six civilians killed in attacks on Kherson, Horlivka","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says in Christmas Eve address that ‘day by day, the darkness is losing’.","Russian attacks on Ukraine’s southern Kherson region have killed five people, according to Ukrainian officials, while Russian-installed authorities reported one person killed in Ukrainian shelling of the Russian-occupied eastern town of Horlivka. Ukrainian officials said the deaths in the attacks on Sunday include an 87-year-old man and his 81-year-old wife who were killed when their Kherson City apartment building was shelled. Oleksandr Tolokonnikov, the head of the press office of Kherson’s regional military administration, said nine other people, including a 15-year-old, were wounded and gas and water supplies were partially cut off in the attacks. “There are no holidays for the enemy,” Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian president’s office, said in a post on social media. “They do not exist for us as long as the enemy kills our people and remains on our land.” Russian forces have carried out repeated shelling of the city of Kherson since abandoning the administrative centre of the region more than a year ago. The latest assault came as Ukraine prepared to markChristmas on December 25for the first time, after President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed a law moving the celebration from the January 7 date observed by the Russian Orthodox Church.

In Russian-controlled Horlivka, about 600km (400 miles) northeast of Kherson, Ukrainian shelling killed one woman and wounded six others, the Russian-installed mayor Ivan Prikhodko said on the Telegram messaging app. The attacks also destroyed a shopping centre and several other buildings, Prikhodko said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/25/ukraine-russia-say-six-civilians-killed-in-attacks-on-kherson-horlivka
Ukraine picks new Christmas date in break with Russian tradition,"For the first time in a century, Ukraine will celebrate the holiday on December 25 rather than January 7.","Ukraine will formally mark Christmas Day on December 25 this year, in a symbolic shift away from Russia, which celebrates the holiday on January 7. It will be the first time in more than a century that Ukraine observes the date in line with the Gregorian calendar, along with most of the world’s Christians. Ukraine’s government passed legislation in July making the date change, in what was viewed as a snub to Russia and the Russian Orthodox Church, which follows the Roman-era Julian calendar for religious occasions. The law signed by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy noted that Ukrainians wanted to “live their own life with their own traditions and holidays”. It allows them to “abandon the Russian heritage of imposing Christmas celebrations on January 7”, it added. Christianity is the largest religion in Ukraine, with the Russian Orthodox Church historically dominating religious life. Ukraine’s date change is part of a series of moves since Russia’s invasion to dispel any traces of the Russian and Soviet empires, such as renaming streets and removing monuments. The Orthodox Church of Ukraine, a newly created independent church that held its first service in 2019, has also changed its Christmas date to December 25. It formally broke away from the Russian Orthodox Church over Moscow’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its support for separatists in eastern Ukraine. The political rift has seen priests and even entire parishes swap from one church to another, with the new Orthodox Church of Ukraine growing fast and taking over several Russia-linked church buildings in moves supported by the government. The historically Russia-linked Ukrainian Orthodox Church, meanwhile, is keeping the January 7 Christmas date. This church claims to have cut ties with Russia because of the war but many Ukrainians view this with scepticism. The country’s third Orthodox denomination, the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, will also hold Christmas services on December 25. Ukraine had been under Moscow’s spiritual leadership since the 17th century at the latest. Under the Soviet Union and its profession of atheism, Christmas traditions such as trees and gifts were shifted to New Year’s Eve, which became the main holiday and still is for many families. Ukrainian Christmas traditions include a dinner on Christmas Eve with 12 meatless dishes, including a sweet grain pudding called kutya, and people decorate homes with elaborate sheaves of wheat called didukhy. In some areas, children go from house to house singing carols called kolyadky and performing nativity scenes.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/24/ukraine-picks-new-christmas-date-in-break-with-russian-tradition
"Russia blasts US on frozen assets, missiles as Ukraine bombardment persists",Moscow warns of retaliation as war in Ukraine causes relations with the West to deteriorate.,"Russia has warned that it will react robustly to Western moves to seize its assets or deploy missiles. Moscow could sever diplomatic relations with the United States should it confiscate Russian assets frozen under sanctions, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said on Friday. Officials also said the Kremlin would respond to the deployment of missiles in Europe or Asia, even as Ukraine reported that Russia had unleashed another barrage of attack drones overnight. Ryabkov threatened that Moscow could cut diplomatic ties with Washington should it hand frozen Russian assets to Kyiv, which isdesperate for funds, according to the Russian state news agency Interfax. Western countries are discussing the confiscation of more than $1bn in Russian assets frozen due to sanctions over the war in Ukraine. The US “must not act under an illusion … that Russia is clinging with both hands to diplomatic relations with that country”, the official said. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov later said at a media briefing that countries who seize Russian assets would never be left in peace and Russia would look at what Western assets it could seize in retaliation. Some officials in US political circles have suggested that $300bn of funds from Russian Central Bank reserves frozen in February 2022 to put pressure on Moscow to withdraw from Ukraine be handed to Kyiv. Peskov said any such seizure would deal a serious blow to the international financial system and Russia would defend its rights in the courts and through other means. On Thursday, Russia promised to respond in kind should the European Union go ahead with a plan to ring-fence profits generated from frozen assets and hand them to Ukraine. Prosecutors in Germany said this week that they were applying to confiscate more than 720 million euros ($790m) from the Frankfurt bank account of a Russian financial institution. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called German leaders “a thieving lot” that have been taking lessons from Washington. “They used to be thieving in the political sense – breaking agreements, cheating someone – but now they are thieving in the direct sense,” he said. President Vladimir Putin this week ordered two European concerns, Wintershall Dea and OMV, be stripped of multibillion-dollar stakes in gas projects in the Russian Arctic. The West is seeking to tighten its sanctions against Russia as it continues to pummel Ukraine. US President Joe Biden will sign an executive order allowing Washington to impose sanctions on financial institutions that help Russia evade sanctions, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Friday. The measure will also allow Washington to ban products originating in Russia but processed in third countries, such as seafood and diamonds, Yellen said in a statement. “Today we are taking steps to level new and powerful tools against Russia’s war machine,” Yellen said. “And we will not hesitate to use the new tools provided by this authority to take decisive and surgical action against financial institutions that facilitate the supply of Russia’s war machine.” Russia’s concerns extend beyond the business and financial sectors. Ryabkov also threatened that Russia is ready to swiftly respond in kind to any deployment by the US of short- and medium-range missiles in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. Moscow is closely tracking Washington’s missile development and potential deployments and was ready to swiftly take the necessary political decisions to respond in kind, he stated. The official also lashed out at the US over problems regarding efforts to organise a prisoner swap, accusing Washington of leaking details of the “sensitive negotiations”. The US said this month that Russia had rejected proposals for the release of former US marine Paul Whelan and Wall Street Journal reporterEvan Gershkovich. Russian forces continued large-scale attacks against infrastructure and civilian sites in Ukraine overnight into Friday. Kyiv’s air force said on social media that it had shot down 24 of 28 Shahed attack drones launched from Russia. It was the sixth such attack on the Ukrainian capital so far in December and part of a larger drone swarm that also targeted other parts of central, southern and western Ukraine, the air force said. Air raid sirens were heard in Kyiv late on Thursday, and residents heard explosions. City hall initially said air defences were in action and called on people to stay in shelters. Russian missiles and drones have begun to frequently target the Ukrainian capital although they are usually shot down by air defence systems. “A residential building in Kyiv hit by a Shahed,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, wrote on Telegram. That attack affected the city’s Solomianskyi district, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram, reporting “flames on the upper floors” of the building. One man was hospitalised while another person was treated at the scene, he said. Kyiv’s military administration published photos on social media of apartment buildings with windows blown out, saying debris from a downed drone had caused the damage rather than a strike. Klitschko also said debris from another downed drone fell on a house in the Darnytskyi district in eastern Kyiv. In the Holosiivskyi district in the city’s south, a piece of shrapnel from a downed drone fell on a high-rise building without causing any casualties, the military administration said on Telegram.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/22/russia-may-sever-ties-respond-in-kind-over-seizure-of-its-assets

Roman Abramovich loses legal attempt to overturn EU sanctions,The EU imposed punishment on the oligarch in 2022 as part of measures targeting Russia and Putin’s close allies.,"Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich has lost a legal challenge aimed at overturning European Union sanctions imposed on him in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Abramovich had filed a lawsuit at the EU’s general court against the European Union Council, which imposed punitive sanctions on the 57-year-old in 2022 as part of measures targeting Russia and President Vladimir Putin’s close allies after Russia invaded Ukraine. The court in Brussels rejected the challenge and also dismissed his claims for compensation, noting his role in the Russian steel company Evraz and the fact that steel provided a major source of revenue to the Russian government. “The General Court dismisses the action brought by Mr Abramovich, thereby upholding the restrictive measures taken against him,” it said in its ruling on Wednesday. “The [European] Council did not in fact err in its assessment by deciding to include, then maintain, Mr Abramovich’s name on the lists at issue, in the light of his role in the Evraz group and, in particular, its parent company,” it added, referring to the sanctions lists. Abramovich, who also holds Israeli citizenship and is a former owner of Premier League football club Chelsea, became one of the world’s most powerful businessmen after the 1991 break-up of the Soviet Union. Forbes estimates his net worth at $9.2bn. In a statement issued on his behalf, Abramovich said he was disappointed by the ruling, which he can appeal. He said the court had not considered some of the arguments used by the EU Council, including the proposition that Abramovich had benefitted from the Russian government – which he said was a false suggestion. “Mr Abramovich does not have the ability to influence the decision-making of any government, including Russia, and has in no way benefited from the [Ukraine] war,” the statement said. “The court’s decision to maintain the sanctions against Mr Abramovich was based purely on the court defining Mr Abramovich as a ‘Russian businessman’ which under today’s very broad EU regulations is sufficient to remain sanctioned, even if you are just a passive shareholder in a business sector with no connection to the war.” The businessman has also been punished in the United Kingdom and had his assets frozen in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Abramovich wasforced to sell Chelseaafter being sanctioned by the British government for what it called his enabling of Putin’s “brutal and barbaric invasion” of Ukraine. The sale of the Premier League club for 2.5 billion pounds ($3.2bn) — then the highest price ever paid for a sports team — was completed by a consortium fronted by Los Angeles Dodgers part-owner Todd Boehly. It marked the end of the trophy-filled, 19-year tenure of Abramovich. The EU has imposed12 rounds of sanctionson Russia since Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine almost two years ago. The measures have targeted the energy sector, banks, companies and markets, and made more than 1,000 Russian officials subject to asset freezes and travel bans.

US aid debate pushed to 2024 as Ukraine continues to battle Russian drones,"US Senate debate on new aid will run into the new year, despite Kyiv push for urgency.","The United States Senate will not vote on an aid package for Ukraine this year, the chamber leaders have said. Democratic and Republican negotiators continue to seek a compromise on the delayed funding deal to support Kyiv as it defends against Russia’s invasion, a joint statement released on Tuesday said. Ukraine has become increasingly desperate to secure funding from the West in recent weeks, with political delays to both US and European Union aid bolstering Russian confidence amid the bogged-down conflict. Having already handed Ukraine about $100bn in aid since the February 2022 invasion, President Joe Biden has asked the lower house Congress to approve another $60bn. However, Republicans have blocked the move, using the issue to demand new immigration legislation. Meanwhile, work is continuing in the upper house Senate to reach a compromise. “As negotiators work through remaining issues, it is our hope that their efforts will allow the Senate to take swift action … early in the new year,” Democrat Chuck Schumer and Republican Mitch McConnell said in the statement. “Challenging issues remain,” the statement continued, referring to US interests in Ukraine, Israel, the Indo-Pacific and along its southern border with Mexico. “The Senate will not let these national security challenges go unanswered.” For the remainder of the year, negotiators would “continue to work in good faith toward finalising their agreement”, they added. However, it is not clear that any deal reached in the Democratic-majority Senate would win support in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, where a significant number of party hardliners oppose providing additional funding. The war in Ukraine, now in its 22nd month, risks being overshadowed by Israel’s war on Gaza that has been raging since October 7, aided by US financial support. The impasse over US aid to Kyiv is mirrored in the EU, where Hungary isblockinga 50 billion euro ($54bn) aid package. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urged both Washington and Brussels to unlock the funds, warning that Moscow was counting on Western unity to “collapse” and of a “dire need” for weapons. In a press conference on Tuesday he said he believed the US“will not betray”his besieged nation. The Kremlin has celebrated the gridlock, and ramped up pressure on the front lines, where the war has largely become bogged down in trenches. As winter approaches, Russia has continued to focus on destroying infrastructure and attacking cities. Overnight on Tuesday, new air attacks targeted Kyiv and other regions. Air defence systems destroyed 18 out of 19 drones, Ukrainian military officials said on Wednesday. “According to preliminary information, there were no casualties or destruction in the capital,” Serhiy Popko, head of Kyiv’s military administration, said on the Telegram messaging app. Kyiv on Wednesday also reported that it plans to build more than one million drones in 2024, as it seeks to raise its own weapons production to reduce dependence on foreign shipments, which are struggling to meet earlier commitments. The strategy is also seen as a potential boost to the economy. Under the scheme, Ukraine hopes to produce one million FPV (first-person-view) drones, widely in demand on the front line, and more than 11,000 medium and long-range attack drones next year, Ukraine’s minister for strategic industries said. The White House has warned that by the end of the year, US aid to Ukraine will be depleted, but has been unable to push the package past partisan political interests. Zelenskyy faced a sceptical reception from Republicans when he visited Washington last week. Speaking on Tuesday, the Ukrainian president also expressed concerns about how US policies towards Ukraine could change if Republican Donald Trump is elected US president in 2024. “If the policy of the next president, whoever it is, is different towards Ukraine, more cold or more economical, I think these signals will have a very strong impact on the course of the war,” Zelenskyy said. Since Russian tanks first rolled into Ukraine, the Kremlin has bet that Western military support would ebb. Russian President Vladimir Putin is believed to be eagerly watching for signs that later this year Trump could offer his campaign significantly eased conditions. On Wednesday, he again slammed Western support for Kyiv, calling for a “severe” response to foreign agents who aim to destabilise Russia by aiding Ukraine. “The Kyiv regime with direct support of foreign special services has taken the path of terrorist methods, practically state terrorism,” Putin said in a video address. “The attempts by foreign special agents to destabilise the political and social situation in Russia must be severely stopped.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/20/us-wont-approve-ukraine-aid-before-2024-as-russian-air-attacks-continue

Zelenskyy confident US will not ‘betray’ Ukraine,"Ukrainian president suggests his country could mobilise 500,000 more people in order to fight Russian invasion.","Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyhas expressed confidence that the United States and other Western countries will continue to support Ukraine in its battle to repel Russia’s invasion. Speaking during an end-of-year news conference on Tuesday, Zelenskyy said that financial assistance plays a crucial role in the country’s efforts to drive back Russian forces that poured over the border in February 2022. He also suggested that Ukraine could mobilise 500,000 more people in order to fight on. “We are working very hard on this, and I am certain the United States of America will not betray us, and that on which we agreed in the United States will be fulfilled completely,” Zelenskyy said. The address comes as support for Ukraine in Western countries comes under greater pressure, with conservatives in the United Statesexpressing doubtsabout continued assistance and stalling the passage of a substantial aid package. Leaders in the US Senate said on Tuesday that the package was not likely to move forward before the end of the year. Zelenskyy, who haspreviously warnedthat such delays benefit Russian PresidentVladimir Putin, said that a Trump victory in the 2024 US elections could have “a very strong impact on the course of the war” if he pursued a policy towards Ukraine that was “more cold or more economical”. The Ukrainian leader also said that he was sure that the European Union (EU) would move forward with a 50-billion-euro ($55bn) aid package of its own, despiteopposition from Hungary, whose right-wing government has raised objections to further assistance for Ukraine. “I’m confident that we have already achieved all this,” Zelenskyy said. “The question now is one of a certain matter of time.” However, support for Ukraine has become a divisive issue in Western countries after along-awaited counteroffensiveover the summer failed to win back substantial territory and the war grinds on. TheRussian invasion, which has been accused of including war crimes, has devastated Ukrainian cities, displaced millions of people, and killed at least 10,000 civilians, according to the United Nations. Zelenskyy said that he is weighing the possibility of mobilising an additional 500,000 troops, adding that he had asked the military for more details on this “very sensitive matter”. Speaking on Tuesday, Putin said that Russia was open to negotiations with Ukraine, the US, and Europe but added that Russia “will not give up what is ours”. “The West isn’t abandoning its strategy of containment of Russia and its aggressive goals in Ukraine,” Putin said. “Well, we also aren’t going to abandon the goals of the special military operation.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/19/zelenskyy-confident-us-will-not-betray-ukraine
Russia boosts nuclear forces amid ‘hybrid war’ with the West: Putin,President says Moscow’s strategic forces remain at the highest level of readiness as he meets top defence officials.,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that Moscow is upgrading its nuclear arsenal and keeping its strategic forces at the highest level of readiness as the West wages a “hybrid war” against it. Moscow would continue what it calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine, and all attempts to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia had crumbled, Putin told a conference of senior defence officials on Tuesday. The Russian leader also accused the United States of exploiting Europe for its own interests and said his country planned no war on Europe. Russia would be prepared to talk to Ukraine, the US and Europe about the future of Ukraine if they wanted to, but Moscow would defend its national interests, Putin said. “In Ukraine, those who are aggressive towards Russia, and in Europe and in the United States – do they want to negotiate? Let them. But we will do it based on our national interests,” he said. “We will not give up what is ours.” Russia would proceed from its own interests when dealing with Ukraine, regardless of Kyiv’s attempts to make any agreements, said Putin, who last week announced that his country’s goals in Ukraine remain unchanged and there will be no peace until they are achieved. Ukraine’s membership of the NATO military alliance “is not acceptable for Russia in 10 years, and not in 20”, he said. The president said Russia’s defence industry has reacted to the conflict in Ukraine faster than that of the West. Meanwhile, Minister of Defence Sergey Shoigu told the same meeting that Russia had increased tank production by 5.6 times since the start of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine last year, and had laid 7,000sq km (2,700sq miles) of minefields along the 2,000km (1,250-mile) front line. Moscow has demanded “denazification, demilitarisation and a neutral status” of Ukraine – which Putin has repeated sinceRussia invaded Ukrainein February 2022. Russia has alleged that Ukraine’s government is heavily influenced by “radical nationalist” and neo-Nazi groups, which Kyiv and the West dispute. The Russian government has also consistently demanded that Ukraine remain neutral and not join NATO. Putin announcedthat he will run in the March 2024 presidential election, in which the 71-year-old leader is almost certain to win a fifth term. He has been in power for 24 years, including his prime ministerial stint, and a victory next year will see him remain president until 2030.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/19/russia-boosts-nuclear-forces-amid-hybrid-war-with-the-west-putin
UN rights chief: ‘Extensive failure’ by Russia to protect Ukraine civilians,Volker Turk also says there are indications that Russian forces committed war crimes.,"The United Nations human rights chief has said there had been an “extensive failure” by Russia to take adequate measures to protect civilians in Ukraine and that there were indications that Russian forces had committed war crimes. Volker Turk, the UN high commissioner for human rights, said on Tuesday that his office’s monitoring indicated “gross violations of international human rights law, serious violations of international humanitarian law, and war crimes, primarily by the forces of the Russian Federation”. These included 142 cases of summary execution of civilians since Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year, as well as enforced disappearances, torture and ill-treatment of detainees, including through sexual violence. Russia has denied committing atrocities or targeting civilians in Ukraine. “The situation in Ukraine seems to have been added to a litany of continuous suffering, and the world’s attention seems jaded by the multiple crises that we face,” Turk told the Human Rights Council in Geneva. Russia has not taken “adequate measures to protect civilians” nor civilian infrastructure “against the effects of their attacks”, he said. The armed forces of both countries, particularly Russia, needed to abide by international human rights and humanitarian law, he added. “They must cease the use of explosive weapons with wide-area effects in populated areas, and scrupulously map the location of mines,” he said. On Tuesday, Russia’s Minister of Defence Sergei Shoigu said that since the start of what Moscow calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine, Russian forces had laid 7,000sq km (2,700sq miles) of minefields along the 2,000km (1,250-mile) front line. During a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin and senior defence officials, Shoigu also said that Russia had increased tank production by 5.6 times. Ukraine’s military has been feeling even more pressure on the front amid waveringsupport from the United Statesand some European countries. After weeks of effort torallymilitary and political backing with visits on both sides of the Atlantic, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy failed to convince the US Congress to approve $60bn in support while in Brussels, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban blocked some 50 billion euros ($55bn) in aid earmarked for Kyiv. Yet, the European Union invited Ukraine toopen membership talkslast week despite objections from Orban, who stood isolated in arguing that European Union financial resources should be saved for existing members. UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron voiced commitment to Ukraine on Tuesday, saying, “Britain and France have been staunch supporters of Ukraine and we will continue to be for as long as it takes. “I have no doubt that we can make sure [President Vladimir Putin] loses and it is essential he does lose,” Cameron said after talks in Paris with his French counterpart Catherine Colonna. Cameron said that Western countries must work together to muster the “economic strength and that commitment pay” as the allies “outmatch the Russian economy by 25 to one or more”. Neither Cameron nor Colonna announced new aid for Ukraine in their comments to reporters. “Hand in hand since the beginning, our two countries are working together to ensure that the Russian aggression is not rewarded, is a failure,” Colonna said. Zelenskyy’s visit with leaders of Nordic countries last week did yield some positive results with Norway promising additional aid worth $275m. And Denmark said it would seek parliamentary approval for $1.1bn in new funds. Zelenskyy is set to hold an end-of-year news conference later on Tuesday.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/19/the-un-and-eu-allies-reaffirm-support-for-ukraine-ahead-of-zelenskyy-speech

Russia designates author Boris Akunin ‘terrorist and extremist’,The popular novelist has criticised Russia’s war on Ukraine and previously called Vladimir Putin a ‘deranged dictator’.,"The Russian government has added the popular author Grigory Chkhartishvili – known by his pen name Boris Akunin – to a register of “terrorists and extremists” for his critical stance towards Russia’sinvasion of Ukraine. Rosfinmonitoring, Russia’s main financial intelligence body, announced that the detective novelist had been added to the registry on Monday. The 67-year-old is known for his historical detective novels and his longstanding criticism of President Vladimir Putin. “Terrorists declared me a terrorist,” Akunin, who lives in exile in London, wrote on Facebook. Separately, Russia’s Investigative Committee said it had opened a case against the Russian-Georgian author for allegedly “justifying terrorism and publicly spreading fake information” about the military. Russia adopted a law criminalising comments that discredit the armed forces following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The Kremlin has since wielded those powers tocrack downon critics. On the day Putin sent Russian troops into Ukraine, Akunin wrote on Facebook thatthe Russian leaderwas a “psychologically deranged dictator”. Speaking withAl Jazeerain March 2022, Akunin said that, even before the invasion of Ukraine, Putin had been “very methodically killing all the branches of democracy” in Russia. “We see what it has brought us to eventually: Russia, Ukraine, and now the whole world is seriously discussing the possibility of nuclear war in the 21st century,” he said. “This is all Putin’s doing.” One of Russia’s best-known publishing houses, AST, announced last week that it would no longer print or sell works by Akunin or Dmitry Bykov, another author critical of the war in Ukraine. The decision by AST followed the release of a prank call from the Russian prankster duo known as Vovan and Lexus, who spoke with the two authors posing as Ukrainian officials. Bykov told the duo that while he was saddened by the killing of Russian soldiers in the conflict, this was not something he blamed on Ukrainian officials. For his part, Akunin described Russia as a global threat and said that he was not bothered by Ukrainiandrone attackson Russian cities.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/18/russia-designates-author-boris-akunin-terrorist-and

‘Nonsense’: Putin rejects Biden claim that Russia plans to attack NATO,The Russian president says Moscow has ‘no interest … to fight with NATO countries’.,"The Russian president has dismissed the United States’s claims that Moscow could attack a NATO country in the future as “complete nonsense”, saying such a conflict would run counter to his country’s interests. Vladimir Putin made the statement in an interview with Russian state TV on Sunday, weeks after US President Joe Bidenwarnedthat if Putin achieved victory in Ukraine, he might be emboldened to attack a NATO ally, sparking a third world war. “It is complete nonsense – and I think President Biden understands that,” Putin told state television channel Rossiya. “Russia has no reason, no interest – no geopolitical interest, neither economic, political nor military – to fight with NATO countries.” Putin added that Biden may be trying to stoke such fears to justify his “erroneous policy” in the region. US-Russia relations have sunk to their lowest level in decades since Moscow invaded neighbouring Ukraine in February 2022. Throughout the 22-month war, the US has provided Ukraine with $111bn in weapons, equipment, and other aid, helping the Ukrainians fend off Russia’s advance and regain some territory. Biden favours sending even more support to war-torn Ukraine, which is running short on supplies as it grinds to a bloody winter stalemate. He has asked US Congress to approve $61.4bn in support for Ukraine as part of a larger $110bn package that includes more funds for Israel and other issues. However, there is waning appetite in the Congress for the lingering war. Some Republican lawmakers have blocked the aid package, demanding the White House first take action on border security. Biden on December 12saidright-wing lawmakers’ refusal to approve the package also risked handing President Putin a “Christmas gift” of victory. “Putin is banking on the United States failing to deliver for Ukraine,” Biden said during a news conference with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. “We must … prove him wrong.” While Putin dismissed the prospect of a direct NATO feud, he did address tensions with neighbouring Finland since it joined the alliance. Finland, which became a NATO member in April, on Fridayshut downits entire eastern border with Russia, which it accuses of orchestrating a migrant crisis on its border. Putin said he would respond to the deteriorating ties by opening up a military zone in its northwest. “They [the West] dragged Finland into NATO. Did we have any disputes with them?

Has the Ukraine war made Europe politically mature — or more transactional?,"Even as the EU invited Ukraine for membership talks this week, deep divisions are now visible after a year of rare unity.","The European Union hailed its next phase ofexpansion as a political victorythis week when leaders invited Ukraine to open membership talks. That invitation, also issued to Moldova, delivered a message to Moscow that the EU would defend the right of former Soviet states to choose a Western orientation. Plunging the knife deep into the Caucasus, the European Council also recognised Georgia as a candidate country. These moves came over the objections of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who stood isolated in arguing that EU financial resources should be saved for existing members. Orban was persuaded to leave the room so the other 26 members could proceed with the expansion decision, but the stout Hungarian stood his ground in blocking approval of a 50 billion euro ($55bn) financial aid package to Ukraine over the next four years. A separate 20 billion euro ($22bn) military aid package for Ukraine also remains in limbo. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow was “impressed” by Hungary’s stance. “Hungary has its own interests. And Hungary, unlike many other EU countries, firmly defends its interests, which impresses us,” Peskov said. During its first year, the Ukraine war appeared to give the EU a long overdue dose of political maturity and unity. The EU froze $300bn in Russian financial assets, unanimously approved11 sanctions packagesagainst Russia, provided Ukraine with85 billion euros( $93bn) in military and financial aid, and accelerated its transition to renewable energy sources as it weaned itself off Russian oil and gas. Yet European unity and resolve appear to have faltered in the second year of the war, analysts told Al Jazeera. A 12th sanctions package languished in intricate negotiations before it was finally approved on December 14 — withRussian diamondimports a key target. The energy transition slowed from a 20 percent increase in solar and wind power in 2022 to a 12 percent rise in 2023, according to Ember, an energy think tank. And as the December summit demonstrated, disagreement remained over the disbursal of EU funds to Ukraine. Most noticeably, Europe made little progress towards a more robust Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), continuing to entrust its security to NATO. The EU works on a consensus basis on major issues, where a single member can block a decision. “We have the phenomenon of countries who want to define themselves as middle powers … who want to have agency in a policy area and refuse to be boxed into binary decision making,” Jens Bastian, a fellow with the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, told Al Jazeera. “This is not an example of maturity, it’s an example of increasing transactionalism,” he said. Hungary, for example, leveraged its veto power to argue for thereleaseof 10 billion euros ($11bn), a third of the funds the European Commission has withheld to press Hungary into scaling back political interference in the functioning of itsjudiciary. The EU’s sanctions packages have been rife with such transactionalism, said Bastian. The Czech Republic has requested an exemption from a ban on Russian steel imports, arguing it needs heavy steel plates to build bridges. “It has asked for an exemption not for one or two years, but until 2028. You’ve had two years [of war] to reconsider your steel manufacturing capacity,” said Bastian. It has taken until now for the EU to consider a ban on Russian diamonds because of concerns over how this will affect the Belgian economy. Some 90 percent of the world’s rough diamonds are cut in the Belgian city of Antwerp. And when the EU banned Russian oil imports a year ago, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic wereexemptedbecause they are landlocked and cannot receive crude oil from tankers. “I cannot remember the EU ever sanctioning one of its own members for sanctions-busting and one reason is the sheer amount of exemptions is so long,” said Bastian. The refusal to be inconvenienced has nowhere been clearer than in many EU members’ refusal to significantly raise their defence budgets. Germany grandly announced a 100-billion-euro ($110bn) increase in defence spending when the Ukraine war broke out. That money was supposed to have been spent two years into the war, but most of it has yet to be written into the budget. Last month Germany’s constitutional court told finance minister Christian Lindner he had to cut the 2024 budget by 60 billion euros ($66bn) earmarked for green initiatives. That’s because Germany has a constitutional obligation to limit its annual federal budget deficit to 0.35 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP), and spending on Ukraine, rebuilding national defence, subsidising household energy efficiency and expanding renewable energy are all clamouring for fiscal attention. That is a problem in a European Union looking to its biggest economy to lead the way in greater defence autonomy. “Germany has pledged a lot but it has yet to deliver,” Minna Alander, a research fellow at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs and a specialist on German foreign and security policy, told Al Jazeera. “It boils down to the question of, ‘Do we want to keep this constitutional [deficit] limit?… is there political willingness to change the thinking according to the needs that we have now,’ and we don’t see that right now … the sense of urgency is nowhere near there,” Alander said. She called it, “one of the biggest blows in the credibility problem Germany is facing”. Since World War II, Europe has not been – nor has it seen itself as – a major geopolitical force, ceding that status to Washington and Moscow during the Cold War. A series of efforts to introduce qualified majority voting in the European Council, making it impossible for any one member to veto a decision, faltered between 2002 and 2005. Had they succeeded, Europe would now be in a position to take foreign policy decisions by majority vote, and wouldn’t be hobbled by a single member, whether Hungary or anyone else. That in turn would enable it to posture as a “geopolitical union”, a phrase that European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen is particularly fond of. Qualified majorities are vital in a diverse bloc where threat perceptions differ greatly, said Alander. “European countries have such differing perspectives on what is the greatest threat to their national security,” she said. During the Ukraine war, the EU states surrounding the North and Baltic Seas have advocated most strongly for a common foreign and security policy that actively anticipates a Russian future threat. They have argued that if Russia should get its way in Ukraine, they might be targeted next, as Putin’s Russia attempts to claw former Warsaw Pact countries back into its orbit. A recent opinion poll by theEuropean Council on Foreign Relationsfound wildly differing majorities in favour of an expansion to include Ukraine – and even in Denmark and Poland, among Ukraine’s most ardent supporters, approval didn’t surpass 50 percent. “We have seen the birth of a geopolitical union – supporting Ukraine, standing up to Russia’s aggression, responding to an assertive China and investing in partnerships,” von der Leyen said in her lastState of the European Unionspeech in September. That, believes Alander, is now a necessity, as US support for European security begins to waver. “The most likely thing to happen … is that US support for Ukraine becomes more conditional and less secure,” said Alander. “Next year it may be that we have to play a bigger role.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/16/has-the-ukraine-war-made-europe-politically-mature-or-more
Hungary blocks $54bn EU financial aid for Ukraine,Veto came hours after the European Union agreed to open membership talks with Ukraine in a move Hungary opposed.,"Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has blocked 50 billion euros ($54bn) in European Union aid for Ukraine, hours after the groupagreedto formally open membership talks with Kyiv. Leaders meeting in Brussels said they would revisit the issue next month after Orban refused to back the additional funding for Ukraine’s government as itbattlesto remove Russian forces from its territory. “Summary of the nightshift: veto for the extra money to Ukraine,” Orban, the closest ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin in the EU, wrote on social media. The EU’s other leaders agreed to revisit the debate in January. “We still have some time, Ukraine is not out of money in the next few weeks,” Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told reporters as he left the talks. “We agreed with the 26 countries. Victor Orban, Hungary, were not yet able to do that. I am fairly confident we can get a deal early next year. We are thinking of late January.” Rutte said another summit would be convened to reach a deal. Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo stressed that the financial support was vital. “It is just as important that Ukraine has the means to continue the war and rebuild its country,” he said. Orban had promised to block the membership talks and the funding for weeks, and the decision was a blow to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who failed this week to persuadeRepublican lawmakersin the United States to approve an additional $61bn for Ukraine. Most EU leaders wanted this week’s summit to send a clear sign of solidarity with Ukraine amid perceptions, eagerly seized upon and repeated by Moscow, that allies’ support for Kyiv was waning. Critics have accused the Hungarian leader of holding Kyiv’s survival hostage in a bid to force Brussels to release billions of euros in EU fundsfrozenamid concerns about Budapest’s commitment to the rule of law. In what some saw as a last-minute concession, the European Commission, the EU’s executive, agreed on Wednesday to unblock 10 billion euros ($11bn) of the money. A further 21 billion euros ($23bn) remains out of Orban’s grasp, but he denied that there was any link to Hungary’s intransigence over Ukraine. “That’s not our style,” he said. Thewar in Ukrainehas become bogged down on the front lines in the country’s east, wherePutinon Thursday claimed his troops were making progress. The country currently has some 617,000 soldiers in Ukraine, he added, after launching its full-scale invasion in February 2022. Across Brussels, at NATO headquarters, the security alliance’s Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warned that the West must continue supporting Ukraine in order to protect the rest of Europe. “If Putin wins in Ukraine, there is real risk that his aggression will not end there. Our support is not charity – it is an investment in our security,” Stoltenberg said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/15/hungary-blocks-54bn-eu-financial-aid-for-ukraine

Zelenskyy claims ‘victory’ as EU agrees to open Ukraine membership talks,Moment of celebration turns bittersweet as Hungary carries through on threats to block financial aid for Kyiv.,"President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has hailed a “victory” for Ukraine and Europe after European Union leaders agreed to openmembership talkswith Kyiv, but the mood was soured just hours later when Hungary carried through on threats to block crucial financial aid to Ukraine. European Council President Charles Michel, host of the summit in Brussels, announced Thursday’s agreement on membership talks in a social media post, calling it “a clear signal of hope for their people and for our continent”. Zelenskyy welcomed the decision as “a victory for Ukraine. A victory for all of Europe. A victory that motivates, inspires, and strengthens,” he said in a post on X. European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said it was “a strategic decision and a day that will remain engraved in the history of our union”. “These countries belong to the European family,” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said. The EU also agreed to open talks with Moldova and granted EU candidate status to Georgia. Michel said the block would also advance a membership bid by another hopeful – Bosnia and Herzegovina – once it reaches “the necessary degree of compliance” with criteria. But the mood changed early on Friday when Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orban, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, announced he hadblockeda proposal to revamp the EU budget to include 50 billion euros ($54bn) in financial aid to Kyiv as it battles to remove Russian troops from its territory. For weeks, Orban had been promising to block the membership deal and the funding, which he said were not in the interests of Hungary or the EU. While Orban had agreed not to be in the room for the membership vote – allowing it to pass – the other EU nations were unable to overcome his resistance to the budget proposal put forward by Michel. “We still have some time. Ukraine is not out of money in the next few weeks,” Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told reporters on leaving the talks. “I am fairly confident we can get a deal early next year, we are thinking of late January.” However, on Friday, Orban told Hungarians in an interview on state radio that Budapest could yet put a stop to Ukraine’s membership talks and he will not give a nod to the funding package unless Brussels releases billions of euros to Hungary that it has frozen due to rule of law concerns. It is widely believed that Orban has been complicating the EU’s efforts to help Ukraine not only because he is close to Putin but also as a way to force Brussels to release the frozen funds, which total more than 30 billion euros ($32.8bn). Stressing that membership talks would be long and complex, the Hungarian leader slammed the “bad decision” to invite Ukraine to launch the process. “Hungary bears no responsibility for this. We can halt this process later on, and if needed, we will pull the brakes, and the ultimate decision will be made by the Hungarian parliament,” he said. He also appeared to set out a clear quid pro quo regarding the funding. “I’ve always said that if someone wants to amend the budget law and they want to for several reasons, this is a great opportunity for Hungary to make it clear that it should get what it deserves – not half, then a quarter, but it must get the whole thing,” Orban said. While insisting that Hungary is not a pro-Russian country, the Kremlin on Friday praised Budapest for being prepared to defend its own interests. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov warned that Ukraine and Moldova could “destabilise” the EU should they join. “Negotiations to join the EU can last for years or decades. The EU has always had strict criteria for accession, and it is obvious that at the moment neither Ukraine nor Moldova meets these criteria,” he told reporters. “It is clear that this is an absolutely politicised decision, the EU’s desire to demonstrate support for these countries. But such new members could destabilise the EU, and since we live on the same continent as the EU, we, of course, are closely watching this.” Zelenskyy has been rallying allies’ support for his country as concerns grow that their backing might be waning. This week, he travelled tothe United States, where he hoped to persuade Republican lawmakers to approve billions of dollars in new funding that they have blocked in Congress. US President Joe Biden has argued that their refusal to back the new spending plays into Putin’s hands. Ukraine launched its bid to become part of the EU after Moscow began its full-scale invasion in February 2022 and was officially named a candidate to join in June last year. Fellow former Soviet republic and neighbourMoldovahad applied at the same time as Ukraine. Thewar in Ukrainehas breathed new life into the EU’s stalled push to take on new members as the bloc looks to keep Russian and Chinese influence at bay. In June 2022, the European Commission set Kyiv seven reform benchmarks to complete, including tackling corruption and curbing the power of its oligarchs, before talks should start. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmyhal said the EU’s decision on Thursday showed that it “highly appreciated the reforms we have made in recent years and the implementation of all the recommendations of the European Commission”. “A difficult path lies ahead. We are united and ready,” he said. EU treaties oblige members to help “by all means in their power” another EU country that is a victim of armed aggression on its territory. If Ukraine becomes an EU member while the war with Russia is continuing, EU countries would have to respect that. The EU would also acquire a long new border with Russia and Belarus with implications for security,migrationand defence.

Ireland’s prime minister urges EU leaders to call for Israel-Gaza ceasefire,Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar says there is ‘some truth’ to accusations that EU employs a double-standard on Gaza.,"A growing number of countries in the European Union have expressed support for a humanitarian ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war as Israel’s assault on Gaza plunges the Palestinian territory into a direhumanitarian crisis. In remarks on Tuesday at an EU summit focused largely on Ukraine, Irish Prime MinisterLeo Varadkarurged his colleagues to take a firmer stance and call for an end to the fighting between Israel and the Palestinian armed group Hamas in the besieged Gaza Strip. “I think the European Union has lost credibility because of our inability to take a stronger and more united position on Israel and Palestine,” Varadkar said. “We’ve lost credibility at the Global South, which actually is most of the world, because of what is perceived to be double standards. And there’s some truth in that, quite frankly.” Before the summit, Varadkar and the prime ministers of Spain, Belgium, and Malta wrote to European Council President Charles Michel asking him to host a “serious debate” about the Israel-Hamas war and the “humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in Gaza.” “We must call urgently for all the parties to declare a lasting humanitarian cease-fire that can lead to an end of hostilities,” the four leaders wrote.    The comments came several days after a large majority of nations represented at the United Nations General Assemblyvoted in favourof a resolution calling for a humanitarian ceasefire and the number of Palestinians killed in Israel’s assault on Gaza passed 18,000, most of them women and children. The resolution passed with 153 nations in support, 23 abstaining, and 10 voting against it. In Tuesday’s UN vote, 17 EU countries were among those that backed the call for a ceasefire. In October, only eight had backed a resolution calling for a truce. Varadkar insisted that a ceasefire could lead “to a new peace process and Palestinian statehood, which is the only way to secure justice and security for everyone living in the region.” Spanish Socialist leader Pedro Sánchez, whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the Council of the EU, backed his Irish colleague. “Europe has to speak out … in a clear, strong, firm and unified voice,” he said. The current round of fighting began on October 7 when Hamas launched an attack on southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took about 240 others captive. Israel responded with a devastating assault on Gaza, bombarding the territory and launching a ground offensive, claiming that it seeks to topple Hamas. The Hamas attack waswidely condemned, and Israel received strong international backing for its war against Hamas from the United States and several European countries. But as the Israeli assault continued, leading to dire humanitarian conditions and displacing more than 80 percent of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents, some allies have tempered their support with growing warnings about the toll on civilians. Western countries have also been accused of employing adouble-standard, chastising Russia for violations of international law during its invasion of Ukraine but relatively muted when faced with similar acts by Israel.    Speaking on Tuesday, US President Joe Biden said that Israel riskslosing supportdue to “indiscriminate bombing” in a rare moment of sharp criticism. But despite mountinginternational pressure, Israel has shown no signs of scaling down its fighting in Gaza, where UN officials have described conditions as “hell on earth”. On Thursday, Israeli Defence MinisterYoav Gallantsaid that the fighting in Gaza would last “more than several months”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/14/irelands-prime-minister-urges-eu-leaders-to-call-for-gaza-ceasefire
Russian court rejects appeal to release WSJ reporter Evan Gershkovich,President Vladimir Putin says he hopes for agreement with US on prisoner swap but admits ‘it’s not simple’.,"An American reporter jailed in Russia must stay behind bars into the new year as he awaits trial on espionage charges, a Russian court has ruled. Evan Gershkovich, a Moscow correspondent for The Wall Street Journal, has been in jail since March on accusations of spying – charges that he, his employer and the United States government reject. A Moscow city court on Thursday upheld aNovember rulingextending Gershkovich’s pre-trial detention to January 30, 2024, as it rejectedhis appeal to be released. Russian President Vladimir Putin, at his end-of-year news conference on Thursday, said he hoped an agreement could be reached with the US about a possible prisoner swap for Gershkovich as well as former US marine and security executive Paul Whelan, also jailed on espionage charges. While Russia had ongoing contacts with the US over the issue, Putin said:“It is not simple, I will not go into details now, but in general, it seems to me that we speak a language that is understandable to each other. I hope we will find a solution. But, I repeat, the American side must hear us and make an appropriate decision, one that suits the Russian side.” US ambassador Lynne Tracy, speaking outside the court, said: “Evan’s ordeal has now stretched on for over 250 days. His life has been put on hold for over eight months for a crime he didn’t commit.” “It is not acceptable that Russian authorities have chosen to use him as a political pawn.” Gershkovich was detained by Russian authorities on March 29 in the city of Yekaterinburg, some 2,000km (1,243 miles) east of Moscow, and accused of spying, making him the first Western reporter to be held on such charges in Russia since the Soviet era. Russia’s Federal Security Service claims the reporter was “caught red-handed” trying to obtain secret information about a Russian arms factory. He faces 20 years in prison if convicted. Gershkovich’s legal team and his supporters have dismissed the charges as baseless – and Russia has not publicly provided evidence. The US has declared Gershkovich to be “wrongfully detained” and accused Russia of using him for “hostage diplomacy”.    This month, Washington said Russia had rejected a“significant proposal”to release Gershkovich and Whelan. However, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said the setback would not “deter” the US government from “continuing to do everything we can to try and bring both of them home”. On Tuesday, Sullivan said Gershkovich’s release was a top priority for the White House. Gershkovich’s detention has unfolded amid heightened tensions between the US and Russia over thewar in Ukraineand what Russia’s critics say is an expansivecrackdownon independent media. The US is also looking into the detention of US-Russian dual citizenAlsu Kurmasheva, who was arrested in the central city of Kazan in October for failing to register as a “foreign agent”. Kurmasheva’s employer, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), this week denounced the new charges filed against her after reports that she has also been accused of violating rules against Ukraine war criticism. Russia and the US have agreed to several high-profile prisoner exchanges in recent years, includingswappingjailed US women’s basketball star Brittney Griner for Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout in December 2022. The Russian foreign ministry has said it would consider a swap for Gershkovich only after a verdict in his trial, which could last for more than a year.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/14/russian-court-rejects-appeal-to-release-wsj-reporter-evan-gershkovich
Ukraine’s Zelenskyy faces doubters and detractors in US and EU,"Republicans say there is no hope for funding approval this year, but Europe may be gearing up for an invitation.","Ukraine’s president spent the 94th week of Russia’s warrallying supporton both sides of the Atlantic, as his troops continued to defend against constant Russian assaults to the east and south of Ukraine. Although battle lines have hardly moved in weeks, Russia is trying to take the initiative after a Ukrainian summer counteroffensive put it on the defensive. Zelenskyy’s task was to ensure Ukraine gets the money and weapons it needs to continue the fight next year, but a trip to Washington, DC, on Tuesday went unrewarded when a meeting with congressional Republicans failed to convince them to release $61.4bn in military and financial aid. Meanwhile, the US Senate voted 51-49 against a $110.5bn measure brought forward by the Democrats. Even if it had passed in the Senate, the Ukraine measure would still have to meet with House approval, where Republicans also hold the majority and hold Ukraine funds hostage to a domestic agenda including abortion restrictions. “What the Biden administration seems to be asking for is billions of additional dollars with no appropriate oversight, no clear strategy to win and with none of the answers that I think the American people are owed,” House Speaker Mike Johnson said afterhis own meetingwith Zelenskyy. “(It) is practically impossible – even if we reach an agreement – to craft it, get it through the Senate, get to the House, before Christmas,” Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell told reporters in the United States Capitol. “Make no mistake, today’s vote is going to be long remembered. History is going to judge harshly those who turned their backs on freedom’s cause,” Biden said in remarks at the White House. Earlier, Biden told congressional Republicans what was at stake besides border security and abortions, as he stood beside Zelenskyy. “Ukraine will emerge from this war proud, free and firmly rooted in the West – unless we walk away. But without supplemental funding, we’re rapidly coming to the end of our ability to help Ukraine respond to the urgent operational demands that it has. Putin is banking on the US failing to deliver for Ukraine. We must, we must, we must prove him wrong,” Biden said. According to documents seen by Reuters, while he was in Washington, Zelenskyy asked for new weapons and armoury including F-18 Hornet fighter jets, Apache and Black Hawk attack helicopters. He also asked for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) air defence systems to supplement Ukraine’s existing umbrella of medium and low-range systems. As part of the effort to convince Republicans to help Ukraine, the US intelligence community released a report that revealed how much the country had achieved with the $111bn in aid the US has already provided. Ukraine had destroyed 90 percent of the forces that invaded it in February last year, the report said, costing Russia 315,000 dead and injured troops from an original force of 360,000, and destroying 2,200 out of 3,500 tanks and 4,400 out of 13,600 infantry fighting vehicles and armoured personnel carriers. Russia continues to suffer high losses in Avdiivka, a city it has been trying intensively to capture since early October. US National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson reportedly said Russian forces had suffered more than 13,000 casualties there in nine weeks. Ukrainian estimates run higher. The commander of Ukrainian ground forces, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said in November alone Ukrainian forces “destroyed” 11,000 Russian troops and 130 tanks in the east. To regain the initiative in the east, Russian forces were sending troops in en masse, he said. “In the east, the loss of Russian casualties is approximately eight times higher than the loss of the Ukrainian defence forces. Despite this, the Russian occupiers are betting on human resources,” he said. Zelenskyy did not go home from his overseas visit entirely empty-handed. The US Pentagon announced $200m in new weapons, including air-to-air missiles on December 6. Meanwhile, following a summit with leaders of Nordic countries on Wednesday, Norway has promised additional aid worth $275m. And Denmark said it would seek parliamentary approval for $1.1bn in new funds. The biggest package may have come from the United Kingdom, which together with Norway, announced a new maritime capability coalition to strengthen the Ukrainian navy. The UK will provide two Sandown-class minehunters from its own fleet to help protect Ukraine’s grain corridor in the Black Sea. Together with Norway, it is to provide 20 Viking amphibious vehicles and 23 landing craft. “Ukraine’s economy continues to be impacted by Putin’s blockade in the Black Sea, which has significantly reduced the country’s ability to move vital exports by sea,” the British government said in an announcement on Monday. On Wednesday, the European Court of Human Rights held a Grand Chamber hearing in the case of Ukraine v Russia, in which Ukraine has accused Russia of human rights abuses in Crimea. Russia, however, failed to attend. Ukraine has four cases pending at the court against Russia, including one which has been filed jointly with the Netherlands. Ukraine might have a political prize to collect this year in Europe, where government leaders have been working to issue Ukraine an official invitation to start membership talks when they hold a summit on Thursday and Friday. “The EU wants to send a message that it continues to be interested in Ukraine,” Greek conservative parliamentarian Angelos Syrigos told Al Jazeera citing sources in the European Commission and European Parliament. “It is highly likely that there will be a green light for the start of membership talks at the next European Council summit. It wants to send a political message to Russia,” Syrigos said. “There’s a feeling it’s going to happen, that there’s no going backwards,” agreed Socialist European parliamentarian Nikos Papandreou. “The whole community has been voting for Ukraine across party lines, except some people on the extreme left and the extreme right – the people who said Ukraine will only last a few weeks,” he said. “[Fellow MEPs] don’t think there will be another chance because we don’t know what the political powers will be [next year]. It’s now or never.” Europe will hold a parliamentary election next June. On Sunday, Zelenskyy had what he later described as a “frank” conversation with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has emerged as a possible deal breaker. That was on the day of the inauguration of Argentina’s President Javier Milei, which Zelenskyy attended in Buenos Aires, alongside the leaders of Paraguay, Uruguay and Ecuador, whom he also met. On Wednesday, Orban reaffirmed his opposition to inviting Ukraine to start membership talks with the EU. “Considering the numbers, economic analyses and taking it seriously that talks (with Ukraine) would aim to grant membership … then we must say that this thought at the moment is absurd, ridiculous and not serious,” Orban said. Leading EU members want the invitation to go out this week. Spain, which holds the six-month rotating presidency of the European Council, is set on getting it done. “I kicked off the Spanish presidency with a trip to Kyiv and I hope to close it with the opening of accession negotiations with this country,” Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez told a plenary session of the European Parliament. “I cannot imagine, I don’t even want to talk about the devastating consequences that will occur should the [European] Council fail to make this decision,” said Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba, calling it “the mother of all decisions”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/14/ukraines-zelenskyy-faces-doubters-and-detractors-in-us-and-eu
"Putin: Russia’s goals in Ukraine unchanged, no peace until they’re achieved",The Russian president holds first end-of-year news conference since the Ukraine war began.,"Russia’s goals in Ukraine remain unchanged and there will be no peace until they are achieved, President Vladimir Putin has said in his first end-of-year news conference since theoffensive began. The event on Thursday comes days afterPutin announcedthat he will run in the March 2024 presidential election, in which the 71-year-old leader is almost certain to win a fifth term. He has been in power for 24 years, including his prime ministerial stint, and a victory next year will see him remain president until 2030. Fielding questions from the public and the media in Moscow, the Russian leader said peace will be possible after “denazification, demilitarisation and a neutral status” of Ukraine – something he has repeated since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Russia alleges that Ukraine’s government is heavily influenced by “radical nationalist” and neo-Nazi groups, which Kyiv and the West dispute. Putin has also consistently demanded that Ukraine remain neutral and not join the NATO military alliance. “As for demilitarisation, they don’t want to negotiate, so we are then forced to take other measures, including military measures,” Putin said. “Either we agree or we need to resolve [the issue] by force,” he added. Putin said there are some 617,000 Russian soldiers currently in Ukraine, including about 244,000 who were called up to fight alongside professional Russian military forces. But there was no current need for a further mobilisation of reservists, he added. He said an estimated 486,000 people had so far signed up voluntarily as contract soldiers, on top of the 300,000 people called up last year, and “the flow is not diminishing”. Last December, in a break from tradition, Putincancelledthe event. It was the first time in a decade he did not hold the conference. This year, key themes of the conference were the fighting in Ukraine, payments to soldiers and their families and the economy. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Putin said Ukraine had lost some of its best troops in an attempt to secure a foothold on the east bank of the Dnipro in the Kherson region. “It is a tragedy, I believe, for them,” he said. As the war approaches the end of its second year, Ukraine has achieved only small gains from a counteroffensive that began in June. Russia, however, has also made no tangible progress since capturing the city of Bakhmut at heavy cost in May. It occupies about a sixth of Ukraine’s territory but does not fully control any of the four Ukrainian regions it claimed last year as part of Russia. On the ongoing war and relations with the West, Putin said: “The unbridled desire to creep towards our borders, taking Ukraine into NATO, all this led to this tragedy … They forced us into these actions.” Meanwhile on Russia’s relations with China, he said, “the level of our ties with China is at an all-time high”. Putin also said it was important that United Nations mechanisms, such as the veto power of permanent member states of the UN Security Council, remained in place. Asked by a Turkish journalist about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, he said he hoped to meet Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in early 2024. And commenting on new Argentinian PresidentJavier Milei’s planto dollarise his country’s economy, Putin said it risked jeopardising the country’s sovereignty. On the 2024Paris Summer Olympics, Putin said he was not against Russians competing, but that the country should ponder whether it should if the event is designed to portray Russian sport as “dying”. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) last week said qualifying athletes from Russia and Belarus – who had been banned from competing internationally following the invasion of Ukraine – could take part in the Games as neutrals without flags, emblems or anthems. “We still need to carefully analyse the conditions the IOC has put forward,” Putin said. “If the IOC’s artificial conditions are designed to cut off the best Russian athletes and portray at the Olympics that Russian sport is dying, then you need to decide whether to go there at all.”   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/14/russias-goals-in-ukraine-unchanged-putin-says

EU holds up billions in aid for Hungary amid tug-of-war over Ukraine,PM Viktor Orban promises to veto proposal on Kyiv’s EU membership as EU chief urges support for ‘strong’ Ukraine.,"The European Union’s executive will wait to unlock billions in development aid for Hungary from the bloc’s shared budget amid a deepening tug-of-war between the EU and Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s administration over support for Ukraine. The European Commission said on Wednesday that it is waiting for a final step from Hungary to unlock 10 billion euros ($10.8bn) that was frozen over concerns that Orban had damaged democratic checks and balances. The commission said Hungary’s latest judicial reforms must first be published in the country’s official journal to be fully enacted, which would then allow the executive body to unfreeze the funds. The EU was earlier expected to unlock the money to help sway Orban,who has threatened to vetoUkraine’s possible EU membership ambitions. But a senior Orban aide then demanded up to 30 billion euros ($32.4bn) in frozen aid be released,Bloombergreported. Orban told Hungary’s National Assembly on Wednesday that he would block a proposal to start talks on Ukraine’s EU membership at a summit in Brussels on Thursday and Friday. Ukraine’s bid for membership requires a unanimous decision by the leaders of all 27 EU nations. Orban, who boasts strong ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, told lawmakers that bringing Ukraine into the EU would have unforeseeable consequences. “We are interested in a peaceful and prosperous Ukraine, but this requires the establishment of peace as quickly as possible and a deliberate deepening of the strategic partnership,” Orban said. “Everything has its appointed time, but the time for Ukraine’s membership in the European Union has not yet come.” Distrust of Orban has been running high in Brussels after bitter run-ins during his 13 years in power over therights of gay peopleand migrants in Hungary as well as tightening state controls over academics, the courts and media Addressing members of the European Parliament on Wednesday, commission President Ursula von der Leyen urged leaders to back massive financial aid for Ukraine and Kyiv’s ambitions for membership talks. “We must give Ukraine what it needs to be strong today, so it can be stronger tomorrow at the table when it is negotiating a long lasting and just peace,” she said. Besides Ukraine’s EU bid, Hungary has also consistently signalled that it would veto a financial aid package for Kyiv worth 50 billion euros ($54bn), a position that has frustrated other EU partners who stressed that aid for Ukraine and its eventual membership are crucial for Europe’s security. Critics accused Orban of trying to blackmail Brussels to gain access to the billions of euros in EU funding. In a bid to overcome Hungary’s objections, it was expected that von der Leyen’s commission would unlock the 10 billion euros for Budapest ahead of the Brussels summit. The potential move sparked accusations that Brussels was backing down in its standoff over the rule of law with Orban, but the commission’s decision on Wednesday to wait further raises the stakes for Orban. The EU’s executive has proposed that the Brussels summit take a decision to start EU membership talks with Ukraine once Kyiv meets four outstanding conditions. Von der Leyen said laws Ukraine passed last week – including on national minorities, an issue raised by Hungary – cleared three of the remaining tasks, meaning only one was missing: a new lobbying law to rein in oligarchs. Orban, who says the rights of tens of thousands of ethnic Hungarians living in western Ukraine are being denied, disputed this interpretation. Orban is seen as Putin’s strongest ally in Europe, even after nearly two years of Russia’s war in Ukraine, and Hungary also relies on Russia for much of its energy supplies.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/13/eu-executive-holds-up-billions-for-hungary-amid-tug-of-war-over-ukraine
"Dozens hurt, children’s hospital damaged, in Russian missile attack on Kyiv",Officials warn number of injured could rise after second missile attack on Ukrainian capital this week.,"At least 53 people have been injured and a children’s hospital as well as homes damaged after Russia launched a missile attack on Kyiv in the early hours of Wednesday morning. People were woken by a series of loud explosions as air defence systems brought down 10 ballistic missiles aimed at the capital, with the debris falling on the eastern side of the Dnipro river that flows through the city. Ukraine’s national police said 53 people, including six children, were hurt in the attack with 18 people taken to hospital. Eighteen people have been hospitalised, it said in a social media post. “Just yesterday, (US) President (Joe) Biden and I agreed to work on increasing the number of air defence systems in Ukraine. The terrorist state demonstrated how important this decision is,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram, referring to Russia. The explosions blew out windows of residential apartment blocks as frightened residents ran onto the street. Falling missile debris left a vast crater in the ground and destroyed parked cars. “There was no air raid siren. At around 4am (02:00 GMT), I heard an explosion. We fled to the corridor, (the explosion wave) threw me into the doors,” Olena Ustinova, 45, a local administration clerk, told the Reuters news agency. “I regained consciousness and started to shake the doors but they were blocked. I shouted for help from my balcony and emergency workers came to help me.” Ukraine’s Armed Forces General Staff said Russia had fired Iskander-M ballistic missiles, as well as S-400s: extremely fast missiles intended for air defence, but which have also been used to hit ground targets. Windows and entrances at a children’s hospital in Kyiv’s Dniprovskyi district were shattered by the debris, but based on initial assessments, there were no casualties, according to Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko. “These (ballistic) missiles fly at a speed up to 8,000km per hour,” Klitschko told Reuters while visiting a site near one of the damaged buildings. Kyiv military administration chief Serhiy Popko said 17 people, including seven children, were evacuated from a residential building in the district after debris hit a building and nearby cars, causing a fire. On Monday, a Russian missile attack destroyed several homes on the outskirts of Kyiv injuring four people and cutting electricity to more than 100 households. The attack came after Zelenskyy was in the United States, urging right-wing Republicans to back billions of dollars in new military aid for his country. US President Joe Biden warned the lawmakers they would risk giving Russia a “Christmas gift” if they failed to approve the assistance.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/13/dozens-hurt-childrens-hospital-damaged-in-russian-missile-attack-on-kyiv
"Zelenskyy urges new Ukraine aid, as Biden warns funding delay helps Putin","Ukrainian president goes on diplomatic offensive in Washington, DC to try and win over sceptical right-wing Republicans.","US President Joe Biden has warned Russia was banking on the United States abandoning Ukraine as he promised visiting President Volodymyr Zelenskyy his full support and announced $200m in weaponry to help Kyiv push out Russian forces. The White House said the security package could be “one of the last” if Republicans did not approve the new military aid plan, which includes about $61.4bn for Ukraine as well as support for Israel and which iscurrently stuckin Congress. Biden said right-wing lawmakers’ refusal to approve the package also risked handing Russian President Vladimir Putin a “Christmas gift” of victory. “Putin is banking on the United States failing to deliver for Ukraine,” Biden said during a press conference with Zelenskyy after talks at the White House. “We must … prove him wrong.” Biden’s comments came as Zelenskyy went on the diplomatic offensive during his third visit to Washington, DC since Moscow began itsfull-scale invasionof Ukraine in February 2022. As well as meeting Biden, he aimed to appeal directly to Republican lawmakers, laying out the state of the war and Ukraine’s plans for victory in an effort to secure their support. Republicans have sought to link the spending to new measures on the US-Mexico border but also appear to be increasingly questioning the war itself. Zelenskyy stressed that supporting his country’s fight for its territorial integrity was about far more than Ukraine. “For nearly two years, we’ve been in a full-scale war – the biggest since World War II, fighting for freedom,” Zelenskyy said. “No matter what Putin tries he hasn’t won any victories. Thanks to Ukraine’s success – success in defence – other European nations are safe from the Russian aggression.” The Ukrainian president noted 600,000 troops were currently on the battlefield amid snow and freezing temperatures, and insisted there had been progress, notably against the Russian fleet in the Black Sea and establishing a new corridor for the safe export of Ukrainian grain. He said the goal in 2024 was to “take away Russia’s air superiority”. Following his more than one-hour meeting with lawmakers, he said that while the signals were “more than positive”, he would focus on action rather than words. Republicans, particularly those with the closest ties to former President Donald Trump, who is running again for election next year, appeared unmoved. Some questioned whether additional aid would really help Ukraine achieve a breakthrough. “I know everyone wants Ukraine to win. I just don’t see it in the cards,” said Republican Senator Ron Johnson. “What the Biden administration seems to be asking for is billions of additional dollars with no appropriate oversight, no clear strategy to win and with none of the answers that I think the American people are owed,” said House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson. Ahead of Zelenskyy’s meetings in the US, the Kremlin claimed that the aid already sent hadfailed to make a differenceon the battlefield and that further US support would not be able to turn the tide. Russia has stepped up drone and missile attacks on multiple regions of Ukraine, amid fears it will again target power infrastructure during the coldest months of the year, with troops engaged inintense battleson the front lines in the eastern and southern parts of the country. Tens of thousands of civilians have been killed since Russia invaded, with many Ukrainians fleeing overseas. The US has said that while Russia appears to “believe that a military deadlock through the winter will drain Western support for Ukraine”, it has paid a heavy price for its invasion. Some 315,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded in Ukraine since the war began, according to a declassified US intelligence assessment shared with Congress, amounting to about 90 percent of the personnel it had in February 2022. Ukraine has also inflicted heavy losses on Russia in recent fighting along the Avdiivka-Novopavlivka axis in the east — including 13,000 casualties and more than 220 combat vehicle losses, the report said. Zelenskyy was asked whether Ukraine might be willing to give up some of its land as part of a peace deal. He dismissed such suggestions. “How can Ukraine simply give away its territory? This is absolutely insane,” the Ukrainian president said. “Let’s be honest… Our people live there… our children. It’s a part of our society. We’re talking about people who live there.” Zelenskyy made his first visit to the US just days before Christmas a year ago. At that time, he received thunderous applause in Congress and many lawmakers wore Ukraine’s national colours of blue and yellow.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/13/zelenskyy-urges-new-ukraine-aid-as-biden-warns-funding-delay-helps-putin

US announces hundreds of new sanctions in push to isolate Russia,New sanctions target entities and individuals around the world in bid to isolate Russia as its war on Ukraine continues.,"The United States has announced hundreds of new sanctions targeting entities and individuals across the globe, seeking tofurther isolate Russiaas its war on Ukraine grinds on. The US Departments of State and the Treasury said on Tuesday that they had designated more than 250 individuals and entities in countries including Turkey, China, and the United Arab Emirates, cracking down on sanctions evasion, weapons procurement, and sectors such as energy and mining. “The Kremlin has steadily turned Russia into a wartime economy, but Putin’s war machine cannot survive on domestic production alone,” said Treasury SecretaryJanet Yellen. “Our sanctions today continue to tighten the vise on willing third-country suppliers and networks providing Russia the inputs it desperately needs to ramp up and sustain its military-industrial base.”    The US Treasury said that among those targeted by the recent round of sanctions are those involved in weapons procurement for Russia, including four entities and nine people in China, Russia, Hong Kong and Pakistan. The sanctions also target those with connections to Russia’s energy sector, a crucialsource of revenuefor the Kremlin. The sanctions include companies working to develop a large natural gas processing facility in northwestern Russia that would be operated by Gazprom. The announcement came as Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyvisited Washington, DC in an effort to secure further military aid from the US, where conservative lawmakers have called continued US support into question. Assistance for Ukraine, which is fighting to eject Russian forces from its territory, has facedmounting oppositionin the US and Europe, after a much-anticipated counteroffensive failed to produce substantial gains and the war continues with no end in sight. Russian officials have expressed confidence that they can outlast Western support for Ukraine, while Ukrainian officialshave arguedthat continued assistance is a necessity and brings benefits to its security partners.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/12/us-announces-hundreds-of-new-sanctions-in-push-to-isolate-russia
Ukraine’s Zelenskyy arrives in the US. What’s on the agenda?,The Ukrainian president is trying to help break a US domestic political deadlock that would deprive his country of war funding.,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hasarrived in the USas part of his efforts to convince US politicians to not block military aid to the war-torn country. Zelenskyy is expected to meet US President Joe Biden, a staunch supporter of Ukraine in its war with Russia. “[Russian president Vladimir Putin] thought he could break you … he was wrong. He continues to be wrong. Ukraine is unbroken, unbowed and unconquered, proving that nothing can dim the flame of liberty that burns in the heart of free people,” Biden said in late last September when Zelenskyy had again visited the White House. Zelenskyy’s key meeting in Washington was likely to be scheduled with Republican and Democratic senators. The Republican Party has so far refused to even schedule a vote on President Biden’s request for $50bn in military aid for Ukraine next year and to replace US weapons drawn down for Ukraine this year. Senate Republicans last weekblockedBiden’s $111bn bill, which includes military aid to Israel and humanitarian aid to Ukraine, from advancing to debate and a vote. They said the bill did not contain provisions to tighten border security with Mexico and restrict asylum and parole rights for refugees. JD Vance, the Ohio Republican senator,saidhe was “offended” by Zelenskyy’s visit to Washington this week, and it was “not the role of the United States here to hand out money to every beggar who comes into our country”. Asked whether he had any indications for a breakthrough in September, Biden had said, “I’m counting on the good judgment of the US Congress. There’s no alternative.” Biden has urged Congress to vote for Ukraine because it is both in the US interest and consistent with US values. “The entire world has a stake in making sure that no nation, no aggressor, has the power to take a neighbour’s territory by force,” he said in his meeting with Zelenskyy. “The American people will never waver in our commitment to those values.” Ukraine has witnessed anerosion in supporton both sides of the Atlantic after a carefully prepared counteroffensive this year failed to achieve its strategic objective of driving a wedge into the middle of the Russian front. Some politicians have called for Ukraine to negotiate with Russia, something Zelenskyy presently refuses to do. On Monday, Zelenskyy spoke with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban in Buenos Aires, during theinaugurationof Argentina’s President Javier Milei. Hungary has emerged as the European Union member most opposed to inviting Ukraine to start membership talks with the EU in this week’s summit or promising Ukraine $21.4bn (20 billion euros) in military aid next year. Zelenskyy has been coordinating strategies with the European Commission to break that impasse. “We are working to get an unconditional decision to start negotiations,” said Zelenskyy in a November 13 video address. “It is fundamental for Ukraine to implement all the recommendations of the European Commission.” But theUS military aid is key, because the US has donated more than three times what Europe has donated in military aid ($111bn so far, versus Europe’s $29bn), and it also has the largest stockpiles of deliverable weapons in the West’s arsenal. That, says a former Republican congressional candidate, is precisely why the US needs to step back. “Republicans are reflecting the sentiment of many Americans who believe Ukraine’s fight is just, but believe that an additional $61.2bn in aid is excessive given that the US has contributed more to the effort than all other nations combined, while domestic concerns have been ignored,” Demetries Andrew Grimes, who stood for Florida’s 15th House district in 2022, told Al Jazeera. Grimes, who has also supported ending birthright citizenship, whereby people born in the US have the right to US citizenship even if their parents were not legal migrants, says the situation is critical. “6.5 million unvetted and undocumented migrants have entered the US since Biden took office,” he said, adding that a record number of immigrant arrivals on the southern border will lead to “another 5 million illegal” migrants entering the US within the next year. Biden said Ukraine was to receive its first M1-Abrams tanks next week, along with Hawkeye missiles, launchers and interceptors to protect its airspace. Apart from President Biden and the full Senate, Zelenskyy was due to meet withUS House SpeakerMike Johnson. The Pentagon has started rationing its aid to Ukraine and has warned it could be stopped altogether by the end of the year. On December 4, the White House Office of Budget and Managementwroteto Congress, warning that “without congressional action, by the end of the year we will run out of resources to procure more weapons and equipment for Ukraine and to provide equipment from U.S. military stocks”. The result would be to “kneecap” Ukraine’s armed forces just as Russia is pushing to regain the initiative on the battlefield, wrote Shalanda D Young, who heads the Office. “If Ukraine’s economy collapses, they will not be able to keep fighting, full stop,” she said. “Putin understands this well, which is why Russia has made destroying Ukraine’s economy central to its strategy – which you can see in its attacks against Ukraine’s grain exports and energy infrastructure.” Some US commentators believe the Republican stance represents Putin’s best hope of hobbling Ukraine’s war effort – especially once theUS presidential electiongets under way next year. “What’s going to happen to the American election?… Trump and what the Republicans represent does not help Ukraine, and could potentially make things easier for Russia,” retired Colonel Seth Krummrich, now vice-president of Global Guardian, a security consultant, told Al Jazeera. The White House has told congressional Republicans that domestic politics should not come in the way of US support for Ukraine in its fight against Russia. Russian PresidentVladimir Putinhas already put his own military budget in place. On November 27, he signed a 70 percent increase ofdefence and securityspending next year, to a post-Cold War record $157.5bn – some 39 percent of the entire Russianbudget. “Zelensky is likely to depart Washington empty-handed, but with a commitment of assistance through authorized US weapons transfers from allies, backed by a US pledge to replenish allies for their contributions,” said Grimes. On Monday afternoon, Zelenskyy received a boost from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which said it would disburse another $900m under its Ukraine programme. The fund has granted $4.5bn under the$15.6bn programmeso far this year.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/12/ukraines-zelenskyy-arrives-in-the-us-whats-on-the-agenda
"Additional US military aid to Ukraine will be a ‘fiasco’, Kremlin says",Moscow is ‘very attentively’ watching as US President Joe Biden and Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy meet in Washington.,"Any further United States aid to Ukraine will be a “fiasco”, the Kremlin has said ahead of ameetingin Washington between US President Joe Biden and Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Moscow is also “very attentively” watching developments as the two leaders are set to meet on Tuesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Zelenskyy’s visit is part of a last-ditch plea to US lawmakers to keep military support flowing as he battles Russia. As the Ukrainian leader visits the White House and Capitol Hill, Biden’s request for billions in additional aid for Ukraine and Israel is at serious risk of collapse in Congress. “It is important for everyone to understand: The tens of billions of dollars pumped into Ukraine did not help it gain success on the battlefield,” Peskov said, speaking at a news conference in Moscow on Tuesday. “The tens of billions of dollars that Ukraine wants to be pumped with are also headed for the same fiasco.” The Kremlin spokesman said the outcome of the meeting would not change the situation on the front line in Ukraine, nor the progress of Russia’s “special military operation” in the country. He added that Zelenskyy’s authority was being undermined by his government’s “failures” in the ongoing war. On Monday, Zelenskyywarnedthat failing to maintain support for Ukraine would play into the hands of Russian President Vladimir Putin. “Let me be frank with you, friends. If there’s anyone inspired by unresolved issues on Capitol Hill, it’s just Putin and his sick clique,” he said, speaking to soldiers at the National Defense University in Washington, DC. Zelenskyy and Biden have argued that helping Ukraine resist Russia’s invasion, launched in February 2022, is in the mutual interests of both countries as support for Ukrainian aid hitspolitical snagsin the US. During their talks, the two plan to discuss a way to rally support for the military aid plan primarily focused on Ukraine and Israel. Last week,Republicans blockedthe plan after walking out of a classified briefing on Ukraine amid demands for US-Mexico border reforms. Some Republicans are opposed to giving a “blank cheque” for Ukraine. The US Congress has approved more than $110bn in security assistance for Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion but has not approved new funds since the Republican Party gained a majority in the House of Representatives in January. Biden has asked Congress to approve an additional $61.4bn in support for Ukraine as part of a larger $110bn package that includes more funds for Israel and other issues.

"As Gaza reels, Ukraine war feels suddenly distant in Global South nations","Everyday Indians are less likely to keep up with the news about Russia’s war, as analysts say Western response to Palestinian suffering underscores double standard.","Jaipur, India –Even though Ukraine lies 6,000km (3,728 miles), two seas and half a dozen national borders away from Ali Hussein’s hometown, the raven-haired 29-year-old tour guide still feels for the war-torn ex-Soviet nation. “India is close to Russia and we buy Russian weapons, [but] I am fully on Ukraine’s side,” he told Al Jazeera, standing next to one of the terracotta-coloured buildings that gave Jaipur, a megalopolis of 3 million people, its sobriquet of India’s “Pink City.” He was referencing New Delhi’s decades-old ties to Moscow dating back to India’s 1947 independence and the fact that over the past five years, India has gone on a $13bn spending spree on Russian-made weaponry. He also has personal ties to Ukraine. His cousin attended a medical school in the northeastern city of Kharkiv, like thousands of Indian students who brave harsh winters and a new language of instruction to get a degree at a much lower cost than at home or in the West. But Hussein is a rare exception. Dozens of Indians asked this reporter in 10 cities from Delhi to the Pakistani border a similar question: “Is the war over?”    Their lack of knowledge seems understandable. Europe’s bloodiest armed conflict since World War II is not top-of-the-hour or headline news any more. Since October, it has been eclipsed by the Israel-Palestine conflict. But the Middle East war has not only changed the news agenda in the Global South, a term meaning Latin America, Africa and much of Asia. It has also confirmed the worst fears of many in the region – that Western powers are far less likely to empathise with Palestinian suffering, compared with that of Ukrainians. “The confrontation between Israel and Hamas has not only boosted the Kremlin’s hopes of changing the mood around the war in Ukraine but also strengthened its belief that the Western-centric system of international relations is breaking down,” according to Nikita Smagin, an expert with the Russian International Affairs Council. The war in Gaza has also “nullified all the results of rapprochement between the West and the Global South, and in this context, the war benefits [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,” Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kushch told Al Jazeera. Ukraine is well aware of the trend. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s trip to Argentina last week is widely seen as an attempt to win the hearts and minds in Latin America. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with widely-reported war crimes, the shelling of civilian areas and, threats toEurope’s largest nuclear station, was met with global condemnation. While Western nations were quick to support Ukraine, a sovereign nation with its own national identity that stood up to Russia’s occupation attempts, their backing of Israel’s operation in Gaza has raised doubts and sparked cries of hypocrisy. “The typical comparison people make between Ukrainians and Palestinians is how the West is treating the former so differently than the latter,” said Seda Demiralp, a professor of political science at Istanbul’s Isik University. European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, for example, has consistently condemned what she has called Russian “acts of pure terror” on civilians in Ukraine, but failed to criticise Israel for its brutal campaign in the Gaza Strip, which has killed more than 18,000 people in just more than two months. The alleged double standards irk Global South nations. “People can argue endlessly about the reasons for the war in Ukraine, or Israel’s operation in Gaza, but for many the conclusion is obvious: the United States was critical of Russia when it killed innocent civilians in Ukraine and now it is silent when its ally Israel does the same thing in Gaza,” said Smagin. The latest episode of the Israel-Palestine conflict escalated after Hamas, which governs Gaza, attacked southern Israel, killing at least 1,200 people and taking more than 200 captive. Israel responded quickly, promising to crush Hamas with its relentless bombardment. Malaysia was quick to accuse the West of “ignoring Palestinians” while providing “swift” support to Ukraine. “Why are there two different approaches? For instance, in the Ukraine crisis, the Western powers swiftly provided support to Kyiv. Unfortunately, when it comes to Palestine, it is entirely disregarded,” Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi reportedly said. Another point of tension is rooted in perception. Western media outlets cover the killings of Israelis in more detail than those of Palestinians – a macabre “Orientalism” that pays little attention to mass deaths in places like Afghanistan or Iraq in comparison with Western nations, a United Kingdom analyst says. “This kind of Orientalism doesn’t want to equal the deaths of Israelis and Palestinians, ignoring the fact that there are dozens of times more victims among Palestinians,” Alisher Ilkhamov of Central Asia Due Diligence, a think tank in London, told Al Jazeera. “And considering the whole history of Palestine’s occupation – thousands times more.” Even though czarist Russia wanted to invade India, post-colonial New Delhi developed cordial ties with Communist Moscow. India’s nationalist premier, Narendra Modi, has not joined the international choir of critics lambasting the invasion of Ukraine and New Delhi abstained from condemning the aggression in the United Nations. These days, the Russian-Indian trade is conducted in rupees, which New Delhi sees as a chance to make its currency convertible and more useful in global trade. This year, New Delhi saved $2.7bn between January and October by buying 70 million tonnes of discounted Russian oil, the Reuters news agency reported in November. And the Kremlin’s narrative seems to be especially effective in India, where 46 percent of Indians believed the Ukrainian government was under the spell of neo-Nazi ideologues – a baseless claim Putin has used to justify the war – according to a poll by YouGov Cambridge, an international pollster, conducted in October 2023. Only 27 percent of those polled said Russia was to blame for the war, while 42 percent thought Ukraine was conducting mass murders and “genocide” of ethnic Russians. Meanwhile, some Indian observers saw Western sanctions on Russia as a new financial tool to keep controlling the global economy. “This led to fears that the dollar was being weaponised,” analysts Ashish Pandey and Garima Bora wrote in the Economic Times, an Indian online newspaper, in June. “Several countries were worried that the US could use the power of its currency to target them and hobble their growth,” they wrote.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/12/global-south-gaza-ukraine

They have just been informed simultaneously in both colonies that he is not there. We still don't know where Alexey is. — Кира Ярмыш (@Kira_Yarmysh)December 11, 2023  The Russian opposition leader had been preparing for an expected transfer to a “special regime” high-security facility from Penal Colony Number 6, in the town of Melekhovo in the Vladimir region, about 230 kilometres (140 miles) east of Moscow. A Russian court handed the 43-year-old Navalny a 19-year prison sentence in August oncharges of “extremism”, which he maintains are politically motivated. That is on top of an 11-and-a-half-year sentence that he was already serving. In December, he also said that he had been informed ofnew chargesagainst him under a penal code that covers vandalism. “They really do initiate a new criminal case against me every three months,” he said in comments issued through his associates at the time. “Rarely does an inmate confined to a solitary cell for over a year have such a vibrant social and political existence.” The spokesperson Yarmysh told the news outlet Reuters that Navalny’s current location is not known. “We don’t know where he is right now. He can be in any colony of special regime and there are around 30 of them in Russia, all over Russia,” she said. “We will try to go to every colony there is and look for him”.    The disappearance comes as Russian PresidentVladimir Putinprepares for an election campaign, hoping to secure another six-year term at the country’s helm. The team for Navalny, by far the best-known figure in Russia’s opposition, is preparing an “anti-Putin” campaign and says that the leader’s disappearance will not halt their efforts.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/11/allies-say-russian-opposition-figure-alexey-navalny-removed-from-prison
Russia plans presidential vote in annexed Ukrainian regions,The decision raises logistical and security challenges for Moscow because of its limited control in the four regions.,"Russia plans to run next year’s presidential election in the four regions of Ukraine that it annexed in 2022. The Central Elections Commission said on Monday that voting would go ahead in Donetsk, Lugansk, Zaporizhia and Kherson regions, according to state news agency Interfax. The plan will test security because Moscow’s military does not control all of the regions, although it has stepped up efforts to extend its grip. Meanwhile, Ukraine has already said that any Russian vote in the regions will be null and void and that it will prosecute any observers sent to monitor voting. Moscow’s ability to hold the election in what it calls its “new territories” is politically important for the Kremlin, but it raises logistical and security challenges because of Russia’s limited control in the regions amid theongoing warsince February 2022. Russia’s annexation claim was rejected as illegal by Ukraine and most countries at the United Nations General Assembly. The areas controlled by Moscow have been placed under martial law. President Vladimir Putinconfirmedlast Friday, in comments to Russian soldiers who have fought in Ukraine, that he will run again for president in the March election, in which he faces no serious competition.    Amid a campaign that has become bogged down in trench warfare, it appears unlikely that Moscow will be able to significantly increase its control of the four regions ahead of the vote. However, it is clearly keen to try. The Ukrainian military reported on Monday that Russian forces had unleashed a massive new offensive on the city of Avdiivka, which sits just northwest of the city of Donetsk and is key to efforts to secure control of the wider Donbas region. “The enemy launched yesterday massive assault actions with the support of armoured vehicles in Avdiivka and Mariinka directions,” military spokesperson Oleksandr Stupun told Ukrainian TV. There was no immediate comment from Russia on the fighting in the area. The front lines in eastern Ukraine have barely shifted over the past several weeks, but the fighting has been intense, Stupun said, adding that there had been 610 artillery shellings reported near Avdiivka in just the last 24 hours. Russia is trying to encircle the small city, which now has only about 1,500 people left out of its pre-war population of some 32,000. Russia launched a renewed bid to capture Avdiivka more than two months ago and Moscow’s forces have been inching forward on the flanks to try to cut supply lines.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/11/russia-to-hold-presidential-election-in-annexed-ukrainian-regions-interfax
Russia claims arrest of Ukrainian assassin network,Russia says it has arrested 18 Ukrainian ‘agents and accomplices’ who plotted to assassinate pro-Russian figures.,"Russia says that it has arrested a network of Ukrainian assassins targeting pro-Russian figures in the annexed Crimea peninsula. Moscow’s Federal Security Service (FSB) said on Monday that it has arrested 18 “agents and accomplices” of Ukraine’s special services. Several pro-Russian figures in Crimea and the occupied east of Ukraine have been attacked since the Kremlin launched its invasion of its neighbour in February 2022. The FSB said it made the arrests after discovering a weapons cache. Moscow accuses the Ukrainian agents of plotting to kill several pro-Russian government figures, as well as attacking Russian energy and rail networks. Among those pro-Russian figures targeted was the Moscow-appointed head of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov. Oleg Tsaryov, a former member of the Ukrainian parliament, survived beingshot twicein October 2023, in an attack Russia blamed on Kyiv. Claims of sabotage are rife on both sides of the war, and such operations are thought to have killed or wounded hundreds of thousands of soldiers and damaged both countries’energyand transport infrastructure. On December 7, Russia said itarresteda foreign agent working for Ukraine’s secret services who blew up several Russian trains in Siberia believed to be carrying ordinances to the front lines. Russia’s claim that it has broken up the Ukrainian sabotage network comes amid fresh military strikes on Kyiv and fierce fighting in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine said on Monday that it had shot down eight ballistic missiles fired by Russia at Kyiv, in the first attack on the capital city in months. Four people were injured by shrapnel in the southeastern Darnitskyi district, police said. Meanwhile, Russian forces have reportedly stepped up their offensive on the eastern city of Avdiivka, which they have zeroed in on as part of their campaign to overtake the Donbas region. Ukraine said Russia’s military had launched “massive assault actions” on the city on Sunday, but that its defences held and the front lines hardly budged. The Russian military has focused on eastern Ukraine since abandoning an advance on Kyiv in the first days after the February 2022 invasion. Now, heading into the harsh winter, Ukrainians fear Russia will strike at their energy system for a second straight year. To shore up their defences, Ukrainian officials are pleading with Western partners for more military aid. However, there appears to begrowing reluctancein the US and Europe to dole out the funds. In the US, Ukraine’s top single-country donor, the White House is struggling to convince Congress to approve a mammoth military aid package that includes $60bn earmarked for Ukraine. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will travel to Washington on Tuesday to make the case for more aid to US lawmakers.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/11/russia-claims-to-bust-ukrainian-sabotage-network-strikes-at-kiev
UK sends minehunters to boost Ukraine’s Black Sea forces,Britain and Norway plan to help Ukraine bolster Black Sea security amid its war with Russia.,"The UK has transferred two minehunter ships to Ukraine as part of a new push to strengthen the country’s presence in the Black Sea amid Russia’s invasion. The UK’s Ministry of Defence (MoD) announced Ukraine’s procurement of the two Royal Navy vessels on Monday. The deal is part of a new Maritime Capability Coalition, led by Britain and Norway, aimed at providing long-term military support tobolster securityin the Black Sea. The focus on maritime operations has increased after nearly two years of war. Ukraine has targeted Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, which is based in the annexed Crimea peninsula, as it has sought to use ships to exportgrain. “As an island nation with a proud maritime history, the UK and Royal Navy are particularly well-placed to support this endeavour, which will form part of a series of new coalitions formed between allies to ensure an enduring military commitment in support of Ukraine,” UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said, explaining how the warships are an important first step. “These minehunters will deliver vital capability to Ukraine, which will help save lives at sea and open up vital export routes, which have been severely limited since [Russian President Vladimir] Putin launched his illegal full-scale invasion,” Shapps said. “This capability boost marks the beginning of a new dedicated effort by the UK, Norway and our allies to strengthen Ukraine’s maritime capabilities over the long term, enhancing their ability to operate in defending their sovereign waters and bolstering security in the Black Sea.” The coalition will also work with the Ukrainian navy to expand its forces in the Black Sea, develop a Ukrainian Marine Corps and enhance the use of river patrol craft to defend inland and coastal waterways, the ministry said. The UK and Ukraine made the deal for the two minehunters in June 2021, before Russia’s full-scale invasion. Ukrainian soldiers have been training on the ships since last year. London has also provided military training courses to around 20,000 Ukrainians over the past year. The UK is thesecond-largest providerof military aid to Ukraine, after the US. The two Sandown-class mine countermeasures vessels were procured by Ukraine through UK Export Finance.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/11/uk-to-send-2-mine-destroying-ships-to-ukraines-black-sea-coast
"Zelenskyy to meet US President Joe Biden, House Speaker as aid stumbles","Ukrainian president will travel to Washington, DC as right-wing Republicans baulk at providing more help to Ukraine in its fight against Russia’s invasion.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will travel to Washington, DC on Monday for meetings at the White House and the United States Capitol as right-wing US Republicans resist efforts to send more money to support Ukraine’s response to Russia’s full-scale invasion. In a statement on Sunday, the White House said US President Joe Biden had invited Zelenskyy to discuss the “vital importance” of continued US support for Ukraine’s defence and the “urgent needs” it faces. Zelenskyy is also expected to address US senators on Tuesday morning. An aide for US House of RepresentativesSpeaker Mike Johnsonsaid Zelenskyy would also hold a private meeting with Johnson who has been trying to link Ukraine aid to immigration reforms at the US’s southern border. The meetings come as Biden attempts to rally support for a $106bn military aid plan mostly for Ukraine and Israel, whichRepublicans blockedlast week after walking out of a classified briefing on Ukraine amid demands for border reforms. Zelenskyy’s office confirmed the planned meeting with Biden, adding that key areas of discussion would include defence cooperation between the US and Ukraine, “particularly through joint projects on the production of weapons and air defence systems, as well as the coordination of efforts between our countries in the coming year”. Biden has warned of the risk of weakening US support for Ukraine and Shalanda Young, head of the White House Office of Management and Budget, reiterated those concerns on CBS’s Face the Nation on Sunday. “What happens if Putin marches through Ukraine, what’s next? NATO countries, our sons and daughters, are at risk of being a part of a larger conflict,” she told the programme. Republicans remained sceptical, however, with Senator JD Vance, a close ally of former US President Donald Trump who is campaigning for election again in 2024, dismissing the idea that the Russian president would put other NATO countries at risk. He told CNN on Sunday that he was opposed to what he termed a “blank cheque” for Ukraine. “What’s in America’s best interest is to accept Ukraine is going to have to cede some territory to the Russians and we need to bring the war to a close,” Vance said. Russia occupies about a fifth of Ukrainian territory. The funding row comes amid signs of fraying Western resolve on Ukraine after Kyiv’s much-heralded June offensive failed to make significant headway and Russia deploys more troops and steps up aerial attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure as temperatures drop to freezing. On Monday, Ukraine’s Air Force said air defences shot down eight Russian missiles aimed at Kyiv early on Monday with the falling debris injuring at least two civilians. The White House said Biden’s meeting will come at a vital moment, “as Russia ramps up its missile and drone strikes against Ukraine”. The US State Department announced last week a stopgap $175m tranche of new aid for Ukraine on Wednesday, including HIMARS rockets, shells, missiles and ammunition. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken insisted on Sunday that “Ukraine has done an extraordinary job” defending itself. “The choice is very clear,” he said on ABC. “If we do this and help Ukraine sustain the achievements that it’s made, help ensure that Russia continues to suffer a strategic failure in Ukraine. That’s one route to go. “The other route to go is to do something that the only people who are rooting for it are in Moscow, and maybe in Tehran and Beijing, which is not to provide this assistance,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/11/zelenskyy-to-meet-us-president-joe-biden-house-speaker-as-aid-stumbles

Israel cannot carry out ‘collective punishment’ of people in Gaza: Lavrov,"Speaking at the Doha Forum, the Russian foreign minister calls for international monitoring of the situation in Gaza.","The Russian foreign minister says it is unacceptable that Israel is using Hamas’s October 7 offensive as justification for a collective punishment of Palestinians in Gaza and has called for international monitoring of the situation on the ground in the besieged enclave. Speaking virtually at the Doha Forum on Sunday, Sergey Lavrov told Al Jazeera’s diplomatic editor James Bays the unprecedented attack by Hamas inside the Israeli territory did not happen in a vacuum. It was due to “decades and decades of a blockade [in Gaza] and decades and decades of unfulfilled promises to the Palestinians that they would have a state, living side to side with Israel in security and good neighbourliness”, he said. At least 17,700 Palestinians have beenkilled in Gazasince October 7 – 70 percent of them women and children, prompting rights bodies and experts to call it a “genocide”. In Israel, the revised official death toll from the Hamas attack stands at about 1,147.    Addressing the Doha Forum, a two-day global meeting being held in the Qatari capital, Lavrov said the ongoing war in Gaza is about “cancel culture” – a recent phenomenon that refers to the mass withdrawal of support to public figures or celebrities who did things in the past that are no more acceptable today. “Whatever you don’t like in the events which lead to a situation, you cancel,” he said. Russian President Vladimir Putin has called Israel’s offensive in Gaza a failure of US diplomacy and suggested that Moscow could be a mediator in the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Moscow has also condemned this week’s US veto of a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza. Dmitry Polyanskiy, Russia’s representative at the UN,saidUS diplomacy was “leaving scorched earth in its wake”. Shortly after Lavrov spoke at the Doha Forum, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a telephone conversation with Putin, expressing his “displeasure” at Moscow’s positions against Israel at the UN and other global forums. “The prime minister emphasised that any country that would suffer a criminal terrorist attack such as Israel experienced would act with no less force than the one Israel is using,” read a statement from Netanyahu’s office.    Lavrov’s comments to Al Jazeera came as Russia’s war in Ukraine continues to rage. Since February 2022, Ukraine has faced a full-scale Russian invasion that has seen its eastern territories occupied. Lavrov, however, dubbed it a “hybrid war on Russia launched by the United States and NATO”, adding that the Ukraine conflict is also based on cancel culture. “It is not a war of choice [for Russia]. It is the operation which we could not avoid, given the years and years of the US and NATO preparing Ukraine to be an instrument to undermine Russia’s security,” he said. Lavrov said the Ukrainian government had passed legislation intended tocancel “everything Russian”, including language, media, culture and education. “This [law] is against people who for generations have been living in eastern and southern Ukraine … The only thing the Western media is being encouraged to say is that Russia invaded Ukraine,” he told Bays. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, however, insists it was Moscow that spurred the current phase of “de-Russification efforts” in the country. “You are doing it – in one generation’s lifetime and forever,” he said in a televised address in March last year. “You are doing your best so that our people abandon the Russian language, because Russian will be associated with you, only with you, with these explosions and killings, with your crimes.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/10/israel-cannot-carry-out-collective-punishment-of-people-in-gaza-lavrov
"Russians, Belarusians to compete as ‘neutrals’ at 2024 Paris Olympics: IOC",The athletes had initially been banned from competing internationally following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.,"The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has given the green light to the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes in the games next year as neutrals, drawing the ire of Ukrainian officials. Russian andBelarusianathletes who qualify in their sport for the Paris 2024 Olympics will be able to take part without flags, emblems or anthems, outside of team events and as long as they do not actively support the war in Ukraine, the IOC said on Friday. “The IOC essentially gave Russia the green light to weaponize the Olympics,” Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said in a social media post condemning the decision. “Because the Kremlin will use every Russian and Belarusian athlete as a weapon in its propaganda warfare. I urge all partners to strongly condemn this shameful decision, which undermines Olympic principles,” he added. The athletes had initially been banned from competing internationally following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but have since been gradually allowed back as neutral athletes in most sport. The IOC said eight Russians and three Belarusians are among 4,600 athletes worldwide who have so far qualified for the Summer Games, which open in July. They will only be allowed to compete in individual sports and no teams for the two countries will be allowed to participate in Paris. The IOC has also said that no state or government official from Russia or Belarus will be invited to or accredited for Paris 2024, but argue that athletes should not be held accountable for the actions of their governments. Russia’s Sports Minister Oleg Matytsin called the move “discriminatory”. More than 60 Ukrainian athletes have qualified for next year’s Paris Olympics. A total of about 11,000 athletes will take part in the games next year. Athletes and officials from Ukraine, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have repeatedly urged the IOC to exclude Russia and Belarus entirely. However, representatives of international sports federations and national Olympic committees hadcalledforRussian and Belarusian athletesto be admitted under a neutral flag “as soon as possible”. Ukraine’s Sport Minister Matviy Bidnyi told the AFP news agency in advance of the decision on Thursday that Kyiv was concerned the move gave the impression that the IOC “does not want to demonstrate the necessary leadership in the matter of Olympic fairness and justice”. “As aptly stated by President Volodymyr Zelensky: ‘Obviously, any neutral flag of Russian athletes is stained with blood,'” said Bidnyi. “When there is a war and one nation with its passports is destroying another nation, then ‘neutrality’ becomes irresponsibility,” he said, adding that giving up their Russian passport was “the only possible way today for an athlete to prove Olympic excellence is his first priority”. Earlier this year, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the IOC of using the games as a form of “ethnic discrimination”.

"Who is Ilya Ponomarev, the anti-war Russian renegade exiled in Ukraine?","Ponomarev, once a liberal parliamentarian, has likened himself to Charles de Gaulle. Does he really pose a threat to Putin?","Ilya Ponomarev was once a member of the Russian parliament, an unruly liberal tolerated by the leadership. These days, he’s on a mission to slay Vladimir Putin and his aides. “They should be terminated with an aspen stake through their hearts,” he wrote in his memoir, Does Putin Have to Die?: The Story of How Russia Becomes a Democracy after Losing to Ukraine. Exiled in Ukraine since 2016, Ponomarev is the political head of the Freedom of Russia Legion, a volunteer militia thought to include about 1,600 Russian dissidents and defectors using pinprick tactics to aggravate Russian troops with the aim of one day marching on Moscow. To some, he cuts a maverick, temptingly plausible figure. The 48-year-old compares himself to Charles de Gaulle, the French military leader who led his nation’s resistance to the Nazis from exile during World War II and later became president. Who is the man who has reportedly been giving Putin, the president who will run again next year, nightmares? A self-confessed “libertarian communist”, Ponomarev hails from an elite background, his mother having once sat in parliament, his grandfather a former Russian ambassador to Poland. Born in Moscow, the physics graduate started out as a tech entrepreneur, transferring his skills to the oil and gas industry. In his 20s, he worked with Yukos Oil, then chaired by Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the oligarch now exiled in London. As he recounts in his book, he later worked with a TV company, almost striking a business deal with CNN that was scuppered by Putin. Such was his frustration that he decided to enter politics. In 2007, at the age of 32, he entered the Duma, elected on the ticket of Just Russia, a social-democratic party within the Kremlin-approved “systemic opposition”. Even so, Ponomarev stuck his neck out, invoking the “crooks and thieves” epithet for the ruling party that had earlier been popularised by Alexey Navalny, the opposition leader now behind bars. In 2012, he and fellow party member Dmitry Gudkov played a prominent role in the “white ribbon” street protests against Putin, decrying the alleged rigging of the 2011 parliamentary and 2012 presidential elections. The following year, he refused to support a law banning “gay propaganda”. However, Ponomarev definitively crossed the Rubicon when he voted against the annexation of Crimea in 2014. He was captured on camera, refusing to stand and applaud when Putin referred to “national traitors” – a term used by Adolf Hitler in Mein Kampf – in a key speech. That image was printed on giant pro-government street banners that also featured Navalny; Boris Nemtsov, who would later be assassinated; and other dissidents with the words “Aliens among us” emblazoned below. By 2016, he went into exile in Ukraine. Since Russia’s invasion began in early 2022, he has positioned himself as the public face of pro-Ukraine Russians, speaking not only for the Freedom of Russia Legion (FRL) in Ukraine but also theNational Republican Army(NRA), a secretive network of partisans allegedly operating within Russia. Ponomarev also set up a wartime Russian-language opposition TV channel, calling it February Morning, in reference to when the war began. He used it as a platform to announce the NRA’s claim of responsibility for last year’s assassination ofDarya Dugina, the daughter of one of Putin’s close political allies, on the outskirts of Moscow. US intelligence had blamed the car bombing on Ukrainian forces. Still, within Russia, he remains relatively unknown. “Average Russians don’t know much about what Ponomarev is doing right now because there is heavy propaganda, and it’s not within Putin’s interests to popularise or advertise him,” said Natia Seskuria, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank. The FRL is one of two Russian groups working within Ukraine to bring down Putin’s government. The other one being theRussian Volunteer Corps(RVC). While both share the same aim, they are ideologically different. The RVC is commanded by a known Nazi close to the local Azov regiment, an ultra-nationalist volunteer military unit. Last May, the FRL and the RVC shocked the world with their joint cross-border raids on western Russia’s Belgorod region. It was the first time that partisans had entered Russia during the Ukraine war. Footage of the attacks showed a Russian officer lying face down in a pool of blood next to Russian passports at a border checkpoint in the town of Grayvoron. Ponomarev said Ukraine’s military intelligence is supporting his coup efforts. This year, he claimed a role in adrone attackon the Kremlin, saying his group had helped to smuggle the devices over the border. He also has suggested he was involved in the assassinations of war bloggerVladlen Tatarskyand pro-Kremlin novelistZakhar Prilepin. But many treat his claims with scepticism. “He’s got no kind of background in military or covert operations. He’s entirely dependent on the Ukrainians. Probably Ukraine’s quite happy for him to kind of try and claim credit,” said Roland Oliphant, senior foreign correspondent with The Telegraph who reported from Moscow for a decade. The FRL is steered by the Congress of People’s Deputies, a shadow parliament of sorts that Ponomarev helped to set up. Based in Poland with members inside and outside Russia, it is hoping for Putin’s government to collapse and is working on a transition plan and new constitution. Congress leaders include Mark Feygin, a former lawmaker and lawyer who represented thePussy Riotfeminist, anti-Putin punk band. But the body lacks big names, like Navalny and chess grandmaster-turned-political activist Garry Kasparov, who are not keen on the FRL’s violent tactics. Ponomarev hopes to build a force that can march on Moscow. Could he succeed whereWagner Group chief Yevgeny Prigozhinfailed? The late Russian mercenary chief, who led the onslaught on Ukraine but fell out with Russian army leaders, staged a spectacular mutiny against the Kremlin in June, taking control of Russia’s military headquarters in Rostov-on-Don. He quickly called off the revolt, relocating to Belarus before dying in a mysterious plane crash two months later. “The power of Prigozhin was that he had all these nationalist Russian credentials. He’d led a force in Ukraine. He was clearly pro-war. He was clearly not a national traitor. I think that’s quite important to Russians,” Oliphant said. Stationed on enemy territory, Ponomarev has a bit of a PR problem. As Oliphant pointed out, he lacks elite support to mount a coup, particularly within the security services. “Are any of those guys in the FSB [Federal Security Service] and FSO [Federal Protective Service] and a whole string of other agencies going to do a coup on behalf of this self-proclaimed liberal who fled to Ukraine?” According to Seskuria, the Kremlin has quickly buried memories of Prigozhin’s coup. “A lot of things have changed, and the regime has become more ruthless,” she said. “The stakes are so high that I don’t really think Russians are ready now to speak out or go out onto the streets and protest.” Now on Russia’s “terror” list, Ponomarev has turned himself into a highly visible target.  But it doesn’t look like he’ll be sticking his “aspen stake” into the regime’s heart any time soon. “Maybe he thinks that he’s going to ride into Moscow on the back of an American or Ukrainian tank,” Oliphant said. “I think that’s the only way he’d get there to be honest.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/8/who-is-ilya-ponomarev-the-anti-war-russian-renegade-exiled-in-ukraine

Ukraine mounts acts of sabotage in Siberia to staunch Russian artillery,Russia has arrested a Belarusian man it accuses of bombing two fuel trains on behalf of Ukraine’s secret services.,"The past week of Russia’s war in Ukraine was remarkable, chiefly for something that happened thousands of kilometres to the east of a hardened battlefront. In an apparent sabotage operation of breathtaking audacity, Ukrainian operatives blew up two freight trains in east Siberia travelling on a track believed to be used to shuttle North Korean-made ordnance to the Russian front lines in Ukraine. Details were sketchy, but some facts have emerged. A freight train caught fire in the 15km-long (9.3-mile) Severomuysky Tunnel in the Republic of Buryatia on the night of November 29, the East Siberian Transport Prosecutor’s office reported. Ukrainian media cited intelligence sources as saying four explosive devices had been planted on the railway, one of two rail links between Russia and China, reportedly also used for ferrying ammunition. “During the movement of the freight train, four explosive devices went off,” the Ukrainian intelligence source was quoted as saying. “Now the [Russian Federal Security Service] FSB is working on the spot, railway workers are unsuccessfully trying to minimise the consequences of the SBU special operation,” the source said, referring to the Security Service of Ukraine by its acronym. The train in question was believed to be carrying 44 cars of refined fuel. At least three were destroyed. A successful detonation might have disabled the tunnel, and that indeed appeared to be the goal of the saboteurs, who told Ukrainian media the route was “paralysed”. On Thursday, the FSB arrested a Belarusian man it said planted the train explosives on behalf of Ukraine’s SBU. Calling the incident a “terrorist act”, Moscow said the detained man’s handler was a Lithuania-based Belarusian linked to Ukraine’s secret services. Russian media said “the explosion seriously damaged the rails, and the leaked fuel flooded them”. Expecting trains to be rerouted through a northern pass of the Baikal-Amur track, the SBU apparently staged a second explosion on a second fuel train as it passed over a bridge in an unspecified location. Four fuel tanks were destroyed and another two were damaged. Ukraine has every reason to disable Russia’s rail links with China. North Korea is believed to have sent Russia more than a million artillery shells to discharge in Ukraine. Satellite images the Washington Post published on October 16 suggested that two Russian ships had successfully transported cargo from the North Korean free trade zone port of Rason to Russia’s port of Dunai several times since August. From Dunai, the containers would most likely traverse the vast Russian landmass via rail. A Washington Post analysis suggested shipments began in mid-August, and US National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby confirmed on October 13 that as many as 1,000 containers’ worth of North Korean weapons had reached Russia between September 7 and October 1. Ukraine was also continuing to focus on disrupting Russian supply routes in Crimea. The Russian defence ministry said electronic warfare systems and air defences downed a total of 35 Ukrainian drones targeting the port of Feodosia in east Crimea on December 1. “Apparently, the Ukrainian Armed Forces intended to hit the oil depot and power plant in the city,” said one Russian report. It was not clear if any drones struck their targets. Russia launched more drones against Ukraine during the week – a total of 83 from November 30 to December 5. Ukraine’s air force said it downed 62 of them. Ukrainian Air Force spokesman Yuriy Ignat said Russia had increased its own production of Iranian-designed Shahed drones, and they were likely to be Russia’s main weapon targeting Ukrainian energy infrastructure during winter. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also expected an intense Russian air campaign this winter targeting electricity and water utilities, he said in an interview with the AP. Resources were one principal criterion for success in the war, resolve was the other, said Nigel Gould-Davies, chief Eurasia analyst for the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), a London-based think tank. He was speaking at the launch of the IISS’s flagship annual publication, the Armed Conflict Survey. “The GDP [gross domestic product] of the West vastly exceeds Russia’s by a factor of 12,” said Gould-Davies. “But … there are growing signs now, and more have appeared in the last few days, that… the West may be inferior in resolve. We have budget struggles in the [US] House [of Representatives] and now the [US] Senate and the EU is increasingly wrangling over budgetary support for Ukraine,” he said. House and Senate Republicans have been insisting on tying military aid for Ukraine to strengthening border security with Mexico, and a socially conservative agenda. Zelenskyy told the AP these tensions were frustrating, but he “can’t complain too much”. “Look, we are not backing down, I am satisfied. We are fighting with the second (best) army in the world, I am satisfied,” he told the AP, referring to the Russian military. He added: “We are losing people, I’m not satisfied. We didn’t get all the weapons we wanted, I can’t be satisfied, but I also can’t complain too much.” But there were also signs of dissatisfaction in Russia. A Russian opposition polling organisation,Chronicles, published a survey on November 30 suggesting that Russians who supported the war, opposed any withdrawal of troops before military aims had been achieved and supported heightened military spending had nearly halved during the year, from 22 percent to 12 percent. A consistent 39-40 percent during 2023 supported a withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine without Russia achieving its war aims.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/7/ukraine-mounts-acts-of-sabotage-in-siberia-to-staunch-russian-artillery
Republicans block Ukraine funding over US-Mexico border despite Biden pleas,"The Kremlin has celebrated the gridlock, saying it hopes US lawmakers will keep axing Biden’s aid plan.","Republican senators in the United States have blocked $106bn in new funding for Ukraine and Israel, rejecting appeals from President Joe Biden amid anger over the exclusion of immigration reforms they had demanded as part of the package. Biden had earlier warned of dire consequences for Kyiv – and a “gift” to Russia’s Vladimir Putin – if Congress failed to pass the measure, which includes about $61bn to help Ukraine keep up pressure on Russia during the freezing winter months, as well as help for Israel and Gaza. “They’re willing to literally kneecap Ukraine on the battlefield and damage our national security in the process,” Biden said. The entire 49-strong Republican minority in the upper chamber voted against the proposal, pointing to a lack of government action on the estimated 10,000 migrantscrossingfrom Mexico into the US every day. “Everyone has been very, very clear on this to say we’re standing firm. Now is the moment,” Senator James Lankford, a lead Republican negotiator on immigration and border issues, told Fox Business ahead of the vote. “We’re completely out of control at the southern border, and it’s time to resolve this.” Citing aid for Israel, independent senator Bernie Sanders also voted against the bill, which needed 60 votes to pass. The Kremlin celebrated the gridlock in Congress, saying it hoped lawmakers would keep shutting down the White House’s aid request. “It is to be hoped that there remain enough people with sober minds among American congressmen,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday. Peskov added that the White House was trying to “scorch the money of American citizens in the furnace of the Ukrainian war”. Biden had previously pleaded with Republicans over the package, warning that a victory for Russia over Ukraine would leave Moscow in a position to attack NATO allies and draw US troops into a war. “If Putin takes Ukraine, he won’t stop there,” Biden said. Putin will attack a NATO ally, he predicted, and then “we’ll have something that we don’t seek and that we don’t have today: American troops fighting Russian troops”, Biden said. “We can’t let Putin win,” he said. Border security with Mexico has emerged as a major stumbling block to continued support for Ukraine, even as the White House warned this week that funds designated for providing aid to Ukraine wouldrun outby the end of the year. House and Senate Republicans are backing renewed construction of a border wall, former President Donald Trump’s signature policy, while deeming large numbers of migrants ineligible for asylum and reviving a controversial policy under which asylum seekers are told to remain in Mexico while their immigration case is heard. Biden said he was willing to make “significant” compromises on the border issue but said Republicans would not get everything they wanted. He did not provide details. “This has to be a negotiation,” he said. Biden, who had discussed Ukraine in a virtual summit with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and G7 leaders earlier on Wednesday, said the US and its allies were prepared to continue supporting Ukraine in its 22-month war against Russia, which currently occupies about a fifth of Ukrainian territory. Zelenskyy warned the G7 that Moscow was counting on Western unity to “collapse” and said Russia had ramped up pressure on the front lines of the conflict. The precarious prospects for the aid package had been clear since a classified Ukraine briefing for senators on Tuesday saw several Republicans walk out, angry that there was no talk of border security. Zelenskyy had been due to address the meeting via video link but cancelled at the last minute. Senators of both parties have acknowledged the need to move quickly to secure a deal given that Congress has just a handful more days in session before the end of the year. Republican negotiators were expected to send a new proposal to Democrats after the failed vote. The president’s willingness to directly engage on the issue carried some political risk with some Democrats and migrant advocates urging him to reject sweeping conservative demands on immigration – which they say are akin to closing the border. House Speaker Mike Johnson, who voted against aid to Kyiv before he took on the job, has made clear he will not agree to send any more money without “transformative” changes to border policy. “The American people deserve nothing less,” Johnson said in a statement. The Louisiana Republican has also declared that any Israel aid needs to be offset with spending cuts, a policy Democrats, the White House and most Senate Republicans oppose. Even amid the disagreement over the new funding package, the US unveiled aid for Kyiv worth $175m from the dwindling supply of money that has already been approved. It includesHIMARS rockets, shells, missiles and ammunition.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/7/republicans-block-ukraine-funding-over-us-mexico-border-despite-biden-pleas

Pro-Russian former Ukrainian parliamentarian shot dead near Moscow,"Illia Kyva, declared a traitor by Ukraine, has been shot dead in a park in Odintsovo region in the southwest of Moscow.","A former pro-Russian member of Ukraine’s parliament has been shot dead near Moscow in an assassination claimed by Kyiv. Illia Kyva, declared a traitor by Ukraine, was shot dead in a park in the Odintsovo region southwest of Moscow on Wednesday. Russian investigators said they have opened an investigation and a hunt for the suspect. “An unknown person fired shots at the victim from an unidentified weapon. The man died on the spot from his injuries,” Russia’s Investigative Committee said in a statement. News agencies, including Reuters and AFP, quoted sources saying Kyva was killed by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU).    Kyva was a member of Ukraine’s parliament before Moscow invaded in February 2022, but had been in Russia throughout the war and frequently criticised Ukrainian authorities online. He had been sentenced in absentia by a Ukrainian court to 14 years in prison for charges including treason and incitement to violence. The day before Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, Kyva said the country had been “soaked by Nazism” and needed “liberating” by Russia – echoing talking points regularly advanced by Russian officials and on state TV. Speaking on national TV, Ukraine’s military intelligence spokesperson Andriy Yusov said: “We can confirm that Kyva is done. Such a fate will befall other traitors of Ukraine, as well as the henchmen of the [Russian President Vladimir] Putin regime.” Yusov did not say who was behind the assassination. In a separate incident, a proxy lawmaker in Ukraine’s eastern Luhansk region was also killed in a car bombing attack on Wednesday, Russian investigators said. Oleg Popov, who served as a deputy in the pro-Moscow Luhansk regional parliament, was killed after the “detonation of an unidentified device in a car”, Russia’s Investigative Committee said, without providing more details.    Kyiv used to rarely comment on whether it was behind the killings of pro-Russian figures, both inside Russia and in parts of Ukraine occupied by Russian forces. But lately, it has started to claim responsibility for a number ofattacksand openly threatened to hunt down other “collaborators” and “traitors”. Moscow has previously said Ukrainewas behindother audacious assassinations deep inside Russia’s borders. In August 2022, Russian nationalist Darya Dugina was killed outside Moscow in a car bombing, while an explosion at a Saint Petersburg cafe in April killed Russian military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky. Ukraine has not publicly claimed responsibility for those attacks, though US intelligence and media reports have linked Kyiv to them. Several lower-ranking Ukrainian officials and politicians who have welcomed Russia’s invasion and worked for Russian-backed authorities in occupied parts of Ukraine have also been killed.

"Putin to visit Saudi Arabia, UAE with Israel-Hamas war on agenda","Talks expected to focus on Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and oil market cooperation, says Kremlin spokesperson.","Russian President Vladimir Putin, staking out a more influential role in the Middle East, will visit the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, and host Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in Moscow the following day. The talks will focus on bilateral relations and theIsrael-Hamas war,Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday. Peskov said that discussions on oil market cooperation will be on the agenda of talks, as Moscow cooperates with all three countries through OPEC+, which is comprised of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies led by Russia. “These discussions are held within the OPEC+ format, but of course, cooperation in this area is always on the agenda,” said Peskov. The OPEC+ group, which Putin helped create in 2016, announcednew voluntary supply cutslast week, which met scepticism from the oil market.    Separately, Putin’s foreign policy adviser Yury Ushakov said that Saudi-Russian cooperation within the oil cooperation body was “fruitful”. “Fairly close Russian-Saudi coordination in this format is a reliable guarantee of maintaining a stable and predictable situation in the global oil market,” Ushakov said, according to Russian news agencies. Putin’s drive to bolster its ties with Gulf and other Middle Eastern states is part of his efforts to demonstrate that Western attempts to isolate Moscow throughsanctions for its war on Ukrainehave failed. The Russian leader has not made many international trips after the International Criminal Court (ICC)issued an arrest warrant for himin March, accusing Putin of deporting Ukrainian children. Neither the UAE nor Saudi Arabia have signed the ICC’s founding treaty, meaning they would not have to arrest him if he entered their territories. With regards to Israel’s current bombardment of Gaza in retaliation for Hamas’s October 7 attacks, Putin has sought to cast the war as a failure of U.S. diplomacy, charging that Washington had opted for economic “handouts” to the Palestinians and abandoned efforts to help create a Palestinian state. He has suggested Moscow could play the role of mediator, thanks to its friendly ties with both Israel and the Palestinians, saying that “no one could suspect us of playing up to one party.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/5/putin-to-visit-saudi-arabia-uae-with-israel-hamas-war-on-agenda
Deputy Russian army commander killed in Ukraine: Official,The governor of Russia’s Voronezh region says Vladimir Zavadsky died at a combat post in the ‘special operation zone’.,"The deputy commander of Russia’s 14th Army Corps, Major-General Vladimir Zavadsky, has been killed in Ukraine, a top regional official confirmed. Zavadsky died “at a combat post in the special operation zone”, Alexander Gusev, the governor of Russia’s Voronezh region, said on Monday without providing any further details. The “special military operation” is the term Russia uses to describe the war in Ukraine, which it launched in February 2022. Gusev paid tribute to Zavadsky, calling him “a courageous officer, a real general and a worthy man”. Zavadsky’s death marked the seventh major-general confirmed dead by Russia, making him the 12th senior officer reported deceased since theonset of the war, investigative news outlet iStories reported. Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Ukrainian authorities reported that their military successfully downed 10 out of 17 attack drones launched by Russia overnight. According to the governor of Ukraine’s Lviv region, three drones targeted unspecified infrastructure, causing minimal damage with no reported casualties. Kyiv’s air force stated the drones were intercepted across “various regions”. Simultaneously, six S-300 missiles were reportedly launched at civilian targets in eastern Donetsk and southern Kherson. At the same time, Russian officials claimed their forces neutralised at least 35 Ukrainian drones. “An attempt by the Kyiv regime to commit a terrorist attack with aerial drones … was foiled last night,” the Russian Ministry of Defence said in a statement on Tuesday, adding that “22 Ukrainian drones were destroyed and 13 others were intercepted over the Sea of Azov and Crimea”. “A new attack attempt by the Kyiv regime” on Tuesday morning saw four Ukrainian drones shot down and two intercepted over the Sea of Azov, the ministry said in a separate statement. TheCrimean Peninsula, annexed by Russia in 2014, serves as the headquarters for Russia’s Black Sea Fleet and a vital supply route for their forces in southern and eastern Ukraine. The region is frequently subject to attacks from Ukrainian forces.   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/5/deputy-russian-army-commander-killed-in-ukraine-official
US and EU struggle to agree on funding for Ukraine,Concern is growing over Ukraine’s ability to continue its defence against Russia should delays of Western funds persist.,"Uncertainty is growing over Western backing for Ukraine amid Russia’s intensifying campaign to knock out the country’s energy infrastructure. The White House has warned the United States Congress that funds designated for providing aid to Ukraine would run out by the end of the year, in a letter made public on Monday. The European Union is also facing difficulties in agreeing on a new 50 billion euro ($54bn) lifeline for Kyiv. “I want to be clear: without congressional action, by the end of the year we will run out of resources to procure more weapons and equipment for Ukraine,” the director of the US Office of Management and Budget, Shalanda Young, wrote in a letter to House SpeakerMike Johnson. In the face of an upcoming harsh winter of intensifying Russian assaults on civilian infrastructure, the lack of funding could mean defeat for Ukraine, warned the budget director. “If Ukraine’s economy collapses, they will not be able to keep fighting, full stop,” she wrote. The USnarrowly averteda government shutdown last month, with a last-minute bill keeping federal agencies funded through the new year, but leaving out key foreign aid initiatives. The US, Ukraine’s biggest single-country donor, has sent more than $40bn in aid sinceRussia’s invasionin February 2022. In October, US PresidentJoe Bidenasked Congress to approve$105bn in nationalsecurity funding, which would include support for Ukraine. But right-wing congressional Republicans have expressedincreasing scepticismtowards approving more funds for Ukraine and some $61bn in additional aid funds are now beingheld upby the US Congress. “There is no magical pot of funding available to meet this moment. We are out of money – and nearly out of time,” Young wrote, urging Congress to act “now”. At the same time, the EU is struggling to pass its own funding package, which would be part of the bloc’s future joint budget. Hungary has led arguments against the package. Prime Minister Viktor Orban has ploughed a pro-Russian furrow since Moscow’s invasion. He is also thought to be hoping to use his threat to block the plan to try to unfreeze 22 billion euros ($24bn) in funding for Budapest that Brussels is holding due to rule-of-law issues. The victory of the far-right in the recent Netherlands election and fiscal challenges in Germany are also complicating negotiations over the budget, the Financial Times reported on Sunday. The delay is endangering crucial pledges to Kyiv made months ago. A budget agreement would be “very, very difficult”, a senior official said. The 50 billion euro ($54bn) instrument proposed is designed to keep Kyiv solvent to 2027. A failure to approve long-term funding, as well as a separate 20 billion euro ($22bn) facility for weapons purchases, would hit Kyiv hard as the war grinds on. Olha Stefanishyna, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister for European and Euro-Atlantic integration, last week described the EU summit as an “existential moment” for her country. The difficulties in securing the funds in Washington and Brussels have raised concerns in Kyiv that Western backers are experiencing “fatigue” with the drawn-out battle as fighting on the front line becomes bogged down in what some see as a “stalemate“. As Russia continues its campaign targeting civilians and infrastructure in indiscriminate bombings and drone attacks, Ukraine announced a 450 million euro ($489m) expansion of a wind farm in its Mykolaiv region on Monday at the United Nations COP28 climate talks. Ukrainian officials highlighted how its turbines would be spread far enough apart to survive any Russian missile attacks. Also speaking at the climate summit, US Assistant Secretary of State for Energy Resources Geoffrey R Pyatt denounced Russia’s targeting of energy infrastructure in the war, saying that Russian President Vladimir Putin “has made energy one of his weapons”. Pyatt, a former US ambassador to Ukraine, said that Putin has “done that with his drone and missile attacks on civilian energy infrastructure. He’s done that by turning off the gas pipelines in order to try to weaken Europe’s resolve to support the Ukrainians…” “For Vladimir Putin, energy is just about as much a part of his war strategy as are his tanks and his missiles,” he said. Russia has spent recent weeks launching dozens of attack drones and missiles at Ukraine in overnight raids targeting energy facilities and military sites. Ukraine’s air force said on Monday that it had shot down 18 out of 23 Iranian-made Shahed drones and one missile. Meanwhile, Russia was reported to have intensified attacks from new directions on the industrial town of Avdiivka on Monday. “The launching of new directions proves that the enemy has been given a command to capture the city at any cost,” Ukrainian officials said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/4/us-and-eu-struggle-to-agree-on-funding-for-ukraine
"Russia boosts size of armed forces by 170,000 troops",President Putin’s decree takes number of Russian service personnel to 1.32 million amid continuing Ukraine war.,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered the country’s military to increase the maximum number of troops by nearly 170,000 people, as Moscow’sinvasion of Ukrainecontinues into its 22nd month. Putin’s decree was released by the Kremlin on Friday and took force immediately. It brings the strength of the armed forces to 1.32 million service personnel and increases the overall number of Russian military personnel to about 2.2 million. “The increase in the full-time strength of the armed forces is due to the growing threats to our country associated with the special military operation and the ongoing expansion of NATO,” the Russian Ministry of Defence said in a statement. It said the order does not imply any “significant expansion of conscription”, and that the increase would happen gradually by recruiting more volunteers. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, now deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, said on Friday that more than 452,000 people were recruited to the military under contract from January 1 to December 1, 2023. NATO’s “joint armed forces are being built up near Russia’s borders and additional air defence systems and strike weapons are being deployed. The potential of NATO’s tactical nuclear forces is being increased,” the ministry statement read. Boosting Russian troops was an appropriate response to “the aggressive activities of the NATO bloc”, the ministry added.    This is the second such expansion of the army since 2018. The previous boost of 137,000 troops, ordered by Putin in August 2022, put the military’s numbers at about two million personnel and about 1.15 million troops. Last December, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu declared that the country needed a force of 1.5 million “to guarantee the fulfilment of tasks to ensure Russia’s security”. He didn’t say when the military would reach that size. The Kremlin previously considered the size of its military as sufficient, but the calculus changed after hopes for a quick victory over Ukraine – which Russia invaded in February 2022 – were shattered by fierce resistance. Russia had undertaken various efforts to give a boost to its army – including drafting conscripts, mobilising reservists, forming volunteer battalions and running campaigns to entice more men to enlist. Some media reports and rights groups say the Russian authorities have also offered amnesty to some prisoners in exchange for a tour of military duty. All Russian men from age 18 to 27 (or age 18-30 starting on January 1, 2024) must serve one year in the military. However, a large number avoid the draft for health reasons or deferments granted to university students.

Moscow accuses Russian-Italian national of Ukrainian-ordered bomb attacks,The FSB said that the suspect was trained by special forces of NATO member Latvia to bomb a railway and military base.,"Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) has arrested a man with dual Russian-Italian citizenship for conducting sabotage operations for Ukrainian military intelligence. Moscow said on Friday that the suspect had carried out bomb attacks on railways after being recruited by Kyiv earlier this year. Infrastructure and production facilities across Russia have been damaged in unclaimed attacks since its military forces invaded Ukraine in February 2022, with investigators opening dozens of cases. The suspect is accused of planting explosives to derail a 15-carriage train in the Ryazan region, southeast of the capital, in early November. The FSB also says that he bombed the Dyagilevo military airfield in July, according to state news agency TASS. “The perpetrator turned out to be a resident of the Ryazan Region born in 1988 with Russian and Italian citizenship. The detainee gave confessionary evidence during his questioning,” the FSB’s Investigative Committee said in a statement. The intelligence agency said that the suspect was recruited by Ukrainian military intelligence in Istanbul in February. He then received sabotage training from Latvian special services in the EU and NATO member state, it added. The statement also said that a search of the suspect’s home unearthed explosives and other bomb-making equipment, and investigations are under way to establish his role in other acts of sabotage. The highest profile Ukrainian attack on Russian infrastructure since the start of the war came in October 2022, when the Kerch Strait Bridge, linking the Crimean Peninsula with Russia, wasbombed. Shortly after the blast, the FSB arrested five Russians and three others, who were citizens of Ukraine and Armenia. Sources claimed on Thursday that the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) had bombed a railway line in Siberia, illustrating its reach deep inside Russia. The attack paralysed “the only serious railroad connection between Russia and China,” used by Moscow for military supplies, the Espreso TV website reported. Russia is also busy targeting Ukrainian infrastructure and has raised the level of drone and missile attacks as winter approaches. While the war on the front lines has become bogged down, Moscow’s forces aim to repeat the tactic of last year, when strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure plunged the country into the cold and dark for extended periods. The Ukrainian military reported on Friday that it had shot down 18 of 25 attack drones, and one of two cruise missiles launched against the country by Russia overnight, mainly targeting southern and eastern regions. Ukrainian air defence systems have been boosted with Western weapons since last winter, but Kyiv continues to stress that it needs more supplies to withstand the barrage.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/1/moscow-accuses-russian-italian-national-of-ukrainian-ordered-bomb-attacks
"A hard, bloody winter awaits Ukrainian and Russian soldiers, say experts","Neither side is ready to give up, and neither can win in the medium term, but negotiations could come next year.","This winter is likely to see a long and bloody stalemate in Ukraine, with neither side backing down from offensives and counteroffensives, but may sow the seed of negotiations next year, experts tell Al Jazeera. “The winter is just going to reinforce the misery … neither side is going to have a tactical or operational breakthrough,” retired colonel Seth Krummrich, now vice president at Global Guardian, a security consultancy, told Al Jazeera. Ukraine launched a major counteroffensive in early June that by some estimates took back half the land Russia had seized earlier in the year. But it failed in its strategic objective of cutting Russian forces in two, isolating Kherson, Zaporizhia and Crimea from Luhansk, Donetsk and Kharkiv. Ukrainian senior commanders have said the counteroffensive will continue through the winter. Last month Russia attempted to answer with a new set of offensives in the east – headed towards the cities of Kupiansk, Lyman, Avdiivka and Mariinka. None has succeeded, but Russia has continued the assaults despite snow and frost, asevidencednear Kupiansk on November 21. “I think they’re going to try to push through in the winter,” said Krummrich. “The ground freezes, [they’ll] try to make some moves because they’re desperate. I don’t mean the Ukrainians. I mean the Russians. The soldiers won’t want to do it. It will be a disaster. There will be more dead bodies,” he said. That is already evident. Ukraine’s armed forces estimate 6,260 Russian deaths in the week of November 20-26, an average of almost 1,000 a day – the result of relentless Russian attacks in the east. “This is a war that lacks high strategy,” Konstantinos Grivas, who teaches weapons systems and geopolitics at the Hellenic Army Academy, told Al Jazeera. “Russia became trapped in an attrition war, which has its own logic … it’s a war on autopilot.”  Both sides have failed to come up with a technological or tactical advantage that would produce a breakthrough because defence is dominant, said Grivas. “Firepower and passive defences – minefields, trenches for instance – seem to have neutralised the capabilities of mechanised and airborne forces,” said Grivas. “If there is a critical development it will be a collapse due to exhaustion – like a boxing match where one fighter simply can’t take the blows, but not from a knock-out punch.” Both sides have had strategies for success, but all have so far been parried. Russia had hoped for a quick collapse of the Ukrainian armed forces when it invaded in February 2022. When that failed, it rained down some 10,000 missiles on Ukraine’s cities to break the country’s will to fight. Last winter Russia targeted power stations, causing outages, and in July it started targeting port infrastructure to stop the export of Ukrainian grain. Ukraine’s Western allies responded with air defence systems, spare parts and emergency generators to keep Ukraine’s power flowing. They provided medium-range missiles Ukraine combined with its domestically manufactured drones to drive Russian naval power back to its own shores, creating a safe passage for merchant shipping. Ukraine tried its own offensive strategies. It used these ranged weapons to strike deep in the Russian rear to disrupt the supply of weapons to the front, but Russia moved its stockpiles out of range and found delivery byways. Ukraine has sent drones to attack Russian missile manufacturing sites and Moscow itself, but their payloads were too small to do much damage.  Ukraine has most recently asked for F-16 fighter planes, which some NATO members have agreed to supply, but it is doubtful these will be a stalemate-breaker either, say experts. “Even if they get F-16s, they won’t be able to use them effectively because these planes need thousands of hours [of training] in flight to become operational,” Andreas Iliopoulos, a former deputy commander of the Hellenic Army, told Al Jazeera. “They won’t be effective until 2025.” “I think all this is a Ukrainian effort to continue to claim Western help and stave off fatigue and the pressure to negotiate,” said Grivas. Ukraine’s allies banned Russian oil, gold, diamonds, lumber and other lucrative exports to starve the Russian economy, but Russia sold its oil at discounted rates to China, India and other markets. Sanctions also attempted to stop the flow of capital and sensitive technologies to Russia. But Russia has been manufacturing weapons and buying artillery shells and drones from pariah states that share its hatred of the United States – Iran and North Korea. Last August, Ukrainian intelligence estimated Russia had about 585 missiles of various types left, but planned to build more than 100 a month. This month, the Ukrainian military said, Russia had stockpiled more than 800 missiles in Crimea alone and was preparing to fire them. Russia’s ability to keep up its stockpiles and to draw on large reserves of manpower has led some observers to suggest that time is on its side. “Ukraine was likely to lose in a protracted war of attrition, because it would be an unfair fight,” wrote John Mearsheimer, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago, in a recent opinion piece entitled “Bound to Lose”. “I keep hearing people say, he’s going to wear out the Ukrainians. That’s not going to happen with a conscript army that doesn’t want to be there,” said Krummrich, who has fought in special operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and believes Russian soldier morale is breaking down. “Every single wave of soldiers that somehow survives and goes home, they’re telling everybody they can, ‘for the love of God, do not get pulled out to Ukraine’,” said Krummrich. Recent reports suggest a growing number of Russian soldiers want to go home.  While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has forsworn any negotiations while Russia sits on Ukrainian soil, Russia has been more nuanced. “Russia has never refused peace talks with Ukraine,” Russian President Vladimir Putin told the Group of 20 on November 21. “Of course, we should think about how to stop this tragedy.” “I think he is messaging again, ‘Hey, I need a way out’. When he got involved in this … he did not have a plan for this situation,” Krummrich said. “I think the secret desire of both is how to get out and who is going to negotiations first,” Grivas said. But is it likely to happen this winter? Both sides are demonstrating a will to fight, for now. Putin may be looking for a symbolic victory ahead of an election next April, and other fissures in the Western alliance, say experts, particularly if former President Donald Trump seems likely to win the US presidential election. “What’s going to happen to the American election … Trump and what the Republicans represent does not help Ukraine, and could potentially make things easier for Russia,” said Krummrich. Congressional Republicans loyal to Trump have led an effort this year to staunch the flow of military aid to Ukraine, saying the US deficit is too high. Even if Ukraine is eventually partitioned, some people believe Russia will suffer a greater loss. “Russia is headed for a big defeat. Its victory would be a catastrophe, because it is being isolated from the rest of Europe, a big blow to its existential core,” said Grivas. “It is being Asianised. The winner is China and the other Eurasian powers, who are able to instrumentalise Russia for the ends of their foreign policies,” he said.

"Russian air strikes injure 10 in Donetsk, Ukraine says",The strikes come as Russia intensifies its attacks in the east and claims to capture the contested village of Khromove.,"Russian missile strikes have injured 10 people and left several unaccounted for in Donetsk, Ukrainian officials said, as attacks intensify in the embattled eastern region. The overnight shelling hurt 10 people, including four children, in several villages in Donetsk, Ukraine’s Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said on Thursday. He said a family with two children, as well as two 13-year-olds, were among the injured. “Five more people are being searched for under the rubble,” the minister added. Later, Donetsk authorities said rescuers found one body while four others, including one child, were still under the rubble. An apartment block, nine private houses, a police station, cars and garages were damaged in the villages of Pokrovsk, Novogrodivka and Myrnograd. Klymenko said a police paramedic helped a man with an injured baby get out from under the rubble. The attacks come as Russia steps up the fighting in Donetsk, of which it occupies most parts and says it intends to take over completely. Some of the most intense fighting in recent weeks has been waged in the front-line town of Avdiivka. On Wednesday, Russia said it had captured another contested village in the Donetsk region – Khromove – in what would be a rare advance after weeks of mostly gridlock. Ukrainian officials offered no comment but said Moscow’s forces were suffering heavy losses while launching fierce attacks. Unofficial accounts and bloggers acknowledged that part of the village was held by Russian forces, but dismissed any notion it was fully under Russian control. Ukrainian military spokesperson Oleksandr Shtupun said Russia’s attacks were growing more intense, with air strikes doubling and waves of up to 20 armoured vehicles pushing towards Ukrainian lines. However, he insisted Ukraine was repelling the assaults. Neither Russia nor Ukraine has made significant breakthroughs on the battlefield for weeks as Moscow’s invasion drags into the 22nd month. Ukraine, which has counted on aid and ammunition from Western allies, is pushing its backers to keep up the support amid funding delays from the United States and Europe. “We have to continue, we have to keep fighting. Ukraine is not going to back down,” Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s minister of foreign affairs, said at a summit of NATO ministers in Brussels on Wednesday. “The issue here is not just Ukraine’s security, it is the security and safety of the entire Euro-Atlantic space.” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, also attending the summit, confirmed NATO would back Ukraine for as long as it takes. “The answer here today at NATO is clear and it’s unwavering. We must and we will continue to support Ukraine,” Blinken said.   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/30/russian-air-strikes-injure-10-in-donetsk-ukraine-says
Russia to require foreigners to sign ‘loyalty agreement’,Visitors would be required to respect Russian values and laws that ensure the country’s national interest.,"Russia is reported to be preparing to introduce laws that would require foreign visitors to sign a “loyalty agreement”. The interior ministry is preparing the legislation that would bar visitors from criticising Russian policy or discrediting Soviet history. It would also require that they respect traditional Russian family values, culture and environment, state news agency TASS reported on Wednesday. All foreigners would have to sign the pledge, which would, in effect, control what they can say and do while in Russia. This means visitors would be prohibited from “interfering with the activities of public authorities of the Russian Federation, discrediting in any form the foreign and domestic state policy of the Russian Federation, public authorities and their officials,” the report said. For the draft to become law, the document has to be introduced to the State Duma, Russia’s lower house of parliament, and to go through committee review and several readings before being submitted to President Vladimir Putin for signing. Officials told state news agency Interfax that the legislation is being worked on by the interior ministry, the government, and the presidential administration and is well advanced. Lieutenant General Valentina Kazakova, head of the ministry’s Main Directorate for Migration, told TASS, “The bill is currently under discussion and will be submitted to the State Duma shortly.” In particular, foreigners would be barred from “distorting the historical truth about the feat of the Soviet people in the defence of the Fatherland and its contribution to the victory over fascism,” the draft bill reads, according to TASS. Thetriumph over Nazism, under the Soviet leadership ofJoseph Stalin,has been constantly compared with Russia’s annexation of Crimea. Putin has utilised this historical moment as an effective tool in his resurgent war on the West and the liberal values mostly associated with it. Evencritics and scholarswithin Russia, who document his totalitarian regime’s atrocities, have lost access to Kremlin-controlled media and are branded “foreign agents”. As the 2024 presidential election approaches, Putin has cast the war as part of an existential battle with the West, saying he will defend Russia’s “sacred” civilisation from what he portrays as the West’s decadence. Under the law, foreigners would have to uphold and abide by “traditional family values”, the “institution of marriage” and “traditional sexual relations”, according to TASS. Russia under President Putin has touted itself as a country home to more conservative moral and family values, backed by theRussian Orthodox Church. To this end, the authorities have cracked down on the LGBTQ community, passing legislationoutlawinggender-affirming surgeries and banning “gay propaganda”. Lawmakers, in recent months have also been working on legislation to limit access to reproductive careand abortions as a way of improving the “demographic situation” and countering the low birth rate. “The legislative initiative proposes prohibiting activities that encourage a neglectful attitude toward Russia’s environment or natural resources … Russia’s regional and ethno-cultural diversity [and] traditional Russian moral and spiritual values,” reported TASS. Russia is one of the most ethnically diverse countries in the world with nearly 200 ethnic groups residing on the territory of the Russian Federation, according to the United Nations.

Ukraine ‘will not back down’ against Russia as it urges Western support,"‘Ukraine is not going to back down’, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tells NATO foreign ministers.","Ukraine will forge ahead in the battle against Russia’s invasion, Kyiv’s top diplomat has pledged as he seeks to rally Western support. Ukraine will not “back down” in fighting against the Russian invasion, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told a summit of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels on Wednesday, even as its military locked into a bloody stalemate with enemy forces amid signs that the provision of weapons and funding is slowing and that the war in Gaza is limiting global attention. “We have to continue, we have to keep fighting. Ukraine is not going to back down,” Kuleba said. “The issue here is not just Ukraine’s security, it is the security and safety of the entire Euro-Atlantic space.” His entreaty comes amid fears that Western fatigue is setting in over the drawn-out war, and that attention and funding is shifting to the Middle East. The United States, Ukraine’s biggest single-country donor, has sent more than $40bn in aid since Russia’s invasion in February 2022. However, some $61bn in additional aid to Ukraine is being held up by the US Congress. Another $50bn package from the European Union is struggling to pass because of opposition from Hungary, leaving Ukraine concerned about dwindling resources as it heads into the harsh winter. Despite the funding delays, Western leaders insist they will stand by Ukraine as long as it takes. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said “every single NATO member expressed enduring support for Ukraine” at Wednesday’s summit. He added that the US is looking for supplemental funding for Ukraine to be approved by Congress in the coming weeks. As well as funds, Kyiv is in desperate need of ammunition, with the West struggling to keep pace with earlier pledges to supply bullets and shells. The US is engaged in talks with Greece to buy $47m worth of artillery shells for Ukraine, which has urged partners to accelerate the delivery of ammunition. The EU has so far sent Ukraine some 300,000 of the 1 million shells it promised, Kuleba said, but it has warned that it will not be able to meet the target in full. However, Germany’s foreign minister voiced strong backing for redoubling military aid, urging for the formation of a “protective shield” that can block Russian attacks during the winter. The Ukraine-focused NATO summit comes as Russian and Ukrainian forces appear to grind to a winter deadlock 22 months into the war. On Wednesday, Ukraine’s military said it had fended off a string of overnight Russian drone and missile attacks. The air force said it destroyed nearly two dozen Russian attack drones and several missiles in the nationwide aerial assault. Russian air defence also destroyed a Ukraine-launched drone flying towards Moscow, the mayor of the capital, Sergei Sobyanin, said. Neither Russia nor Ukraine has made significant breakthroughs on the battlefield for weeks as Moscow’s invasion drags on. The conflict has killed or wounded an estimated 500,000 from both sides.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/29/ukraine-fm-vows-to-keep-fighting-while-lobbying-nato-support
"Russia unleashes assault waves on Ukraine’s Avdiivka, refugees on Nordics","Russia is losing manpower at pace, says Ukraine, whose army has been mostly on the defensive in recent days.","Russia has tried to smash through Ukraine’s eastern defences before the onset of winter, incurring huge losses during the 92nd week of the war. Between November 22 and 24, Russia unleashed what Ukraine said was the third major attempt to capture Avdiivka in two months, sending about 50 assaults supported by armour. On one day alone, Ukraine’s military said it had “eliminated” 1,100 Russian soldiers and 30 tanks. “There is an average number of eight to 16 to 18 air attacks per day. Sometimes 30. We don’t have time to count them,” Vitaliy Barabash, head of Avdiivka’s military administration, told Channel 24 television. Russian fatalities came to almost 1,000 men a day – 6,260 for the week of November 20-26, said Ukraine’s deputy defence minister Oleksandr Pavlyuk. He said 78 enemy tanks and 113 armoured combat vehicles were also destroyed in the intense fighting By Ukraine’s estimation, more than 325,000 Russian soldiers have died in the war. “The Russians are tolerant to human losses … on the other hand, this tolerance is nestled in a sense of fighting a just war,” Konstantinos Grivas, who teaches geopolitics and weapons systems at the Hellenic Army Academy, told Al Jazeera. “If that doesn’t exist, there is a social reaction … I’m not sure this traditional tolerance will apply in this war, considering also that the population is shrinking. So it will be difficult for Russia to continue to bang its head against the wall indifferent to casualties,” Grivas said. Southern forces spokesman Oleksandr Shtupun said Russian attacks were coming in waves, involving 10-20 people, similar to Ukraine’s platoon or company-sized attacks, suggesting manpower limitations. Shtupun also suggested morale was low, saying Russians were surrendering to Ukrainian forces in increasing numbers – including a dozen on November 15 and some 30 taken prisoner on November 27. Although Ukraine has said its counteroffensive would continue through the winter, its forces seemed to be busy defending from Russian attacks. The only places where Ukraine’s general staff said it was still conducting counteroffensive operations were near Robotyne, on the southern front, where it has breached Russian front-line fortifications, and on the left bank of the Dnipro river, where it has landed reconnaissance troops in force. Russia and Ukraine attacked each other in the air during the week, with Russia unleashing a record 75 Shahed drones against Kyiv on November 25 – Ukraine’s remembrance day for theHolodomor famine of 1932-33. Ukraine’s air force said it downed 74 of them, and a further eight out of nine were launched the following day. Air force spokesperson Yuri Ignat said Russia was painting its drones black and coating them in a radar-absorbent material to make them harder to detect. Ukraine planned to increase its mobile air defence units, consisting of a pick-up truck equipped with a large-calibre machine gun, anti-aircraft gun or Man-Portable Air Defence System (MANPADS). These, Ignat said, had downed a large proportion of the drones. Russia seemed to be pursuing a hybrid war through non-military means as well. Finlandon Friday closed three border crossings to Russia for a month, saying Moscow was deliberately sending asylum-seekers to create a refugee crisis. Some 900 nationals from Afghanistan, Kenya, Morocco, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen had entered Finland this month, said the Finnish Border Guard, compared with about one asylum seeker a day previously. “Intelligence information from different sources tells us that there still are people on the move … If this continues, more measures will be announced in the near future,” Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said on Monday. Finland had already closed four border crossings to Russia, and has threatened to close the remaining one – at Raja-Jooseppi, in the Arctic. Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, accused Finland of stoking “Russophobia”, but other Nordic countries have followed developments with similar concern. Latvia and Estonia said they, too, had observed an increase of asylum seekers in what Estonian Defence Minister Hanno Pevkur described as an attempt to “weaponise illegal immigration”. Both countries were considering closing their borders with Russia, as was Norwegian Prime Minister Johan Gahr Store. Some European Union members were at risk of closing their borders to Ukraine for a different reason. Slovak truckers threatened to blockade their country’s main border crossing to Ukraine beginning on December 1, if the EU didn’t limit competition from Ukrainian truckers. They were following thelead of Polish truckers, who started similar protests earlier this month and had, the previous day, blockaded a major crossing with Ukraine, creating traffic queues kilometres long. Truckers from both countries say Ukrainian hauliers are undercutting their rates and want the EU to bring back a permit system for non-EU truckers. Earlier in the year, Poland and Hungary threatened to stop the transit of Ukrainian grain through their territories if the grain was also sold in-country. They said the dumping of relatively cheap Ukrainian grain was threatening to put their farmers out of business. Both of these commercial disputes are suggestive of the problems EU leaders are likely facing in the run-up to a December summit when there will be pressure to declare Ukraine an official EU candidate. That is one of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s three declared wishes – a move that would send a powerful political signal that Europe is prepared to defend Ukraine in the long run. Zelenskyy also listed as key “victories” US Congressional approval of a $60bn military aid package and EU approval of a 19 billion euro ($21bn) military aid package, both for 2024. Russian President Vladimir Putin has already put his own military budget in place. On November 27 he signed a 70 percent increase of defence and security spending next year, to $157.5bn. Defence and security will thus represent some 39 percent of the entire Russian budget of $412bn – itself 13 percent higher than last year’s budget.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/29/russia-unleashes-assault-waves-on-ukraines-avdiivka-refugees-on-nordics
"Ukraine says Marianna Budanova, wife of military spy chief, was poisoned",Ukrainian officials say wife of Kyrylo Budanov has been hospitalised due to heavy metals poisoning.,"The wife of Ukraine’s military spy chief has been poisoned with heavy metals and is undergoing treatment, a Ukrainian official says. A spokesperson for the Ukrainian military intelligence agency, or GUR, said Marianna Budanova, wife of Kyrylo Budanov, was receiving treatment in hospital. “Yes, I can confirm the information. Unfortunately, it is true,” GUR spokesperson Andriy Yusov told the Reuters news agency on Tuesday without clarifying when the poisoning occurred or who was responsible. Budanov has become a celebrated figure in Ukraine for his role in planning clandestine operations against Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.    Yusov said this year that Budanov had survived 10 assassination attempts by Russia’s Federal Security Service, or FSB. While it is not immediately clear who was behind the suspected poisoning of his wife, the BBC’s Ukrainian service cited Yusov as saying that other GUR officials have experienced milder poisoning symptoms. The suspected poisoning was first reported by Ukrainian media. There was no immediate comment from Russian authorities. Russian media figures have speculated that the poisoning could be a result of infighting within Ukraine. Russia has previously been accused of poisoning dissidents, including politicianAlexey Navalnyand twoRussian exileswho attended a summit in Berlin organised by a critic of Russia. Moscow has also blamed Ukraine for suspected involvement in the killings of apro-war Russian bloggerand a pro-war journalist on Russian soil, something Ukraine denies.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/28/ukraine-says-marianna-budanova-wife-of-military-spy-chief-was-poisoned
Baltic foreign ministers pull out of OSCE summit over Russia invite,"Ministers of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania say presence of Sergey Lavrov risks legitimising Russian war in Ukraine.","The foreign ministers of three Baltic states have announced that they will boycott a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) after Russian Foreign MinisterSergey Lavrovwas invited to the event. In a statement on Tuesday, the officials from Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania said that a decision to invite Lavrov to attend the summit in Skopje risked legitimising Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “We deeply regret the decision enabling the personal participation of Russian Foreign Minister S. Lavrov at the 30th Session of the OSCE Ministerial Council in Skopje,” thestatementreads. “It will only provide Russia with yet another propaganda opportunity.” Separately, Oleh Nikolenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian foreign ministry, wrote in a statement on Facebook that the Ukrainian delegation would not take part in the meeting. Nikolenko said Russia had abused the rules of consensus in the organisation, resorted to “blackmail and open threats” and had also been holding three Ukrainian OSCE representatives in prison for 500 days. “In such conditions, the presence of a Russian delegation … at minister-level for the first time since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine will only deepen the crisis into which Russia has driven the OSCE,” he said. There was no immediate comment from the Russian foreign ministry.

Speaking before a gathering of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg urged members to “stay the course” in theirsupport for Ukraine, as both the United States and European Union struggle to agree on further military aid. The OSCE, a 57-member organisation first started during the Cold War with the goal of lowering tensions between East and West, has a rotating presidency currently held by North Macedonia, whose foreign minister invited Lavrov to the summit that is set to begin on Thursday. Lavrov said on Monday that he would attend, in what would be his first trip to a NATO member since Russia launched itsinvasion of Ukrainein February 2022. Speaking to reporters at NATO headquarters on Tuesday, North Macedonia’s Foreign Minister Bujar Osmani defended the decision and argued that the OSCE should be seen as a neutral forum.    “Lavrov is not coming to Skopje, in a way. Lavrov is coming to the OSCE just as he went to [the] UN in New York a few months ago,” Osmani said. “I won’t be meeting him as the foreign minister of North Macedonia, but as the OSCE chairman in office.” However, Osmani also took a firm stance on Ukraine, saying that he would tell Lavrov that “we have turned [the] OSCE into a platform for political and legal accountability of the Russian Federation for its deeds in Ukraine, and we will continue to do so”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/28/baltic-foreign-ministers-pull-out-of-osce-summit-over-russian-participation
NATO chief urges allies to ‘stay the course’ in supporting Ukraine,"Jens Stoltenberg meets alliance’s top diplomats amid some resistance in US, Europe to keep funding war against Russia.","NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg has urged members of the security alliance to continue backing Ukraine in its battle against Russia’s invasion amid opposition in the United States to a military aid package and resistance in Europe for a longer-term support plan for Kyiv. “We just have to stay the course. This is also about our security interests,” Secretary General Stoltenberg said on Tuesday at a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels. The US has provided more than $40bn in security aid to Ukraine sinceRussia’s invasionin February 2022 and pledged to back Kyiv for as long as necessary. But some $61bn in proposed US aid to Ukraine is being held up by the US Congress, while another $50bn package from the European Union is struggling to pass because of opposition from Hungary. Al Jazeera’s Step Vaessen, reporting from Brussels, said the funding delays show indications of “fatigue” from some NATO members 21 months into the war. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the two-day summit was aimed at “strongly reaffirming our support for Ukraine as it continues to face Russia’s war of aggression”. “I’m confident that the United States will continue to provide support because it is in the security interest of the United States to do so and it’s also in line with what we have agreed,” Stoltenberg said.     Stoltenberg pointed to recent pledges from Germany and the Netherlands worth 10 billion euros ($11bn) as proof that NATO remained committed to backing Kyiv. “Even though the frontline has not moved so much, the Ukrainians have been able to inflict heavy losses on the Russian forces,” he said. Concerns have ratcheted up over the future of Western backing for Ukraine as Kyiv’s top general has admitted that the fierce fighting has reached a “stalemate“. Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba will try to overcome such fatigue and lobby for continued NATO backing when he joins the summit on Wednesday. Kuleba will also work with NATO ministers to outline a plan for reforms aimed at helping Ukraine gain eventual membership in the alliance. Russia has said NATO expansionism is at the core of its grudge against bordering Ukraine, which it has repeatedlywarnednot to join the alliance. More than 500,000 troops from Russia and Ukraine areestimatedto have been killed or wounded since Moscow marched troops across its neighbour’s border in February 2022. At least 10,000 civilians have also been killed in the conflict, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine hassaid. The ministers planned to discuss Russia’s “destabilising actions” throughout the region, including allegations it has been enabling undocumented migrants to reach neighbouring Finland. Finland on Tuesday announced that it willclose its entire border with Russiato travellers for the next two weeks in a bid to halt the unusually large flow of asylum seekers to the Nordic nation, which the government and its allies called an orchestrated move by Moscow.    The ministers are likely to address theseven-week warbetween Israel and Hamas, though it is not officially on the agenda. Al Jazeera’s Vaessen said the ministers would discuss “not only the extension of the ceasefire [between Israel and Hamas] but a future for Gaza after the war is finished”. On China, Stoltenberg said: “China is not an adversary, but at the same, we must be clear-eyed about the impact of China’s coercive policies on our security.” Hanging in the background is the membership status of Sweden, which has been awaiting ratification from Turkey and Hungary for 18 months. Stoltenberg on Tuesday told Hungarian media he expected the two countries to approve Sweden’s membership bid without further delay, but gave no precise timeline. The Turkish parliament started this month to debate Sweden’s bid to join after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan launched the process following a deal at a NATO summit in July, but the legislature’s foreign affairs commission decided todelay the voteafter lawmakers expressed reservations. Turkey has demanded that Sweden take more steps to rein in local members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), considered a “terrorist” group by Ankara, the EU and the US. Sweden and Finland requested to join NATOin May last year following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In order to join, a country must be approved by all current members. While Finland’s accession was approved in April, Turkey and Hungary have yet to approve Sweden’s application for membership.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/28/nato-ministers-talk-russia-ukraine-war-kosovo-unrest-at-brussels-summit
"Ukraine storm death toll rises to 10, thousands rescued in the south","Worsening weather in Odesa, Kharkiv, Mykolaiv and Kyiv has put pressure on emergency services, already overstretched by war.","Ten people have died in Ukraine as icy storms of snow and rain swept in from the Black Sea, crippling infrastructure, blocking roads and cutting power, the country’s interior minister said. The record-breaking storm has lashed swathes of the country since Sunday, leaving thousands of settlements in the affected region without power and taxing an already overworked energy grid and rescue serviceoverextendedby Russia’s nearly two-year invasion. “As a result of worsening weather conditions, 10 people died in Odesa, Kharkiv, Mykolaiv and Kyiv regions,” Minister Ihor Klymenko wrote on the Telegram app on Tuesday. “Twenty-three people were injured, including two children.” A total of 411 settlements in 11 regions had lost power, and more than 1,500 vehicles had to be rescued, Klymenko said. Emergency responders carried out rescues and evacuations of residents swept off roads and trapped by snow. Southern Ukraine was the worst affected, particularly the Black Sea region of Odesa. Cars and buses slid off frozen roads into fields and police battled high winds to tow the vehicles out. Oleh Kiper, the governor of the Odesa region where five people died due to the weather, said nearly 2,500 people had been rescued by emergency services after becoming trapped by the snow. “849 vehicles have been towed out, including 24 buses and 17 ambulances,” Kiper wrote on Telegram, adding that over 300 settlements in his region were without power. The extreme weather struck as tens of thousands of troops man front-line positions in the 21-month-old war with Russia amid fears Moscow could attack the power grid with air strikes this winter. The storm system overran also nearby regions. In Russian-annexed Crimea and southern Russia, at least three people were reported to have died. Russia’s Ministry of Energy said “about 1.9 million people” were affected by power cuts in the southern Russian regions of Dagestan, Krasnodar and Rostov as well as the occupied Ukrainian territories of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, Zaporizhia and Crimea.

"At least three killed as storm hits Russia, Ukraine’s Black Sea coast",Hundreds of thousands of people without power as fierce storm devastates infrastructure.,"More than half a million people are without power in occupied-Crimea, Russia and Ukraine after a storm in the Black Sea region flooded roads, ripped up trees and took down power lines, according to Russian state media and Ukraine’s Ministry of Energy. More than 2,000 towns and villages were without electricity on Sunday night and Monday morning in 16 Ukrainian regions, including Odesa, Mykolaiv and inland in Kyiv, as trees were uprooted, power lines snapped and electrical substations failed, leaving almost 150,000 households in the area without electricity, Ukraine’s Energy Ministry said. A 110-metre (360ft) chimney of a heat and power plant collapsed in the Ukrainian port city of Odesa on Sunday night, adding to Ukraine’s losses of energy infrastructure that have already sustained heavy damage from Moscow’s militarycampaign targeting Ukraine’s power grid. As winter nears, Russia has been attackingcivilian infrastructurefar from the front lines, leaving millions of Ukrainians without power, heat and water for days at a time. Although the heating supply has been restored after plants in Odesa were shut down for several hours due to power fluctuations, Ukrainian officials said they expected the weather to worsen as forecasters predicted more strong winds and snowfall. The head of Russia’s national meteorological service said the storm that hit Crimea was the most powerful since record-keeping began, state news agency RIA Novosti reported. At least three people were killed during the storm, local media reported. One person was killed in the resort city of Sochi, another on the Russian-held Crimean Peninsula and a third person on board a vessel in the Kerch Strait, which separates Crimea from the Russian mainland, the state news agency TASS reported. Russia’s Ministry of Energy said “about 1.9 million people” were affected by power cuts in the southern Russian regions of Dagestan, Krasnodar and Rostov as well as the occupied Ukrainian territories of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, Zaporizhia and Crimea. Crimea’s Moscow-appointed governor declared a state of emergency, and hundreds of people were evacuated. A video published online showed large waves sweeping over the seafront in Sochi and carrying away cars. In the Crimean port city of Sevastopol, an aquarium flooded and nearly 800 exotic fish, including pikes and piranhas, died from thermal shock as cold seawater flooded the facility, the aquarium director said. Roman Vilfand, the head of Russia’s national meteorological service, said a similar storm hit the region in November 1854 during the Crimean War. It caused at least 30 ships to sink off Crimea’s coast, RIA Novosti said.

Russia’s bid to arrest Meta spokesperson revealed amid media crackdown,,"Russia has put the communications director of social media company Meta on a wanted list, it has been revealed, amid Moscow’s announcement of new media restrictions ahead of next year’s presidential election. Andy Stone, aspokespersonof US tech giant Meta Platforms Inc, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, is wanted on unspecified criminal charges, Russian news wires reported late on Sunday, referring to an Interior Ministry database. Russia added Meta to its list of “terrorists and extremist” organisationslast year. The list includes right-wing nationalist groups; foreign “terrorist organisations,” including the Taliban; and Russian opposition groups. The classification means Russians using Facebook and Instagram could face possible criminal charges. According to Mediazona, an independent news website that covers Russia’s opposition and prison system, Stone was put on the wanted list in February 2022, but authorities made no related statements at the time and no news media reported on the matter until this week. In April 2022, Russia also formallybarredMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg from entering the country. Russia’s row with Meta started with its invasion ofUkraine, as users from both sides of the war voiced their unfiltered emotions on the platforms. Stone, at that time,announced temporary changesto Meta’s hate speech policy to allow for “forms of political expression that would normally violate [its] rules, like violent speech such as ‘death to the Russian invaders’”. In the same statement, Stone added that “credible calls for violence against Russian civilians” would remain banned. In late March, RussiabannedFacebook and Instagram for “carrying out extremist activities” after authorities accused Meta of tolerating “Russophobia”. Facebook and Instagram have been inaccessible in Russia since, but many Russians resorted tousing VPNsto keep using the social media networks. Instagram is particularly popular in Russia and is an important platform for advertisement and sales. Earlier this month, Russian PresidentVladimir Putinapproved changes to a law that willcurtail media coverageof next year’s presidential election, according to local news agencies. To enforce this ban, the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media also reportedly plans to block certain virtual private networks (VPNs) that Russians widely use to bypass internet restrictions.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/27/meta-spokesman-andy-stone-placed-on-russian-wanted-list

Earlier, Russia said some drones were shot down over the Moscow region. The Russian army said it had also downed two Ukrainian missiles headed for Russia over the Sea of Azov, between the two countries. Ukraine, meanwhile, said its air defence had downed eight out of nine drones over the country on Sunday. On Saturday, Ukraine said Moscowhad launched 75 dronesinto the country, mostly aimed at the capital. The attack came as Kyiv markedHolodomor, the Soviet-engineered starvation tragedy that killed millions of Ukrainians during the Stalin era.

"More than 70 Russian drones hit Kyiv, wounding five: Ukrainian officials",Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the attack an act of ‘wilful terror’.,"At least five people were wounded after Russia fired more than 70 drones at Kyiv overnight, Ukrainian officials said, calling it the largest drone attack in the war so far. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the attack on the capital an act of “wilful terror”, writing on the Telegram app that “the Russian leadership is proud of the fact that it can kill”. The attack, which used Iranian-designed Shahed kamikaze drones, reportedly began hitting different districts of Kyiv in the early hours of Saturday, with more waves coming as the sun rose. The air raid warning lasted for six hours. Air force chief Mykola Oleschuk said 71 of the 75 drones launched at Ukraine had been downed. He praised the effectiveness of “mobile fire” units – usually fast pick-up trucks with a machine gun or flak cannon mounted on their flatbed. According to Oleschuk, these downed nearly 40 percent of the drones. Kyiv’s Mayor Vitali Klitschko, writing on Telegram, said the attack had injured five people, including an 11-year-old girl, and damaged buildings in districts all across the city. Fragments from a downed drone had started a fire in a children’s nursery, he said.    The target of the attack was not immediately clear, but Ukraine has warned in recent weeks that Russia will once again wage an aerial campaign to destroy Ukraine’s energy system. Ukraine’s energy ministry said nearly 200 buildings in the capital, including 77 residential ones, had been left without power as a result of the attack. Ukraine’s air force said the raid was Russia’s largest drone attack since the beginning of thewarin February 2022. Al Jazeera’s Rob McBride, reporting from Kyiv, said Russian forces are trying to destroy critical infrastructure in Ukraine ahead of winter. “That is the concern for residents here in Kyiv and other cities as Russia targets important infrastructure and power supply as they did last year,” he said. Kyiv has also ramped updrone and missile attackson Russian military installations in eastern Ukraine and in and around the Crimean peninsula as it presses a counteroffensive it launched in June. Russian missile defences were reported to have downed 13 Ukrainian drones over Crimea and three more over the Volgograd region in the early hours of Friday, local media said, citing Russia’s defence ministry. Zelenskyy said on Friday that Ukraine needed to secure three key “victories” abroad, including the approval of extensive aid packages from the United States Congress and the European Union, and a formal start of accession talks to join the European Union. Twenty months into Russia’s full-scale invasion, fatigue has crept into the West’s relations with Kyiv, which heavily relies on its allies for military, economic and humanitarian aid to battle against the Kremlin’s troops.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/25/more-than-70-russian-drones-hit-kyiv-wounding-five-ukrainian-officials
Russian actress dies on stage as Ukraine ramps up air attacks,Russian theatre says actress Polina Menshikh died on stage in the Donbas region in a Ukrainian air raid.,"A Russian actress has been killed by a Ukrainian air attack while performing for Russian troops in eastern Ukraine. The Russian theatre for which Polina Menshikh, 40, worked confirmed that she was killed while performing on stage in the Donbas region. The details of the incident could not be independently verified, but military officials on both sides confirmed there had been a Ukrainian attack in the area on November 19. A Russian military investigator, quoted by Russian state television, said a school and cultural centre had been hit by HIMARS missiles in a village in the Donetsk region referred to as Kumachovo and known by Ukrainians as Kumachove, 60km (37 miles) from the front line. The investigator said one civilian, of whom he gave no further details, had been killed but made no mention of military casualties. The Russian defence ministry declined to comment and has mentioned no casualties from the attack. Ukrainian commanders said their forces had struck a Russian military award ceremony, targeting Russia’s 810th Separate Naval Infantry Brigade.    Robert Brovdi, a Ukrainian military commander, said in a post on social media that 25 people had been killed in the strike and more than 100 wounded. Unverified video footage on pro-Russian Telegram channels showed soldiers watching Menshikh singing on stage with a guitar on the day the Russian military celebrated their missile and artillery forces. Mid-song, the building was suddenly rocked by a blast and windows can be heard shattering before the lights go out and someone is caught on camera using an expletive. Ukraine’s Brovdi said the attack was “revenge for the 128th,” a reference to a Russian attack this month on soldiers from Ukraine’s 128th Separate Mountain Assault Brigade, in which the brigade said 19 of its soldiers were killed. Russian cultural leaders have been urged to visit areas near the front line to show support for soldiersfightingin Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin sent troops to invade in February 2022. Ukraine has ramped up drone and missile attacks on Russian military installations in eastern Ukraine and in and around the Crimean peninsula as it presses a counteroffensive launched in June. Russian missile defences were reported to have downed 13 Ukrainian drones over Crimea and three more over the Volgograd region in the early hours of Friday, the RIA news agency said, citing Russia’s defence ministry.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/24/ukrainian-strike-kills-russian-actress-performing-in-ukraine-theatre-says

Ukraine battles ‘elaborate’ Russian defences as Putin condemns Israel’s war,Putin says world should try and stop ‘tragedy’ in Gaza as Russian forces reportedly kill civilians in Ukraine’s Kherson.,"Russian President Vladimir Putin reacted to criticism of his war in Ukraine from the world’s wealthiest nations, now in its 91st week, by holding up Israel’s war in Gaza for comparison. “I understand that this war, and the death of people, cannot but shock,” Putin told the virtual G20 meeting called by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday [November 21]. “And the extermination of the civilian population in Palestine in the Gaza Strip today, is not shocking?” Putin asked. Russia has leveragedthe deaths of more than 14,500 civilians in Gaza to cast its own aggression in Ukraine in a more favourable light. Putin’s remarks came after a series of speeches from other leaders expressing shock at Russian aggression. “Yes, of course, military actions are always a tragedy,” Putin said. “And of course, we should think about how to stop this tragedy.” Some observers took this remark to be conciliatory, and Putin reminded his colleagues that “Russia has never refused peace talks with Ukraine,” whereas Ukraine refuses peace talks with Russia under the current government. But only the previous day his ambassador at large, Rodion Miroshnik, told reporters in Moscow that “the current regime [in Kyiv] is absolutely toxic, we do not see any options for co-existence with it at the moment.” Putin’s opposition to war was also cast into doubt by domestic developments. A St Petersburg court sentenced Russian artist AlexandraSkochilenkoto seven years’ imprisonment for “spreading false information” on November 17, after she replaced five supermarket price tags with messages against the war. “The Russian army bombed an arts school inMariupol. Some 400 people were hiding in it from the shelling,” one read. Another said, “Russian conscripts are being sent to Ukraine. Lives of our children are the price of this war.” A Russian wartime law criminalises criticism of Putin’s prosecution of the invasion, and any view that deviates from the Kremlin’s position. Skochilenko wept in the dock as her sentence was read out. The prosecutor had asked for eight years. “How weak is our prosecutor’s faith in our state and society if he thinks our statehood and public safety can be ruined by five little pieces of paper?” she said in court. “Everyone sees and knows that you are not judging a terrorist. You’re not trying an extremist. You’re not even trying a political activist. You’re judging a pacifist.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said troops were still launching counteroffensive actions on the southern front in the 91st week of the war, but had gone on the defensive in the east. He attributed the defensive posture to winter weather, rather than a series of attacks Russian troops have launched in Avdiivka, Bakhmut, Kupiansk and Mariivka in recent weeks. “Difficult weather, difficult defence on the Lyman, Bakhmut, Donetsk and Avdiivka fronts. Offensive actions in the south,” Zelenskyy said on Telegram on Wednesday. Even in the south, however, a Ukrainian counteroffensive that began in June has failed to make territorial gains for the past few weeks. There was one bright spot for Ukraine on the front lines. Ukraine’s general staff said on November 17 their marines had established a bridgehead on the left bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson, killing a battalion’s worth of Russian soldiers – some 1,200 men – and destroying two dozen tanks and four dozen armoured vehicles. The figures were possibly cumulative for the entire period of this bridgehead action, which started approximately a month ago, when a Russian reporter said Ukrainian reconnaissance units had reached the outskirts of Krynky, 20km (12.4 miles) east of Kherson City on the left bank. Ukraine general staff said, “One of the main goals of this work is to push the enemy as far as possible from the right bank in order to secure the civilian population from continuous Russian shelling.” Russian artillery killed two civilians in a parking lot in Kherson City on Monday, Ukrainian authorities said. Despite Russia’s difficulty in reinforcing its thin defences on this far western corner of the front, Ukraine has had difficulty getting on. The staff said Russian defences in the area were “fairly elaborate”. A Ukrainian soldier told the Wall Street Journal they consisted of “elaborate dugouts that [Russian forces] constructed over months”. The strength of these could weaken over winter, said the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, a think tank. “Russian forces have not constructed extensive visible defensive fortifications … and appear to have opted for more discrete fortifications set further from the frontline,” the ISW wrote. “The discrete fortifications located away from the frontline in Kherson Oblast will likely only be fully effective if they remain concealed, however. Fall and winter weather conditions may reveal some concealed positions as foliage and natural ground cover die.” Russian sources provided contradictory accounts about this Ukrainian action. Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu told the Russian Ministry of Defence Collegium on November 21, that “all attempts of the Ukrainian armed forces to conduct an amphibious operation in the Kherson direction were unsuccessful,” while “suffering colossal losses”. But on the same day, a Russian military reporter contradicted the official version, saying Ukrainian forces gunned down an entire Russian assault group near Krynky. “If the company craps itself and leaves the village, there is no point in reporting that it is ‘ours’,” wrote the reporter in adiatribeagainst official reports that gloss over bad news. Russia scored more success by intensifying its attacks on the softer target of Ukrainian energy infrastructure – a repeat of last winter’s tactic. Russia reportedly sent a total of 96 Iranian-designed Shahed drones into Ukrainian civilian territory during the week in attacks almost every night. Some of the attacks were accompanied by missiles. The worst came on the night of November 17-18, when Ukraine said it downed 29 out of 38 drones. But the rest caused power outages in 400 towns and villages in the south and north of the country. “Your accuracy, guys, is literally life for Ukraine,” Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the air force, but warned: “The closer we are to winter, the more Russians will try to make the strikes more powerful.” Ukrainian authorities said among the drones they shot down on November 21 was an Iranian-built Mohajer-6. Unlike the Shahed, the Mohajer is not a kamikaze drone. It is designed for reconnaissance and attack, and can carry four missiles. The recurrence of Russia’s winter tactics was likely the motive for Berlin upping the number of IRIS-T air defence systems it promised to supply Ukraine from eight to 12, in a new $1.3bn defence aid package on November 21. But the systems still have to be built, and capacity is low – only three of the eight previously pledged systems have been delivered, and those took a year. Separately, a border crisis brewed. Finlandsaid it was preparing to shut all but one of its eight border crossings with Russia on November 22. Four were shut on November 17 after a surge of refugee arrivals – more than 600 in November, compared with dozens a month before that. “Russia is effectively instrumentalising people, not only letting people through to the Finnish border with invalid documents or missing documents, which has not been the case before, but also we have evidence that Russia is effectively bringing those people to the border and organizing transport as well,” foreign minister Elina Valtonen told Reuters on November 21. She described it as part of Russia’s “hybrid warfare” against Finland. “At the EU border with Finland, Russian border guards have been letting people through without Schengen visas or EU residence permits. People who are being misled. People who are being used by Russia,” EU commissioner for home affairs Ylva Johansson said on November 21. In 2021, Russia’s main ally Belarus attempted to instrumentalise refugees, bringing in thousands of Syrians and Iraqis by plane from Istanbul, Amman and elsewhere and ferrying them to the borders with Poland and Lithuania.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/23/putin-uses-gaza-to-defend-his-war-while-bombing-civilians-in-ukraine
Russian journalist Boris Maksudov dies in Ukraine drone attack,The Rossiya 24 TV channel correspondent succumbs to shrapnel wounds sustained in the drone strike in Ukraine’s Zaporizhia region.,"Russian journalist Boris Maksudov has died after sustaining injuries in a drone attack in southeasternUkraine’sZaporizhia region. Maksudov, who worked for Russian state television Rossiya 24, was wounded on Wednesday and taken to hospital. Initially, defence officials said he was in stable condition. However, he later died of shrapnel wounds. “Boris Maksudov died a hero’s death, like a brave fighter,” Dmitry Kiselyov, the CEO of the Russian media group Rossia Segodnia, said, according to state-run news agency RIA Novosti. Moscow has repeatedly accused Kyiv of attacking reporters. Last month, it said three correspondents from the Izvestia news outlet were injured by shelling in the occupied Donetsk region. At least 15 media workers apart from Maksudov have been killed in Ukraine since Moscow launched its all-out invasion last February, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. In May, the Agence France-Presse news agency’s video journalist Arman Soldin was killed near the eastern city of Bakhmut. Russian theatre actress Polina Menshikh was killed in a similar manner this week while performing for Russian soldiers in the occupied Donbas region. Missiles struck the cultural centre where, according to the Ukrainian army, a Russian military award ceremony for the810th Separate Naval Infantry Brigadewas taking place.

Russia silent on Tehran arms claim as Ukraine downs Iran-built drone,The Kremlin says only that it is ‘developing military relations’ with Iran as Ukraine reports ‘rare’ drone.,"Russia has declined to comment on US claims that Iran could supply it with ballistic missiles. Ukraine said it shot down a “rare” Iran-built drone amid a barrage of attacks overnight. The Ukrainian Air Force said on Wednesday that it had downed more than a dozen attack drones and a cruise missile. The overnight assault followed a report by authorities in the southern region of Odesa that a rare Iranian-designed attack and reconnaissance drone had been destroyed. The air force said the overnight barrage was launched from southeast Russia and that a combination of air defence units in several central regions had “destroyed all 14 enemy Shahed-131/136 drones”. “The X-22 cruise missile failed to reach its target and landed in Zaporizhia region in an open area, and the blast wave damaged private homes. There were no casualties,” it added in a statement. Ukraine has been bracing for an increase in Russian attacks on critical infrastructure – particularly energy facilities – as subzero temperatures set in. Russian strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure last winter left many in the cold and dark for long periods. Kyiv has since received more air defence systems from its allies. Authorities in the Odesa region said on Tuesday that they had downed a “rare” Mohajer-6 drone. “The reconnaissance and strike UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle] was sneaking up on the Odesa region,” city officials said. The statement on social media said Russia had purchased 30 of the drones last year and that air defence forces shot one down for the first time last September. The Mohajer-6 is designed for reconnaissance and attack, can carry four guided missiles and has a range of up to 200km (124 miles) over 12 hours, the statement added. Iran’s support of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has long disturbed the US. The Kremlin declined on Wednesday to comment on a suggestion by White House spokesperson John Kirby that Iran may be considering providing Russia with ballistic missiles for use in its war. “We are developing relations with Iran, including in the field of military-technical cooperation, but we do not comment on this information,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters when asked about the accusation. Kirby said the United States would monitor the situation between Iran and Russia and take appropriate action as needed.

"More than 10,000 civilians killed in Ukraine since Russia invasion, UN says","UN: Half the fatalities in past three months due to Russia’s use of long-range missiles, abandoned ordinance blasts.","More than 10,000 civilians have been killed in Ukraine since Russia’s invasion last year, the United Nations says, with about half of the deaths in the past three months taking place far behind the front lines. The actual toll is expected to be “significantly higher” than the official tally since corroboration work is ongoing, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine said on Tuesday. More than 560 children have been killed, and more than 18,500 people have been injured since the start of the conflict on February 24, 2022, said the mission, which has monitors across the country. The UN attributed the recent deaths far beyond the front lines to Russian forces’ use of long-range missiles and the explosion of abandoned ordinance. “As a result, no place in Ukraine is completely safe,” warned Danielle Bell, who heads the monitoring mission. At least 10,000 civilians, incl over 560 children, have been killed since the start of Russia's full-scale armed attack on Ukraine in February last year. Read the latest 👇 — UN Human Rights (@UNHumanRights)November 21, 2023  The death toll includes events in the first months after the invasion, such as the battle for control of the port ofMariupol, where residents reported high civilian casualties. Russia denies deliberately targeting civilians. “Ten thousand civilian deaths is a grim milestone for Ukraine,” Bell said. Russia’s war against Ukraine“now entering into its 21st month, risks evolving into a protracted conflict with the severe human cost being painful to fathom”, she said. The vast majority of the deaths have been caused by explosive weapons with a wide-area impact, such as shells, missiles and cluster munitions, the UN said. Representatives from several of Ukraine’s allies were in the capital, Kyiv, on Tuesday in a show of solidarity as the countrymarked 10 yearssince the beginning of mass protests that toppled a Russia-backed president and set the country on a pro-Western course.

Ukraine marks 10-year anniversary of Maidan ‘Revolution of Dignity’,President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the protests marked Ukraine’s ‘first victory’ in its war with Russia.,"Ukraine’s pro-democracy, pro-Europe demonstrations inMaidansquare a decade ago marked the “first victory” in its war with Russia, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared on the anniversary of the popular protest movement. Nearly 100 civilians died in violent clashes with security forces when Ukrainians took to the streets of the capital in 2013, demanding to move Ukraine out of the orbit of VladimirPutin’s Russiaand “join” the family of European democracies to which it “historically belongs”. The “Revolution of Dignity” protests ultimately led to the ouster of Kremlin-backed PresidentVictor Yanukovychand gave space to the rise of a new generation of anticorruption, pro-democracy movement leaders. “The first victory in today’s war took place. A victory against indifference. A victory of courage. The victory of the Revolution of Dignity,” Zelenskyy said in a statement on Tuesday. He praised his country’s progress towards gaining membership in the European Union since Russian forces invaded Ukraine in February of last year. “Year after year, step by step, we do our best to ensure that our star shines in the circle of stars on the EU flag, which symbolises the unity of the peoples of Europe. The star of Ukraine,” he said. His comments come as Russian forces chip away at Ukraine’s sovereignty and continue their full-on invasion of their smaller neighbour. A number of foreign leaders made trips to Kyiv in a show of solidarity. German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius arrived by train for an unannounced visit to reaffirm Berlin’s backing for Ukraine in its fight against Russia’s troops. “I am here again, firstly to pledge further support, but also to express our solidarity and deep bond and also our admiration for the courageous, brave and costly fight that is being waged here,” he said laying flowers at Maidan square in central Kyiv. Also in Kyiv on Tuesday, European Council President Charles Michel, shared a post on the social media platform X, saying it was “Good to be back in Kyiv – among friends”. He posted a picture of himself shaking hands with the EU ambassador to Ukraine, Katarina Mathernova. Moldova’s President Maia Sandu arrived in Kyiv early on Tuesday to join Zelenskyy in honouring the memory of those who died during the Revolution of Dignity, her office said on X. United States Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin made anunannounced visitto Kyiv on Monday “to meet with Ukrainian leaders and reinforce the staunch support of the United States for Ukraine’s fight for freedom”, the Pentagon said in a statement. The United Kingdom’s foreign secretary, David Cameron,visited Ukraine last weekto underline British support for Kyiv amid its ongoing war with Russia. He told Zelenskyy the UK would support Ukraine for “however long it takes”. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs commented on the anniversary of Maidan protests by blaming Ukraine and the West for the current war in which nearly 10,000 people have lost their lives. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova questioned what the dream of Europe had brought Ukraine. “From a prosperous, industrially developed, densely populated ex-Soviet republic, Ukraine has turned into an impoverished, dying territory,” she said, according to comments published on the Foreign Ministry website. Ukraine had lost its independence as a result of the Maidan events, she said. “Western colonisers determine its domestic and foreign policy.” Russia’s Foreign Ministry also made statements saying Russia cannot coexist with the “regime” in Ukraine. “The current regime is absolutely toxic, we do not see any options for co-existence with it at the moment,” Russian ambassador-at-large Rodion Miroshnik said on Tuesday. He further stated that in order for the war to end, Ukraine must be “de-militarised and de-nazified” so as not to be deemed a threat to Russia.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/21/ukraine-marks-10-year-anniversary-of-maidan-revolution-of
"US defence chief visits Kyiv, announces $100m military aid package","US will send Ukraine anti-tank weapons, air-defence equipment and an additional HIMARS system.","US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin has made a surprise visit to Kyiv where he unveiled a new military aid package for Ukraine worth $100m. Austin, on his first trip to Kyiv since April 2022, met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as well as Defence Minister Rustem Umerov and Commander-in-Chief General Valerii Zaluzhnyi on Monday and promised the long-term support of the United States. “The message that I bring you today, Mr President, is that the United States of America is with you. We will remain with you for the long haul,” Austin told Zelenskyy. Austin said Ukraine’s effort to defeat Russian forces “matters to the rest of the world” and that US support would continue “for the long haul”. The new aid package includes anti-tank weapons, air-defence interceptors and an additionalHigh Mobility Artillery Rocket System(HIMARS). Zelenskyy told Austin that his visit was “a very important signal” for Ukraine. “We count on your support,” the Ukrainian president said. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the US has provided more than $44bn – and allies an additional $35bn – in security support that ranges from millions of bullets to air defence systems, advanced European and US battle tanks and, finally, pledges for F-16 fighter jets. But there are concerns that allied support is flagging amid the devastatingIsrael-Gaza warand aperceived lack of progressin a Ukrainian counteroffensive that began in June. Fighting has been bogged down in the east of the country around ruined towns such as Bakhmut and Adviidka, although Ukraine has recently reported some success in the southern Kherson region, where it hasestablished a footholdon the east bank of the Dnipro River, and in the Black Sea. However, as the cold weather sets in, it will become more difficult for either side to make large gains due to ground conditions. “I think they are prepared for combat in the winter,” Austin told reporters after his meetings, adding that the expectation was that Russia would be “even more aggressive”. Last year, Moscow relentlessly attacked Ukraine’s energy infrastructure and the power grid leaving millions of Ukrainians in the cold and dark at a time when temperatures are often below zero. Fred Kagan, a senior resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said it would be a mistake to think there is time to wait. “If we stop providing aid to Ukraine, it’s not that the stalemate continues. The aid is actually essential to preventing the Russians from beginning to manoeuvre again in ways that can allow them to defeat Ukraine,” Kagan told the Associated Press news agency. “So the cost of cutting off aid is that Russia wins and Ukraine loses and NATO loses.” Austin’s visit comes amid increasing division over aid for Ukraine in the US Congress. Some lawmakers want to make support for Israel a priority even though US defence officials stress that Washington can support both allies simultaneously, while a small, but vocal, group of Republicans oppose sending more aid to Ukraine, saying that taxpayers’ money should be spent at home.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/21/us-defence-chief-visits-kyiv-announces-100m-military-aid-package

"Zelenskyy sacks Ukraine’s military medical chief, urges reform of system",Ukraine’s president demands rapid changes in the operations of the war-torn country’s military medical system.,"Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has demanded rapid changes in the operations of Ukraine’s military medical system, announcing the dismissal of the commander of the medical forces. Zelenskyy’s move was announced on Sunday as he met Defence Minister Rustem Umerov, and coincided with a debate over the conduct of the 20-month-old war against Russia, with questions over how quickly a counteroffensive in the east and south is proceeding. “In today’s meeting with Defence Minister Umerov, priorities were set,” Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address. “There is little time left to wait for results. Quick action is needed for forthcoming changes.” Zelenskyy said he had replaced Major-General Tetiana Ostashchenko as commander of the Medical Forces of the Armed Forces. “The task is clear, as has been repeatedly stressed in society, particularly among combat medics, we need a fundamentally new level of medical support for our soldiers,” he said. This, he said, included a range of issues – better tourniquets, digitalisation and better communication. Umerov acknowledged the change in a post on the Telegram messaging app and laid out digitalisation, tactical medicine and rotation of servicepeople as his top priorities. “The experience of the effectiveness of specific units should be extended to the entire defence forces,” he said. Ukraine’s military reports on what it describes as advances in recapturing occupied areas in the east and south and last week acknowledged that troops had taken control of areas on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River in the southern Kherson region. Ukrainian commander-in-chief General Valery Zaluzhniy, in an essay published this month, said the war was entering a new stage of attrition, and Ukraine needed more sophisticated technology to counter the Russian military. While repeatedly saying advances will take time, Zelenskyy has denied the war is headed into a stalemate and has called on Kyiv’s Western partners, mainly the United States, to maintain levels of military support. Ostashchenko was replaced by Major-General Anatoliy Kazmirchuk, head of a military clinic in Kyiv. Her dismissal came a week after a Ukrainian news outlet suggested her removal, as well as that of others, was imminent following consultations with paramedics and other officials responsible for providing support to the military.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/20/zelenskyy-sacks-ukraines-military-medical-chief-urges-reform-of-system
Qatar-UN mediation returns orphaned Ukrainian teen home after Russia ordeal,"Bohdan Yermokhin is one of 20,000 Ukrainian children who were illegally taken to Russia from Ukraine’s occupied regions.","An orphaned Ukrainian teenager, who was taken to Russia from occupied regions of the war-torn country, has returned home ahead of his 18th birthday after mediation from the UN and Qatar, avoiding potential conscription in the Russian army. Bohdan Yermokhin was one of 20,000 Ukrainian children illegally taken to Russia since Moscow’s full-scale invasion in February last year, according to Ukraine. The practice is deemed a war crime by the International Criminal Court (ICC). The teenager, who had been living in the port city of Mariupol with his cousin after both his parents died, was captured by Russian troops in the first weeks of Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and put into a foster home in Russia. Yemokhin tried to return home on his own through Belarus earlier this year but was stopped at the border and sent back. He appealed to Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskyy for help getting back ahead of his 18th birthday when he risked being drafted into the Russian army. On Sunday, Yomokhin arrived in Ukraine via Belarus, the Reuters news agency reported. “I believed I would be in Ukraine, but not on this day”, Yermokhin told reporters after crossing into Ukraine. “This is a very pleasant gift, to put it in the right way. The emotions are overwhelming, all good, with the notion that Ukraine needs me.” Zelenskyy welcomed Yermokhin’s return in his nightly video address. “Many attempts were made to help him. I am happy everything worked out,” he said, expressing thanks to Ukrainian officials, international organisations, and particularly the UN children’s fund, UNICEF, and authorities in Qatar for their mediation. The ICC claims Russia intends to “permanently [remove] these children from their own country”. It has issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Children’s Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova, saying there are “reasonable grounds to believe” they are responsible for the illegal deportation of Ukrainian children. Russia denies the allegations, saying it has only sought to protect children from the risk of violence in war zones. The Kremlin says Moscow does not recognise the jurisdiction of the ICC. About 400 Ukrainian children taken to Russia during the war have been returned home. Yermokhin’s lawyer, Kateryna Bobrovska, has said the teen risked being conscripted into the Russian army after he had been told to report to a draft office near Moscow next month. She called on Zelenskyy to help bring him home, bringing international attention to the case. Lvova-Belova, Russia’s children’s commissioner, said Yermokhin left Russia on Saturday on a plane to Minsk, where he met a cousin, before continuing to Ukraine. She acknowledged that Yermokhin had wanted to be reunited with his relative. Ukraine’s human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said he was grateful Yermokhin was back home after his long ordeal. “It was a thorny path. Bogdan went through a lot while in Russia, but despite everything, he wanted to be home!

Ukraine says Russia launched new drone attacks on three regions,Ukrainian military says its defences shot down 15 out of 20 Iranian-made Shahed drones overnight.,"Russia has launched several waves of drone attacks on the Kyiv, Poltava and Cherkasy regions of Ukraine, stepping up its assaults on the Ukrainian capital after several weeks of respite, according to Ukrainian officials. “The enemy’s UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles] were launched in many groups and attacked Kyiv in waves, from different directions, at the same time constantly changing the vectors of movement along the route,” Serhiy Popko, the head of Kyiv’s military administration, said in a message on Telegram messaging app early on Sunday. “That is why the air raid alerts were announced several times in the capital.” Popko said preliminary information indicated that Ukraine’s air defence systems downed 10 Iranian-made Shahed kamikaze drones in Kyiv and the city’s outskirts. There were no initial reports of “critical damage” or casualties, he said. The Ukrainian Air Force said on its official Facebook page on Sunday morning that Russia attacked the Ukrainian territories from its Kursk region. It said air defences shot down 15 out of 20 drones that conducted the strikes. The reports could not independently be verified and there was no immediate comment from Russia. Russia began carrying out strikes on Ukraine’s energy, military and transport infrastructure in October 2022, six months after Moscow’s troops failed to take over the capital and withdrew to Ukraine’s east and south. Last winter, Russia pounded Ukraine with hundreds of missiles and drones, leavingmillions without electricity, heating and waterduring the coldest months of the year – before easing the assaults in the summer. After a pause of 52 days, Moscow resumed air strikes on Kyiv earlier this month. On Saturday, Ukrainian officials said all drones heading towards Kyiv were destroyed, but some hit infrastructure facilities elsewhere in Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other officials have warned that Russia will resume its large-scale bombardment of Ukrainian civilian infrastructure during the winter months. In his daily video message on Saturday evening, Zelenskyy announced new steps to bolster Ukraine’s air defences in the coming weeks. “The closer we get to winter, the greater Russia’s efforts will be to step up its attacks,” Zelenskyy said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/19/ukraine-says-russia-launched-new-drone-attacks-on-three-regions
Russia sends first free grain to Africa since end of Black Sea deal,"Moscow begins shipments of 200,000 tonnes of grain months after it withdrew from UN-brokered Black Sea grain deal.","Russia’s agriculture minister says Moscow has begun free shipments of grain totalling up to 200,000 tonnes to six African countries,as promised by President Vladimir Putin. In a statement posted on Telegram on Friday, Dmitry Patrushev said that ships headed for Burkina Faso and Somalia had already left Russian ports, and that additional shipments to Eritrea, Zimbabwe, Mali and Central African Republic would soon follow. Putin had promised to deliver free grain to the six countries at a summit with African leaders in July, soon after Moscow withdrew from a deal that had allowed Ukraine to ship grain from its Black Sea ports despite the war with Russia. The agreement, brokered by the United Nations and known asthe Black Sea grain initiative, aimed to help avert famine by injecting more wheat, sunflower oil, fertiliser and other products into world markets, including for humanitarian needs. After Russia announced its plan to send free shipments, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that a “handful of donations” would not correct the “dramatic impact” caused by the end of the Black Sea deal. Since quitting the arrangement, Russia has repeatedly bombed Ukrainian ports and grain storage facilities, and Kyiv says hundreds of thousands of tonnes of cereals have been destroyed. In response to the collapse of the deal, Ukraine announced a “humanitarian corridor” hugging the western Black Sea coast near Romania and Bulgaria. On Friday, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency quoted a senior Ukrainian government official as saying that about 151 ships have used the new Black Sea shipping corridor since it was set up in August. A total of 4.4 million metric tonnes of cargo, including 3.2 million tonnes of grain, has been shipped via the corridor, Yuriy Vaskov, deputy minister for renovation and infrastructure, was quoted as saying. Vaskov said that 30 ships were being loaded at Ukrainian ports. They included 22 ships that would carry 700,000 tonnes of grain and eight ships readying 500,000 tonnes of other cargo. Ukraine is one of the world’s leading grain producers and exporters. Keeping grain exports flowing is key for its economy, which shrank by about a third last year. It is expected to grow by about 5 percent this year.   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/17/russia-sends-first-free-grain-to-africa-since-disrupting-ukraines-trade
Finland to block border amid Russian ‘instrumentalisation of migrants’,At midnight ‘devices to prevent entry’ will go up at four of the border crossings between the European neighbours.,"Finland will place barriers on four of the eight border crossings it shares with Russia, as it seeks to stem a flow ofasylum seekers. The Finnish Border Guard said on Friday that the barriers will go up at midnight (22:00 GMT) at the Vaalimaa, Nuijamaa, Imatra and Niirala crossings in southeastern Finland. “Our aim is to use barrier devices to prevent entry,” the Border Guard’s head of international affairs Matti Pitkaniitty told reporters. The measures are a response to changes in Russia’s border policy, he said. Helsinki has accused Moscow of encouraging or turning a blind eye to undocumentedmigrantscrossing over. Russia has denied the claim. Finland announced earlier this week that it would close the four border crossings, which are the busiest points of travel between the two countries, with about 3,000 people crossing per day. Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said that amidRussia’s invasion of Ukraine, Moscow was seeking to destabilise his country in response toHelsinki’s decision to join NATO. Finland’s action was supported by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. “Russia’s instrumentalisation of migrants is shameful. I fully support the measures taken by Finland,” von der Leyen said on X. I had a call with PM@PetteriOrpowho informed me about the situation at the border with Russia. Russia’s instrumentalisation of migrants is shameful. I fully support the measures taken by Finland. And I thank the Finnish Border Guards for protecting our European borders. — Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen)November 16, 2023  Finland’s neighbour Norway, which shares a border with Russia in the Arctic, has said it is also ready to close its border at short notice if necessary. From Saturday, asylum seekers arriving via Russia will only be allowed to hand in their applications at two northern border crossings, at Salla and Vartius, Pitkaniitty said. The border closures come amid growing tension between Russia and Finland over Helsinki’s military alliances since Russia’s war with Ukraine began. Finland shares a 1,340km (833-mile) frontier with Russia that also serves as the European Union’s external border. After Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year, EU member Finland abandoned its decades-long policy of military non-alignment. The country joined NATO in April. Russia said at the time that it would take unspecified “countermeasures” in response. Finland’s Border Guard has since tracked an uptick in undocumented arrivals, mostly from Africa and the Middle East. Finland’s ombudsman for non-discrimination said on Thursday that Helsinki still had a duty under international treaties and EU law to allow asylum seekers to seek protection. Finland is constructing a 200km (124-mile) fence on a section of the border, due to be completed by 2026.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/17/finland-to-place-barriers-on-russian-border-to-block-migrant-flow
Ukraine claims gains against Russian positions on Dnipro east bank,Ukraine shoots down nine out of 10 drones above several regions and gains ‘a foothold on several bridgeheads’ of the Dnipro river.,"Ukraine’s armed forces claim to have made significant headway via a series of attacks on the Russian-occupied east bank of the Dnipro river. The country’s Marine Corps said in a statement published on social media on Friday that it had gained “a foothold on several bridgeheads” of Dnipro, near the key southern city of Kherson. The waterway is the de facto front line in the south of Ukraine. However, Russia conceded for the first time this week that Ukrainian forces had claimed back some territory on the opposing bank. “The Defence Forces of Ukraine conducted a series of successful operations on the left bank of the Dnipro River, along the Kherson front,” the marines said, and “managed to gain a foothold on several bridgeheads.” Russian and Ukrainian forces have been entrenched on opposite sides of the Dnipro river since Moscow withdrew from the western part of the Kherson region last November. The Russian-installed official responsible for occupied Kherson this week conceded that some Ukrainian soldiers were “blocked” in Krynky, a small village on the Dnipro’s eastern bank, and were facing a “fiery hell” from Russian artillery, rockets and drones.    Also on Friday, the Ukrainian Air Force said it had repelled another night of attacks. It reported that it had shot down nine out of 10 Russian drones overnight over the southern Mykolaiv and Odesa regions, and also near Zhytomyr in the centre, and in the Khmelnytskyi region in the west of the country. Russia has intensified its strikes on Ukraine’s grain infrastructure, including the major port at Odesa, since July, when Moscow pulled out of the Black Sea Grain Initiative; a wartime deal that enabled Ukraine’s exports to reach African countries facing the threat of hunger. The air force said in a statement that Russian forces also launched several C-300 missiles during an overnight attack in the eastern Donetsk region, close to the front line.

Belarus linked to forcible transfer of Ukrainian children: Study,"Yale researchers say more than 2,400 children have been deported from Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine.","Belarus has been collaborating with Moscow in the forcible transfer of thousands of Ukrainian children from Russian-occupied Ukraine in a programme “directly overseen” by the country’s President Alexander Lukashenko, according to research from Yale School of Public Health’s Humanitarian Research Lab (HRL). The report (PDF), released on Thursday, said at least 2,442 children aged between six and 17 years old had been taken to 13 facilities across Belarus since Russia began its full-scale invasion in February 2022 until the end of October this year. “Russia and Belarus are targeting children for removal from Ukraine, coordinating their transport from occupied Ukraine through Russia to Belarus, and subjecting children to re-education, sometimes including military training, sometimes including military training,” the Yale HRL researchers said. They said Belarus’s authoritarian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, had “jointly directed and co-funded” the deportations with Putin under theUnion Stateinitiative that was first agreed back in 1996. “Belarus’s direct involvement in Russia’s forced deportation of children represents a collaboration between Belarus’s authoritarian leader [Alexander] Lukashenka and Russia’s President Vladimir Putin, with various pro-Russia and pro-regime organisations facilitating the deportation,” they said. Putin is already the subject of an International Criminal Courtarrest warrantover Moscow’s alleged forcible transfer of Ukrainian children from occupied territories, along with the country’s Children’s Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova. Taking children under the age of 18 across a border without the consent of a parent or guardian is illegal under international humanitarian law. Kyiv, which estimates some19,000 childrenhave been abducted, has already said it is investigating Belarus’s alleged involvement in the policy. In September, Belarus’s state media published photos of dozens of Ukrainian children arriving in the country from the Donetsk, Luhansk and Zaporizhia regions for a “three-week holiday”. The children were shown getting off a train carrying backpacks and suitcases, mostly looking solemn. Alexei Talai, the head of the charity leading the programme, said Lukashenko had described it as an “important humanitarian project” that needed to continue. Talai was also mentioned as a facilitator in Thursday’s report. The Yale HRL is part of The Conflict Observatory, which receives funding from the United States. “These revelations of Belarusian involvement are part of a broader campaign directed by Russia,” the US State Department said in a statement. “Members of Russia’s military and government have deported hundreds of thousands of Ukraine’s civilians to Russia, including children who have been forcibly separated from their families. The United States will continue to pursue accountability for actors involved in abuses connected with Russia’s war against Ukraine.” Moscow has denied allegations that it is involved in forcible transfers or separating children from their families. The Yale HRL report said the children had been taken from at least 17 cities in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhia regions, parts of which are occupied by Russia. They were put on trains to Rostov-on-Don in Russia before being transported to Belarus. It said more than 2,050 of the children had been taken to the “Dubrava children’s camp” in Minsk, the Belarusian capital. The researchers said it was not clear how many of the children it had documented remained in Belarus.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/17/belarus-linked-to-forcible-transfer-of-ukrainian-children-study
Russian artist jailed for seven years over anti-war price tag protest,Alexandra Skochilenko was convicted of spreading ‘false information’ after she replaced five supermarket price tags with criticism of Russia’s war in Ukraine.,"Russian artist Alexandra Skochilenko has been sentenced to jail for seven years after being found guilty of spreading “false information” about the Russian military by replacing a handful of supermarket price tags with messages criticising the war in Ukraine. The 33-year-old, known as Sasha, is one of thousands of Russians to be detained, fined or jailed forspeaking outagainst Moscow’s invasion of its neighbour amid an escalating crackdown on free speech and opposition to President Vladimir Putin. Skochilenko was arrested in her native St Petersburg in April 2022, after an elderly customer at the supermarket found the slogans on the price tags and notified the police. “The Russian army bombed an arts school in Mariupol. Some 400 people were hiding in it from the shelling,” one read, in reference to Russia’sbrutal siegeof the southern Ukrainian city. Another said, “Russian conscripts are being sent to Ukraine. Lives of our children are the price of this war.” Judge Oksana Demiasheva delivered the verdict on Thursday hours after Skochilenko, who has a congenital heart defect and coeliac disease, had made a final statement to the court, asking for compassion and to be set free. As well as the prison term, the artist was banned from using the internet for three years. Skochilenko, wearing a colourful T-shirt decorated with a large red heart, reacted with shock to the sentence, covering her face and wiping away tears. Supporters shouted “shame” and “we’re with you Sasha”, the AFP news agency reported. Skochilenko’s lawyers left without giving any comment. Skochilenko’s arrest came about a month after authorities adopted a law effectively criminalising any public expression about thewarthat deviated from the Kremlin’s official line. Human rights group Memorial – now banned in Russia – said police spent 10 days interrogating supermarket staff and inspecting security camera footage before arresting the artist. “They sometimes give less for murder than for five price tags in a supermarket,” Boris Vishnevsky, a politician linked to the opposition Yabloko party, told AFP. “Hopefully, someday, the pendulum will turn the other way.” Skochilenko was accused of committing what the state prosecutor described as a serious crime out of “political hatred” towards Russia. He had asked for her to be jailed for eight years. Skochilenko admitted to swapping the tags but denied that the text written on them was false. She said she was a pacifist who valued human life above all else. “How weak is our prosecutor’s faith in our state and society if he thinks our statehood and public safety can be ruined by five little pieces of paper?” she said in court. “Everyone sees and knows that you are not judging a terrorist. You’re not trying an extremist. You’re not even trying a political activist. You’re judging a pacifist,” she said. Amnesty International condemned the verdict. “Her persecution has become synonymous with the absurdly cruel oppression faced by Russians openly opposing their country’s criminal war,” it said in a statement. Memorial has designated Skochilenko a political prisoner and has launched a campaign calling for her release. She has already been in detention for nearly 19 months, meaning that her overall term will be reduced by more than two years, since every day served in a pre-trial detention centre counts as 1.5 days of time served in a regular penal colony. But she has struggled in custody due to pre-existing health conditions, and her need for a gluten-free diet, according to her lawyers and her partner. According to OVD-Info, a prominent rights group that monitors political arrests and provides legal aid, a total of 19,834 Russians have been arrested between February 24 2022, when Russia began its invasion, and late October 2023 for speaking out or demonstrating against the war. Also on Thursday, opposition politician Vladimir Milov was convicted in absentia of spreading false information about the army and sentenced to eight years. Milov, who was once Russia’s deputy energy minister and is now an ally of imprisoned opposition leader Alexei Navalny, has left the country.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/17/russian-artist-jailed-for-seven-years-over-anti-war-price-tag-protest

Finland to shutter border crossings with Russia to deter asylum seekers,Finland accuses Russia of trying to destabilise the country by encouraging undocumented migration.,"Finland says it will close four of its eight border crossings with Russia where it has seen a surge in asylum seekers, accusing Moscow of turning a blind eye to undocumented people from mainly Africa and the Middle East to destabilise the country. Interior Minister Mari Rantanen said on Thursday that the border crossings in the southeastern regions of Vaalimaa, Nuijamaa, Imatra and Niirala would close on Saturday morning. The crossings are normally the busiest points of travel between Russia and Finland with about 3,000 people using them per day. Asylum seekers arriving via Russia will from Saturday have to turn in their applications at two northern border crossings, the government said. The border closures come amid growing tension between Russia and Finland, which share more than 1,300km (830 miles) of border, over Helsinki’s defence cooperation with the United States. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year, Finland abandoned its decades-long policy of military non-alignment and joined NATO in April. Russia said it would take unspecified “countermeasures” in response.    Finland’s Border Guard has since tracked an uptick in undocumented arrivals, mostly from Africa and the Middle East. Finnish officialsbelieveMoscow is encouraging people to go to the Finnish border, where they can apply for asylum. “It is clear that these people get help to get to the border. This seems like a very conscious decision”, Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said on Tuesday. Rantanen surmised: “Maybe [Russian officials] are annoyed by something in Finland’s activities.” The Kremlin, reacting to earlier reports that Finland was mulling a closure, put the blame on Helsinki for deteriorating ties. “We deeply regret that the Finnish leadership has chosen to deliberately move away from what used to be good relations,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday. Finland is constructing a 200km (124-mile) fence on a section of the border, due to be completed by 2026. At present, Finland’s borders are secured primarily by light wooden fences, mainly designed to stop livestock from wandering into the neighbouring country.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/16/finland-to-shutter-border-crossings-with-russia-to-deter-asylum-seekers
UK’s newly appointed top diplomat makes surprise visit to Ukraine,David Cameron tells Ukraine’s president that London would support Kyiv for ‘however long it takes’.,"The United Kingdom’s newly appointed foreign secretary, David Cameron, has made a visit to Ukraine to underline British support for Kyiv amid its ongoing war with Russia, according to his office. The former prime minister, making his first working trip abroad as Britain’s top diplomat, told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that his country would support Ukraine for “however long it takes”. “I wanted this to be my first visit,” Cameron said. “I admire the strength and determination of the Ukrainian people.” He wasnamedforeign secretary on Monday in a surprise cabinet reshuffle. Zelenskyy said he was grateful for Cameron’s gesture, which comes amid Israel’s war in Gaza that he worries has diverted attention from Ukraine’s drawn-out battle with Russia, in its 21st month. “The world is not so focused on the battlefield situation in Ukraine, and this dividing of the focus really does not help,” Zelenskyy said.    The UK has been a close ally of Ukraine throughout the war, and Cameron told Zelenskyy Britain would continue to be there for moral, diplomatic and military support. “What I want to say by being here is that we will continue to give you the moral support, the diplomatic support … but above all the military support that you need not just this year and next year, but however long it takes,” Cameron said. He added that the UK would work with its allies “to make sure the attention is here in Ukraine”. Ukraine’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Cameron had also engaged in talks on issues related to armaments, arms production, and security in the Black Sea while in Kyiv. Ukraine did not say when the talks took place. Due to stringent wartime security regulations, the details of foreign dignitaries’ trips are sometimes released late. As of last month, the UK said it was second to the United States in providing military funds to Ukraine, giving 4.6 billion pounds ($5.7bn) worth of assistance and training 30,000 Ukrainian soldiers on British soil.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/16/uks-newly-appointed-top-diplomat-makes-surprise-visit-to-ukraine

Europe considers commitments to Ukraine as Russia’s war rages on,"The European Union considers massive military and state aid packages as Ukraine claims 10,000 Russian troops killed in Avdiivka assault.","Ukraine and Russia both scored some territorial successes and flung missiles and drones at each other during the 90th week of the war, each showing little sign of abatement. But much of the main action was in Europe’s capitals. European Unionmembers debated whether to grant Ukraine 20 billion euros ($22bn) in military aid and 50 billion euros ($54bn) in state and reconstruction aid over four years, and whether to invite Ukraine to start membership talks at the European summit in December. Both actions would send a powerful message to Russia’s President Vladimir Putin that Europe’s resolve to help Ukraine has not weakened. Europe also prepared a 12th package of sanctions, making it harder for Russia to sell its oil around the world. The United Kingdom, meanwhile, ensured that Ukrainian grain would continue to be exported through the Black Sea, by brokering an insurance agreement that lowered the cost of war risk to freighters. That cost briefly rose after Russia struck a sixth civilian cargo vessel on November 8. Ukraine built up its bridgehead on the left bank of the Dnipro river during the week, threatening Russian forces at the western extremity of the front. Russian reporters said Ukraine advanced to new positions around Krynky, a town 20km (12 miles) east of Kherson City, on November 9. Geolocated footage confirmed the advance on November 13. The reports also said continuous Ukrainian artillery was pinning down Russian troops in towns between Krynky and Kherson City. Ukrainian military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said the armed forces were doing “everything possible to knock out the Russians from the left bank” in a statement on November 11, the first anniversary of a tactical Russian withdrawal from the territory it held in Kherson west of the river. Two days later, Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukraine’s presidential office, said, “Against all odds, Ukraine’s Defence Forces have gained a foothold on the left bank of the Dnieper [Dnipro river].” Ukrainian headway seemed to have caught Russia unprepared to communicate. On November 9, the day of the Ukrainian advance, Russia’s military said it had thwarted Ukraine’s attempt to gain a bridgehead on the left bank, killing 500 Ukrainian servicemen in a week. On November 13, Russia’s state TASS news agency and RIA Novosti newspaper published reports that Russia was ordering the redeployment of elements of the “Dnipro” group of forces in Kherson to “more advantageous positions”. Both withdrew the reports within minutes, issuing an apology. Russia, too, made advances. The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said Russian forces launched 30 attacks north and south of Bakhmut, an unusually high number, on November 8 and 9. Geolocated footage showed they had regained control of a railway line running south of Bakhmut and advanced north of the city. “The Russians have stepped up and are trying to recover previously lost positions” in Bakhmut, wrote Ukrainian ground forces commander Oleksandr Syrsky on Telegram. Russia also kept up pressure on Avdiivka, the eastern city south of Bakhmut it is trying to encircle. Ukraine’s military chief of staff, Valery Zaluzhny, said on November 10 that Russia had lost 10,000 men in the first month of its assault on Avdiivka. “During this time, our soldiers destroyed more than 100 enemy tanks, 250 other armoured vehicles, about fifty artillery systems and 7 Su-25 aircraft. The enemy’s total losses in manpower amount to about 10,000 people,” he wrote on social media. Neither Ukraine’s nor Russia’s claims of the other’s losses could be independently verified. Ukraine and Russia also sparred from a distance. Ukraine’s air force said it downed 19 out of 31 Shahed drones Russia fired off on November 10. Russia also fired a Kh-31 missile, an Onyx anti-ship missile and an S-300 air defence missile into Ukrainian territory, adopting a Ukrainian technique of using drones and missiles together to help overwhelm air defences. Russia’s Ministry of Defence said it downed two Ukrainian drones on the same day, one near Moscow and the other near the Russian border with Belarus. Baza, a Russian Telegram channel with links to security services, suggested one was targeting a machine plant in Kolomna, 100km (62 miles) southeast of Moscow. Ukraine has consistently asked allies for more air defence systems. On November 9, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister asked France for additional ammunition for air defence systems, and to participate in pilot training for F-16s. That pilot training took a major step forward on November 9, when five Dutch F-16s arrived at the Fetesti Air Base in Romania for pilot training. Four days later, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said F-16 pilot training had begun in a video address. The European F-16 Training Centre (EFTC) in Fetesti is to train non-Ukrainian pilots as well. The Netherlands is lending the EFTC 12-18 of its F-16s for training purposes, and helping coordinate the effort to provide Ukraine with its own F-16s. Ukrainian Deputy Energy Minister Farid Safarov recently told a NATO meeting that F-16s were the best way for Ukraine to defend its energy infrastructure from Russian attacks during the winter, but it was not certain how soon Ukraine would have operational F-16s. The EU was finalising a 12th package of sanctions on Russia that could be approved on Wednesday, the bloc’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Monday, November 13. “This 12th package will include … new export bans, among them … diamonds,” Borrell told reporters, indicating there would also be “actions to tighten the oil price cap, in order to decrease the revenue that Russia is getting from selling its oil – not to us but to others – [and] fighting against circumvention”. Days earlier, the European Parliament had called for tougher enforcement of European sanctions against Russian oil – and for an extension of those sanctions. The resolution said refined oil products from Russian oil were finding their way into the EU from India, and gas was continuing to enter the EU directly. But the most important European contributions to Ukraine’s security could come in December. Ukraine has been lobbying for an invitation to open membership talks, and the European Commission supports that demand.    “We are working to get an unconditional decision to start negotiations,” said Zelenskyy in a November 13 video address. “It is fundamental for Ukraine to implement all the recommendations of the European Commission that were given, all seven recommendations, and to do what is necessary at this stage of our journey to the European Union.” The EU last year said it would grant Ukraine candidate status if it passed legislation to fight corruption and money laundering, limit the influence of oligarchs, secure the integrity of the judiciary and guarantee the rights of ethnic minorities. At the same summit, the EU is to decide on whether to approve a 50 billion-euro ($54.2bn) financial aid package for Ukraine for the period 2024-27. The European Parliament has already given a green light to the so-called “Ukraine Facility”, designed to help finance the state as it transitions to EU membership and to rebuild the country. Separately, EU diplomats were considering a 20-billion euro ($22bn) military aid package that would commit members to spending 5 billion euros ($5.4bn) a year over four years. EU diplomats said on November 14 that there was resistance to the package. The EU’s foreign policy chief proposed the military budget in July. Among the sceptics was reportedly Germany, a stalwart provider of military aid to Ukraine so far, and this despite the fact that it proposed doubling its military aid to Ukraine to 8 billion euros ($8.7bn) next year. The governing coalition had reportedly agreed to the increase and would submit it for committee discussion on November 16. “It is a strong signal to Ukraine that we will not leave them in the lurch,” German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius is quoted as having said. Germany’s 8 billion-euro ($8.7bn) pledge came as Chancellor Olaf Scholz sought to ensure that Germany would meet a NATO defence spending minimum of 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) over the medium term. Germany is on track to spend 1.57 percent of GDP this year, and the 8 billion-euro ($8.7bn) pledge puts it over 2 percent for next year.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/15/europe-considers-commitments-to-ukraine-as-russias-war-rages-on
"Ukraine claims key southern foothold, appeals for more military aid",President Zelenskyy’s chief of staff says Ukrainian forces have secured their position on the east bank of the Dnipro.,"Ukrainian forces have secured a pivotal position on the eastern shore of the Dnipro River, a senior official said. The claim of momentum in the Ukrainian military’s counteroffensive, made by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s chief of staff in the United States on Tuesday, came as Kyiv presses the West to raise the supply of arms. “Against all odds, Ukraine’s Defense Forces have gained a foothold on the left (east) bank of the Dnipro,” Andriy Yermak told the Hudson Institute think tank in the US, as posted on Zelenskyy’s website. The statement was the first official confirmation of Ukraine’s establishment of a foothold on the Dnipro’s east bank in the Kherson region. This opens up a potential route towards Crimea. The peninsula, which was annexed by Russia in 2014, has been the focus of Ukrainian attacks in recent weeks. “Step by step, they are demilitarising Crimea. We have covered 70% of the distance. And our counteroffensive is developing,” Yermak told Hudson Institute. Russian forces seized Ukraine’s southern Kherson region in the early days of the February 2022 invasion. However, late last year, they pulled out of the regional capital, also called Kherson, and left the Dnipro’s west bank. Attacks have since been launched on Kherson and other towns from the east bank, soliciting a response from Ukraine. A Ukrainian military spokesperson this month said Ukraine had achieved “not bad results” in pushing Russian troops to relocate. Unofficial accounts have noted Ukrainian advances. In a highly unusual incident on Monday, two Russian state news agencies published alerts saying Moscow was moving troops to “more favourable positions” east of the Dnipro in Ukraine, only to withdraw the information minutes later. In the past, Russia has sometimes used similar phrasing about moving troops to more advantageous positions to describe retreats. The announcement of Ukraine’s southern foothold came as Zelenskyy also pointed to heavy Russian losses in the shattered eastern city of Avdiivka, which he said was undermining Moscow’s broader war goals. Moscow’s forces have focused on eastern Ukraine since failing to advance on Kyiv in the first days of the February 2022 invasion. They have taken aim at Avdiivka since mid-October and officials from the town, which had a pre-war population of 32,000, say not a single building remains intact. Zelenskyy, in an address on Tuesday night, said Russian assaults in the eastern Donetsk region, including Avdiivka, had been “very intense” but that Russia was rapidly losing manpower and equipment. Yermak, in his address to the Hudson Institute, said Russia’s strategy against Ukraine was “to outlast and out-endure the unity of democracies” and called on allies to provide more military aid to bolster Ukraine’s defence. “We need weapons right now. Russia still has air superiority,” he told the gathering. “It still is capable of producing missiles due to circumvention of sanctions. Not to mention the Iranian drones and North Korean artillery rounds.” The US has sent more than $46bn in military aid to Ukraine since Russia’s invasion. However, since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war on October 7, conservative US lawmakers have expressedscepticismabout further aiding Ukraine and advocated for redirecting funds to Israel. Germany, another key Ukraine ally, recently announced plans to double its military aid to Ukraine to $8.6bn next year.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/15/ukraine-claims-key-southern-foothold-appeals-for-more-military-aid

Russian convicted over journalist Anna Politkovskaya’s murder pardoned,Former police officer had been serving a 20-year sentence over his role in the killing of investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya.,"A man convicted for his role in the killing of investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya has been pardoned after fighting in Ukraine, according to his lawyer and local media reports. Politkovskaya, who was well known for reporting on abuses in Russia’s war in Chechnya early in Vladimir Putin’s presidency, was shot dead outside her flat in Moscow in 2006. The killing triggered an outcry in the West and underlined the growing dangers of reporting in Russia as Putin gradually clamped down on independent media. Sergei Khadzhikurbanov, a former police officer, was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2014 for organising the killing. “As a special forces fighter, [Khadzhikurbanov] was invited to sign a contract to participate in the special military operation… When the contract expired, he was pardoned by presidential decree,” Khadzhikurbanov’s lawyer Alexei Mikhalchik told the AFP news agency.    Khadzhikurbanov was convictedalong with four other menfrom Chechnya, a mostly Muslim region in the northern Caucasus where Russia and its local allies crushed two rebellions, in 1994-96 and, under Putin, in 1999-2009. In 2018, the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg found that, while the authorities had found and convicted a group of men who had directly carried out the contract killing, they had “failed to take adequate investigatory steps to find the person or persons who had commissioned the murder”. Politkovskaya, who did much of her work for the independent investigative magazine Novaya Gazeta, now banned in Russia, won more than a dozen international prizes for reporting on abuses committed in Chechnya by Russian and allied forces as well as by rebels, despite repeated detentions and death threats. Many Russian prisoners have been sent to fight in Ukraine since Moscow launched its offensive last February, with critics warning some have committed new crimes after returning from the front. The Kremlin last week acknowledged the use of prisoner recruits to fight in Ukraine and said convicts who “atone for their crime on the battlefield with blood” could be pardoned. “They are atoning with blood in storm brigades, under bullets and under shells,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Friday.    Russia has probably recruited 100,000 people from prisons to fight in Ukraine, Olga Romanova, the head of an independent prisoners’ rights group has estimated. Local Russian media outlets have reported several instances of released prisoners going on to commit serious offences, including murders, after having left the army.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/14/russian-convicted-over-journalist-anna-politkovskayas-murder-pardoned
Putin approves new media restrictions ahead of presidential election,Media barred from reporting on election body’s actions at military bases or areas under martial law without clearance.,"Russian PresidentVladimir Putinhas approved changes to a law that will curtail media coverage of next year’s presidential election, according to local news agencies. The elections are due to be held in March. The 71-year-old president, who has led the country for 24 years, is expected to stand for another six-year term. Putin has not officially declared he will run, saying he will announce that only after parliament formally sets the election date. The changes Putin greenlighted limit coverage of Central Election Commission sessions to registered media outlets, which could exclude freelancers or independent journalists, according to the reports on Tuesday. The amendments prohibit media from reporting on the commission’s actions at military bases or in areas under martial law without advance clearance from regional and military authorities. They also bar the publication of any campaign content on “blocked sources”, referring to restricted websites and social media services. Under an intensifying crackdown on the opposition and the flow of information, Russia has banned an array of websites and services, including Facebook and Instagram. To enforce this ban, the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media also reportedlyplansto block certain virtual private networks (VPNs) that Russians widely use to bypass internet restrictions. The state-owned news agency RIA quoted the ministry on Sunday as saying that it could block certain “VPN services and VPN protocols” that an expert commission identifies as a “threat.” Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, it hasclamped downon independent and dissenting media voices, watchdogs have said. Hundreds of journalists have gone into exile as state censors have closed many respected independent media outlets and launched criminal cases against prominent journalists and regional bloggers. “After Russian tanks entered Ukraine, the authorities switched to a scorched-earth strategy that has turned Russia’s media landscape into a wasteland,” Amnesty International’s director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, Marie Struthers,saidin March 2022. Russian polling agencies have found that Putin’s approval rating remains high – even as much as 82 percent in October. He appears easily poised to win if he runs for re-election. Last week, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “I have no doubt that if he puts forward his candidacy, he will win confidently.”   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/14/russias-putin-imposes-new-curbs-on-election-reporting

Russia labels reports on troop movements in Ukraine ‘provocation’,,"Russia’s Ministry of Defence has called the publication by media about a regrouping of its troops in Ukraine a “provocation”. The ministry said that the reports by two state news agencies on Monday, discussing Russian troop movements in Ukraine, were “false”. The reports were quickly withdrawn after publication. “The transmission of a false report about the “regrouping” of troops in the Dnipro area, allegedly on behalf of the Russian Defence Ministry’s press centre, is a provocation,” the ministry said, according to the RBC news outlet. The reports, by the RIA Novosti and TASS agencies, had said that Russian troops were being moved to “more favourable positions” east of the Dnipro River in Ukraine. The Kremlin’s spokesperson declined to comment on the incident, which has been flagged as illustrating disarray among the military establishment regarding media work, saying it was a matter for the military. On Friday, Russia’s military said that its forces had thwarted a Ukrainian attempt to forge a bridgehead on the eastern bank of the Dnipro and on nearby islands. Last week, The US-based Institute for the Study of War said that Ukraine appeared to have conducted assaults across the Dnipro in Kherson region in mid-October, and noted that Russian military bloggers were reporting continued Ukrainian ground operations on the east bank. According to ISW’sassessmentas of November 12, while Russian forces conducted a limited series of missile strikes targeting southern Ukraine, “the Russian government is attempting to downplay the extent of its efforts to strengthen control over the Russian information space”. Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials say that Russian forces have ramped up attacks in eastern Ukraine in an attempt to gain ground near two key front line cities. “Toward Bakhmut, the Russians have become more active and are trying to recapture previously lost positions,” General Oleksandr Syrskyi wrote in a statement on the Telegram messaging app. “Enemy attacks are being repelled,” he added.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/13/russia-labels-report-on-military-regrouping-as-provocation

"Ukraine military officer had key role in Nord Stream sabotage, reports say",President Zelenskyy has denied Ukraine was behind blasts that cut off a major route for Russian gas exports to Europe.,"A Ukrainian special forces commander played a key role in sabotaging theNord Stream gas pipelinesin September last year, according to an investigation by two international newspapers. Mystery has surrounded who was behind the blasts that damaged the pipelines – which run from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea – cutting off a major route for Russian gas exports to Europe and heightening already high tensions overMoscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Different theories have emerged pointing the finger at Ukraine, Russia or the United States. All have denied involvement. A joint investigation by The Washington Post newspaper and German outlet Der Spiegel, published on Saturday, singled out Roman Chervinsky, a 48-year-old who served in Ukraine’s Special Operations Forces. The officer’s alleged role provides the most direct evidence to date tying Ukraine’s military and security leadership to the sabotage that spawned multiple criminal investigations. Chervinsky was the “coordinator”, the reports claimed, citing officials in Ukraine and elsewhere in Europe, as well as other people with knowledge of the operation, who spoke anonymously.    He oversaw logistics and support for a six-person team, which rented a sailing boat using false identities and diving equipment to place explosive charges on the pipelines, according to the Post. The blasts ruptured three of the four pipelines that make up Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2, spewing gas into the Baltic Sea, near Bornholm, Denmark. Russian energy giant Gazprom halted flows through Nord Stream 1, the main conduit for Russian natural gas to Germany, amid disputes over the war in Ukraine a month earlier. The newly completed Nord Stream 2 twin pipelines never opened as Berlin pulled the plug on the project days before Russian troops entered Ukraine on February 24, 2022. The Nord Stream attack hit civilian infrastructure built to provide energy to millions of people in Europe. Ukraine had long complained that Nord Stream would allow Russia to bypass Ukrainian pipes, depriving Kyiv of transit revenue. According to the report, Chervinsky did not act alone nor did he plan the operation. Instead, he took orders from more senior Ukrainian officials, who ultimately reported to General Valerii Zaluzhny, Ukraine’s highest-ranking military officer, it said. He denied any role in the sabotage through his lawyer. “All speculations about my involvement in the attack on Nord Stream are being spread by Russian propaganda without any basis,” he said in a statement to the Post and Der Spiegel. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly denied his country was behind the sabotage. “I would never do that,” he told Germany’s Bild newspaper in June, adding that he would “like to see proof”. But the Nord Stream operation was designed to keep Zelenskyy in the dark, the Post reported. The two media outlets said the Ukrainian government did not respond to requests for comment on their investigation. US and Western officials have called the act a dangerous attack on Europe’s energy infrastructure. Chervinsky is currently in jail in Kyiv on charges of allegedly abusing his power during an attempt to persuade a Russian pilot to defect in July 2022. He says his prosecution is political retribution for having criticised Zelenskyy, according to the reports. Russia alleged that Washington was behind the attack, with President Vladimir Putin dismissing the argument that Ukraine was behind the explosions.

"Ukraine’s Kyiv comes under attack for first time in months, mayor says",Strong explosions heard in the capital in first attack on the city since September.,"Ukraine’s Kyiv has come under attack for the first time in months, the city’s mayor has said, as large explosions were heard in the capital. “Strong explosions were heard on the left bank of the capital,” Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Saturday in a post on the Telegram messaging app, referring to the left bank of the Dnipro river. “Preliminary, air defence was working against ballistic (missiles).” There were no immediate reports of casualties. Two strong explosions were heard and trails were visible in the sky in central Kyiv on Saturday morning, AFP news agency reported, citing its journalists in the city. Air alerts for Kyiv and a nearby region were announced just minutes before the explosions were heard, and city authorities urged residents to stay in shelters. Saturday’s attacks were the first on Kyiv since September 21, when Ukrainian air defences downed a missile over the capital. Falling debris from the missile wounded seven people, including a child. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said earlier this week that Ukraine had deployed more Western air defence systems in anticipation of a second full winter of Russian attacks on energy facilities. Russian attacks last year hit Ukraine’s energy grid, leaving thousands without heating or electricity in freezing temperatures.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/11/ukraines-kyiv-comes-under-attack-for-first-time-in-months-mayor-says
Fighting rages on Ukraine front line as Russia goes on the offensive,Assaults on key town of Avdiivka continue as Putin visits Russian military headquarters for progress report on offensive.,"Russian forces have intensified their attacks on key points of the front line as they go on the offensive in Ukraine. Ukraine’s general staff reported late on Thursday that its military had repelled Russian assaults across the front earlier in the day, including around the strategic eastern towns of Avdiivka and Bakhmut as Moscow’s forces become more active following Kyiv’s counteroffensive over the summer. Ukrainian forces are reported to have repelled 11 attacks near Avdiivka, 15 in the Maryinka sector and 22 to the northeast in Bakhmut. Six attacks were repelled farther north near Kupiansk, the general staff said. As Moscow ramps up its offensive, President Vladimir Putin paid a surprise visit to Russia’s military headquarters for the campaign in Rostov-on-Don in southern Russia, the Kremlin said on Friday. The president surveyed plans and equipment on his second visit there in under a month. Russian troops have been bearing down on Avdiivka since mid-October. The industrial town’s position as a gateway to the provincial capital of Donetsk, 20km (12 miles) to the east makes it highly strategic. A press officer for Ukraine’s 3rd Separate Assault Brigade told the news outlet Espreso TV that Russian forces have been launching major infantry attacks. “It is not just infantry advancing but also parallel work of artillery, drones, aviation, the same air bombing and more,” he said. However, the officer said Russian forces have been unable to replenish supplies quickly and Ukrainian defensive positions were solid. The head of Avdiivka’s military administration told Espreso that Russian forces were shelling the town “round the clock” but wet ground from several days of rain was holding them back. “Once the ground dries, they will definitely advance,” he added. Russia’s Investigative Committee, in an account of the day’s fighting, said Ukrainian forces shelled the town of Skadovsk in a Russian-occupied area of the southern region of Kherson. The report said there were dead and wounded in the attack. Russia’s Ministry of Defence also reported strikes on Ukrainian troops and equipment near Bakhmut. Elsewhere, Ukraine’s military intelligence agency said on Friday that Ukrainian forces damaged two small Russian landing boats in Crimea during an overnight attack using sea drones. The statement said the vessels were crewed and loaded with armoured vehicles. The extent of the damage was not immediately clear. Meanwhile, the news agency RIA quoted Russia’s Defence Ministry as saying its air defences had brought down two Ukrainian drones over Crimea and one over the Tula region south of Moscow. Reports from both the Russian and Ukrainian sides could not be independently confirmed. As the fighting continues, Putin assessed the state of his country’s forces in Ukraine during his overnight visit to the Southern Military District headquarters in Rostov-on-Don. Video shared by a Russian state news agency showed him being greeted by Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu and Valery Gerasimov, chief of the general staff, late on Thursday. Putin was “introduced to new types of military equipment” and was informed about the progress of the war, his spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, according to the Russian state news agency Tass. The Russian president made the visit on the way back from a trip to Kazakhstan, where he aimed to cement ties with Russia’s former Soviet neighbour and major economic partner in the midst of tensions with the West over Ukraine.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/10/fighting-rages-on-ukraine-front-line-as-russia-goes-on-the-offensive
Ukraine sees NATO air technology as key to a breakthrough on the ground,"Air wars heat up over Ukraine as front-line battles hit a stalemate, while on the diplomatic front, the EU warms up to Kyiv.","Russia and Ukraine traded missile strikes in the 89th week of the war, using air power to overcome the perception that their forces on the ground had reached astalemate. “Russia controls the skies,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said during a news conference on November 4. Moscow had provided a reminder of that air superioritythe previous night, when it launched 40 Shahed drones against Ukraine, one of the largest salvoes in recent weeks. Ukraine said it shot down 24, but the remaining 16 struck critical infrastructure and civilian homes. Among the targets were a military facility in Ivano-Frankivsk and “infrastructure facilities” in Lviv and Odesa. Two nights later, Russia again showed its superior firepower with a combination of 22 Shahed drones and four missiles of various types. Ukraine said it shot down 15 drones and two of the missiles, but the general staff said the remainder destroyed port infrastructure in Odesa and civil infrastructure in Kherson city. That same night, Russia dropped 87 glide bombs into Kherson – the largest salvo of that munition so far in the war.  The worst strike came in broad daylight on November 3. More than 20 soldiers were reported killed by a Russian Iskander missile when ithit an award ceremonyfor the 128th Separate Assault Mountain Transcarpathian Brigade in Zaporizhia. “This is a tragedy that could have been avoided,” Zelenskyy said in a video address. Defence Minister Rustem Umerov ordered a full investigation. Ukraine, too, scored important successes in the air war. A Russian news outlet, Astra, said on November 1, four Ukrainian missiles hit a command post for the Dnipr group in the village of Strilkove, on the Arabat Spit off the east coast of Crimea, killing two soldiers and wounding three. Three days later, Ukraineseverely damageda Russian corvette while it lay in a shipyard in the port of Kerch. Later photographs showed it to be the Askold, a Karakurt-class Kalibr missile carrier. The Karakurt-class corvettes first went into construction in 2016 and are among Russia’s most modern, while the Zalyv shipyard, where the strike occurred, is one of three servicing the Black Sea Fleet. “The Zalyv shipyard is the largest shipyard in Eastern Europe and is likely the main repair facility for the [Black Sea Fleet] in Crimea following a successful Ukraine strike on the Russian state-owned ship repair facility Sevmorzavod in Sevastopol on September 13,” said the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank. The strike on the Askold “will likely render it inoperable for the foreseeable future”, the ISW said.  The Russian Ministry of Defence said Ukraine fired 15 missiles at the port, 13 of which had been shot down. There were other incidents that showed the high priority Ukraine placed on air strikes. Russian military reporters said Ukraine attacked Skadovsk in Kherson with missiles on the night of November 4 and struck the port of Berdyansk with Storm Shadow missiles on November 5. Russian sources also claimed that a salvo of Ukrainian drones targeting a railway in Crimea had been downed. All this air activity appeared to be trying to make up for the lack of any great movement on the ground. Ukrainian forces reported small gains near the eastern city of Bakhmut, which they are slowly trying to encircle, and a successful defence against a Russian attempt to encircle Avdiivka, to the south of Bakhmut. There was only one report of note – Russian military reporters said Ukraine had landed more troops on the left bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson and was operating a battalion-sized force of about 300 soldiers including armoured vehicles near the village of Krynky. There was much talk of stalemate during the week. Ukraine’s chief of staff kicked off the theme. “Just like in the First World War we have reached the level of technology that puts us into a stalemate,” Valery Zaluzhny was quoted as saying in an interview published alongside an article he wrote in The Economist. Zaluzhny said the Ukraine war was moving towards an attritional stage that benefited the side with deeper resources: “This will benefit Russia, allowing it to rebuild its military power, eventually threatening Ukraine’s armed forces and the state itself.” Both governments moved to erase the notion of stalemate. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied the war had reached a “dead end”, while Zelenskyy said, “Today time has passed and people are tired. But this is not a stalemate”, during a news conference with visiting European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen.  Reports suggest Ukraine’s soldiery is indeed exhausted from almost two years of constant fighting. Zaluzhny said that to break the stalemate Ukraine needed to gain control of the air. “Basic weapons, such as missiles and shells, remain essential. But Ukraine’s armed forces need key military capabilities and technologies to break out of this kind of war. The most important one is air power,” he wrote. Igor Girkin, the Russian commander who formed and led the separatist Donetsk militia in 2014, feared this Western superiority in air technology in an analysis dated October 26. Russian troops, too, are exhausted, he said, and unable to conduct “even limited offensive operations”, as evidenced in the failure of the Avdiivka offensive. “Our troops will have to spend the rest of the autumn-winter campaign on the defensive, trying to the best of their ability to eliminate emerging operational crises,” he wrote. “Worse, by the spring of next year, our active army will probably be even less capable of offensive operations than it is now, and the enemy will be seriously strengthened in military-technical terms, which will allow him to continue to try to control the strategic initiative.” Zelenskyy told the Reuters NEXT conference that Ukraine had a battle plan for next year that included “concrete directions where we can go”. Both sides were busy resupplying themselves with ordnance, but Ukraine also hopes for a qualitative leap by spring, when it expects to receive F-16 fighter jets from Western arsenals converting to the fifth-generation F-35. These, it hopes, supplied with US air-to-air missiles, will finally give it mastery of its airspace and an edge in the Black Sea. But the Ukrainian leader dismissed calls for a March 2024 election, when Russia is to hold one. Reuters quoted unnamed Russian sources as saying Putin has decided to run for a fifth presidential term. On November 6, Reuters quoted unnamed sources in the European Commission saying Von der Leyenwouldsupport inviting Ukraine to start EU membership talks at the December summit of the European Council. Ukraine expected a positive report from the Commission towards Council members, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Olha Stefanishyna said. “I would say that the assessment would definitely be positive because we have been in permanent contact with the European Commission, discussing the steps and negotiating the steps we managed to implement,” Stefanishyna told Reuters. She said Ukraine had carried out all seven steps deemed necessary for a positive invitation. Three days earlier, Von der Leyen had praised Ukraine for its progress towards EU-mandated reforms and said she was “confident” of Ukraine’s soon reaching the “next stage” of the process of accession. “I must say you have made excellent progress,” she told Zelenskyy during their joint news conference in Kyiv. There may also have been another convergence in the offing between Ukraine and Brussels. Ukraine’s deputy justice minister said European Union leaders were considering allowing the proceeds from frozen Russian assets to be used to assist Ukraine – a long-standing Ukrainian demand. Approximately $300bn in Russian assets were in European hands, and their proceeds amounted to $3.6bn since the war began, said Iryna Mudra.

Why are US Republicans pushing for aid to Israel but not Ukraine?,Experts say a fractured Republican Party is increasingly turning away from Ukraine in favour of support for Israel.,"As wars continue to rage in both Ukraine and Gaza, another battle is playing out in the United States Congress: over which country should receive aid money. In recent months, congressional Republicans have expressedincreasing scepticismtowards approving more funds for the government of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as his country seeks to repel afull-scale Russian invasion. But that opposition has grown since thestart of the Israel-Hamas waron October 7, with some Republicans positioning aid for Israel and Ukraine as an either-or proposition. “Israel is facing [an] existential threat. Any funding for Ukraine should be redirected to Israel immediately,” Republican Senator Josh Hawleyposted on social mediatwo days after the war began. Experts say that disparate approach — with stronger Republican backing for aidto Israelthan to Ukraine — signals the growing power of the party’s hard-right flank. “Omitting aid for Ukraine is a concession to the far right of the Republican Party,” Richard F Bensel, a government studies professor at Cornell University, told Al Jazeera. Ukraine, he added, “has neither the emotional appeal of a religious ally nor the geopolitical importance of Israel, and the differences between the two issues reflect deeper divisions within the Republican Party between secular rationalism and sectarian emotionalism”. The debate over foreign aid comes amid turmoil within the Republican caucus, which struggled last monthto elect a speakerto lead the House of Representatives. After weeks ofinternal fighting, religious conservativeMike Johnsonfinally won the gavel on October 25, in an apparent victory for hardline and evangelical interests. One of Johnson’s first moves was to introduce a bill that included nearly $14.5bn in support for Israel but zero dollars for Ukraine.It passedthe Republican-controlled House by a vote of 226 to 196, only to be shut down in the Democrat-led Senate on Tuesday. Robert Y Shapiro, a political science professor at Columbia University, said the failed bill points to the continued sway former President Donald Trump holds over the Republican Party. Trump is currently theRepublican frontrunnerin the 2024 presidential race. During his time in office, he championed an“America First” foreign policythat saw the US withdraw from certain international agreements, in favour of a more isolationist stance. “This [bill] is clearly a show for the Trump base of the Republican Party, which opposes anything related to Ukraine,” Shapiro said. Trump, he explained, has lingering resentment towardsUkraine. After all, questions over whether Trumpillegally withheld military aidto Ukraine led to hisfirst impeachment. And then there was Trump’s cosy relationship with Ukraine’s adversary,Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he praised on several occasions. Since leaving office, Trump has remained critical of aid to Ukraine. In campaign stops for his reelection bid, he called on Congress to cut off military assistance to the country, accusing it of paying “millions of dollars” to the “Biden crime family” — a reference to his Democratic rival,President Joe Biden. Trump is hardly the first leader to push for more isolationism in US foreign policy: The sentiment was particularly strong after World War I, as the country tried to disentangle itself from continued tensions in Europe. But Stephen Zunes, a professor of politics and international studies at the University of San Francisco, told Al Jazeera that isolationism is making a comeback. “Recent years have witnessed a growing segment of the Republican Party moving away from its more overtly imperialistic and interventionist foreign policy to a more isolationist foreign policy,” Zunes said. However, the strong Christian leanings in the Republican Party allow for a more easy embrace of aid requests for Israel. “An exception is made for Israel, in large part due to the strong influence of fundamentalist Christians who believe that the modern state of Israel is the manifestation of Biblical Israel and therefore is in God’s favour,” Zunes explained. Aid to Ukraine still hasprominent supportersamong the Republican Party, including Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell. He called for military assistance to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan to be packaged together, along with greater funds forUS border security. “We view all of these problems as connected,” McConnell told reporters at an October 31 press conference. But US views overall are shifting towards the war in Ukraine, with Republican voters in particular retreating from their initial support for the embattled country. AGallup pollreleased on November 2 found that 41 percent of Americans believe their country is “doing too much” to help Ukraine, up from 29 percent this June. The belief is most common among Republicans, 62 percent of whom agreed with that statement. Some experts point to the prevalence ofwar fatigueamong the American public. The war in Ukraine has stretched on for months since its start in February 2022, arriving at a seemingdeadlock. But the Israel-Hamas war is new. It was sparked on October 7 with asurprise attackfrom the Palestinian group Hamas, and it has continued over the last month with thesteady Israeli bombardmentof the Gaza Strip. The US public has responded with large-scale protests in favour of Israeli and Palestinian causes.One pro-Palestinian marchon Saturday brought thousands of people to Washington, DC, flooding Freedom Plaza. “Part of [the issue] is that newer conflicts will get more attention than ongoing conflicts,” Zunes said. “Another is that the Gaza War is more violent. Israel has killed more Palestinian civilians during the past month than Russia has killed Ukrainian civilians in the past 20 months.” Zunes also noted that Israel “plays an important role in advancing US strategic interests in the greater Middle East”, making support for the country more pressing. With withering Republican support for Ukraine, Democrats have largely helmed the push to bundle aid for the two countries together. In October, President Biden called on Congress to approve a$105bn supplemental funding request, which included $61.4bn for Ukraine and $14.3bn for Israel. But as Congress approaches its November 17 deadline to pass budget legislation — or else risk a government shutdown — experts suspect Biden’s funding request isunlikely to pass. What’s more, the 2024 presidential race is heating up, with polls showing Biden and Trump neck and neck. Foreign aid will likely be one of many flashpoints. “We won’t see a compromise between Democrats and Republicans,” Shapiro, the Columbia professor, told Al Jazeera. “The Republicans will almost certainly ultimately come together in opposing all things Democratic in the 2024 election.” Bensel, meanwhile, spoke to the increasingpolarisationacross the political landscape. Not only does theRepublican-controlled Housebutt heads with the president’s agenda, but it is also at odds with theDemocratic majorityin the Senate. “The disagreements between the administration and the House of Representatives — and between the two chambers of Congress — are clearly driven by the very serious partisan divisions in the nation at large,” Bensel said. That political impasse is not necessarily new, he added. “What is abnormal is the apparently irreconcilable split within the Republican Party in the House of Representatives.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/8/why-are-us-republicans-pushing-for-aid-to-israel-but-not-ukraine
Ukraine says Russia struck civilian ship near Odesa,"A missile has hit a civilian vessel in the Black Sea region, killing one and injuring four, the army says.","Russia has fired a missile at a Liberia-flagged civilian ship entering a port in the Black Sea region ofOdesa, according to the Ukrainian army. A harbour pilot was killed and four of the ship’s crew were injured in the attack on Wednesday. “The missile hit the structure of a civilian vessel flying the Liberian flag as it was entering the port,” the army said. “Three crew members, citizens of the Philippines, were injured, one of them was hospitalised. The pilot was killed and another port worker was injured,” it added. Since a United Nations-brokered deal guaranteeing safe passage for civilian shipsfell through in July, both Kyiv and Moscow have ramped up military activity and attacks in the Black Sea. “Continuing the terror of civilian shipping, the enemy insidiously fired an Kh-31P anti-radar missile in the direction of one of the ports of Odesa region from tactical aircraft in the Black Sea,” the Ukrainian army said. The collapse of the UN-backed grain export dealprompted Moscow to warnthat any ships entering Ukrainian ports could be viewed as potential military targets. Ukraine subsequently announced the launch of a new “humanitarian corridor” – a sea route for civilian ships – that avoids international waters. But Russia has continued to attack Ukraine’s grain-exporting ports and infrastructure. EU membership prospects On Wednesday, the European Union’s executiverecommendedopening formal membership talks with Ukraine, as soon as it meets final conditions, in a major show of support for Kyiv in itsbattle against Russia. “This is a strong and historic step that paves the way to a stronger EU with Ukraine as its member,” Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyposted on social media. Zelenskyy also said that Ukraine would still try to deliver battlefield results by the end of the year and that he remained sure Kyiv would eventually have success in the war despite difficulties at the front. Acknowledging the slow progress of Kyiv’s counteroffensive in the occupied south, in an interview by video link at the Reuters NEXT conference in New York, he also touted a Ukrainian battlefield plan for 2024 that he said he could not disclose. His tone contrasted with the gloomier assessment last week of his commander-in-chief who said the fighting now in its 21st month might be heading towards a deadlock and a war of attrition that could play into Russia’s hands.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/8/ukraine-says-russia-struck-civilian-ship-near-odesa
Russia turns to buybacks to resupply forces deployed in Ukraine: WSJ,"The Wall Street Journal reports that Russia is engaging in export requisitions and buybacks to boost its depleting arsenal, as it continues its invasion of Ukraine.","Russia is trying to get back parts of defence systems it had exported in an attempt to restock for its invasion of Ukraine, the Wall Street Journal hasreported. In an article published on Wednesday, the US-based newspaper reported – citing three people with knowledge of the encounter – that Russian officials visited Cairo in April and asked Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to return more than 100 engines from Russian helicopters. The sources claimed Sisi gave the green light and the deliveries will likely begin in December. An Egyptian government spokesman declined to comment to the WSJ. Al Jazeera was not able to independently verify the claims. Cairo has maintained some arms trade ties with Russia, to which the US has acquiesced. According to the newspaper, Moscow has also contacted Pakistani, Belarusian and Brazilian officials to try to recover engines and transport helicopters its forces lost to Ukrainian defences early on in the war. “Russia spent decades building its arms trade,” one source said, according to the WSJ. “Now they’re going back in secret to their customers trying to buy back what they sold them.” As well as buying back weapons, Russia is understood to be stepping up domestic production. Russian officials have rejected repeated Western claims its supplies are shrinking and steered clear of announcing specifics regarding its arsenal and domestic production. The war in Ukraine began on February 24, 2022, and has claimed tens of thousands of lives – mostly soldiers on both sides, devastated the country, and sent diplomatic ties between the West and Moscow to historic lows. WSJ reporter Evan Gershkovich is currently detained in Russia, accused of spying. He and his paper deny the allegations. In its report on Wednesday, the WSJ also alleged that Russia has received more munitions from partners, including North Korea – aclaimmade earlier this month by South Korea and denied by Pyongyang. Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Russia officiallypulled outof the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE), an international security pact that restricts the use of conventional weapons, saying NATO’s expansion has made such cooperation impossible. As for Ukraine’s weapons supplies, military analysts have said Kyiv’s counteroffensive has so far failed because the West is failing to send arms in an efficient manner. “Strategic objectives have not been achieved this year, and it’s hardly possible” in the remaining months, Lieutenant General Ihor Romanenko, former deputy chief of the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, told Al Jazeera. Heblamed Western alliesfor months-long delays of weaponry and a reluctance to supply more sophisticated arms.

Ukraine gets European Commission nod to start EU membership talks,Ukraine’s president hails move as ‘strong and historic step’ that paves way to a stronger EU.,"The European Union’s executive has recommended opening formal membership talks with Ukraine, as soon as it meets final conditions, in a major show of support for Kyiv in itsbattle against Russia. “This is a strong and historic step that paves the way to a stronger EU with Ukraine as its member,” Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyposted on social media on Wednesday. “Our country must be in the European Union. Ukrainians deserve it both for their defence of European values and for the fact that even in times of full-scale war, we keep our word,” he said. The European Commission, which also paved the way for discussions to begin with Moldova, recommended that the talks should formally be launched once Ukraine satisfies remaining conditions related to reining in corruption, adopting a law on lobbying in line with EU standards and strengthening national minority safeguards. “Today is a historic day,” commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. “Ukraine continues to face tremendous hardship and tragedy provoked by Russia’s war of aggression, and yet the Ukrainians are deeply reforming their country.” Ukraine launched its bid to become part of the EU after Moscow’s invasion in February 2022 and was officially named a candidate to join in June that year. Former Soviet republicMoldovahad applied at the same time as Ukraine. Moldovan President Maia Sandu thanked Brussels and said her country was “firmly on the path for EU membership and we will continue working relentlessly towards this goal”. The EU’s 27 leaders still have to sign off on the recommendations at a summit in December, and the membership process is contingent upon the completion of required reforms with regular progress assessments as part of a long and vigorous process. Brussels also suggested member states grantGeorgiacandidate status. “I rejoice with the people of Georgia,” Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili wrote online. Balkan country Bosnia and Herzegovina did not get approval yet again, having come short on expected membership criteria, von der Leyen said. Other EU hopefuls includeTurkey, which began accession talks in 2005, but those are at a dead end. Albania, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia are also stuck in negotiations. Thewar in Ukrainehas breathed new life into the EU’s stalled push to take on new members as the bloc looks to keep Russian and Chinese influence at bay. The commission in June last year set Kyiv seven reform benchmarks to complete, including tackling corruption and curbing oligarch power, before talks should start. Von der Leyen said Ukraine had now completed “well over 90 percent of the necessary steps”. The positive signal from the EU provides a vital boost to Ukraine at a difficult time. However, whether EU countries will be ready by December to approve the talks with the war-torn country of more than 40 million people is uncertain.

G7 ‘united’ on Ukraine as Russia warns over Western ‘aggression’,The G7 hopes to assure Ukraine of support amid the Gaza war as Russia says Western policies endanger the world.,"TheGroup of Seven(G7) has reiterated its unwavering support for Ukraine as the Israel-Hamas conflict threatens to take the focus off Russia’s invasion. However, Moscow remains defiant, claiming that Western “aggression” risks global catastrophe. The foreign ministers of the leading industrial democracies said on Wednesday that they had gathered in Japan seeking to “speak … with one clear voice” and forge a consensus amid two serious conflicts and other crises around the world. “Our steadfast commitment to supporting Ukraine’s fight for its independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity will never waver … we further call on China not to assist Russia in its war against Ukraine,” the ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union, said in a statement. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned that amid the war in Gaza, his country’s continuing defence against the Russian invasion must not slip out of focus. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba joined the G7 meeting by video conference. With the war approaching its third year, Ukraine is braced for a Russian winter offensivetargeting energy infrastructure, with more than 60 attacks in recent weeks, Ukraine’s energy ministry said. The Kremlin, meanwhile, warned on Wednesday that the West’s aggressive behaviour could lead to catastrophe. Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev said that the “destructive” policies of the United States and its allies were increasing the risk that nuclear, chemical or biological weapons would be used. “The natural consequence of the United States’ destructive policies is the deterioration in the global security,” Patrushev said, according to state news agency TASS. “The risk that nuclear, chemical and biological weapons will be used is increasing,” Patrushev said. “The internationalarms control regime has been undermined,” he added, claiming that Ukraine had tried to attack three Russian nuclear power plants. “We have a doctrine where everything is clearly spelled out. There are no changes. This is confirmed by the president,” Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov said when asked to clarify Patrushev’s remarks. Patrushev also warned of a wider Western colonial agenda, claiming that more countries are falling victim to Western exploitation. The opening of formal EU membership talks was recommended for Moldova and Ukraine on Wednesday, with Georgia to be awarded candidate status. Patrushev said Moldova is “on a path to lose its sovereignty and risks becoming another victim of Western colonialism”. Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also joined the criticism, accusing the West of provoking crises in the global markets. He blamed boycotts on Russian energy and a self-serving rush to switch to green energy for hurting global energy security. Meanwhile, he reported that efforts to renegotiate the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which allowed Ukrainian exports by sea, have broken down again. The deal, brokered by the United Nations and Turkey last year, allowed Ukraine to safely export grain and deliver much-needed grain all over the world. However, Russia withdrew in July, saying the arrangement was not delivering grain to the poorest countries, and discriminated against its own exports of grain and fertiliser. Since the deal was scrapped, Russia has concentrated fire on Ukrainian grain storage and port facilities.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/8/russia-defiant-against-colonialist-west
Car bomb kills Russia-backed politician in east Ukraine,Mikhail Filiponenko had been engaged in Luhansk’s pro-Russian separatist movement since 2014.,"Ukraine said it carried out a special operation to kill a Russia-backed politician who died as a car bomb exploded in eastern Ukraine. The assassination is the latest in a series of attacks against separatists and Moscow-installed officials in the Ukrainian regions to which the Kremlin lays claim. Mikhail Filiponenko, a deputy in the Russia-backed parliament in occupied Luhansk, was killed on Wednesday after an “explosive device detonated” in his car, his son told the Luhansk Information Centre news agency. Filiponenko, who had been engaged in Luhansk’s pro-Russian separatist movement since 2014, previously acted as one of the top commanders in the army of the so-called Luhansk People’s Republic. In September, he was voted into the regional assembly in a poll that sparked broad international condemnation. Ukraine’s military intelligence agency said it conducted the operation with resistance forces in Luhansk. “A special operation to eliminate Filiponenko was implemented jointly with representatives of the resistance movement. As a result of the morning explosion, Filiponenko died on the spot,” it said on the messaging app Telegram. Luhansk is one of four Ukrainian regions Russia said it annexed last year, despite not exerting full military control in the areas. Russian media shared photos of what they said was Filiponenko’s battered vehicle on the side of the road, with traces of blood on the seats. ☠️🧨 Explosão em carro mata ex-comandante da Milícia Popular de Lugansk Mikhail Filiponenko, deputado do Conselho da RPL, ex-comandante da Milícia Popular da república, morreu em resultado de uma explosão em seu carro, esclareceu o Centro de Informações de Lugansk.pic.twitter.com/kqrpch00hA — Sputnik Brasil (@sputnik_brasil)November 8, 2023  Several high-profile backers of Russia’s assault on Ukraine and Moscow-installed officials in territory seized by Russian forces have been attacked since the conflict started last February. Last month Oleg Tsaryov, a pro-Kremlin politician that Moscow was reportedly prepping to head a pro-Russian government in Kyiv, survived being shot in his hotel complex on the annexed peninsula of Crimea. Moscow has accused Ukrainian secret services of carrying out that and several other attacks, including the car bombing of nationalist Darya Dugina outside Moscow last year and the bombing of military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky in a Saint Petersburg cafe in April. Kyiv has given no immediate comment after Wednesday’s bombing. Russia and Ukraine have been locked in a bloody 20-month war since Moscow sent troops to invade the neighbouring country in February 2022. There have since been hundreds of thousands of casualties on each side.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/8/russia-backed-deputy-in-east-ukraine-killed-in-car-bomb-local-media

‘Strategic objectives not achieved’: Has Ukraine’s counteroffensive failed?,Ukraine hoped to unleash punishing counterattacks on invading Russian troops. Experts explain why the push did not live up to expectations.,"Kyiv, Ukraine –Referring to the Soviet puzzle video game, Alla says her husband kills Russian soldiers as though he is playing “human Tetris”. “A drone hangs in the sky, and he watches [them] crawl across the forest,” she told Al Jazeera. “And he kills them. And then they crawl again.” The war in Ukraine has turned Avdiivka, where Alla’s husband is stationed, into a maze of ruins, trenches and tunnels surrounded by burned-down fields and patches of forest studded with landmines, explosion craters and remnants of Russian soldiers and armoured vehicles. Avdiivka sits 20km (12 miles) north of separatist Donetsk, wedged deep into occupied areas. Ukraine has held it since 2014. But it is nearly surrounded, and Ukrainian forces may have to leave it after weeks of bombardment with 500kg (1,100-pound) gliding bombs and storms that killed thousands on both sides. The surrender may become a sobering, pessimistic end of this year’s counteroffensive campaign, that began in June along the crescent-shaped, 1,000km-long (621-mile) front line in eastern and southern Ukraine. Last year, Ukrainian forces liberated almost 75,000 sq km (30,000 sq miles), an area the size of the United Arab Emirates, according to the Institute for the Study of War, a think tank in Washington, DC. Kyiv had said it wanted to reach the Sea of Azov to cut the “land bridge” between the Russian mainland and annexed Crimea. But Russian forces spent months building defence lines and planting thousands of landmines across no-man’s land. They also rule the air and airwaves with their planes, Lancet kamikaze drones, and radio-jamming systems that paralyse and disorient Ukrainian unmanned vehicles. Meanwhile, the F-16 fighter jets the West pledged to supply will take months to arrive – and their future pilots will spend many more months on training. So far this year, Kyiv has lost some 487 square kilometres (188 sq miles), according to a calculation by The New York Times published in late September. The results are disappointing due to several factors, military analysts say. “Strategic objectives have not been achieved this year, and it’s hardly possible” in the remaining months, Lieutenant General Ihor Romanenko, former deputy chief of the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, told Al Jazeera. He blamed Western allies for months-long delays of weaponry and a reluctance to supply more sophisticated arms. “Weaponry should be supplied on time, not the way our allies are doing it,” he said. Ukrainian “generals asked [for certain arms] a year ago, but they still didn’t supply even the types of arms that had been agreed upon.” Ukrainian top brass have long complained about the delays that Western officials say are caused by logistical hurdles. Meanwhile, the war has morphed into WWI-like positional warfare that exhausts both sides in terms of manpower and economy. “This is not our war because resources-wise, economically, Russia looks stronger and has a four-fold advantage in manpower,” Romanenko said. Russia’s population stands at 143 million, but millions of Ukrainian nationals live in annexed Crimea and other occupied areas of eastern and southern Ukraine. Ukraine’s current population is between 29 and 33 million, according to different estimates. And even though men aged 18 to 60 are not allowed to leave Ukraine, and several waves of mobilisation had hundreds of thousands drafted, heavy losses have bled Ukrainian forces dry. “Obviously, there isn’t enough manpower,” Romanenko said. He said there should be tougher measures to register all men of fighting age and classify them according to their fitness for combat. Meanwhile, some younger Ukrainians dodge the draft any way they can. “I got a summons, it was stuck in my [apartment] door,” Boris, a 21-year-old university student in Kyiv, told Al Jazeera. “I have kept it there for two months so that it looks like no one lives in the apartment.” Ukraine’s commander-in-chief reportedly admitted that the counteroffensive had reached a “stalemate”. “Just like in the first world war we have reached the level of technology that puts us into a stalemate,” he told The Economist on November 1. “There will most likely be no deep and beautiful breakthrough.” Nikolay Mitrokhin, of Germany’s Bremen University, told Al Jazeera that Ukraine paid too dearly, with Western-supplied arms spent during “meaningless” frontal assaults on enemy lines. “A part of Western equipment burned down in meaningless attempts to break through that ended with the liberation of half a dozen ruined villages.” The counteroffensive brought with it huge casualties among Ukrainian servicemen – especially the Western-trained units that were withdrawn from the eastern towns ofBakhmutand Soledar – Russia’s last sizeable territorial gains last year. While there are no reliable official figures of casualties, tens of thousands of soldiers on both sides are understood to have been killed in the war this year. “Russian defence ground down the attack brigades that had been trained for at least six months and for whose salvation Bakhmut and Soledar were abandoned,” Mitrokhin said. Meanwhile, the Kremlin managed to avoid the collapse of Russia’s economy. “Russia has used comprehensive stimuli of investment, credit and budget – from affordable mortgages to the military-industrial complex,” Kyiv-based analyst Alexey Kushch told Al Jazeera. Moscow’s strategy of affordable credits and “replacing import” in response to Western sanctions triggered the mushrooming of domestic businesses, he said. In comparison with Russia, Ukraine’s economy is “hanging by a thread of foreign aid”, Kushch said. “There are no programmes of internal development, monetary policies are aimed at restriction of domestic credits,” he said. The economic backbone of Russia is hydrocarbon exports, and it can only be broken if the “entire world will stop buying Russian oil and gas,” said Sergey Bizyukin, an exiled opposition activist from the western city of Ryazan. “And yes, defence factories in Ryazan, where the technological base has traditionally been strong, work at a full throttle, and there’s only a lack of workforce,” he told Al Jazeera. But regardless of how small Kyiv’s gains are, they “shouldn’t be underestimated” – in the words of Rybar, a pro-Russian Telegram channel with 1.2m subscribers. Ukrainian forces are expanding their toehold on the left bank of the Dnipro river in the southern Kherson region, a gateway to Crimea, it said. Supported by swarms of drones, Ukrainians ferried armoured vehicles and some 300 servicemen to the village of Krynki earlier this month, Rybar said. “Krynki is ours,” Ukrainian war veteran Yevgen Dikyi said in televised remarks.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/7/russia-looks-stronger-and-has-a-four-fold-advantage-in-manpower
Blinken seeks G7 unity on Israel-Hamas war,"Top diplomats of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, the US and the EU are gathering amid two serious conflicts.","After a whirlwind tour of the Middle East, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has shifted his intense diplomacy on theIsrael-Hamas warto Asia with an appeal for the Group of Seven (G7) leading industrial democracies to forge consensus on how to deal with the crisis. As he and his G7 counterparts began two days of talks in Japan, Blinken said it was important for the group to show unity – as it has over Russia’s war in Ukraine and other major issues – and prevent existing differences on Gaza from deepening. “This is a very important moment as well for the G7 to come together in the face of this crisis and to speak, as we do, with one clear voice,” Blinken told Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa, shortly after talks with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. The devastating monthlong conflict in Gaza and efforts to ease the dire humanitarian impacts of the Israeli assault will be a major focus of the meeting. Yet with the Russia-Ukraine war, fears North Korea may be readying a new nuclear test, and concerns about China’s increasing global assertiveness, it is far from the only crisis on the agenda. In Tokyo, Blinken and foreign ministers from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and Italy will be seeking common ground in part to prevent the Gaza war from further destabilising already shaky security in the broader Middle East and seeking to maintain existing positions on other matters. Israel, after a surprise attack on October 7 by Hamas – the group that rules Gaza, and that on October 7 and in its aftermath killed more than 1,400 people in Israel – has waged a monthlong assault on Gaza, relentlessly bombarding the enclave and sending in ground forces for the first time since 2014. Israeli attacks have during this timekilledmore than 10,000 Palestinians, more than a third of them children, according to Gaza’s officials, while displacing 1.5 million people and decimating much of the territory’s infrastructure.    An early consensus on Gaza appeared to be building as at least four of the G7 members made statements in favour of a strong common stance. Kishida said “the unity of G7 is needed more than ever with the situation in Israel and Palestine, the situation in Ukraine, and the challenges in the Indo-Pacific region,” his office said in a statement, adding that the prime minister “highly appreciates the leadership and diplomatic efforts by the Biden administration concerning this issue”. “You have our utmost support,” Kamikawa told Blinken, the top diplomat in the administration of United States President Joe Biden. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said that “as G7 countries, we are making clear that Israel has the right and the duty to protect its population and its people in the framework of international law”. She said that she has been discussing with many partners “how we can finally get humanitarian ceasefires off the ground, in terms of time and also geographically”. United Kingdom Foreign Secretary James Cleverly told journalists his government only supports a time and geographically specific “humanitarian pause” and not a wider ceasefire. “Firstly, we have seen and heard absolutely nothing that makes us believe that Hamas leadership is serious about [a] ceasefire,” he said, adding that a ceasefire would hamper Israel’s ability to defend itself. The US has provided firm backing to Israel, offering it a $14.5bnmilitary aid packageamid the war and voting with it against a “humanitarian truce” at the United Nations General Assembly last month. France voted in favour of the “humanitarian truce” while all other G7 member countries abstained. Blinken has said Washington is working “very aggressively” to expand aid for trapped civilians in Gaza. “I think we will see in the days ahead that the assistance can expand in significant ways,” Blinken said on Monday, without providing details. Another focus of the G7 meet-up will be Russia’s war in Ukraine, which has lost global attention due to the bloodshed in Gaza. The G7 was expected to stick to firm language condemning Moscow and reaffirm its commitment to Ukraine. “Our commitment to continue strict sanctions against Russia and strong support for Ukraine has not wavered at all, even as the situation in the Middle East intensifies,” Japan’s FM Kamikawa told a news conference before the meeting. The gathering will include a virtual meeting with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. The G7 has been at the forefront of sanctions on Russia since Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. In the latest move aimed at ramping up economic pressure on Russia, the group is considering proposals to impose sanctions on Russian diamonds. UK Foreign Secretary Cleverly is set to meet Kamikawa on the sidelines of the gathering to discuss intensifying military cooperation with Japan under a new pact that allows their countries’ militaries to enter each other’s territories for joint exercises. These talks, also featuring UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps and Japan’s Defence Minister Minoru Kihara, are likely to include expanding joint exercises and cooperation in new areas such as space and cybersecurity, based on the Japan-UKHiroshima Accordreached in May. Japan in December announced a new mid- to long-term security strategy to build up its security and defence – including counterstrike capability – in a significant shift from its self-defence-only principle adopted after the last world war. Foreign ministers of five Central Asian countries are also expected to participate online in the Tokyo gathering, as the grouping aims to deepen ties to the region amid the Ukraine war. Ministers of former Soviet nations Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan will join for talks on Wednesday. G7 leaders have recently increased outreach to these resource-rich countries, with French President Emmanuel Macronmaking stopsin Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan last week during his Central Asia tour, and Japanese PM Kishida planning a similar trip in 2024.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/7/g7-foreign-ministers-hold-talks-in-japan-israel-gaza

Ukraine’s Zelenskyy says war complicates plans for 2024 elections,The Ukrainian president says talk of polls is ‘irresponsible’ while the country is fighting a Russian invasion.,"Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyysays discussions about the fate of scheduled 2024 elections are irresponsible as the country is locked in a war with invading Russian forces. Speaking in a video address on Monday, Zelenskyy said Ukraine must remain focused on itsmilitary challengesand stay united. “We all understand that now, in wartime, when there are many challenges, it is utterly irresponsible to engage in topics related to an election in such a frivolous manner,” Zelenskyy said. “We need to recognise that this is a time for defence, a time for battle, upon which the fate of the state and its people depend. … I believe that elections are not appropriate at this time.”    Ukraine is currently undermartial lawas it battles Russian forces, whom Kyiv hopes to expel from its territory. But as the war drags on, Zelenskyy has considered whether a special provision could be invoked to hold elections. Over the weekend, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the president was considering the positives and negatives of holding elections during a time when large swathes of the country remain affected by fighting. As Ukraine battles to maintain the support of Western allies such as the United States, some, such as US Senator Lindsey Graham, have called for the elections to proceed as planned to demonstrate Ukraine’s commitment to democracy. Zelenskyy alsoplayed downconcerns recently that the war with Russia has reached a deadlock.    “Time has passed, people are tired, …. but this is not a stalemate,” Zelenskyy said at a news conference on Saturday in Kyiv with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. “No one among our partners is pressuring us to sit down with Russia, talk to it and give it something,” he added.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/6/ukraines-zelensky-says-war-complicates-plans-for-2024-elections
Russia bombards Ukrainian grain port Odesa,,"Russian forces have bombarded Ukraine’s port city of Odesa with missiles and drones. Four missiles and 22 attack drones were launched from the occupied region of Crimea of Ukraine at the Black Sea port late on Sunday, Ukraine’s air force reported on Monday. The attacks injured at least eight people, destroyed grain, and damaged the 124-year-old Odesa Fine Arts Museum. “Fifteen Shaheds and one Kh-59 air guided missile were shot down,” the Ukrainian air force said, referring to the Iranian-designed kamikaze unmanned aerial vehicle. Ukrainian Presidential Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak posted images on social media of the aftermath of the strike, vowing retribution for the attack. “This is their despicable answer to the reality – the Ukrainian Crimea will be demilitarised, without the Black Sea fleet and military bases of the Russians,” he said. Ukraine has recently ramped up strikes on the Russian naval base at Sevastopol. Meanwhile, Russian air attacks have intensified in recent weeks, with infrastructure a particular target ahead of the winter. Odesa, Ukraine’s main grain port, has also been targeted since earlier in the year when Moscow pulled out of a deal that allowed Ukrainian grain exports through the Black Sea. Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said 20 residential buildings, the Odesa Fine Arts Museum and infrastructure facilities were damaged. A warehouse and trucks with grain caught fire, which was promptly extinguished. The museum, where walls and windows were damaged, housed before the war more than 10,000 pieces of art, including paintings by some of the best-known Russian and Ukrainian artists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. “On November 6, the Odesa National Art Museum turns 124 years old,” Oleh Kiper, governor of the Odesa region, of which the Odesa city is the administrative centre, said on the Telegram messaging app. “On the eve of November 6, the Russians ‘congratulated’ our architectural monument with a missile that hit nearby.” Eight people were injured during the attack. PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyreiterated his request for Western support ahead of the harsh winter months, and for air defence systems especially, in a televised interview with US network NBC News on Sunday.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/6/russian-aerial-attack-damages-odesa-national-art-museum
Ukraine orders investigation after Russian attack on brigade ceremony,President Volodymyr Zelenskyy promises ‘complete truth’ after at least 20 soldiers killed in Russian missile attack.,"Ukraine has begun a criminal investigation after a group of soldiers attending an “award ceremony” not far from the front line in the southern Zaporizhia region were killed in a Russian missile attack. At least 20 soldiers were reported to have been killed in the incident on Friday in Zarichne, according to local media. Zaporizhia Governor Yuriy Malashko said nine civilians were also injured in the attack on the village, which is about 16km (10 miles) from the front line. “This is a tragedy that could have been avoided,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in aspeechlate on Sunday. “A criminal investigation has been registered into the tragedy,” he added, saying the intention was to uncover the “complete truth” about what happened to ensure such incidents were not repeated. The Ukrainian Armed Forces confirmed on Saturday that several soldiers from its 128th Mountain Assault Brigade had been killed in a missile strike the day before, but did not provide casualty figures. “[Russia] fired an Iskander-M missile at the personnel of the 128th Mountain Assault Brigade, killing the soldiers and causing injuries of varying severity to local residents,” the army said. Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said in a social media statement the same day that he had ordered a “full investigation” into what had happened. Zelenskyy said Umerov had briefed him on the measures taken to clarify the circumstances of the attack, who was specifically involved and what orders were given. The New York Times, citing a military official who was not named because they were not authorised to speak to the media, said that any investigation was likely to focus on how Russia had found out about the event and been enabled to attack it. By holding the ceremony in the open, senior brigade members appeared to have breached military regulations, the official added. One Ukrainian soldier said on social media that 22 people from the brigade had been killed, criticising commanders for having held the ceremony. The event was organised to commemorate Artillery Day, which took place on Friday. “Everyone is writing that ‘Heroes died’. Although it is more appropriate to write ‘Heroes became victims’,” soldier Ivan Savytskyy said. “They became victims of military rudimentary traditionalism in its worst form,” he said. In its daily updates on battlefield developments, the Russian defence ministry said only that Russian forces had “inflicted fire” on a unit of Ukraine’s assault brigade in Zaporizhia, killing as many as 30 soldiers.    Russia and Ukraine have often underestimated their own military casualties in the 20-month-long war and exaggerated the losses they claim to have inflicted on each other. Ukraine’s western Zakarpattia region, where the 128th assault brigade is based, will observe a three-day mourning period from Monday, local Governor Viktor Mykyta said. “Our heroes are alive as long as the memory of them and their deeds lives on,” he said. Amid little apparent movement along the nearly 1,000km (620 mile) front line, Zelenskyy hasrejectedsuggestions that the conflict is at a deadlock, urging allies to continue their support even as theIsrael-Gaza wardraws increasing attention. In his statement on Sunday, Zelenskyy sought to reassure Ukrainians about the conflict. “When we go through weeks like this, filled with pain and difficult discussions, it is important for people to understand that what weighs on their hearts is seen, and the necessary changes will be made,” the president said. “This applies to many things, from negligence that can occur to the Soviet legacy and the terrible bureaucracy that prevents Ukraine and many in our defence forces from realising their potential correctly and effectively.” Zelenskyy promised that the investigation into the attack would provide “honest answers” for the soldiers’ families as well as the wider Ukrainian society.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/6/ukraine-orders-investigation-after-russian-attack-on-brigade-ceremony

Ukraine military says it hit Zalyv shipyard in Russian-annexed Crimea,Crimea’s Russian-installed chief says downed missile fragments had hit a dry dock and that there were no casualties.,"Ukraine’s armed forces said they hit marine and port infrastructure at a shipyard in the port city of Kerch on the eastern coast ofRussian-occupied Crimea. Since launching itscounteroffensiveagainst Moscow’s forces this summer, Kyiv has ramped up attacks on theBlack Sea peninsulathat Russia seized in 2014. The peninsula’s Russian-installed chief said on Saturday that downed missile fragments had hit a dry dock and that there were no casualties. Ukraine had “implemented successful strikes on marine and port infrastructure of the ‘Zalyv’ factory in the temporarily occupied city of Kerch,” the Department for Strategic Communications of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said in a Telegram post, giving no further details. “I hope another ship has followed theMoskva!” Mykola Oleshchuk, commander of Ukraine’s Air Force, said in a Telegram post, referring to the Russian Black Sea Fleet flagship sunk by Ukrainian missiles on April 14, 2022. Oleshchuk said cruise missiles struck the infrastructure at Zalyv – which is now named BE Butoma – “where one of the most modern Russian Navy ships was stationed, a Kalibr cruise missile carrier”. He said he was “awaiting official confirmation of the results”. Sergei Aksyonov, the Russian-installed governor of Crimea, said air defence systems had been in action around a Kerch shipyard named after BE Butoma. “Fragments of downed missiles fell onto territory of one of the dry docks,” Aksyonov said in a Telegram post. “There were no casualties.” Meanwhile, Russian news agencies cited the Russian Ministry of Defence confirming that Ukraine hit a shipyard in Kerch with 15 cruise missiles, damaging one ship. It added that air defence systems destroyed 13 of the Ukraine-launched missiles. The Reuters and AFP news agencies said it was not possible to verify the Russian and Ukrainian statements, nor social media posts including videos of missile activity as well as fire and smoke that the posts said was rising from the same location the Ukrainian military mentioned. Military analyst and journalist Andriy Tsaplienko said in a Telegram post that one of Russia’s most modern ships, a small cruise missile carrier launched in 2021, the Askold, was damaged in the attack, according to what he described as preliminary information.

Ukraine’s Zelenskyy denies war with Russia at ‘stalemate’,"The Ukrainian leader says the war between Israel and Hamas has drawn attention away from them, adding that is ‘Russia’s goal’.","President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has denied thatUkraine’s war with Russiahad reached a “stalemate”, pushing back at suggestions Western leaders were lobbying for peace talks. The sprawling front line between the two warring sides has barely moved in almost a year, with one senior Ukrainian official warning this week that the conflict was deadlocked. “Time has passed, people are tired … But this is not a stalemate,” Zelenskyy told a news conference on Saturday in Kyiv with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The Ukrainian leader also rejected the idea that Western countries were putting pressure on Kyiv to enter negotiations with Russia, amid reports US and EU officials had discussed what such talks would entail. “No one among our partners is pressuring us to sit down with Russia, talk to it, and give it something,” he said. Such pressure existed before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and at the beginning of the fighting, but “today, none of the EU leaders or the US are putting pressure on me to sit down with Russia, negotiate and give Russia anything. There will be no such thing,” he added. Zelenskyy expressed irritation at media reports about pressure to negotiate, saying he had no idea where those claims came from. At the same time, he emphasised that he would always act in accordance with the will of the Ukrainian people. With the war now in its 20th month and Ukraine struggling to gain ground in its counteroffensive, Zelenskyy has routinely met Western leaders in a bid to stave off fatigue with the conflict. Zelenskyy said thewar between Israel and Hamashad also drawn attention away from Ukraine, and said that this was “Russia’s goal”. “Of course, it’s clear that the war in the Middle East, this conflict, is taking away the focus,” Zelenskyy said. “We have already been in very difficult situations when there was almost no focus on Ukraine,” he said, but added, “I am absolutely sure we will overcome this challenge.” Ukraine’s backers, including the United States, have maintained they are ready to support Kyiv with military and financial support for as long as it takes to defeat Russia.

Ukrainian shelling kills 9 in occupied south: Russia-installed officials,Moscow-appointed governor says attack in southern Kherson left nine dead and nine others ‘badly injured’.,"Ukrainian forces have killed at least nine people and wounded nine others in strikes on the Russian-occupied part of the southern Kherson region, the region’s Russia-installed authorities have said. The strikes on Friday struck an employment centre in Chaplynka, a town about 100 kilometres (62 miles) southeast of the regional capital Kherson, the region’s Moscow-appointed Governor Vladimir Saldo said. “As of now, nine dead have been pulled out from under the rubble as well as nine who are badly injured,” Saldo was quoted as saying by Russian state television. Moscow-backed official Konstantin Basyuk accused Kyiv of attacking civilian infrastructure in Chaplynsky, including the local pensions office and jobs centre. Ukrainian officials and Ukrainian media have not confirmed the attacks. Al Jazeera could not independently confirm the strikes or any resulting casualties or damage. Russia captured the Kherson region shortly after it launched itsfull-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, but has since abandoned the region’s main town and other centres on the west bank of the Dnipro River. Friday’s reported strikes came as Kyiv is mounting a counteroffensive to retake territory from Russian forces, focused on the south of the country.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/4/ukrainian-shelling-kills-9-in-occupied-south-russia-installed-officials
Italian PM’s diplomatic adviser steps down over prank phone call fiasco,Meloni discussed issues such as the Ukraine war and migration with a Russian comedian posing as an African official.,"Italian Prime MinisterGiorgia Melonisaid that her chief diplomatic adviser has resigned, after she was tricked by a prank phone call in which she discussed the war in Ukraine and migration. Meloni said on Friday that Francesco Talo, who previously served as Italy’s ambassador to NATO and Israel, had stepped down over the fiasco. “This matter was not handled well, we are all sorry, Ambassador [Francesco] Talo took responsibility for it,” Meloni said. In a call in September, supposedly with a high-level official from the African Union, Meloni made stark comments about several topics, saying that Italy was not receiving adequate support to crack downon migrationand that there was international “fatigue” over the war in Ukraine.    The prime minister’s office later confirmed that the caller was not, in fact, an African Union official, but a Russian comedian who managed to fool them. Meloni blamed her staff for failing to adequately screen the caller after comments from the conversation were released online earlier this week. She said that she had “a doubt” about the identity of the caller but “no certainty”. The opposition Democratic Party had asked Meloni to inform parliament about the incident, charging that it raised questions about national security. The Italian leader also reiterated her country’ssupport for Ukraineon Friday, saying that comments about fatigue over the war are “nothing new”. “We have taken a very clear [pro-Ukraine] position and perhaps this is also why [Russians] call us,” she told a news conference, adding that there was no evidence that the call was part of a propaganda campaign. It is not the first time that Russian pranksters Vladimir Kuznetsov and Alexei Stolyarov, known as Vovan and Lexus, have successfully fooled powerful leaders.

"Russian drones, missiles and shells target Ukrainian infrastructure",A rise in shelling and drone attacks is sparking concern that Moscow is targeting energy infrastructure ahead of winter.,"Russia has launched dozens of drone attacks and fired shells and missiles against civilian infrastructure, Ukraine reports. Kyiv said two dozen Russian drones and a missile were downed overnight as concern grows that Moscow is once again targeting Ukraine’s energy infrastructure ahead of winter. Officials in Kharkiv reported civilian targets were hit by shelling and drone attacks. The General Staff of Ukraine’s militarysaidRussian drones targeted several areas across Ukraine and were launched from Russia’s Kursk region and the Primorsk-Akhtarsk area. “As a result of combat operations, in cooperation with the defence forces of Ukraine, 24 attack bpla ‘Shahed-136/131’ [drones] and one controlled aviation missile were destroyed,” the statement said, using the acronym for “bezpilotniy letayuschiy apparat”, or “pilotless flying equipment”. Police in Kharkiv in northeastern Ukraine reported that at least 10 Russian drones hit civilian infrastructure and triggered multiple fires in the city and shelling also damaged buildings. “As a result of the drone strikes, a local school was attacked, causing a fire that destroyed the roof and two of the building’s floors. A residential building, a service station and an administrative building were also on fire due to shelling,” the police officials added. Kharkiv Mayor Ihor Terekhov said the fires were being brought under control. While no casualties have been reported so far, Kharkiv police officials said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app that doctors have diagnosed three residents with “an acute reaction to stress”. The overnight raids are part of a recent rise in Russian attacks.More than 100 settlementsin eastern Ukraine, including Kharkiv, were targeted on Wednesday, the heaviest day of shelling so far in 2023. Local authorities in Kharkiv said overnight shelling in the city on Wednesday killed one person. Ukraine and its partners in the West worry that Russia could try to replicate a strategy it followed last winter, squeezing Ukraine bytargeting energy infrastructureas temperatures fall. Last winter, Russia repeatedly attacked civilian infrastructure far from the front lines, leaving millions of Ukrainians without power, heat and water for days at a time. “We are strengthening air defence and mobile fire groups,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on the social media platform X.

New US sanctions over Russia-Ukraine war target Lancet drones,"Sweeping new measures target entities including in China, Turkey and UAE in bid to cut off Russia’s supply chain.","The United States has announced new sanctions covering some 130 new entities, including firms in China, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates, for allegedly supplying Russia’s military with much-needed components and technology and abetting itsongoing war in Ukraine. “Russia is dependent on willing third-country individuals and entities to resupply its military and perpetuate its heinous war against Ukraine, and we will not hesitate in holding them accountable,” Secretary of the Treasury Jane Yellensaid in a statementon Thursday. The new measures target critical supply chains that have otherwise allowed Russia to circumvent international sanctions and export controls by exploiting “otherwise legitimate economic relationships” with China, Turkey, and the UAE. These loopholes allow entities in the three countries to send Russia “high-priority dual-use goods” such as vehicle parts or encryption software that can be used by civilians or the military. In a move welcomed by Ukraine, the latest sanctions mark the first time Washington has moved against the production of Russia’s Lancet suicide drones. Ukrainian soldiers say the drone – an angular grey tube with two sets of four wings – has emerged as an increasing threat on the front lines. In his nightly video address, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hailed the measures as “just what is needed”. His chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, agreed. “I am very pleased that … restrictions are being tightened against companies associated with the military-industrial complex of the Russian Federation … ,” Yermak wrote on the Telegram messaging app. The new Treasury sanctions also target Russia’s domestic industrial base, which, the Treasury said, had been reorientated from “producing goods for the Russian people to attempting to ensure that the war machine can sustain itself”. Separately on Thursday, the US Department of State added 100 new sanctions targeting Russia’s energy, metals and mining sectors, defence procurement and “those involved in supporting the Russian government’s war effort and other malign activities”. The Commerce Department, meanwhile, also blacklisted 12 Russian companies and another from Uzbekistan that is says helped Moscow acquire critical drone technology. The US, European Union and other countries have already sanctioned hundreds of Russian individuals and entities since Moscow’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Further sanctions have also targeted its economy, freezing overseas assets, restricting exports, and otherwise making the cost of doing business in Russia extremely challenging and expensive. Yellen said the “global sanctions coalition” had “choked off Russia’s access to key inputs for its military-industrial complex and has undermined the Kremlin’s ability to wage its unprovoked war”. Despite the sanctions,Russia’s economyis expected to grow 1.5 percent this year, according to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development as countries like China, Turkey and India have provided Moscow with a critical economic lifeline.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/3/new-us-sanctions-over-russia-ukraine-war-target-lancet-drones

"Russia attacks more than 100 settlements in 24 hours, Ukraine says",Ukrainian authorities have said that cities and towns in the east have come under heavy bombardment over the last 24 hours.,"Ukraine’s interior minister has said that more than 100 settlements have come under fire in 24 hours, marking the heaviest day of Russian shelling this year. In a statement on social media, Ukrainian Interior Minister Igor Klymenko said that Russia had unleashed a barrage of millions of shells on cities across the eastern regions of the country. “Over the last 24 hours, the enemy shelled 118 settlements in 10 regions,” Klymenko said on Wednesday. “This is the highest number of cities and villages that have come under attack since the start of the year,” he said.    Russia’s wave of strikes turned some towns and villages to rubble. Local authorities said that overnight shelling in the city of Kharkiv, near the border with Russia, killed one person, with another also killed in southeastern Kherson. A Russian drone strike on the southern city of Nikopol also killed a 59-year-old woman and injured four people. Kyiv reported that a Russian strike on an oil refinery in Kremenchuk had caused a fire that took hours to extinguish, but resulted in no casualties. Ukraine and its partners in the West, such as the United States, worry that Russia could squeeze Ukraine bytargeting energy infrastructureas winter approaches. In an interview published by the British outlet The Economist on Wednesday, Ukrainian top general Valery Zaluzhny said that the conflict is moving towards a state of attrition, and that Ukraine will need new technology and larger army reserves to meet its goals. While Western supporters of Ukraine had hoped that a much-anticipatedUkrainian counteroffensivewould result in large territorial gains, Zaluzhny said in the interview that there would be no “deep and beautiful breakthrough”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/1/russia-attacks-more-than-100-settlements-in-24-hours-ukraine-says
Russia pursues Avdiivka with ‘meat assaults’ in a replay of Bakhmut,"Russia throws vast numbers of poorly supported troops into a new meat grinder, Ukrainian officials say.","Russia has doubled down on a campaign to capture the eastern Ukrainian town of Avdiivka during the 88th week ofits warin what appears to be a repeat of its year-long campaign to capture nearby Bakhmut, which fell in May. As inBakhmut, the Russian tactics have consisted of waves of infantry attacks that Ukrainian commanders said would soon become denser, and as in Bakhmut, Russian forces were suffering large losses of men and equipment. The Russian military is mounting efforts to retake the initiative in other places on the eastern front as well. The commander of Ukraine’s ground forces,Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Russia has “significantly strengthened” its forces in Bakhmut and switched from defence to offence. Ukrainian forces have had the Russians in retreat there in recent months as they tried to encircle the captured town. They retook commanding heights north of Bakhmut in July, from which they’ve been shelling Russian positions. During the past week, they advanced past a railway line that runs 10km (6.2 miles) southwest of Bakhmut, meaning Russian forces can’t use it to resupply their front lines. Russian forces tried to advance from several directions towards Kupiansk in the Luhansk region, Syrskyi said. Ukrainian southern forces spokesman Oleksandr Shtupun estimated on Thursday that 5,000 Russians had been killed or wounded two weeks into the effort to capture Avdiivka and Moscow had lost about 400armoured vehiclesthere and in Mariinka, farther south along the eastern front. That high rate of attrition continued in the past week, according to Ukraine. Its armed forces reported 660 Russians killed on Saturday across the front in 70 combat clashes, 10 of them in Avdiivka. Two days later, they said they killed 680 Russian soldiers. Shtupun said 500 of those casualties were in the Avdiivka area over 30 assaults. Russia is apparently able to replenish its numbers. The commander of the Russian “Arbat” Separate Guards Special Purpose Battalion, which is serving in Avdiivka, told a Russian reporter that fighters from theWagner mercenary groupare now among its ranks, an observation backed by a Ukrainian source. Wagner fighters were largely responsible for the capture of Bakhmut but were taken off the front lines because of military disagreements between the late Wagner boss,Yevgeny Prigozhin, and the Russian Ministry of Defence. Their recruitment is likely to strengthen the quality of Russian forces. Russian National Security Council Deputy Chairperson Dmitry Medvedev said nearly 385,000 people entered service with the Russian armed forces this year. There may be worse to come.    Shtupun said Russia was training Storm-Z assault troops to deploy in Avdiivka. Storm-Z soldiers are recruited in prisons and are thought to receive only rudimentary training and equipment but are believed to be ruthless in close-quarters combat. Ukrainians refer to such waves of infantry with poor mechanised and air support as “meat assaults”. Retired Ukrainian Colonel Petro Chernyk said Russia could potentially call on up to 3 million former conscripts trained in basic combat and, despite the fact that Ukraine has “destroyed” about 25,000 Russian soldiers a month, these were always immediately replaced. “The enemy should not be underestimated strategically. They have an extremely large number of small arms in their warehouses, and the last battles for Avdiivka and Bakhmut showed that they will use large infantry [columns]. Therefore, any information that Russia is currently running out of mobilisation resources is absolute nonsense,” Ukraine’s armed forces website Armyinform quoted Chernyk as saying. Both sides appeared to be scraping the bottom of the barrelfor ordnance. The Bloomberg news agency quoted unnamed sources as saying that the European Union had supplied only a third of the one million shells it has promised Ukraine by April. While Ukraine’s allies made new pledges of hundreds of millions of dollars of equipment in the past week, it appeared that not all were immediately deliverable. The New York Times reported that the US military was looking into marrying Soviet-era air defence launchers with modern Western missiles that are accurate and effective. These so-called FrankenSAM hybrid systems are an effort to make use of readily available components to enrich Ukraine’s air defences. In the same spirit, Russia was reportedly upgrading its gliding bombs – the FAB-250, FAB-500 and FAB-1500 – to use laser guidance, which improved their accuracy from 50 metres (55 yards) to 5 metres (5.5 yards). The smallest of these bombs reportedly carries 99kg (218lb) of explosives and has a damage radius of 120 metres (130 yards) while the largest packs 675kg (1,500lb) of explosives and has a blast radius of half a kilometre (a third of a mile). Gliding bombs are generally cheaper and easier to produce than other highly accurate systems, such as missiles or drones. Ukraine prides itself on having contained Russia’sBlack Sea Fleet, allowing grain ships to continue using a safe corridor along its coastline to the territorial waters of NATO members Romania and Bulgaria. The Reuters news agency reported on Thursday that Ukraine had suspended that corridor because of a threat from Russian warplanes. Ukraine’s reconstruction minister, Oleksandr Kubrakov, denied there had been a suspension. The US ambassador to Kyiv, Bridget Brink, appeared to reinforce Ukraine’s denial, saying 53 ships had passed safely through the corridor in September, delivering 2 million tonnes of grain. Russia pulled out of a deal to allow Ukraine’s grain ships to cross the Black Sea in July after Ukraine attacked the KerchBridge to Crimeafor a second time. Russia threatened to prevent ships from loading at Ukrainian ports, but Ukraine has since managed to keep the Russian fleet at bay.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/1/russia-pursues-avdiivka-with-meat-assaults-in-a-replay-of-bakhmut
North Korea sends Russia artillery rounds for satellite advice: S Korea,"Pyongyang and Moscow have an ‘arms-for-liftoff deal’, claims South Korea’s spy agency.","North Korea is supplying munitions to Russia for use in its war against Ukraine in return for satellite technology, South Korea has said. Pyongyang has supplied Moscow with more than one million artillery shells since early August, Seoul’s National Intelligence Service (NIS) reported on Wednesday. In return, Russia is assumed to be providing technology and know-how to North Korea, which is making a third effort to launch a satellite following two failures. South Korean lawmaker Yoo Sang-bum said that Pyongyanghas sent around 10 arms shipments to Russiaby air, as well as via naval shipments between a North Korean east coast port and Russian ports, asthe United States has previously claimed. More than one million artillery shells were transported by sea, originating from the port of Najin and reaching the Russian ports of Dunai and Vostochny, according to NIS. From there, they were conveyed by train to Ukraine, near the Toretsk ammunition depot. It is estimated that these deliveries will keep Russian forces in Ukraine supplied for two months. Meanwhile, the West is struggling to keep pace in supplying Ukraine’s forces with ammunition. “North Korea is running its munition factories to full capacity to meet demand for military supplies to Russia and even mobilising residents and civilian factories to make ammunition boxes for exports,” Yoo said. The US, South Korea, and Japan have condemned North Korea’s supply of arms and military equipment to Russia, and Moscow’s supply of technology in the other direction. The allegations have been denied by bothNorth Koreaand the Kremlin. “Russia, as a responsible member of the world community, strictly adheres to its international obligations towards Pyongyang through the UN Security Council,” Russian Ambassador at LargeOleg Burmistrov said in responseto the allegations. North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in September in eastern Russia, where the leaders toured Russia’s most important satellite launch centre, theVostochny Cosmodrome. During the meeting, President Putin said Russia would help North Korea build satellites, without providing specifics. Observersspeculatedafter the meeting that Moscow would help with North Korea’s space programme in return for supplying conventional weapons. Indeed, North Korea appears to have received technical assistance from Russia with its spy satellite system, South Korea’s spy agency claims. North Korea lacks both financial resources and technical expertise in its satellite programme, and appears to have not yet mastered the technology for atmospheric re-entry of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) warheads, Yoo said. Now, Pyongyang is in the final stages of a third, likely successful, satellite launch attempt, after two previous failed attempts. North Korea also hopes to receive Russian fighter jets and other aircraft in the exchange, according to Yoo.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/1/north-korea-sends-russia-artillery-rounds-for-satellite-advice-s-korea
Sirens in Sevastopol as Ukraine ramps up attacks on Crimea,"Ukraine’s strategy to quell Russia’s control of Crimea and the Black Sea requires patience, says Zelenskyy.","Russian officials have declared an air raid alert in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol in anticipation of further attacks from Ukraine. Sirens went off in the city early on Wednesday. Traffic on the Crimean bridge, linking the peninsula to Russia, as well as sea transport, were suspended. The alert comes amid a string of Ukrainianattacksin recent weeks in and around Crimea, which was seized and annexed by Moscow in 2014. Kyiv’s forces have struck a Russian air base on the peninsula and the Black Sea Fleet command post in Sevastopol, as Ukraine seeks to weaken Russia’s control over the water. Moscow on Tuesday accused Ukraine of theattempted assassinationof pro-Russian politician Oleg Tsaryov in Yalta. The Crimean Bridgewas attacked in July. At the same time, amid disappointing results from Kyiv’s much-vauntedcounteroffensive, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is seeking to rouse his country ahead of a winter campaign anticipated to be harsh. Ukraine hopes that weakening Russian forces on the Black Sea will deliver an ultimate victory in the war. The “illusion” of Russia’s domination of Crimea and the Black Sea had been shattered, Zelenskyy told a meeting of the Crimea Platform on October 24. “The Russian (Black Sea) fleet is no longer able to operate in the western part of the Black Sea and is gradually fleeing from Crimea,” Zelenskyy said. “And this is a historic achievement.” The attacks have highlighted Kyiv’s growing capabilities, which include naval drones. Meanwhile, Moscow continues bombarding Ukraine from afar with long-range missiles and assault drones. Last week, the Russian defence ministry said “a set of mine and anti-sabotage measures” in Sevastopol Bay had intercepted three unmanned Ukrainian boats. Ukraine said on Wednesday that Russia had shelled more than 100 settlements over the last 24 hours; the highest number of attacks on any single day so far in 2023. “We have not yet gained full fire control over Crimea and surrounding waters, but we will,” Zelenskyy told the attendees of the diplomatic initiative gathered in Prague. “This is a question of time.” On Monday, the Ukrainian military claimed a successful attack on a Crimean Russian air defence base with naval drones and missiles. As the strategy persists, and a downbeat analysis of Ukraine’s progress with its counteroffensive mounts, Zelenskyy sought on Tuesday to rouse his troops and country with a message of patience, perseverance and focus on the final goal. “We live in a world that gets used to success too quickly. When the full-scale invasion began, many people around the world did not believe that Ukraine would survive,” the Ukrainian president said in his nightly video address on Tuesday. “Glory to all those who do not retreat, who do not burn out, who believe in Ukraine just as they did on February 24, and who has been fighting for unwaveringly.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/1/air-raid-sirens-in-sevastopol-as-ukraine-ramps-up-attacks-on-crimea
Is Russia recruiting Muslim migrants to fight its war in Ukraine?,"Moscow appears to be flouting its own laws to boost its forces, targeting foreign workers from Central Asia.","Kyiv, Ukraine –In mid-October, Mamut Useinov performed on Sing Better Than a Star, a popular Russian television show for aspiring singers on the state-controlled Channel One network. “I’ve been anticipating this and can’t hide my excitement,” the 25-year-old from annexed Crimea wrote on Telegram on October 15, as he thanked “the Almighty” for the chance. But Useinov’s way to stardom was cut short. Five days after the broadcast, Useinov went to a “prayer house”, a type of informal mosque that offers a place to worship in the absence of officially sanctioned places for prayer. Heavily armed riot police officers detained him along with several dozen men who gathered for the Muslim Friday prayer in Kotelniki, an overpopulated southeastern suburb of Moscow where labour migrants settle because rent is cheap. All the men were forced into a police bus for an ID check and taken to a military conscription office in the nearby town of Lybertsy, according to Useinov and media reports. There, they underwent a medical evaluation that deemed Useinov “fit for military service”, despite flat feet and a recent surgery, he said. They were reportedly shipped to a military base east of Moscow and given a choice – go to jail or enlist. “We were all told that we have to sign one-year contracts, otherwise – jail,” he said in a Telegram-posted video on October 21, without specifying the charges they may face. He fears that once they sign the contract, the men will be sent to the front lines in Ukraine, the nation where Useinov was born and whose national he was, before accepting Russian citizenship in 2014, he wrote. “During a morning lineup, I heard we would all be send to the special military operation,” he wrote using the Kremlin’s preferred euphemism for the war in Ukraine. In a video he posted, he is seen in a small room filled with men next to bunkbeds listening to an elderly ethnic Russian man in camouflage. One more video shows the courtyard of a large building whose sand-coloured brick walls are adorned with a Russian flag and a banner reading, “Devotion to the motherland.” He went incommunicado on October 22. At the time of publishing, Useinov had not responded to Al Jazeera’s requests for comment. He has been taken to yet another military base for basic training, his representative told the Astra telegram channel on October 23. What Useinov described blatantly violated Russian rights legislation. The men were detained and denied access to lawyers. They were told about being conscripted without receiving a written notification issued by the conscription office where each man is registered – and then signed by the recipient. The men had no chance to overrule the forced conscription in court – or voice their objection to military service.Conscientious objectorshave a right to an alternative service in Russia. “This procedure violated all of my rights,” Useinov wrote.    Dire demographic problems and oil wealth turned Russia into a magnet for millions of labour migrants from ex-Soviet Central Asia. SomeCrimean Tatars, a Muslim community of about 200,000 in the annexed peninsula, became part of this influx as they share ties with Turkic-speaking nations of Central Asia, a region their forefathers had been deported to en masse in 1944. Meanwhile, Russia’s mostly Muslim, impoverished and corruption-choked North Caucasus is one of the few regions with high birth rates, and hundreds of thousands also move to Moscow and other big cities. But attending a mosque almost anywhere in Russia can be complicated and sometimes dangerous. Moscow only has five official mosques, and tens of thousands of believers throng areas around them duringMuslimholidays, putting their prayer mats on the asphalt or even tram tracks. Most labour migrants choose to attend informal “prayer houses”, which some locals and police see as hotbeds of “extremism”. These houses have mushroomed because authorities routinely do not sanction new mosques, even though Muslims are Russia’s fastest-growing population stratum. While the Kremlin tries to revive its Soviet-era clout in the Middle East, courting Muslim leaders and calling Islam one of Russia’s “traditional religions”, Russian police snub religious rules and rights during their raids on prayer houses. They do not take their boots off, interrupt prayers, shower believers with slurs, and spray them with tear gas, according to dozens of reports, photos and videos. Far-right role Russian far-right nationalists help organise raids on “prayer houses”, in an apparent effort to kill two birds with one stone. They see the forcible conscription of Muslims as a way to rid Russia of unwanted “aliens” and help the faltering war effort, according to analysts. Zov (Call), a group whose closed Telegram channel has 141,000 subscribers, routinely informs police about Muslim gatherings – and proudly announces raids, detentions and deportations. “Just now, police visited two illegal mosques organised in apartment buildings. More than 70 people were rounded up. Awaiting deportation,” one of Zov’s posts said. The group is led by Andrey Tkachuk, head of a small media group in Moscow, and Andrey Afanasyev, a former staffer of the Tsargrad television channel whose oligarch owner Konstantin Malofeyev has been sanctioned in the West as a sponsor of separatists in Ukraine’s Donbas region. Muslim labour migrantshavefaced hate attacks, arbitrary detentions and arrests, police brutality, extortion and threats for decades. But after the Kremlin realised that its blitzkrieg in Ukraine failed amid disastrous losses of manpower, it threw a new curveball their way. As part of a nationwide series of raids dubbed “Illegal 2023”, police have been combing construction sites, markets, farms, restaurants, apartment buildings, hostels and “prayer houses” – or simply rounding up anyone who does not look Slavic, according to rights groups and media reports. During ID checks, they find “problems” – both imaginary and real, such as a lack of registration, a blurred stamp, or an expired work permit. The migrants are locked up and forced to enlist in military service, facing several kinds of threats to ensure their cooperation, an expert said. Shukhrat Ganiyev, a human rights advocate based in the central Uzbek city of Bukhara, told Al Jazeera that the pressure put on migrants included “threat of deportation of [their] families from Russia, the planting of drugs, an intolerable atmosphere for business”. He said some Uzbeks had signed contracts for construction jobs in the Russia-occupied southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, but then ended up on the front line – “and were not heard of since”. Police in St Petersburg, Russia’s second-largest city and President Vladimir Putin’s hometown, said they handed conscription papers to 56 migrants with Russian passports after just one raid on a market on September 6. A month earlier, about 100 migrants were served with conscription papers, it said. The Illegal 2023 investigations are “tied to organisation of illegal migration, trade in drugs and psychotropic substances, arms trade and border crossings”, Ministry of Internal Affairs spokeswoman Irina Vovk said. Another way of forcing Muslim migrants into the trenches has been to deny Central Asians citizenship – a red Russian passport eliminates many of the problems with police and bureaucratic hurdles that migrants face. In one case, migration officials turned down an application from a Tajik man whose mother is a Russian national, according to rights advocate Tatyana Kotlyar. The man was told to enlist first, even though as a father of five he cannot be drafted, she said. In another case, an Uzbek man whose wife and child are Russian nationals, was told that “without a [military] contract and participation in the special military operation, they won’t even accept his citizenship application,” Kotlyar, who is based in the city of Obninsk 120km (75 miles) southwest of Moscow, told Al Jazeera. Both men did not reply to Al Jazeera’s request for comment. And in Kaluga, a region of more than one million people, some 200km (124 miles) south of Moscow, foreign workers have been barred from submitting citizenship applications in recent months unless they enlist, Kotlyar said. Officials at the Kaluga migration office refused to comment on her claim. And even if a migrant already has a Russian passport, recently adopted laws allow authorities to take it away with ease. “If you are a Russian national but are not ready to fulfil your military duty, a decision should be made to strip such a man of his citizenship,” Russia’s top investigator Aleksander Bastrykin told a military conference in mid-October. Bastrykin said earlier that migrants have a “constitutional duty to defend the nation that accepted them” and that enlisting them should be a “priority”. There have even been calls to abolish age limits for migrants so that they can be forced to serve in the military. The conscription age in Russia is between 18 and 30. “You became a Russian national at age 50 – go serve at 50,” nationalist lawmaker Aleksey Zhuravlyev said on October 24. Muslim migrants are among the most vulnerable people in Russia, said Sergey Abashin, a migration expert and anthropologist based in St Petersburg. They are often subject to the whims of police officers and officials because they “always” have problems with their documents, he said. “The [Russian] legislation’s very design makes it impossible to have absolutely ‘clean’ documents,” he said. The migrants are also dependent on the goodwill of their employers, as many work without the permits to do so. Meanwhile, public opinion is dominated by rampant nationalism, xenophobia and often portrays Muslim newcomers as hostile and alien, he said. “The sum of these dependencies makes migrants easily victimised,” he said. Very few make their cases public, fearing persecution of their families, rights advocates have said, adding the immigrants are accustomed to authoritarian rule and police brutality in their countries of origin, often know little about their civil rights in Russia, do not have access to lawyers, and may not speak much Russian. Where there is a stick, there follows a carrot – promises of hefty pay and a Russian passport. “Since at least May 2023, Russia has approached Central Asian migrants to fight in Ukraine with promises of fast-track citizenship and salaries of up to $4,160,” the British Defence Ministry said in September. In September 2022, Putin signed a decree that gives Russian nationality to anyone who has served on the front line for six months. The first Uzbek national taken prisoner in Ukraine said he was driven by financial interest, according to a Ukrainianmedia report. Lying on his back in a camouflaged coat, Mukhriddin Akhmedov, a 22-year-old student from the central Uzbek city of Samarkand, said he joined the Redoubt military company because he “needed money”. He said that “one more Uzbek” had joined the company. Looking ahead, the Russian military faces a shortage of manpower on the front lines after heavy casualties in the so-called “meat storms” on Ukrainian positions, experts have said. The shortage is exacerbated by Russia’s catastrophically low birthrates and a population loss of hundreds of thousands of people a year in the rapidly aging nation of 143 million. “By waging the war in Ukraine via the tactics of ‘meat storms’ and thus suffering heavy losses of manpower, the Russian military began experiencing a lack of cannon fodder,” Alisher Ilkhamov, head of the London-based Central Asia Due Diligence group, told Al Jazeera. Although their forcible conscription has undermined earlier official steps to limit Central Asia natives’ access to firearms – for years, Central Asian migrants were denied permits to buy hunting rifles – the political risk to Russian leaders is minimal. So far, there has only been a single public incident associated with the forced conscription of migrants. Last October, two Tajik nationals were forcibly sent to a training camp before departure to Ukraine. After the men, Ekhson Aminzoda and Mekhrob Rakhmonov, heard their commanding officers “insult their religion”, they got hold of a machine gun and killed 11 people and injured 15 others. The two were shot dead and pronounced “terrorists” by authorities. Meanwhile, the Kremlin is afraid to declare a second round of mobilisation in advance of the March 2024 presidential election, he said. The September 2022 “partial”mobilisationtriggered an exodus of hundreds of thousands of Russian men, making migrants more attractive targets. “In such conditions, the emphasis is on recruiting migrants, as their loss on the front line will not affect Russia politically or economically,” Ilkhamov said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/1/is-russia-recruiting-muslim-migrants-to-fight-its-war-in-ukraine

Russia says Kyiv behind shooting of Ukrainian pro-Moscow separatist leader,"The FSB arrested a 46-year-old Russian man in Crimea for allegedly acting as an accomplice, Russian state media reports.","Russia has accused the Ukrainian government of carrying out theattempted assassinationof former Ukrainian Member of Parliament and Moscow-backed separatist Oleg Tsaryov. The Russian state news agency TASS reported on Tuesday that the FSB, Russia’s federal security agency, had arrested a 46-year-old Russian man who resides in Crimea for allegedly acting as an accomplice. The FSB said that the suspect confessed to his role in helping coordinate the plot by conducting surveillance and leaving a cache of weapons, saying that he acted “on the instructions of Ukraine’s security service”. The pro-Russian politician and businessman Tsaryov was shot twice in his home in Yalta, Crimea, last week. The FSB has said that he is in “satisfactory” condition. Media reports had identified Tsaryov as the potential leader of a prospective puppet government in Kyiv that Russia had hoped to install when it launched itsinvasion of Ukrainein February 2022. That plan was denied by Tsaryov, who told the news outlet Reuters, which reported on the prospective plan, that the account had “very little to do with reality”.    Ukrainian media outlets and the news service Reuters reported last week that the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) was responsible for the assassination effort on Tsaryov, who a Ukrainian source told Reuters was an “absolutely legal” target. The 53-year-old, who owns a hotel in Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014, was a former member of Ukraine’s parliament. When Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine began fighting Ukrainian forces in 2014, Tsaryov became the leader of the separatist parliament known as Novorossiya. He has been sanctioned by Ukraine, the United States, and several other Western countries and is listed as a “traitor to the Motherland” by Ukraine.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/31/russia-says-kyiv-behind-shooting-of-ukrainian-pro-moscow-separatist-leader
Russia’s Shoigu claims US fuelling tension to uphold ‘global dominance’,"Speaking at security forum in Beijing, defence minister warns of growing risk of confrontation between nuclear-armed countries.","Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu has accused the United States of fuelling geopolitical tensions to uphold its “global dominance by any means” and warned of the growing risk of confrontation between nuclear-armed countries. Addressing the Xiangshan Forum, China’s biggest military diplomacy conference, Shoigu also claimed the NATO alliance was trying to expand its footprint in the Asia Pacific under the pretence of seeking dialogue and collaboration with regional countries. “Washington for years has deliberately undermined and destroyed the foundations of international security and strategic stability, including the system of arms control agreements,” Shoigu said at the start of the three-day event on Monday. “Having provoked an acute crisis in Europe, the West is trying to expand the crisis potential in the Asia Pacific,” he told delegates from about 90 countries. “Direct involvement of countries with nuclear arsenals multiplies the strategic risks. The West’s line towards escalation with Russia poses a risk of direct conflict between nuclear powers, which will result in catastrophic consequences,” Shoigu added. Shoigu’s gloomy assessment was echoed by China, whose defence ministerLi Shangfuwas sacked without explanation last week after disappearing from public view at the end of August. China has refused to condemnRussia’s invasion of Ukraineand has deepened economic, diplomatic and military cooperation with Moscow since the start of the war in February 2022. Russian President Vladimir Putin this month paid a two-day visit to China, his first outside the former Soviet Union this year and part of the Kremlin’s drive to strengthen its economic partnerships across Asia. Zhang Youxia, China’s second most senior military official, painted a grim picture of the international situation, blaming countries he did not name for the turmoil. “As we look across the world today, hotspot issues are arising one after another. The pain of war, chaos and turmoil, and loss of life are constantly playing out,” Zhang said. “Some countries, for fear that the world may stabilise, deliberately create turmoil, interfere in regional issues, interfere in other countries’ internal affairs, and instigate colour revolutions,” he said. “Behind the scenes, they hand out knives and think nothing of provoking people into wars, ensuring that they’re the ones who benefit from the chaos,” he added. Zhang – who embraced Shoigu on the sidelines of the forum – said that Beijing was “willing to develop military ties with the US on the basis of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation.” China suspended military communication with the US, which was represented at the forum by a delegation led by Xanthi Carras, the leading official on China at the Pentagon, in August 2022. In recent years, the US has deepened its relationships with countries across the Asia Pacific, with initiatives such as the Quad that includes Australia, India and Japan, as well as the AUKUS project with Australia and the United Kingdom, which involves the sharing ofnuclear-powered submarine technologyand the development of advanced weaponry. The US has also furtheredsecurity cooperationwith Japan and South Korea, as well as with the Philippines, where it has securedaccessto military bases.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/31/russias-shoigu-claims-us-fuelling-tension-to-uphold-global-dominance

Russia to ease investment for ‘friendly’ countries,"The ‘friendly’ countries include China, India, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Kazakhstan and Belarus.","Russia will ease investment processes for citizens and companies from “friendly” countries, as it seeks to establish an anti-Western coalition and shore up its sanctions-hit economy. Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin announced on Monday that investment processes will be simplified for investors from 25 countries considered allies by Moscow. In the wake of its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and subsequent efforts by Western states to isolate it and trim its economic power to wage war, Russia has been seeking to strengthen ties around the globe. The “friendly” countries whose citizens and companies will be able to open Russian bank accounts and make deposits through a simplified process include China, India, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Kazakhstan and Belarus. “Creating more convenient conditions for foreign enterprises and entrepreneurs is an important part of the government’s systemic efforts to achieve financial sovereignty as part of the implementation of the national goals set by our president,” Mishustin said in a statement. According to Moscow, “unfriendly” nations are those that have joined a slew of Western-led economic sanctions in response to its war in Ukraine. Russia haslikenedthe sanctions to “a declaration of war”. On Monday, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu singled out one of the primary instigators of the sanctions, the United States, at a defence conference in Beijing, accusing it of disrupting global security and harming Russia’s interests. “To maintain its geopolitical and strategic dominance, the United States is deliberately undermining the basis of international security and strategic stability,” Shoigu said. Shoigu also pointed the finger at the US’s Western and Asia Pacific allies, without naming them. “Western countries aim to escalate the conflict with Russia and increase the risk of major country confrontation … This will lead to serious consequences,” he added.

"Taiwan takes security lessons from Hamas, Ukraine surprise attacks",Taiwan considers its ability to counter a Chinese invasion attempt with lessons learned from Israel-Gaza war and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.,"Taichung, Taiwan –On October 7, the Palestinian armed group Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel, firing thousands of rockets that quickly overwhelmed Israel’s state-of-the-art Iron Dome air defence system while thousands of fighters infiltrated southern Israel by air, sea and land. The significance of Hamas’s surprise attack was not lost on Taiwan’s military, which lives with a promise by Beijing’s political leaders to unify self-ruled Taiwan with China,by force if necessary. In the week after Hamas’s raid on Israel, the Taiwanese defence ministry announced the establishment of a task force to draw lessons from the Israel-Gaza war. Taiwan’s defence minister, Chiu Kuo-cheng, has said that an initial lesson is that intelligence gathering will be key to counter China’s threats. Taiwan also has the sea, said 42-year-old Tony Wei, who is a member of the Taiwanese reserves and a dentist by profession. Taiwan is separated from China’s east coast by a 130-kilometre (81-mile) stretch of ocean known as the Taiwan Strait which acts as a natural barrier and early warning system should Beijing try to overwhelm Taiwan in a surprise attack. “To invade Taiwan, they (the Chinese military) have to gather a very large fleet,” Wei told Al Jazeera. China’s mobilisation of such a naval force would probably be detected by Taiwan, giving the self-ruled island time to ready for an invasion or even launch a preemptive attack, Wei said. Still, the Hamas raid – largely considered unimaginable by military analysts before it happened – has made Wei question whether Taiwan truly possesses thecapabilitiesnecessary to counter a potentially determined Chinese military. “The Israelis have a very powerful military, an effective intelligence service and a lot of American support,” Wei said. “If even Israel can be surprised and overwhelmed, then what about Taiwan?” The Israel-Gaza war is the second time the world has recently been taken aback by a military operation considered improbable until it was carried out. “They said that President Putin wouldn’t attack Ukraine, but he did, and they said that Hamas couldn’t attack Israel, but they did,” Wei said, referring to theRussian invasionof February 2022. “Taiwan needs to learn from these attacks in case our island becomes the next place where the unthinkable happens.” “Hamas’s attack achieved strategic, operational, and tactical surprise against the Israelis,” Eric Chan, a non-resident research fellow at the Global Taiwan Institute, told Al Jazeera. “Taiwan has a vested interest in avoiding this type of surprise, especially because their adversary has greater powers than Hamas,” Chan said. “The Russian invasion, as well as the surprise attack by Hamas, was an object demonstration that while you may think that the adversary is deterred by high costs, the adversary may actually not care,” he added. Fang-Yu Chen, an assistant professor at Soochow University in Taipei who researches political relations between Taiwan, China and the US, said that Taiwan’s announced establishment of a task force in the aftermath of the Hamas attack was an attempt to learn lessons in order to prevent a Taiwanese intelligence failure with regards to China. “Taiwan is constantly picking up a lot of information about China’s activities, but such information has to be verified, analysed and passed on to the right people,” Chen told Al Jazeera. According to Chen, Taiwan might look to strengthening its intelligence gathering in order to ensure that credible threats from China are clearly identified before a potential disaster strikes. “The next major consideration is what to do after an attack has already taken place,” he said. Taiwan’s government has taken steps in that direction, too.    More money is being allocated to the military; compulsory military service for Taiwanese citizens is being extended from four months to one year; the purchase of new missile systems was announced, and the island’sfirst domestically built submarinewas also unveiled earlier this month. In its preparations, Taiwan has also looked to and learned from the war in Ukraine, according to Chen. A major lesson of Russia’s invasion is the importance of not only strengthening the island’s conventional military and intelligence but also its capabilities within the field of information warfare in order to win the battle of the narrative, he said. Chen has observed thatChina’s information operationsdirected at Taiwan have adjusted since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “Before the Ukraine war, the propaganda was often about how the US will abandon Taiwan, but after the war, it has been about how the US is pushing China towards war,” he said. At the same time, Chen has detected a polarisation of public opinion in Taiwan with people who were already willing to fight against Chinese aggression becoming more willing to confront Beijing while those who were unwilling to fight have become even less willing. Amid thisbattle for public opinionand efforts to influence personal resolve among the Taiwanese, Taiwan’s government last year launched a ministry of digital affairs which has since introduced a range of measures to combat disinformation directed at the island and its population. In the battle of narratives it is not just a matter of countering disinformation that reaches Taiwan, said Wei, the military reservist, but also about how Taiwan obtains the backing of other countries. Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen has also taken certain preliminary steps to accomplish this by encouraging the island to tell its own story to the world. Through the “Give Taiwan a Voice” campaign, her administration has protested against Taiwan’s exclusion from the United Nations and sought to highlight the island’s contributions to the international community. At the same time, Tsai has sought to reach out to and integrate Taiwan more extensively with countries in South and Southeast Asia through a so-called “southbound policy” under the slogan of “Taiwan helps Asia, Asia helps Taiwan”. Wei believes such initiatives are important if Taiwan is to win over world opinion in the face of increasing pressure from China. For Wei, the importance of winning the narrative was highlighted in the information battle that broke out between Israel and Hamas over responsibility for the deadly explosion at theal-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza. The fight to convince the world of the magnitude and responsibility for the hospital atrocity had far-reaching consequences as meetings between US President Joe Biden – Israel’s staunchest ally – and several Arab leaders were cancelled amid a global outcry over the attack. As Wei said, no one supports someone who bombs hospitals, and no one can win a war without assistance from the outside. Winning the information war, he said, will be crucial for Taiwan in any potential confrontation with China. “So, we must win the war of words so that we can count on international support if Chinese bombs strike Taiwan.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/29/taiwan-takes-security-lessons-from-hamas-ukraine-surprise-attacks
Gaza divides the world along faultlines set by Ukraine war,Russia is running short of shells but Israel’s war in Gaza threatens to cloud US diplomacy.,"Israel’s war against Hamas has deepened the international faultlines set during Russia’s war in Ukraine, as both sides seek to entrench an increasingly polarised pattern of global allegiances during the 87th week of the Ukraine war. US President Joe Biden tarred Russian leader Vladimir Putin and Hamas, which the United States and the European Union consider a terrorist group, with the same brush after visiting Israel on October 18. “Hamas and Putin represent different threats, but they share this in common: They both want to completely annihilate a neighbouring democracy,” Biden said in a primetime Oval Officespeechwatched by 20 million people. Washington’s European allies, who have stood behind Ukraine, also paid visits to Israel in a show of solidarity that simultaneously cemented their geopolitical allegiance. Biden further joined the Ukrainian and Israeli causes in Congress last week byseeking$105bn in new funding for them in a single bill, calling it “a smart investment that’s going to pay dividends for American security for generations”. “They used to call it ‘fighting for freedom and democracy’,” Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Maria Zakharova lashed back in a message on the Telegram platform. “Now it turns out it is just calculations.” China and Russia, too, have sought to close ranks, saying they will focus on a “close coordination of efforts” to solve crises in the Middle East. Russia’s deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov met Zhai Jun, China’s special envoy for the Middle East, in Doha on the same day as Biden’s speech – October 20. Russia has also been tightening relations with Iran. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov visited Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in Tehran on October 24 to “further build” their “multifaceted” partnership, Russia’s foreign ministry said in a statement on Tuesday. While supporting Hezbollah in Lebanon, a sworn enemy of Israel, Iran is also a supplier of Shahed kamikaze drones to Russia in its war in Ukraine. Russia now produces its own Shahed drones and, according to Russian news sources, it may have begun on October 23 to deploy a new type of Iranian drone, the Italmas, which is said to have a longer range and is harder to detect. Diplomacy, military technology and money are intimately connected. Ukraine has relied heavily on Western aid. The US spent nearly $77bn to support Ukraine against the Russian invasion between February 24 last year and July 31 this year, according to the Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank, and Biden wants Congress to agree to $60bn more. The EU has spent 82 billion euros ($86.7bn) since the beginning of the war. Some of this has come in the form of advanced military hardware, which has given Ukraine an edge. This month, Ukraine started using Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) from the US arsenal. Putin dismissed it as a weapon that “only prolongs the agony”, but Ukraineused it to damageat least five Russian helicopters at the Luhansk city airfield and cause further damage at an airfield in occupied Berdyansk. Putin is also in increasing financial difficulty. On Monday, Britain’s military intelligence said he had raised next year’s defence spending by 68 percent, bringing it to $82bn or 6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), possibly to cover increased medical and retirement costs for soldiers. Last week, Estonia’s military intelligence chief estimated Russia’s artillery ordnance at four million shells, which would allow it to continue a “low intensity” war for another year. Russia’s current firing rate of 10,000 to 15,000 shells a day contrasts with an average of 45,000 to 80,000 shells a day last year, intelligence chief Ants Kiviselg said. So far, the odd man out in the Western alliance has been Hungary whose prime minister, Viktor Orban, visited China this month to celebrate the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), during which hemet Putin to reaffirmthe bond between Russia and Hungary. Upon his return, Orban compared EU membership with Soviet occupation. Brussels’ model of liberal democracy does not fit Hungary, he said. “Fortunately, Brussels is not Moscow. Moscow was a tragedy. Brussels is just a bad contemporary parody,” Orban told guests in the city of Veszprem. Hungary was also the most reluctant EU member to give up imports of Russian oil last December. “The United States is concerned about Hungary’s relationship with Russia,” US ambassador to Hungary David Pressman said in a statement on October 20. Russia’s war in Ukraine has intensified in its 87th week, with Russian forces persisting in an assault on the eastern town of Avdiivka and Ukrainian forces scoring a few stealthy advances along the front. They were fighting to establish full control of the village two days later, according to the BBC’s Russian service. The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said on October 20 that its troops had destroyed almost 50 Russian tanks and about 100 armoured fighting vehicles while repelling attacks near Avdiivka, on the eastern front. Some Ukrainian soldiers reported 200 Russian vehicles destroyed, losses which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy late last week described as “really staggering”. Russian forces have formed pincers to the north and south of the city, and have mounted a fierce offensive to overrun it in the past month. Ukraine’s southern forces spokesperson, Oleksandr Shtupun, said Russia was having to resupply the Avdiivka front with new soldiers directly from Russia, and by October 24, Reuters news agency reported the losses had forced Moscow to switch to air attacks. According to Gudmundsson, a tracker of Russian losses based on open sources, Russia’s single worst day of the war in terms of losses was October 20, with reported casualties of 1,380, compared with a daily 2023 average of just below 500. Geolocated footage on October 21 seemed to show that Russian forces had made marginal gains northwest of the city in a landfill area and had advanced again there two days later, but Ukraine’s military said another 20 lines of attack had failed. Some 45km to the north, Ukrainian forces were making slow progress in a pincer movement of their own around occupied Bakhmut on October 23, crossing a key railway line near Klishchiivka. Ukraine managed to establish a new bridgehead on the left bank of the Dnipro river in Kherson during this week, the 87th of Russia’s war, scaling up a new battle on what is already a 1,500km (932-mile) front. Ukrainian sabotage and reconnaissance groups gained a foothold in the village of Krynky, 2km from the Dnipro shoreline on October 19, a Russian military reporter said, confirmed by geolocated footage. Russia’s Defence Ministry said it had frustrated several attempts by reconnaissance groups to cross the Dnipro, without specifying where. Other Ukrainian units have already established footholds on parts of the shore and near the Antonivsky bridge, said the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington, DC-based think tank.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/28/gaza-divides-the-world-along-faultlines-set-by-ukraine-war

Russian defence minister visits Ukrainian front amid winter preparations,Shoigu visited the “Vostok” command post to be briefed on front-line developments and preparations for winter combat.,"Russian Defence MinisterSergei Shoiguhas visited a command post near the front lines in eastern Ukraine as fighting in the regionintensifiesin advance of the harsh winter season. He travelled to the “Vostok” command post in the east to be briefed on developments at the front as Russian forces stepped up attacks, according to footage posted by the Ministry of Defence on Wednesday. The minister was briefed on preparations for combat for the forthcoming winter and the training of drone operators, the Ministry of Defence said, according to AFP. “The situation today suggests the enemy has fewer and fewer opportunities. And they will continue to be reduced, thanks exclusively to your combat work,” Shoigu told Russian soldiers as he sought to raise morale. The Ministry of Defence, whose video showed Shoigu arriving at the post via helicopter,addedthat the minister “drew special attention to the timely and sufficient provision of new winter uniforms and insulated footwear for all personnel” before winter, when temperatures plunge below freezing. Shoigou’s visit comes as Russia stepped up attacks in eastern Ukraine, hammering the city of Avdiivka with air and artillery attacks. Ukrainian officials claim that Moscow’s forces have suffered heavy bloodshed, losing thousands of troops in less than a week. “The enemy is persistently trying to surround the city and is throwing in new forces from the north and south,” Vitaliy Barabash, head of Avdiivka’s military administration, told Ukrainian television on Tuesday. “For two days, they have been operating mostly in small groups, trying to find cracks in our defence, but without success. The defence line is holding.” Further east in Crimea, Ukraine also claims to have been making inroads despite struggling to progress its counteroffensive.    Russia, meanwhile, has continued its assault on the southeastern Kherson region. The bombing killed one person early on Wednesday after four people were injured on Tuesday. Ukrainian authorities have recently ruled that families with children must evacuate the region. Sixteen people were injured in a Russian drone attack in the western Khmelnytskyi region late on Tuesday night, a local official said Critical infrastructure was damaged, a local official reported, without offering details. Khmelnytskyi is home to a Ukrainian military airfield. “In Shepetivka district, as a result of the downing of enemy aerial targets, they crashed on the territory of a critical infrastructure facility,” a senior official in the Khmelnytskyi region, Sehiy Tiurin, said on the Telegram messaging app. The Ukrainian military said its air forces had taken out all 11 Russian drones. It has been months since either Russia or Ukraine made a significant territorial gain in the 20-month conflict, as losses continue to mount.

Russia prepares to withdraw from nuclear test ban treaty,Law to revoke ratification of CTBT on its way to President Putin for signing after parliament vote,"Russian lawmakers have approved a bill revoking the ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). The move adds to the tension between Moscow and the West amid Russia’s war in Ukraine. The upper house Federation Council unanimously approved the bill to abandon the landmark agreement outlawing nuclear weapons tests on Wednesday. The lower house State Duma passed it in an accelerated vote last week. The legislation now only needs the signature of President Vladimir Putin to come into effect. Moscow announced on October 6 its intention to withdraw from the treaty to “mirror” the position of the United States, which has itself signed but never ratified the treaty. It is unclear, however, whether the revocation will result in Russia resuming tests of nuclear weapons. Putin said onOctober 5:“I hear calls to start testing nuclear weapons. I am not ready to say whether we really need to conduct tests or not.” Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said earlier this month that Moscow will continue to respect the ban and will only resume nuclear tests if the US does so. However, he noted on Wednesday that the US conducted a chemical explosion at its test site in Nevada. While Washington said the test would help it “detect” low-yield nuclear explosions, Ryabkov told the Federation Council that the blast was “undoubtedly a political signal”. “As our president said, we must be on alert, and if the United States moves towards the start of nuclear tests, we will have to respond here in the same way,” the official said. The US stated earlier this month that it was“disturbed”by Russia’s move to revoke ratification of the treaty. “A move like this by any state party needlessly endangers the global norm against nuclear explosive testing,” the US State Department said. Russia should not be “wielding arms control and irresponsible nuclear rhetoric in a failing attempt to coerce other states”, the State Department added, appearing to suggest that the move was aimed at pressuring the US and other countries who are supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russian forces. Since invading the neighbouring country, Putin has repeatedly invoked Russia’s nuclear doctrine.    With the abandonment of the CTBT, the last remaining bilateral nuclear weapons treaty between Washington and Moscow is New START, under which the pair used to regularly inspect each other’s nuclear facilities and limit warheads. Russia suspended the treaty in February. It is due to expire in early 2026. On Wednesday, Ryabkov told journalists in Moscow that the Kremlin had received informal proposals from the US to resume talks on issues of strategic stability and arms control “in isolation from everything that is happening”. However, he said that Moscow believes it is “simply impossible” to return to such dialogue without a change in the “deeply fundamental hostile course towards Russia on the part of the US”.

Russia claims destruction of three Ukrainian boats off Crimea,"The Black Sea, which Ukraine needs to export its grain, has been a key battleground in the ongoing war.","Russia’s Ministry of Defence says its naval forces have destroyed three unmanned Ukrainian boats in the northern part of the Black Sea off the Crimean Peninsula, the latest in aseries of attacksaround the contested waterway that is crucial to Russia’soffensiveagainst Kyiv. “Anti-sabotage missiles and bombs hit the area where the unmanned boats were detected,” the ministry said on the Telegram messaging app on Tuesday. It added that an anti-mining and an “anti-sabotage” operation was being conducted off the port of Sevastopol in the Black Sea, where Russia’s Black Sea Fleet is based. Moscow has used that fleet, comprised of some 30 warships, to try to blockade Ukraine’s coastline and fire missiles at Ukrainian cities. It was not immediately clear whether there were any casualties from the latest Black Sea attack — and Kyiv issued no immediate comment. Ukraine has in recent monthsstepped up attackson Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, helping it win back limited control of the Black Sea and, at times, push Russian warships further east.    In September, Kyiv claimed it had hit two naval vessels and struck Sevastopol’s port infrastructure, inflicting what appeared to be the most severe damage to that area in the war. “Ukraine’s actions have wrestled control of Ukraine’s western territorial waters back from Russia and prevented the Black Sea Fleet from threatening Odesa with amphibious assault or providing tactical fires and logistical support to Russian forces in Kherson,” retired US Army Major-General Gordon Skip Davis Jr toldAl Jazeerain early October. Ukraine’s engagement in the Black Sea has helped it establish a new “humanitarian corridor” in the waterway to get out its exports after Moscowdeserteda deal to guarantee Kyiv’s shipments in July. Since the opening of the corridor, which cuts through the waters of NATO members Bulgaria and Romania to deter Russia, Ukraine has exported some 700,000 tonnes of grain, helping it preserve a key component of its economy. “We see a trend towards an increase in the number of ships leaving our ports. We hope it will continue,” senior Ukrainian agricultural official Mykola Solsky said on Monday.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/24/russia-claims-destruction-of-three-ukrainian-boats-off-crimea
China’s Wang Yi to pay rare visit to US as two countries try to repair ties,Visit takes place amid Israel-Hamas war and escalating tensions in the disputed South China Sea.,"Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi will travel to the United States later this week as part of an ongoing effort to repair the two countries’ strained ties amid growing geopolitical crises. Wang will visit Washington from October 26-28 and meet US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and President Joe Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan, officials said, after Blinken and other top officialstravelled to Beijingin June. The US is keen to ensure disagreements between Washington and Beijing do not veer into conflict and that they can work together on issues of mutual concern. Other US politicians have travelled to China since Blinken’s visit, with California Governor Gavin Newsom currently in the country to discuss climate change. “We continue to believe that direct face-to-face diplomacy is the best way to raise challenging issues, address misperception and miscommunication and explore working with the Chinese where our interests intersect,” one official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity, told the Reuters news agency. The meetings are likely to cover a range of issues, including theIsrael-Hamas conflict, theUkraine warand the escalating tension in the South China Sea, senior administration officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the Associated Press news agency. Washington is sending military aid to Israel and Ukraine, while Beijing has grown closer to Russia since the Ukraine war began in February 2022, and has called for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. A second official said the US would “push the Chinese to take a more constructive approach on both”. Wang heldphone callswith the foreign ministers of Israel and the Palestinian Authority on Monday and expressed sadness at the civilian suffering as a result of the conflict. He reiterated China’s calls for a ceasefire and backing for a two-state solution. Washington has placed importance on China’s ability to influence Iran. Blinken, during his whirlwind trip last week to the Middle East, held a phone call with Wang asking him to use Beijing’s influence in the region to ensure the conflict does not widen. Wang’s trip takes place about three weeks ahead of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in San Francisco, where there are expectations that President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping might meet. The US officials did not confirm the leaders’ meeting, nor did they say if Wang’s visit would prepare for such a meeting. Instead, Wang’s trip was described as reciprocal to Blinken’s visit to Beijing. Beijing has yet to confirm if Xi will travel to San Francisco for the annual APEC summit. US-China relations have been deteriorating since 2018 over issues such as trade, thesituationin the northwestern region of Xinjiang, the militarisation of the South China Sea, the rising pressure on the self-governed island of Taiwan and the origins ofCOVID-19. Biden and Xi last met in November 2022 on the sidelines of the Group of 20 meeting in Indonesia. At that time, they agreed to resume talks, set up work groups on specific issues and expand person-to-person exchanges. US officials said territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas were also likely to be on the agenda, saying that Washington was deeply concerned by China’s “destabilising and dangerous actions” in the South China Sea. The Philippines, a key US ally, this week accused Chinese coastguard vessels of “intentionally” colliding with its vessels on a resupply mission at Second Thomas Shoal, in the most serious incident this year. Beijing claims the shoal as its territory although it lies within Manila’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Re-establishing military-to-military ties with China also remains a top concern for the US, the officials said, adding that this meant sustained communications throughout the ranks. Defence Minister Li Shangfu, who has not been seen in public for nearly two months amid a corruption probe, had snubbed US calls to meet. He had been targeted with US sanctions in 2018 over Russian weapons purchases.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/24/chinas-wang-yi-to-pay-rare-visit-to-us-as-two-countries-try-to-repair-ties

Turkey’s Erdogan submits Sweden’s bid for NATO membership to parliament,Move comes after months of back-and-forth with western countries over new additions to alliance amid war in Ukraine.,"Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has submitted a bill on Sweden’sNATO membershipbid to parliament, after months of back-and-forth with Western countries over the issue. Erdogan told his NATO allies at a summit in July that he wouldsend the legislationto the Turkish parliament when it reconvened on October 1, having previously raised objections over a range of security concerns. Since parliament reopened, however, Turkish officials have repeatedly said Stockholm needed to take more concrete steps to clamp down on the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) armed group, which has been designated a “terrorist organisation” by Turkey, the European Union and the United States. “The Protocol on Sweden’s NATO Accession was signed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on October 23, 2023 and referred to the Grand National Assembly of Turkey,” the presidency said on social media platform X on Monday. Sweden’s Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson welcomed the development. “Now it remains for the parliament to deal with the question,” Kristersson said on social media platform X. “We look forward to being a NATO member.” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said he looked forward to a “speedy vote” in the Turkish parliament. There is no set timeframe for ratification. The bill will be put on the agenda of parliament’s foreign affairs commission, which will have to pass it before it can be sent to the general assembly for ratification. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Sweden and Finland abandoned their long-standing non-aligned status and asked to join NATO in May 2022. In order for new countries tojoin the transatlantic military alliance, all 31 current NATO members must endorse their efforts. Finland’s request was approved by all members, and it became a NATO member in April. Sweden’s bid for membership has been ratified by all members apart from Hungary and Turkey. Erdogan had accused Stockholm of being too soft on the PKK and other groups his country considers to be security threats. Turkey also was angered by a series of Quran-burning protests in Sweden. Turkey’s foreign ministrycalled the eventsa “despicable attack” and called for “decisive measures to prevent this hate crime” in a statement issued at the time. In July, Sweden’s Supreme Court rejected an extradition request from Turkey for two men accused of membership in the movement of US-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, who Turkey blames for a failed coup effort in 2016.     Turkey lifted its opposition after US President Joe Biden’s administration signalled it would let Turkey buy 40 new F-16 fighter jets and modernisation kits from the US. Ankara also received assurances from Sweden that it would help revive Turkey’s own quest to join the EU. Under the deal, NATO as an organisation agreed to address Turkey’s concerns about “terrorism”. Stoltenberg said he had appointed an assistant secretary-general to serve as his special coordinator in this effort.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/23/turkeys-erdogan-submits-swedens-bid-for-nato-membership-to-parliament
Russian court extends detention of US journalist Alsu Kurmasheva,"The journalist is accused of failing to register as a ‘foreign agent’, a charge watchdogs have called ‘spurious’.","A Russian court has ruled that Russian-American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva should remain in detention until early December, adding to what rights groups say is a crackdown on media in the country. Kurmasheva, an editor for the US government-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s (RFE/RL’s) Tatar-Bashkir service, wasarrestedby Russian law enforcement in the central city of Kazan on October 18. She is accused of failing to register as a “foreign agent” and collecting information on the Russian military, Russia’s state-run news site Tatar-Inform reported. If convicted, she faces up to five years in prison. On Sunday, a district court in Kazan ruled Kurmasheva must be held for six more weeks as a “preventative measure” in advance of her trial. RFE/RL acting president, Jeffrey Gedmin, said the organisation was “disappointed” by Kurmasheva’s prolonged detention and called for her “immediate release”. Kurmasheva is the second American journalist to face charges in Russia this year, following thearrestin March of Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reporter Evan Gershkovich on “espionage” charges. Gershkovich, who is being held in Moscow’s Lefortovo prison, is the first American charged with spying in Russia since the end of the Cold War. His lawyers, the WSJ, and the White House have all dismissed the allegations, with the US government blaming Russia for “harassing US citizens”.    Press freedom groups and independent journalists have denounced Russia’stargeting of media members, which they say has intensified since it invaded Ukraine in February 2022. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), an independent, New York-based non-profit that advocates for correspondents around the world, called the charges against Kurmasheva “spurious” and urged for them to be dropped. “CPJ is deeply concerned by the detention of US-Russian journalist Alsu Kurmasheva on spurious criminal charges and calls on Russian authorities to release her immediately and drop all charges against her,” said Gulnoza Said, CPJ’s Europe and Central Asia programme coordinator. .@pressfreedomis deeply concerned by Wednesday’s detention of@RFERLjournalist Alsu Kurmasheva in the western#Russiancity of Kazan and calls on#Russianauthorities to release her immediately.https://t.co/wKcchSDybX#FreeThePress — CPJ Europe and Central Asia (@CPJ_Eurasia)October 18, 2023  Kurmasheva, who is based at RFE/RL’s headquarters in the Czech capital, Prague, was stopped at Kazan international airport on June 2 on her arrival in Russia to attend to a family emergency, the media outlet said. Officials confiscated her passports and issued her a fine for not registering her US passport with Russian authorities, RFE/RL said. She was awaiting the return of her passports when the new charges were announced earlier this month. Russia told RFE/RL to declare itself as a foreign agent in 2017 but the media organisation has contested Moscow’s application of foreign agent laws in the European Court of Human Rights. Dmitry Kolezev, an independent Russian journalist, wrote that the criminal article being used against Kurmasheva effectively required her to voluntarily declare herself a “foreign agent”. He had previously called the article, which is rarely used, “treason light”. Russia’s Federal Security Service has declared an extremely broad spectrum of information to be sensitive to national interests, he wrote, and a foreign agent can now be anyone who has simply “fallen under foreign influence”. “This is a law by which anyone can be convicted at all,” he said, adding: “In general, they’ve taken another hostage.” Hundreds of journalists have gone into exile since Russia launched the invasion of Ukraine, with state censors closing many respected independent media outlets and launching criminal cases against prominent journalists and regional bloggers.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/23/russian-court-extends-detention-of-us-journalist-alsu-kurmasheva

"Russian missile strike on mail depot in Ukraine kills six, officials say","At least 14 people were injured in the Russian missile strike on an ‘ordinary civilian’ site, Kyiv says.","Six people were killed and at least 14 injured when Russian missiles hit a postal distribution centre in Ukraine’s northeastern city of Kharkiv, Ukrainian officials have said. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a post on the Telegram messaging app that the strike on Saturday hit an “ordinary civilian” site. He shared a video showing a building with blown-out windows and heavy structural damage, with the logo of Ukraine’s Nova Poshta postal service in the background. Victims of the attack are being treated for shrapnel injuries and seven are in serious condition and “fighting for their lives,” regional Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. The injured are aged between 17 and 42, Syniehubov said. Syniehubov added that postal workers had been unable to seek shelter from the strike because the building was hit just seconds after a warning siren sounded. “The Russians have inflicted more terror on Kharkiv’s peaceful population,” he said on Telegram. The regional prosecutor’s office said the depot had been struck by two S-300 missiles fired by Moscow’s forces in Russia’s Belgorod region, north of Kharkiv. Kharkiv is Ukraine’s second-largest city and just 30km (19 miles) from the Russian border. The city was the site of heavy bombing by Russia in February 2022, in the early days of the Russian full-scale invasion.

Biden asks US Congress for $105bn in assistance for Israel and Ukraine,"More than $9bn would be set aside for humanitarian assistance in Ukraine, Israel, and Gaza.","US PresidentJoe Bidenhas submitted a request to Congress for more than $105bn to provide humanitarian and military aid to Israel and Ukraine, humanitarian assistance for Gaza and for immigration enforcement on the United States border with Mexico. The White House issued the funding request on Friday, following aspeech from Bidenthe day before in which he argued that US security is connected to the success of Ukraine and Israel. “This budget request is critical to advancing America’s national security and ensuring the safety of the American people,” National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters on Friday, echoing comments from Biden’s speech.    The comments come as Israel continues to bombard the beseiged Gaza Strip in response to a Hamas attack in southern Israel that killed at least 1,400 people, according to Israeli officials. The Palestinian Ministry of Health has said that 4,137 people have been killed in theIsraeli bombardment, and humanitarian conditions in Gaza have reached critical levels as medical workers plead for fuel and assistance that has yet to materialise. The Israeli campaign has sparked protests across the Middle East region, and critics have accused the US of turning ablind eyeto violations of international law. Biden’s request also faces complex political circumstances in Washington, where Republicans in the House of Representativeshave struggledfor more than two weeks to select a candidate for the vital role of House speaker. Some in the Republican Party have alsomounted resistanceto further US assistance to Ukraine, a dilemma Biden may hope to bypass by attaching Ukrainian aid to support for Israel and US border enforcement with Mexico, both important issues for the conservative party. The largest part of the spending package is dedicated to Ukraine, with more than $61bn for that purpose. More than $14bn would go towards Israel, much of it for the country’s air defence system known as “theIron Dome” and other weapons purchases. More than $9bn would be set aside for humanitarian assistance in Ukraine, Israel, and Gaza, and nearly $14bn would go towards USborder enforcement. “The world is watching and the American people rightly expect their leaders to come together and deliver on these priorities,” said Biden’s budget director, Shalanda Young, in a letter to interim House Speaker Patrick McHenry. “I urge Congress to address them as part of a comprehensive, bipartisan agreement in the weeks ahead.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/20/biden-asks-us-congress-for-105bn-in-assistance-for-israel-and-ukraine

Biden says US ‘holds world together’ as he condemns Putin and Hamas,President addresses US in rare Oval Office speech and explains why country should back Ukraine and Israel.,"United States President Joe Biden has said he will ask Congress for more money to support Israel and Ukraine, asserting in an impassioned speech that both nations were fighting enemies of democracy. Speaking to  Americans from the Oval Office, Biden sought to make a link between the actions of Hamas in Israel and those of Russian president Vladimir Putin who sent his troops into Ukraine for afull-scale invasionin February 2022. Biden said stopping such aggression was crucial not only for the security of the US but also for the wider world. “Hamas and Putin represent different threats but they share this in common; they both want to annihilate a neighbouring democracy,” he said. He said if the US walked away and aggressors succeeded, others might be “emboldened to try the same” spreading the risk of conflict to other parts of the world. “American leadership is what holds the world together,” the president said during the 10-minute speech, only the second he has made from the Oval Office during his administration. “American alliances are what keep us, America, safe. American values are what make us a partner that other nations want to work with.” Biden was speaking hours after returning from a whirlwind trip to Tel Aviv, where hereiterated US support for Israeleven amid its total blockade of Gaza and relentless bombardment of the Palestinian enclave of 2.3 million people.    The visit had been meant to include a meeting with Arab leaders but the talks were cancelled after Gaza’s Al-Ahli Arab Hospital was hit hours before, killing some 500 people. Amid calls for a ceasefire, Biden was able to secure a commitment from Israel and Egypt to open the Rafah crossing for desperately needed humanitarian aid. Biden said he would be lodging an urgent request to Congress to support Israel and Ukraine on Friday.  He did not put a value to the security package, but reports have suggested it could be as much as $100bn. “It’s a smart investment that will pay dividends for American security for generations,” the president stressed. Biden’s address comes amid paralysis in Congress where Republicans, who control the lower house, havestruggled to appointa new House of Representatives Speaker afterremovingKevin McCarthy earlier this month. He said politicians needed to rise above “petty, partisan, angry politics” and meet their responsibilities. A small group of ultra-conservative Republicans have become increasingly vocal about their opposition to continued funding for Ukraine, but analysts said the US public remained broadly supportive of the initiative and Biden’s speech would probably win over more people. “This dysfunction in the House is viewed very unfavourably by the US people and I suspect that the Republicans will be forced, if only for concern about their electoral chances next year, to resolve this within the next two weeks,” John Herbst, senior director at the Atlantic Council and a former diplomat, told Al Jazeera. The conflict in Gaza erupted on October 7, when Hamas launched asurprise attackagainst Israel, killing more than 1,400 people and taking dozens captive. At least 3,785 Palestinians have been killed in the bombing campaign. Biden accused Hamas of unleashing “pure, unadulterated evil” on the world, and stressed that there was “‘no higher priority” for him as president than bringing home the US citizens being held by the armed group. While making clear his support for Israel, Biden said he was “heartbroken” by the “tragic loss” of Palestinian lives and that he had spoken with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to reiterate that the US remains “committed to the Palestinian people’s right to dignity and right to self-determination”.    He stressed the urgent need for humanitarian assistance to the enclave and noted the agreement secured to get food, water and medicine into Gaza. “We cannot give up on peace,” he said. “We cannot give up on the two-state solution. Israel and the Palestinians equally deserve to live in safety, dignity and peace.” Biden’s speech at the Oval Office came after he again reassured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of US support for Kyiv in its bid to push Russian forces from Ukrainian territory. He noted that the US was an “essential” part of a group of about 50 countries that havebackedUkraine since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion. Will make sure Ukraine has the “weapons they need to defend themselves”, he said, stressing to his domestic audience that there were no plans to send US troops to Eastern Europe. “When Putin invaded Ukraine he thought he could take Kyiv and the whole of Ukraine in a matter of days, but Putin has failed, and he will continue to fail,” Biden said. “Kyiv still stands because of the bravery of the Ukrainian people. Ukraine has regained more than 50 percent of the territory Russian troops once occupied.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/20/biden-says-us-holds-world-together-as-he-condemns-putin-and-hamas

The outlet Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) said in a statement on Thursday that Alsu Kurmasheva, an editor and a dual citizen of Russia and the United States, faces up to five years in prison. “Alsu is a highly respected colleague, devoted wife, and dedicated mother to two children,” said RFE/RL acting President Jeffrey Gedmin in a dual statement with the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), a press freedom group. “She needs to be released so she can return to her family immediately.” .@pressfreedomis deeply concerned by Wednesday’s detention of@RFERLjournalist Alsu Kurmasheva in the western#Russiancity of Kazan and calls on#Russianauthorities to release her immediately.https://t.co/wKcchSDybX#FreeThePress — CPJ Europe and Central Asia (@CPJ_Eurasia)October 18, 2023  US State Department spokesman Matt Miller told reporters that the arrest “appears to be another case of the Russian government harassing US citizens”. “We have not been officially notified by the government of Russia about this arrest,” he said. Russia hastightened controlsover the media following its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, designating many reporters as “foreign agents”. Kurmasheva, who works for RFE/RL’s Tatar-Bashkir Service, is the second US reporter to be detained by Russia this year, after Wall Street Journal reporterEvan Gershkovichwas arrested in March on espionage charges. Press freedom groups and the US government have strongly criticised such detentions as a form of stifling dissent. CPJ called the charges against Kurmasheva “spurious” in its statement with RFE/RL. “CPJ is deeply concerned by the detention of US-Russian journalist Alsu Kurmasheva on spurious criminal charges and calls on Russian authorities to release her immediately and drop all charges against her,” said Gulnoza Said, CPJ’s Europe and Central Asia programme coordinator.

US House chaos continues as Jim Jordan readies for second speaker bid,Republican Jim Jordan is set for his second bid to be elected speaker after he fell short by 17 votes in the first round vote on Tuesday.,"The US House of Representatives is entering its third week with no leader after right-wing Republicans ousted the former speaker, leaving the body unable to take action on key issues including the wars in Ukraine and Israel-Palestine. Former House Speaker McCarthy wasvoted outon October 3 after angering far-right members of his own party by partnering with Democrats to pass a debt ceiling bill that narrowly averted a government shutdown. Ever since, the fiercely divided House, which requires a majority vote from present members to select its leader, has been unable to coalesce around a new speaker. Thedysfunctionmeans it likely cannot pass bills or greenlight resolutions needed to direct aid overseas. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Republican from Georgia, said the picture looks dire and advocated awarding more powers to Speaker Pro Tempore Patrick McHenry to ease the crisis. “We can’t sit around and suck our thumbs and hope the world will wait until the House Republicans get their act together,” he told Fox News. On Tuesday, right-wing Republican Jim Jordan fell short in his first bid for the position by 17 votes, with 20 of his own party membersdefecting. All 212 Democrats in the body cast their ballots for their party’s Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Jordan is set to push forward with a second bid for the leadership role on Wednesday, but it remains unclear if he has built up enough additional support to come out on top. At least one Republican who voted against Jordan on Tuesday, Representative Doug LaMalfa, agreed to support his bid in the second round, but that would still leave him far short of the 17 additional votes he needs. The House was set toconveneat 11:00am EST (15:00 GMT) for the vote. Jordan, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee who was endorsed by former US President Donald Trump, will be expected to show significant progress. But the holdouts appear to be dug in. Jordan’s Republican opponents met after voting against him and nearly all reaffirmed their objections, with some predicting he could lose another 10 Republicans. The Ohio lawmaker has little of the goodwill among the rank and file that McCarthy spent years cultivating, and it is unlikely that they would indulge him in the 15 rounds of voting that it took to get his predecessor elected. There is momentum behind a push to appoint caretaker Speaker McHenry for a limited period – expanding his purely ceremonial powers so that he can bring legislation to the floor. Lawmakers are expected to vote on a motion to formally elect McHenry – probably until the end of the year or until a permanent speaker is elected – if the second speaker vote doesn’t go Jordan’s way. “After two weeks without a speaker of the House and no clear candidate with 217 votes in the Republican conference, it is time to look at other viable options,” Ohio congressman Dave Joyce said in a statement reported by the political newspaper The Hill. “By empowering Patrick McHenry as Speaker Pro Tempore we can take care of our ally Israel until a new Speaker is elected.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/18/us-house-chaos-continues-as-jim-jordan-readies-for-second-speaker-bid
"Russia attempts to seize military, diplomatic initiative against Ukraine","Russian forces mounted new assaults against Avdiivka and Lyman in the east, but Ukrainian defenders held the line in the 86th week of war.","Russia sought to break out of its diplomatic isolation, resupply its dwindling weapons stockpiles, and take back the military initiative it lost this year in the 86th week of itswar in Ukraine. Russian PresidentVladimir Putinmet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping to celebrate the 10th anniversary of China’s Belt and Road initiative, which aimed to develop rail, road and port infrastructure across Eurasia to facilitate the export of Chinese goods. Xi is one of Putin’s few allies, but while there he also metHungarian premier Viktor Orban, in a symbolic gesture of support for the Kremlin from one of Ukraine’s purported allies. “Hungary has never wanted to confront Russia,” Orban said. “Hungary’s goal has always been to establish and mutually expand the best contacts,” he said. More ominously, Putin has been receiving substantial shipments of ammunition fromNorth Korea, the White House said. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said on October 13 that as many as 1,000 containers’ worth of North Korean weapons may have reached Russia between September 7 and October 1. The Washington Post’s analysis was that shipments had begun earlier, after high-level meetings between Russian and North Korean officials in mid-August, and that the shipments were greater than what Kirby suggested. Satellite images the Washington Post published on October 16 suggested that two Russian ships had successfully transported cargoes from the North Korean free trade zone port of Rason to Russia’s port of Dunai several times since August. “This will have a very serious effect on the trajectory of the war [in Ukraine],” Jack Watling, senior research fellow for land warfare at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), told the newspaper. “North Korea has the ability to manufacture a lot of ammunition, and it has significant stockpiles,” he said. North Korea reportedly manufactures 122mm Grad rockets and 122mm artillery rounds. Kirby also said Russia may have reciprocated in kind. Pyongyang has sought “fighter aircraft, surface-to-air missiles, armoured vehicles” and “ballistic missile production equipment” from Russia, he said, and there was evidence that Russian containers had flowed towards Pyongyang. Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have been wooing each other for some time. Putin met Kim at the Vostochny Comsodrome in Russia’s far east on September 13. Kim was reportedly interested in Russian satellite technology, and pledged to stand with Russia in the “fight against imperialism”. North Korea failed to launch spy satellites in May and August because of second- and third-stage flight issues. The relationship appears to be warming. Russian Foreign MinisterSergey Lavrovarrived in Pyongyang on October 18 in apparent preparation for a trip by Putin. Russia said it could decide to provide the same long-range, nuclear-capable ballistic missile technology Kim is interested in to Iran. A 2015 ban on the transfer of such technology expired on October 18. “Supplies to and from Iran of products falling under the Missile Technology Control Regime no longer require prior approval by the UN Security Council,” Russia’s foreign ministry said in a statement on Tuesday. Ukraine also received military technology during the week. On Tuesday, October 17, the Pentagon confirmed that all 31 M1 Abrams tanks it had pledged were on Ukrainian soil. On the same day, Ukraine fired the first 18 Army Tactical Missiles (ATACMS) sent by the US, with 160km (100-mile) range. The missiles apparently landed on airfields in the Russian-occupied port of Berdyansk and Russian-occupied Luhansk city. Russian forces launched a new effort to capture the eastern city ofAvdiivkaon October 10. They have long succeeded in forming a pincer to its north and south, but Ukrainian defenders have held them at bay. Russian forces attacked with armoured assault units, helicopters and concentrated artillery in 10 or 12 directions at once, said the head of the city’s military administration, Vitaliy Barabash. Artillery barrages were so continuous as to prevent rescue crews from recovering the bodies of those killed. “They are striking with everything they have. Bouts of shooting, artillery, multiple rocket launchers, mortars and a lot of aircraft,” Barabash, told national television. “Operations cannot take place in such conditions. It is frightening to leave because the road is under fire. And no easier to stay as there is no place, no basement that can withstand the strikes.” Russian forces had captured 4.52sq km (1.75sq miles) around Avdiivka and were 5.25km (3.2 miles) and 3.32km (2.06 miles) away from key Ukrainian supply routes to the north and south, respectively, assessed the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank. At the same time, Russian forces were attempting to break through Ukraine’s defences in the Lyman-Kupyansk area, at the northeastern end of the front. The commander of Ukraine’s ground forces, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said there had been a sharp increase in fighting. “The enemy is preparing, seriously preparing for offensive actions, bringing in staff,” Syrskyi said in the footage posted on the Telegram messaging app. “The main goal is to break through our troops’ defences and recapture our territory.” Ukraine appeared to be holding its own. Neither Russian nor Ukrainian sources indicated any major territorial changes, and Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared to temper expectations by calling the action around Avdiivka an “active defence” on national television. “Both Ukrainian military observers and Russian sources stated that Russian forces did not achieve their desired immediate breakthrough, and Russian forces faced initial high losses and a likely slower than anticipated rate of advance,” said the ISW. Military observers also assessed that Russia had suffered losses of at least three dozen tanks and armoured vehicles – equivalent to a battalion. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said on October 13 that the new Russian offensives near Lyman and Avdiivka “did not come as a surprise,” and said Ukraine would repel them. Meanwhile, Ukraine kept up its own counteroffensive in the south and east, making marginal advances according to Ukrainian official sources. Russian sources said Ukraine mounted attacks on the front-line village of Verbove in the south, on October 15 and 16. Geolocated footage published on October 15 showed that Ukrainian forces marginally advanced towards the railway line north of Klishchiivka, beside the fiercely contested eastern city of Bakhmut. Ukrainian forces also harassed Russian positions south of Bakhmut on October 14. Damage to the Baltic Connector gas pipeline was likely caused by interference, said Finnish officials on October 15. The pipeline, which runs between Finland and Estonia was shut down on Sunday. “It is likely that the damage to both the gas pipe and the communication cable is the result of external activity,” President Sauli Niinisto of Finland said in a statement. “The cause of the damage is not yet clear.” The incident raised the spectre of sabotage, similar to that which destroyed a section of the Nordstream 2 pipeline in September 2022. There was good news for four Ukrainian families during the week. Qatar succeeded in securing the release of four Ukrainian children abducted by Russian forces, after mediating with Russia at Ukraine’s request. The children, aged two to 17, were to travel to Ukraine via various routes after reaching Qatar’s embassy in Moscow. Two had already arrived home on October 16.

Russia’s Lavrov visits North Korea amid claims of military cooperation,The Russian foreign minister’s visit comes as the US fears Russia and North Korea are developing closer military links.,"Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has landed in North Korea, amplifying United States concerns about deepening North Korea-Russia military cooperation amid the war in Ukraine. Lavrov’s trip to the Asian country on Wednesday, his first since 2018, is expected to pave the way for a visit to Pyongyang by Russian President Vladimir Putin, whohostedNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Moscow just a month ago. Lavrov is expected to brief the North Koreans on Putin’svisit to China, which is hosting some 130 global leaders for its third Belt and Road Initiative forum, and also discuss Putin’s potential upcoming visit, according to Russia’s state news agency. Lavrov’s visit to North Korea comes days after the US expressed concern that Pyongyang is supplying Moscow with weapons, in return for a range of military assistance, including advanced technologies. Washington claimed on Friday that North Korea has delivered more than 1,000 containers of military equipment and munitions to Russia in recent weeks.    The US allegations have been denied by bothNorth Koreaand the Kremlin. “Russia, as a responsible member of the world community, strictly adheres to its international obligations towards Pyongyang through the UN Security Council,” Russian Ambassador at Large Oleg Burmistrov said. “At the same time, we are categorically against the introduction of new restrictive measures,” he added. Putin and Kim heaped praise upon one another during their September meeting, with the North Korean leader fully backing Russia in its war with Ukraine andwishingthe Russian president victory against the “imperialists’ anti-Russia scheme”. Putin claimed that there were areas of potential military collaboration between the two states in spite of numerous UN sanctions against North Korea over its weapons and ballistic missile programme. “There are certain restrictions. Russia complies with all these restrictions. But there are things that we can talk about … Under the current rules, we also have opportunities, which we see and discuss,” the Russian president said. Putin and Lavrov’s engagement in Asia is part of a push by Moscow to deepen ties throughout the continent as geopolitical tensions persist over its war in Ukraine. On Tuesday, Putin accepted an invitation from Vietnamese President Vo Van Thuong to visit Hanoi, a key Russian ally and arms purchaser. However, Moscow’s diplomatic drive in East Asia could be eclipsed by the escalating war in Gaza, which saw anair strikekill at least 500 civilians at a crowded hospital on Tuesday night. Russia’s foreign ministry spokeswoman said Russia considered the attack “as a crime – as an act of dehumanisation”. It also comes as Russia facescriticismfor an air strike in the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia that killed at least two civilians and wiped out two floors of a residential building. A Russian official in the city cast blame for the attack on Ukrainian forces.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/18/russias-lavrov-to-visit-north-korea-as-moscow-deepens-ties-in-asia
Xi hails ‘deepening trust’ between China and Russia as he meets Putin,Chinese president notes that he and Putin have met 42 times in the past decade and developed a ‘deep friendship’.,"Chinese leader Xi Jinping has told Russian President Vladimir Putin the “political mutual trust” between their countries was “continuously deepening” as the two men met for bilateral talks in Beijing. State news agency Xinhua reported on Wednesday that Xi also called for joint efforts by China and Russia to “safeguard international fairness” and “justice” as he hailed “close and effective strategic coordination” between their two countries. Xi noted that he and Putin had met “42 times in the past 10 years and [had] developed a good working relationship and a deep friendship”. The two leaders last met in March when Xi travelled to Moscow. The two men spoke at that time of a “new era” of cooperation, building on the “no-limits” partnership they announced in 2022 days before Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine. TheirBeijing meetingcomes as Kyiv continues a counteroffensive to remove Russian troops from its territory amid aworsening crisisover the Palestinian enclave of Gaza. China’s Middle East envoy Zhai Jun is due to travel to the region soon. “The visit aims to help with de-escalation in the Middle East,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told reporters at a regular briefing on Tuesday without going into further detail. “This is part of China’s efforts to promote peace talks.” Putin told Xi that China had a crucial role to play in foreign policy. “In the current difficult conditions, close foreign policy coordination is especially necessary – which is what we are doing, and today we will also discuss all of this,” the Russian leader said. The meeting is taking place on the sidelines of a forum to mark 10 years of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a globe-spanning infrastructure development policy that is one of Xi’s signature policies. Leaders and senior politicians from some 130 countries are in the Chinese capital for the event, which opened on Wednesday. China is Russia’s largest trading partner, with the exchange between the nations reaching a record $190bn last year, Beijing customs data shows. Putin is on a mission to strengthen the two countries’ already strong bond, although experts say Moscow is increasingly the junior partner in the relationship. Beijing has attempted to position itself as a mediator in theUkraine war, but it has refused to condemn Russia’s full-scale invasion, which began in February 2022.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/18/xi-hails-deepening-trust-between-china-and-russia-as-he-meets-putin

"Ukraine uses ATACMS long-range missiles, Zelenskyy says",President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirms that Kyiv used US-supplied long-range ATACMS missiles.,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has confirmed that Kyiv used US-suppliedlong-rangeATACMS missiles on the battlefield against Russian forces. “Today, special thanks to the United States. Our agreements with President Biden are being implemented. Very accurately – ATACMS proved themselves,” Zelenskyy said in his nightly address on Tuesday. The comments come after Kyiv’s military said Ukrainian forces struck airfields in Russian-held territory in eastern and southern Ukraine, destroying helicopters, knocking out an air defence missile launcher and damaging runways. Ukraine said it carried out “well-aimed strikes on enemy airfields” near the eastern city of Luhansk and the southern city of Berdiansk overnight, but gave few details. The country’s Special Operations Forces said nine helicopters, an air defence missile launcher and other equipment had been destroyed, runways had been hit, and heavy losses had been inflicted on Russian forces. Russia’s Defence Ministry did not mention the attacks. Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-installed official in the Zaporizhia region that is partly controlled by Moscow, said on the Telegram messaging app that Russian air defences had ensured the attack on the Berdiansk airfield was not successful. A Ukrainian lawmaker said the US-supplied ATACMS missiles were used in the attack on the airfield in Berdiansk. For months, Ukraine has pushed the US to provide it with ATACMS as it seeks toexpel Russian forcesfrom its territory. The US had previously held off on providing Ukraine with the long-range missiles, fearing their usecould riskan escalation of the conflict. ATACMS is already with us. The airfield in Berdyansk with enemy equipment was hit by them. Thanks to our partners! And Russians are already publishing photos 😀pic.twitter.com/6SVwPPhHz9 — Oleksiy Goncharenko (@GoncharenkoUa)October 17, 2023  Several US news outlets reported that ATACMS had been sent to and deployed by Ukraine. Politico reported that Washington had “secretly shipped” them over the last several weeks. Washington had previously hesitated to send the long-range missiles to Ukraine, partly due to concerns that they could enable Ukrainian strikes within Russian territory. Russia itselfhad warnedagainst sending longer-range missiles, with the Russian foreign ministry calling them a “red line” that would make the US “party to the conflict” in September 2022. Kyiv, for its part, insisted that ATACMS could play a vital role in its efforts to disrupt Russian supply lines, air bases, and rail networks within occupied Ukrainian territory. The Biden administration’s apparent reversal signals continued US support as Ukraine fights to make progress in a counteroffensive launched in June. Thecounteroffensivehas made only gradual gains through vast Russian minefields and heavily entrenched Russian positions, and Kyiv says Moscow is attacking in some areas ahead of the second winter since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. The Ukrainian military said on Tuesday that Russia was hoping to advance as far as possible towards the town of Kupiansk in northeastern Ukraine before winter, and that fighting continued around the town of Avdiivka on the eastern front. Kyiv says its forces are holding their ground, including around Avdiivka and Kupiansk.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/17/ukraine-uses-atacms-long-range-missiles-zelenskyy-says
"Russia’s Putin, Hungary’s Orban reaffirm bond ahead of Beijing summit",The two leaders discussed strengthening energy ties despite geopolitical strains due to the Ukraine war.,"Russian President Vladimir Putin and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban have underscored their countries’ strong ties ahead of an international forum in Beijing, saying that continuing “geopolitical tensions” due to the war in Ukraine do not affect their relationship. “Despite the fact that in the current geopolitical conditions, the possibilities for keeping contact and developing relations are very limited, it cannot but cause satisfaction that our ties with many European countries are maintained and developed,” Putin said, according to Russian news agencies. “One of those countries is Hungary.” Hungary, which is a member of the European Union and NATO but also has close ties with Moscow, has had its allegiancesput to the testover the war in Ukraine. Since Russia’s invasion, Budapest hasblockedweapons from passing through its territory to reach Ukraine and deepened energy ties with Moscow despite EUsanctionson Russian oil. Budapest is expected to play a decisive role in Ukraine’s bid to join the EU, positioning itself as a potential opponent to a December vote on accession talks. The EU is consideringreleasingbillions of dollars in aid to Hungary that has been blocked overalleged rule-of-law violationsin order to win Hungary over on the vote, which requires unanimous approval from EU members. Hungary is expected to use the Beijing summit as an opportunity to shore up close energy ties with Russia, from which itreceivesat least 80 percent of its gas. During Putin and Orban’s meeting, the leaders discussed gas and oil shipments and nuclear energy issues, Orban’s press chief Bertalan Havasi told the Reuters news agency. Orban also reportedly stressed the need for an end to sanctions on Russia and the fighting in Ukraine. The two leaders are joining numerous Southeast Asian and African leaders in Beijing for a two-day event celebrating the 10th anniversary of China’s Belt and Road Initiative, a mammoth infrastructure development strategy that spans more than 150 countries. Putin, one of the highest-profile leaders to attend the summit, said he hopes to link up with China’s efforts through an alliance of former Soviet Union nations to “achieve common development goals.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/17/russias-putin-hungarys-orban-reaffirm-bond-ahead-of-beijing-summit
Vladimir Putin to meet Xi Jinping in Beijing: Five things to know,Ties between Russia and China have deepened in recent years.,"Russian President Vladimir Putin hasarrived in Beijingand is scheduled to hold bilateral talks with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Wednesday. Ties between Russia and China have deepened in recent years, and Putin and Xi have developed a strong personal friendship. The two men last met in March in Moscow. Putin’s trip to China during which he will take part in a forum to mark 10 years of the Belt and Road Initiative, is the first time this year that the Russian leader has travelled to a country beyond those that were once part of the former Soviet Union. “(The) Russian delegation’s presence in Beijing is important for Moscow,” Alicja Bachulska, an expert on Chinese foreign policy at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told the AFP news agency. “It will legitimise Russia in the international arena by creating a positive image of Putin not being completely isolated in the context of war.” Here are five things to know: Xi and Putin forged their friendship when the pair shared cake and vodka shots to mark the Russian leader’s birthday at a summit in Indonesia in 2013. They have since drawn closer, with Xi accompanying Putin on a high-speed train ride across China to make traditional steamed buns five years later, and the two men eating caviar-topped blini during a river cruise when Xi later visited Russia. In 2019, the Russian leader threw Xi a birthday party, surprising him with ice cream at a conference in Tajikistan. On a visit to Moscow the same year, Xi told Russian media: “President Putin is the foreign colleague that I have interacted with most extensively. He is my best friend, and I greatly treasure our friendship.” In an interview with Chinese state media ahead of the latest visit, Putin was effusive in his praise for Xi, praising the relevance and significance of Xi’s policies and vision of a multipolar world. Broadcaster CGTN said that Putin described Xi as a “true world leader”. The two men were born just a few months apart in the early 1950s. While Xi was the scion of a family of communist revolutionaries, Putin was born in more humble circumstances before becoming an intelligence officer in the Soviet Union. Both men found lessons in the collapse of the USSR – for Putin, it was a humiliation and a “major geopolitical disaster” and for Xi, a cautionary tale for China’s own Communist Party. In line with their leaders’ deepening friendship, China and Russia have also moved closer. Putin was last in Beijing in February 2022, just days before he sent thousands of troops across the border into Ukraine in what he called a “special military operation”. At that time the two men signed an agreement promising a“no-limits” relationship.By March this year, they were talking of a “new era” of cooperation. Russia is now China’s second-largest trade partner outside Asia, and trade between the two countries surged 30 percent in the first half of this year, Russian Economy Minister Maxim Reshetnikov said on a visit to China. Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, said that from China’s view, “Russia is a safe neighbour that is friendly, that is a source of cheap raw materials, that’s a support for Chinese initiatives on the global stage and that’s also a source of military technologies, some of those that China doesn’t have.” “For Russia, China is its lifeline, economic lifeline in its brutal repression against Ukraine,” Gabuev told The Associated Press news agency. Putin comes to Beijing amid expectations that Israel could soon launch a ground invasion of the blockaded Palestinian enclave of Gaza. The issue was high on the agenda when the Russian and Chinese foreign ministers held talks in Beijing on Monday, with both calling for intensified efforts to avoid ahumanitarian disaster. “It is imperative that a ceasefire be put in place, that the two sides be brought back to the negotiating table, and that an emergency humanitarian channel be established to prevent a further humanitarian disaster,” Wang said at the meeting, according to a Chinese transcript of the meeting. A Russian-drafted UN Security Council resolution calling for a humanitarian ceasefire failed to get the minimum nine votes needed in the 15-member body on Monday, and Putin and Xi are likely to pick up the baton on the issue. Putin held multiple calls with leaders in the region on Monday including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. He told Netanyahu that Moscow wanted to help prevent a humanitarian disaster. China’s state broadcaster CCTV reported earlier that Zhai Jun, Beijing’s special envoy on the Middle East, will visit the region this week to push for a ceasefire and promote peace talks. Even amid the deepening crisis in the Middle East, Russia’s continuing conflict in Ukraine is also likely to feature in the talks between the two men. Recent reports suggestintense fightingon the eastern front around Avdiivka, as well as in the northeastern Kupiansk-Lyman area. Beijing has sought to portray itself as a neutral party in the war and in March, about the time of Xi’s visit to Moscow, embarked on a flurry of diplomatic activity to promote its 12-point peace plan. Those efforts have made little headway and Ukraine’s allies have largely dismissed Beijing’s attempt to position itself as mediator. Still, on a visit to China that ended at the weekend, European Union policy chief Josep Borrell urged China to do what it could to end the war in Ukraine. Borrell said he had conveyed to the Chinese that the EU considered Russia “a huge threat” to its security and that the group was committed to supporting Ukraine. The EU is expected to have a summit with China before the end of the year.    Oil and gas is a key concern for Russia amid international sanctions, and the bosses of Russia’s Gazprom and Rosneft are said to be part of Putin’s delegation to Beijing. Russia is eager to secure a deal to sell more natural gas to China and plans to build the Power of Siberia-2 pipeline, which would travel through Mongolia and have an annual capacity of 50 billion cubic metres (bcm). For China, Russia is not only a major source of oil and gas: one of the world’s biggest nuclear powers is also a rich potential source of technology as its People’s Liberation Army (PLA) seeks to modernise its conventional and nuclear forces by 2035. Russian aviation, rocket and even submarine technology have been shared over recent decades with China, according to a 2022 assessment by the United States. China and Russia also cooperate closely on civilian nuclear plants.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/17/putin-to-meet-xi-in-beijing-five-things-to-know
Russia’s Vladimir Putin visits ‘dear friend’ Xi Jinping in China,Putin is attending China’s Belt and Road summit for a third time but the meeting could be overshadowed by wars.,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has arrived in Beijing ahead of a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday. Xi invited his “dear friend” Putin to China’s thirdBelt and Road Initiative forumwhere the leaders of 130 countries will discuss one of Xi’s signature international projects. But the meeting’s theme is likely to be overshadowed by theIsrael-Hamas waras well as Russia’s ongoinginvasion of Ukraine. China is one of the first countries Putin has visited since the Hague-based International Criminal Court (ICC)issued an arrest warrantagainst him in March, accusing the Russian leader of illegally deporting children from Ukraine. China is not one of the 123 countries that are members of the ICC, so it is not obliged to transfer Putin to The Hague for trial. Earlier this month, Putin visited Kyrgyzstan but China is the first outside of former Soviet republic countries he has visited this year. Kyrgyzstan is also not an ICC member.    Beijing has rejected Western criticism of its partnership with Moscow even as the war in Ukraine continues, insisting that their ties do not violate international norms and that China has the right to collaborate with whichever country it chooses. Trade between neighbouring China and Russia has been soaring since Moscow began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, with Beijing importing Russian oil after other countries placed sanctions on Russian imports. In an interview with Chinese state broadcaster CGTN ahead of his visit this week, Putin said that a “multipolar world is taking shape, and the concepts and initiatives put forward by President Xi Jinping are highly relevant and significant”, CGTN reported. Russia’s top diplomat Sergey Lavrov has arrived in Beijing ahead of Putin and held talks with China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Monday. Xi and Putinlast met in Russiain March this year. Speaking at the Kremlin during that visit, Xi told Putin, “Right now there are changes – the likes of which we haven’t seen for 100 years – and we are the ones driving these changes together.” Putinlast visited Chinafor the Beijing Winter Olympics in February 2022 when Russia and China released a sweeping 5,000-word statement reaffirming theirno-limits relationship– days before the Russian president sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine. It is the third time Putin has attended the Belt and Road forum, which continues until Wednesday. He attended the two previous meetings in 2017 and 2019. Putin has alsoaccepted an invitationfrom leader Kim Jong Un to visit North Korea after the two presidents met in Russia last month.

Ukrainian children repatriated from Russia through Qatari mediation,The Gulf country negotiated a mechanism to return Ukrainian children taken by Russians to their families.,"Qatar has announced that its mediators have succeeded in securing Russian agreement for the return of four Ukrainian children to their families in what is hoped to be the first phase of repatriations for more children. The children, who range in age from two to 17, have been received at the Qatari mission in Moscow which “facilitated the hosting of the children and their families…and accompanied them to their destination”, according to a statement by the Qatari Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This first repatriation of Ukrainian children is part of a longer-term mechanism Qatar negotiated with both sides after months of secret talks, according to a Qatari official who spoke to Reuters. Commenting on the repatriation, Qatari Minister of State for International Cooperation Lolwah al-Khater said in a statement: “Today, we celebrate the power of unity as we witness the reunification of children and their families. I extend my deepest gratitude to the State of Russia… and the State of Ukraine… Their tireless efforts, alongside the State of Qatar’s commitment, have been instrumental in facilitating this heartwarming success. “We stand resolute in our commitment to this humanitarian cause and hope that our collaboration remains an inspiring symbol of hope and compassion.” Ukraine says up to 20,000 children have been taken by Russia into the country or territory that it holds. In May 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree making it easier for Russians to adopt Ukrainian children who were “without parental care”. In March, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova, Russia’s commissioner for children’s rights, stating that it had “grounds to believe [they bear] responsibility for the war crime of … unlawful transfer of population from occupied areas of Ukraine to the Russian Federation, in prejudice of Ukrainian children.” Both individuals dismissed the ICC warrants and accusations while Ukraine welcomed the court’s decision. Observers at the time worried that this would spelltrouble for any future diplomatic attemptsto mediate the situation, but the successful launch of this mechanism signals some hope for a solution.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/16/ukrainian-children-repatriated-from-russia-through-qatari-mediation
China prepares for Belt and Road summit in shadow of Israel-Gaza war,President Xi Jinping’s signature economic initiative has extended Beijing’s global reach.,"China is due to host representatives of 130 countries for a forum on its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) that is likely to be overshadowed by theIsrael-Gaza war, and the continuing conflict in Ukraine. At the top of the forum’s guest list is Russia’s President Vladimir Putin, on his first trip to a major global power since the Ukraine invasion threw his regime into international isolation, leading the International Criminal Court (ICC) to issue awarrant for his arrest. Leaders began arriving in Beijing on Monday for an event showcasing the global reach of the BRI – a signature project of President Xi Jinping. While China hopes the forum will help boost its standing as a leading global power, Israel’s continued bombardment of the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip is likely to dominate the headlines. Israel declared war on Hamas after its fighters launched a surprise attack on Israel on October 7, killing more than 1,400 people, most of them civilians, and taking others captive.    Gaza has been under attack ever since with entire neighbourhoods flattened. More than one million people have fled their homes amid expectations that Israel will soon launch aground offensive. At least 2,670 people have been killed in Gaza. China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi has condemned Israel’s actions for going “beyond the scope of self-defence” and called for an end to the violence. “(Israel) should listen earnestly to the calls of the international community and the UN secretary general, and cease its collective punishment of the people of Gaza,” Wang said on Sunday. Beijing has been criticised by Western officials for not specifically naming Hamas in its statements on the Israel-Gaza conflict. Wang had on Sunday spoken with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who called on China to use its “influence” in the Middle East to push for calm. China has a warm relationship with Iran, whose leaders support both Hamas and Hezbollah, the Lebanese group that could open a second front against Israel. Earlier this year, China brokered a rapprochement between former regional foes Iran and Saudi Arabia. Beijing’s special envoy Zhai Jun will visit the Middle East this week to push for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas conflict and promote peace talks, China’s state broadcaster CCTV said on Sunday, without specifying which countries he would visit. Niva Yau, a nonresident fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub, told AFP the BRI summit would allow Beijing to frame attendance as a gesture of support for its position. “Any head of state that attends the summit, it’s almost as if they agree with Beijing’s positions on these global issues,” she said.  A number of leaders have already arrived in Beijing ahead of the two-day forum, which gets under way on Tuesday. Among them are Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Chilean President Gabriel Boric, Kenyan President William Ruto and Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. On Monday Russia’s top diplomat Sergey Lavrov flew into Beijing and within hours held talks with Wang. Putin – whose strategic dependence on China has only grown since Russia’s February 2022 invasion of neighbouring Ukraine thrust his country into international isolation – is expected to arrive overnight. This year, trade between China and Russia has soared to levels not seen since the beginning of Moscow’s war in Ukraine, with Chinese imports of Russian oil offering Moscow a critical lifeline as international sanctions bite. China has positioned itself as a neutral party, putting forward its own 12-point peace plan, but it has also refused to condemn the war and has offered Moscow vital diplomatic and financial support. At the heart of the deepening partnership is therelationship between Xi and Putin, who have described each other as “dear friends”. Theirallianceis also forged by a symbiotic necessity, each seeing the other as a necessary bulwark in their shared struggle against Western dominance. In an interview with Chinese state broadcaster CGTN ahead of his visit this week, Putin hailed ties with Beijing and the “mutual benefits” of the BRI. “President Putin pointed out that a multipolar world is taking shape, and the concepts and initiatives put forward by President Xi Jinping are highly relevant and significant,” CGTN reported. “He stated that President Xi Jinping is a well-recognised leader on the world stage and is a true world leader,” the broadcaster said. Putin also reportedly “shared pleasant memories between President Xi and him, and hoped tradition continues when they meet in China in the future”. Xi travelled to Moscow in March for a summit with Putin.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/16/china-prepares-for-belt-and-road-summit-in-shadow-of-israel-gaza-war
Tusk celebrates potential win over ruling nationalists in Poland election,Poland should see official election results from Monday but exit polls suggest an end to eight years of nationalist rule.,"Polish opposition leader Donald Tusk has welcomed exit polls showing opposition parties on course to potentially secure a majority in the country’s parliamentary election over the ruling conservative nationalist party. A former European Council President, Tusk’s victory would see Poland moving closer to European allies and reviving support for Ukraine. His Civic Coalition (KO) party ran with Third Way and the New Left on separate tickets but with a shared commitment to restoring ties with Europe. The ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party initially supported Ukraine but ran on areversal of its position, apparently believing that Polish voters were growing weary ofRussia’s warin the country. The Ipsos exit poll projected that while PiS would emerge as the largest party with approximately 36.8 percent of the vote, roughly equivalent to 200 seats, the KO-led opposition grouping would secure 248 of the 460 seats in Poland’s parliament, enough to form a majority. Notably, initial results suggested Sunday’s election may have also inspired a higher turnout than in 1989, when some 63 percent of Polish people voted in an election that removed communist authorities. “Democracy has won … This is the end of the PiS government,” Tusk told party members at a celebration on Sunday evening where he and others wore red hearts on their clothing. As a member of the European Union and NATO, Poland’s changing position on neighbouring Ukraine, and response to peoplefleeing the conflict, was being closely watched. The high turnout led to long queues at polling stations but people who were still in line when polls officially closed were reportedly still able to cast their votes.    PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski was muted in his comments at the party headquarters in central Warsaw, indicating it was not clear whether Sunday’s results would translate into another term in office. “We have to have hope that regardless of whether we are in power or in opposition, our project will continue,” said Kaczynski. “We will not let Poland lose [the] right to decide its own fate.” PiS denies its reforms have undermined democracy, saying they were meant to make the country and its economy more fair while removing the last vestiges of communism. It has built its support base on generous social handouts and a pledge of more independence from Brussels. Tusk has said he would seek to unblock about 110 billion euros of European Union funds earmarked for Poland, which have been frozen due to rule-of-law concerns, from day one if he heads a new government.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/16/new-era-tusk-celebrates-exit-polls-suggesting-opposition-win-in-poland

"Poland votes in key election amid rising nationalism, Ukraine war",Ruling conservative nationalist party is pitted against an opposition that accuses the government of eroding democracy.,"Poland is voting in akey electionthat would significantly impact the country’s local and foreign policies. People headed to the ballots on Sunday, with voting expected to end at 9pm local time (19:00 GMT). Nearly 30 million people are eligible to vote and turnout is expected to be among the highest in years. The ruling United Right (ZP) coalition led by the nationalist conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party hopes will earn it an unprecedented third term in office, while the opposition warns it could put the country on a path towards leaving the European Union. Political analysts say Poland could face a period of instability if PiS fails to secure a majority.    PiS has cast the election as a choice between security from unfettered migration, which it says its opponents support, and a creeping westernisation it sees as contrary to Poland’s Catholic character. “This election will show whether Poland will be governed by Poles, or by Berlin or Brussels,” PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski told supporters at the party’s last campaign rally on Friday. “What will win is good, patriotic governance … not the screaming and hatred that fill the media and which affect weaker minds,” he said in Skarzysko-Kamienna, a city in the PiS heartland in southeastern Poland. Since sweeping to power in 2015, the party has been accused of undermining democratic checks and balances, politicising the courts, using publicly owned media to push its own propaganda, and stirring up homophobia. PiS denies wrongdoing, or wanting to leave the EU, and says its reforms aim to make the country and its economy more fair while removing the last vestiges of communism. It has built its support on generous social handouts, which it says rival parties will stop.    Its main rival, the liberal Civic Coalition (KO), led by former European Council president Donald Tusk, has campaigned on a pledge to undo PiS reforms, hold its leaders to account and resolve conflicts with Brussels over democratic rule. Tusk says his party would maintain social support. “We need change if you care about fundamental values such as trust, accountability, tolerance to dominate public life again,” Warsaw mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, a senior KO official, told voters on Friday in Kalisz, in central Poland. The outcome of the elections will be important not just to Poles, but also to policymakers in the United States, across Europe, and especially to Ukraine and Russia. Poland has been central to the West’s response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine as it has equipped Kyiv with German-made Leopard 2 tanks and Polish MiG-29 fighters. The country has also taken in millions of Ukrainian refugees since the start of the war.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/15/poland-votes-in-key-election-amid-rising-nationalism-ukraine-war

Russia’s Putin makes rare visit to Kyrgyzstan despite ICC arrest warrant,Russian leader is expected to travel to China next week after a two-day visit to Bishkek.,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has arrived in Kyrgyzstan on his first foreign trip since the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued a warrant for his arrest for alleged war crimes. Putin’s two-day trip to Bishkek will culminate in his attendance at a summit of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), an intergovernmental organisation made up of former Soviet republics, amid claims of waning Russian influence in the region. Putin, who has rarely left Russia since sending troops into Ukraine in early 2022, is also expected to travel to China next week for the third Belt and Road Forum in Beijing. During a meeting with Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov on Thursday, Putin reiterated Russia’s importance as a trade partner and Kyrgyzstan’s biggest investor and said the two sides would further develop cooperation. “I would like to thank the president for the invitation. We have good reasons [to be here], but even without reason, this visit is long overdue,” Putin said. The Russian leader also highlighted double-digit growth in Russian-Kyrgyz trade, which some analysts in the West suspect is due to sanctions-busting by Russian businesses. Last week, the Kyrgyzstan central bank urged local banks to tighten controls to improve compliance with Western sanctions against Moscow. In July, the United States imposed sanctions on four Kyrgyz companies for re-exporting electronic components and other technology to Russia. In Kyrgyzstan, Putin is also expected to take part in a ceremonies to mark the 20th anniversary of the opening of Russia’s airbase near the town of Kant, which allows Moscow to project power in the region. The ICC in March issued a warrant for Putin and Russia’s rights commissioner, Maria Lvova-Belova, for allegedly deporting thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia. Russia, which does not recognise the ICC’s authority, has rejected the warrant as “illegal”. Kyrgyzstan and China are also not members of the ICC and therefore not bound by its jurisdiction. Still, Russia has taken precautions with foreign visits in the past, sending Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in place of Putin to the BRICS summit in August.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/12/russias-putin-makes-rare-visit-to-kyrgyzstan-despite-icc-arrest-warrant
Three killed in Russia as debris from downed Ukrainian drone destroys homes,Two others seriously injured after debris from destroyed drone crashed into homes in Russia’s Belgorod region.,"Three people were killed, including a young child, and two injured when debris from a destroyed Ukrainian drone fell on homes inRussia’s Belgorod region, a local official says. Belgorod regional GovernorVyacheslav Gladkov said early on Thursday that Russian air defences shot down an “aircraft-type” unmanned aerial vehicle as it approached Belgorod city, and the falling debris had destroyed several homes. “To great sorrow, there are dead. Operational services recovered the bodies of two people from the rubble – a man and a woman,” Gladkov wrote on the Telegram messaging app. The governor later updated the death toll to three following the discovery of a child’s body beneath the rubble of a house. “Three people were killed, one of them a small child,” he wrote, accompanied by pictures of a house reduced to a pile of masonry behind red and white police tape. “A difficult morning for all of us,” he said, offering his condolences to the loved ones of those killed. “We are all grieving.” Rescuers recovered the bodies of two people from under the rubble of a house in Belgorod after an attack by a Ukrainian drone, the region’s governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said:https://t.co/vxD8dILHSgpic.twitter.com/pBQVwyyJuN — TASS (@tassagency_en)October 11, 2023  Two other people, a man and a woman, were also injured in the incident and had been brought to hospital. The man was in a coma and had suffered burns to his respiratory tract and upper and lower body, according to Russia’s state news agency TASS. The injured woman had a concussion and a fractured leg, TASS reported, adding that doctors had assessed the woman’s condition as “serious”. Russia’s Ministry of Defence said earlier on Thursday that an attempted Ukrainian drone attack in the Belgorod region had been “thwarted” at about 11:30pm local time (20:30 GMT) on Wednesday. The ministry made no mention of casualties. Russia has come underregular attack by Ukrainian drones in recent months, mainly in border regions but also in the capital, Moscow. According to the regional governor, Ukrainian shelling killed two civilians in the Belgorod region on Tuesday.

Russia tries to spoil Ukraine’s counteroffensive before winter,"In the 85th week of war, Russia ruins attacks across the front, an apparent bid to sap the progress of Kyiv’s forces.","Russia launched a series of small-scale offensives in the 85th week of its war with Ukraine, appearing to try and freeze Kyiv’s four-month-old counteroffensive by fixing its forces in place. Ukraine’s counteroffensive has succeeded in wresting back half the territory Russia captured earlier this year, breaching Russia’s vaunted “Surovikin line” of defence, weakening Russian logistics by striking deep into Crimea, and depriving Russia of control of the western Black Sea. Russia resumed an offensive effort towards the city of Kupiansk at the northeastern end of the front, on October 6, Ukraine’s eastern forces spokesman said. Russian sources confirmed the ground assault in the direction of Synkivka following an artillery barrage. Ukrainian officials said in July that Russia had launched a push to capture Kupiansk, and military analysts have assessed that this is a Russian effort to distract Ukrainian forces from parts of the front where they are achieving success. “If I was Russia today … I would do an immediate spoiling attack. I would go on the offensive somewhere,” Colonel Seth Krummrich, a vice president at Global Guardian, a security consultancy, told Al Jazeera in late June. “I would punch, because right now you’re running out of options …  [the Ukrainians] are going to find a breach and they’re going to punch through it,” he said. That is what Russia did in Kupiansk the following month, but it didn’t stop Ukrainian forces from puncturing their first line of defence on the southern front, near Robotyne, in September. Russian forces near Robotyne appeared to have rotated troops of the 291st and 71st Motorized Rifle Regiments after gruelling September battles in which they retreated before a growing Ukrainian salient through their minefields and trenches. Russian forces near Robotyne and Verbove were busy re-mining front lines previously cleared by Ukrainian forces and slowing them down, said one Russian military blog calling itself Paratrooper’s Diary. “Although enemy armoured vehicles are increasingly appearing in the Robotyne-Verbove section, the enemy has reduced the movement time due to mined areas,” the blogger said. “Our sappers manage to re-mine areas already cleared by the enemy.” But the blog also corroborated Ukrainian reports that the counteroffensive was continuing. “The artillery does not stop for a minute,” the blogger said. Russian forces were going on the offensive elsewhere, too. As many as three Russian battalions attacked Ukrainian defences in October near Zherebyanky, west of Robotyne, claiming to have advanced 2km (1.2 miles). They launched a battalion-level offensive near Huliaipole on the southern front, advancing “several hundred metres”, according to one Russian reporter. And they stepped up efforts to capture Avdiivka, an eastern city they have surrounded to the north and south with a pincer movement. These tactical operations were aimed at freezing what has been a slow but steady Ukrainian advance ahead of Russian presidential elections, said Igor Girkin, a Russian military officer who organised the Russian militia that has fought the Ukrainian army since Donetsk and Luhansk declared they were seceding in 2014. “With a 99 percent probability, the Kremlin decided to freeze the war until the elections, that is, until March 2024,” wroteGirkin, who goes by the nom de guerre Strelkov, in a letter posted by his wife on social media. In his analysis, Russian President Vladimir Putin will do nothing to “seriously aggravate the social, economic and internal political situation in the country”, until spring, the sole priority being “to prevent deep breakthroughs or sensitive operational successes of the enemy”, until then. The Kremlin may expect a lull in winter fighting due to seasonal rainfall that will muddy the ground and make manoeuvres by tanks and armoured fighting vehicles difficult. But Ukraine has said it could maintain the momentum of its summer counteroffensive through the winter. “If the cold weather hits immediately … the ground will remain frozen and heavy machinery will be able to move on it,” said Ilya Yevlash, Ukraine’s eastern forces spokesman. Despite Russian spoiling attacks, Ukrainian forces pressed on with their counteroffensive. In their southern salient, they marginally advanced south of Robotyne on October 6 and broadened their salient westwards towards the village of Kopani on October 7. They also attempted to expand that salient east, towards Novofedorivka, on October 10. In the east, they continued to advance past the recently recaptured settlements of Klishchiivka and Andriivka south of Bakhmut, in an ongoing effort to surround the captured city and retake it. And on the Donetsk-Zaporizhia border, where the eastern and southern fronts meet, geolocated footage showed that they advanced near the village of Mykilske on October 10. Despite Slovakia’s September 30 election of a pro-Russia government, which has announced a halt to weapons deliveries to Ukraine, Slovakia joined fellow NATO members to accelerate training and munitions promised to Ukraine on October 9. NATO ministers voted to “further increase their military, intelligence, financial, training and humanitarian support to Ukraine”, including “long-range missiles and multi-purpose fighter aircraft, and to sustain this support for as long as it takes for Ukraine to prevail”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/11/russia-tries-to-stop-ukraines-counteroffensive-before-winter
US announces $200m military assistance package for Ukraine,US package is the first to be announced since Congress dropped new funding for Kyiv to avoid a government shutdown.,"The United States will provide Ukraine with a new $200m military assistance package, including air defence and rocket ammunition. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced the package at the opening of a two-day meeting of Kyiv’s international supporters at NATO headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday. The package is the first since Congress dropped new funding for Kyiv from a bill to avoid a government shutdown earlier this month. The decision to drop the funding amid resistance from Republicans raised questions about Washington’s continued commitment to helping Ukraine fight against Russian forces. On Wednesday, Austin repeated assurances that the US will stand with Ukraine “for as long as it takes”. Absent further action by Congress, US President Joe Biden’s administration still has authority to withdraw more than $5bn worth of equipment from military stocks. However, the Department of Defense has only $1.6bn in remaining funding to replace donated weapons and equipment. Austin and Air Force General Charles Q Brown are also expected to use the meeting to reassure allies, including Kyiv, that it can maintain support for Ukraine while backing Israel in its conflict with Hamas. So far, the US has provided Ukraine with $44bn in military assistance since Russia’s invasion, including tanks, rockets and millions of rounds of ammunition. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also attended the meeting in Brussels to press allies for more weapons before winter. “We are preparing, we are ready,” Zelenskyy said in advance of a meeting of defence ministers. “Now, we need some support from the leaders.” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Russian President Vladimir Putin was “preparing once again to use winter as a weapon of war” by targeting energy infrastructure in Ukraine. “We need to prevent that. With more advanced and increased capabilities for air defence, we can make a big difference,” Stoltenberg said. Ukraine has waged acounteroffensive to recapture territoryin the south and east of the country since July, but has failed to make a breakthrough due to Russian fortifications and landmines. During the two-day gathering in Brussels, officials are also expected to discuss other security-related issues, including recent damage to an undersea gas pipeline and telecommunication cable linking Finland and Estonia.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/11/us-announces-200m-military-assistance-package-for-ukraine
Putin concerned over ‘catastrophic’ civilian deaths in Israel-Gaza war,Russian leader blames explosion of violence on failed US Middle East policy that ignored aspirations of Palestinians.,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has voiced concern at the “catastrophic increase” in the number of civilians killed in Israel and the Gaza Strip amiddays of fightingbetween Hamas and the Israeli military. The Russian leader also took aim on Tuesday atWashington’s policy in the Middle East, which he said had failed by not taking the needs of Palestinians into account. Putin, whose military has been accused of killingthousands of civilianssince its full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year, expressed his concern for civilians killed in Israel and Gaza during a phone call with Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Kremlin said in a statement. The “emphasis was placed on the sharply worsening situation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict zone”, the Kremlin said of the leaders’ discussion. “Deep concern was expressed about the continuing escalation of violence and the catastrophic increase in the number of civilian casualties,” the Kremlin said. The two leaders reiterated the need for “an immediate ceasefire” and for “the resumption of thenegotiation process“, the Kremlin added, saying that Erdogan noted it was “regrettable to target civilian installations and that Turkey doesn’t welcome such acts”.    Earlier on Tuesday, Putin called the creation of a Palestinian state “necessary” and blamed the latest explosion of violence on US policy in the region. “I think that many people will agree with me that this is a vivid example of the failure of United States policy in the Middle East,” Putin said at the start of a meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed al-Sudani on Tuesday. Putin said Washington had sought to “monopolise” efforts at forging peace between Israel and Palestinians, and he accused the US of not bothering to seek compromises acceptable to both sides but instead had pushed its own ideas for a solution to the conflict. The US had ignored the interests of Palestinians, including their need for their own independent state. 💬 President Putin: Unfortunately, we see a sharp escalation of the situation in the#MiddleEast. ☝️ This is an example of the US failed policy in the region. It tried to monopolise the settlement process, but was not concerned with finding compromises acceptable to both sides.pic.twitter.com/gpqNeXnH0B — MFA Russia 🇷🇺 (@mfa_russia)October 10, 2023  Putin made no mention of Russia’s role in the Middle East peace process.  Along with the US, the United Nations and the European Union, Moscow has since 2002 formed part of a “Quartet” of powers charged with helping to mediate Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said the Kremlin was in touch with both warring sides in Israel and Gaza and would seek to play a role in resolving the conflict. Peskov did not specify how that would be achieved. “We intend to keep making efforts and play our role in terms of providing assistance to seek ways to a settlement,” he said.     Since the latest crisis erupted, the Kremlin has sought to appear even-handed, underscoring its relations with both Israelis and Palestinians. Moscow has longstanding ties with the Palestinians, including Hamas, which sent a delegation to Moscow in March. But it also has “a lot in common” with Israel, including the fact that many Israelis are former Russian citizens, Peskov said. Peskov also warned that the current violence was “more than worrying”. “It has the potential to be dangerous by growing and spilling over from the current zone of the Arab-Israeli conflict,” he said. The Russian Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that it was ready to help reach a settlement between Israel and Palestinians by coordinating regional players. “We are in close contact with the leading regional players, whose role in stabilising the situation and creating conditions for establishing direct Palestinian-Israeli dialogue is indispensable,” ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said, according to Russia’s state-run TASS news agency.

"‘External’ source suspected as Finland, Estonia gas, telecom link damaged",Damage to undersea gas and telecommunications links comes just over a year after sabotage to Nord Stream gas pipeline.,"Damage to an undersea gas pipeline and telecommunications cable connecting Finland and Estonia appears to have been caused by “external activity”, Finnish and Estonian officials said. The Finnish government on Tuesday reported damage to a gas pipeline and a telecommunications cable with Estonia following an unusual drop in pressure on Sunday in the Balticconnector gas pipeline, which led to its shutdown. Speaking at a news conference, Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo stopped short of calling the pipeline damage an act of sabotage but said it could not have been caused by regular operations. “According to a preliminary assessment, the observed damage could not have occurred as a result of normal use of the pipe or pressure fluctuations. It is likely that the damage is the result of external activity,” Orpo said. Finnish and Estonian authorities are working closely together to investigate the damage to 🇫🇮🇪🇪 undersea infrastructure. Finland is well prepared, our readiness is high and the situation is stable. Our security of supply is not threatened.#BalticConnector — Petteri Orpo (@PetteriOrpo)October 10, 2023  Finland’s National Bureau of Investigation was leading an inquiry into the leak, Orpo said. Finnish telecoms operator Elisa also confirmed on Tuesday that it suffered a break in a data cable connecting Finland and Estonia over the weekend. Asked by a reporter whether Finland’s governmentsuspected Russian involvementin the latest incident, Orpo said he did not want to speculate on potential perpetrators before authorities completed the investigation in Finland. Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said that Estonia and Finland had informed their allies in NATO and the European Union regarding the incidents and she was in contact with the Finnish leader on the “next steps” to be taken. “Both Estonia and Finland are taking these incidents very seriously and are doing everything possible to determine the circumstances,” Kallas said in a statement. I convened ministers and relevant authorities to discuss incidents regarding#Balticconnectorand an undersea communication cable. While there’s no threat to our security of supply, both Estonia and Finland are taking the incidents very seriously. 🔗https://t.co/SkPNc4IAr0 — Kaja Kallas (@kajakallas)October 10, 2023  The damaged cable and pipeline “are in very different locations, although the timing [of the incidents] is quite close”, Estonian Defence Minister Hanno Pevkur told a press briefing. Pevkur said that Estonian authorities received photos confirming that the damage to the Balticconnector was “mechanical” and “human-made”. “This damage must have been caused by some force that was not created by … a diver or a small underwater robot; the damage is more massive,” Pevkur said, adding that seismologists have previously stated there was no explosion at the incident site. Heidi Soosalu, a seismologist at the Estonian Geological Service, told the Estonian public broadcaster ERR on Tuesday that neither Estonian nor Finnish seismic stations registered anything resembling explosions during the time period the Balticconnector registered a loss of pressure. The incident comes just over a year after theNord Stream gas pipelinesrunning between Germany and Russia in the Baltic Sea were damaged by explosions believed to be sabotage. That case remains unsolved.    Estonia’s Navy told The Associated Press news agency they were conducting an investigation on the damaged gas pipeline together with the Finnish military in the Gulf of Finland. The 77km-long (48 miles) Balticconnector pipeline runs across the Gulf of Finland from the Finnish city of Inkoo to the Estonian port of Paldiski. The 300 million euro ($318m) pipeline, largely financed by the EU, started commercial operations at the beginning of 2020. The Balticconnector has been the only gas import channel to Finland, apart from LNG, since Russian imports were halted in May 2022, following Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.     Russia stopped supplying gas to Finland after it refused to pay Moscow in rubles, a condition imposed on “unfriendly countries” – including EU member states – as a way to sidestep Western financial sanctions against Russia’s central bank. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she had spoken with Finnish premier Orpo and Estonia’s Kallas regarding damage to the gas pipeline and telecoms cable. “Only by working together can we counter those seeking to undermine our security, and ensure that our critical infrastructure remains robust and reliable in the face of evolving threats,” von der Leyen said in a statement. I held calls with Prime Ministers@kajakallasand@PetteriOrpoon the on-going investigations into the damage on the gas pipeline and data cable connecting Estonia and Finland.

"Ukrainians stand with Israel amid war with Hamas, despite grievances",Historic ties between Kyiv and Tel Aviv appear stronger than recent disagreements over weapons deliveries as Ukrainians express support for Israel.,"Kyiv, Ukraine –To Valentina Boyko, what’shappeningin Ukraine and Israel is strikingly similar. “We were attacked. They were attacked. Both attacks were stealthy, backstabbing,” the Kyiv resident told Al Jazeera, referring to Russia’s invasion of her homeland and theHamas-Israeli warthat began on Saturday. Just metres away from her, lying on one of the concrete slabs that surround the Israeli embassy in Kyiv, were fresh flowers and pieces of paper reading “Praying for Israel” in English and Ukrainian. Boyko’s opinion is shared by many in Ukraine, despite Tel Aviv’s refusal to provide air defence systems to Kyiv and sanction Moscow, as well as Israel’s steps to temporarily suspend visa-free travel for Ukrainians and restrict the arrival of refugees. Historic ties seem stronger than current disagreements – a mere century ago, what is now Ukraine was home to one of the largest diasporas of Ashkenazi Jews and the birthplace of Hasidism, a reformist doctrine in Judaism. Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who won Ukraine’s presidency in 2019 by the largest landslide in the country’s history, and some of his cabinet members are proud of their Jewish roots. “I have Jewish blood. And I’m president. And nobody cares, right?”Zelenskyytold The Times of Israel in 2020. The fact and the phrase would seem impossible to Nikolai Gogol, Ukraine’s most celebrated author, who described how Cossacks killed Jews with habitual, thoughtless cruelty. However, Zelenskyy’s heritage does not guarantee an overwhelming approval by Israelis of everything he says and does. His March 2022 address to Israeli lawmakers was lambasted for his comparison of the Russian-Ukrainian war with the Holocaust and his scathing criticism of Israeli-Russian ties. However, as the war with Russia approaches its 600th day and the annexation of Crimea nears its 10th anniversary, many Ukrainians see Israel as a nation that thrives despite a decades-long conflict – and one that has advanced weaponry and intelligence services that minimise risks for civilians. The idea proved outdated on Saturday, when Hamas unleashed surprise attacks on Israel from the Gaza Strip, killing and kidnapping hundreds – and catching Israeli intelligence and military off guard. “Hamas de-sacralised the myth about the Israeli defence sector. Turns out that Israel wasn’t ready for the invasion neither technically nor technologically,” Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kushch told Al Jazeera. He seessimilaritiesbetween Hamas leaders and those in the Kremlin, who can mobilise their subjects against their neighbours. “In the 21st century, a consumer and information society is not ready for a total war. That’s an axiom. But poor and ideologised societies are ready for it,” he said. The Hamas-Israeli war may also convince Ukrainians to seek membership in NATO even more doggedly.     “Recent events will somehow tarnish Israel’s image from the viewpoint of maintaining their security and will prompt more critical attitude to all formats of US security ‘guarantees’ beyond NATO,” Kyiv-based expert Vyacheslav Likhachev told Al Jazeera. Before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Kyiv and Tel Aviv had a “good level of mutual understanding,” he said. But last year’s return to power of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has long boasted of his “special” ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, galvanised the dissatisfaction. “The Ukrainian public, with its sensitivity sharpened by the collective trauma, also began to somewhat childishly get vexed with Israel,” Likhachev said. Some 43 percent of Ukrainians were opposed to Tel Aviv’s refusal to supply arms, but a third still “understands and accepts” the decision, according to a January poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology. Some 52 percent of Ukrainians still consider Israel a “friendly nation,” and only 12.5 percent disagree, the poll said. “The current public opinion about Israel is truly strategically balanced because potentially (and in some practical aspects – right now) Israel is Ukraine’s important partner,” the poll’s organisers concluded. And even Ukrainian far-right groups and their lionisation of figures who contributed to the Holocaust do not affect the attitude. In Ukrainian-Israeli ties, every year used to begin with an almost ritual diplomatic spat. Before the full-scale Russian invasion, thousands used to march with torchlights on January 1, the birthday of Stepan Bandera, a Ukrainian nationalist who briefly sided with Nazi Germany to fight with Communist Moscow during World War II. And even though Bandera was thrown in a German concentration camp after a falling out with the Nazis, and was poisoned in Munich in 1959 by a Soviet assassin, Israel lambasts him and his supporters for their role in the mass killings of Ukrainian Jews. So, hours after the marching nationalists would stop chanting “Bandera is our father, Ukraine is our mother” on the streets of Kyiv, the Israeli embassy would issue a protest denouncing the march. But despite their penchant for carefully staged street rallies, Ukrainian far-right groups have little political clout, which has diminished even further during the war. And another annual event would prove how dismal and insignificant anti-Semitism in Ukraine has become. Every October, tens of thousands of Hasidic Jewsflockto the grave of Rabbi Nachman, who founded the Breslov branch of Hasidism and asked his followers to visit his grave in the central Ukrainian city of Uman. Even though Russian cruise missiles reached Uman several times, killing two dozen people, more than 32,000 pilgrims still thronged the streets near Nachman’s grave in mid-September. “Nothing can stop them, their faith and determination are too strong,” Uman resident Alex Melnik, whose family has for years rented their apartment to pilgrims, told Al Jazeera. And as reports from Israel and the Gaza Strip dominate news broadcasts and front pages, some Ukrainians have very simplistic explanations for who and what is behind the conflict. “Russia helped Hamas start this war because Putin wants to distract the world from our war,” Roman Zhelyabenko, who fled his Russia-occupied city of Berdyansk in southeastern Ukraine for Kyiv last year, told Al Jazeera.

Russia launches dozens of drones into Ukraine in latest air raid: Kyiv,Ukraine says it downed 27 Russian drones out of 36 sent from the Crimean peninsula overnight.,"Russia launched 36 drone attacks overnight on Ukraine, according to Kyiv’s air force, in Moscow’s latest air raid targeting the country. Ukraine’s air force said in a statement on Tuesday that its defence systems had destroyed 27 of the drones. The attacks using Iran-made Shahed drones targeted the Odesa, Mykolaiv and Kherson regions of Ukraine, the air force said on the Telegram messaging app. Moscow launched a total of 36 Iranian-made drones from the Russia-annexed Crimean peninsula, it added. The air force did not say which targets, if any, the nine other drones may have hit. The governor of Mykolaiv, Vitaliy Kim, said on Telegram that one of the drones had been destroyed over his region. There was no immediate comment from Russia. Separately, Kherson region’s administration said on its Telegram channel that four people had been injured and several buildings damaged in 79 instances of shelling using mortars, artillery and drones. Russia has stepped up attacks on ports in southern Ukraine since exiting a deal that allowed safe passage for grain shipments through the Black Sea in July. Kyiv has also warned that Moscow is restarting a campaign of aerial attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure, mirroring attacks that last year left millions without heating and water for long periods. In September, Moscow launched more than 500 Shahed drones – a monthly record, according to Ukrainian consultancy group Defense Express. Moscow launched its full-scaleinvasionof Ukraine in February 2022, after annexing the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine in 2014.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/10/russia-launches-dozens-of-drones-into-ukraine-in-latest-air-raid-kyiv

‘Essence is the same’: Ukraine’s Zelenskyy likens Hamas to Russia,"Ukrainian president says Moscow and the Palestinian armed group that attacked Israel are ‘terrorists’, while alleging Iran has a role in both conflicts.","Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has linked the recent assault by Hamas on Israel with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and criticised Iran over both conflicts. On Monday, he likened the Palestinian armed group to Russia, saying it was a “terrorist organisation” while Russia can be considered a “terrorist state”. Zelenskyy told NATO’s Parliamentary Assembly in Copenhagen via video link: “The only difference is that there is a terrorist organisation that attacked Israel and here is a terrorist state that attacked Ukraine. The intentions declared are different, but the essence is the same.” Ukraine said about 1,000 Iranian-designed Shahed drones were used by Russia over the past six months. “Iran can’t say it has nothing to do with what is going on in Ukraine if it sells Shaheds to Russia. Iran can’t say it has nothing to do with what is going on in Israel if its officials claim the support of what is going on in Israel,” Zelenskyy said. Israel was caught off guard on Saturday when Hamas launched an attack, blowing up parts of the country’s highly fortified separation fence, and sending fighters into Israeli communities along the Gaza frontier. The surprise assault set off amajor warbetween Israel and the armed group, which has so far killed more than 1,100 people. The conflict continues to escalate, with Israel on Monday declaring that it will impose a“total blockade”on Gaza, the besieged, densely populated Palestinian strip often described as an “open-air prison”, where 120,000 people have already been displaced due to the latest tensions. Palestinian fears of an Israeli ground invasion of Gaza are growing. Iran has denied it has supplied Russia with Shahed kamikaze drones for use in Ukraine and has said it is not involved in the weekend’s attacks on Israel. An Israeli army spokesperson said on Saturday that “Iran’s tentacles” were “everywhere” when asked about a possible role. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said there was no evidence Iran was behind the attacks on Israel, but he said there were longstanding ties between Tehran and Hamas. Iran hasvoiced supportfor Hamas after its attack, but slammed the allegations of involvement in Hamas’s operation as politically motivated. Rahim Safavi, an adviser to Supreme Leader Ali Hosseini Khamenei, was quoted by the semi-official ISNA news site, saying: “We congratulate the Palestinian fighters … We will stand by the Palestinian fighters until the liberation of Palestine and Jerusalem.” Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said attacks by Hamas were proof of the Palestinians’ increased confidence in the face of Israel’s occupation. Al Jazeera’s Dorsa Jabbari, reporting from Tehran, said Iran’s solidarity with Hamas is historical. “Iran, since the revolution of 1979, has really seen itself as a Shia minority in the Middle East – it’s [one of few] Shia majority [countries in the region]. “There were a number of steps taken by the founder of the revolution, Ayatollah Khomeini, to ensure that Iran’s position remained secure. “One was to align with resistance groups, not just Shia groups like Hezbollah, but also like Hamas and Islamic Jihad, to ensure their own existence down the line. “Israel has always been a point of contention for Iran. They don’t believe Israel has a right to exist as a country. They say Palestine is a country that has been oppressed.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/9/essence-is-the-same-ukraines-zelenskyy-likens-hamas-to-russia

"Russia-Ukraine war: List of key events, day 592",,"Here is the situation on Sunday, October 8, 2023. Russia’s defence ministry said it shot down two Ukrainian S-200 anti-aircraft missiles over the Moscow-annexed Crimean Peninsula. The ministry issued two near-identical Telegram posts on Saturday night saying that Kyiv had “attempted a terrorist attack” at 6pm (15:00 GMT) and 10pm (19:00GMT) Moscow time with an S-200 anti-aircraft missile that had been “converted to an attack version”. Another Ukrainian drone was also shot down near Moscow early on Saturday, the Russian TASS news agency reported, adding that it appeared to cause no damage or injuries. In Russia’s Belgorod, local authorities said three Ukrainian Tochka-U missiles were destroyed over the border region and that shelling by Kyiv’s forces had killed one person who was on the street at the time of the attack. In Ukraine, a member of Russia’s governing United Russia Party was killed by a car bomb in the Russian-held town of Nova Kakhovka in the Kherson region, according to officials. Vladimir Malov died in hospital, the officials said. In the Ukrainian town of Hroza in the Kharkiv region, local residents began burying victims of aRussian missile strikethat killed some 50 people on Friday. Representatives from the United Nations Monitoring Mission in Ukraine told The Associated Press news agency that conversations with local residents and survivors indicate “that virtually all those killed were civilians and that the target itself, a busy village cafe and store, was also clearly civilian”. Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of Russia’s Chechnya region and a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, proposed that a presidential election due next March should either be postponed due to the war in Ukraine or limited to one candidate. “I propose now, while the ‘special military operation’ is under way, to unanimously decide that we will have one candidate in the elections – Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin,” Kadyrov was quoted as saying. “Or temporarily call off the elections, because there’s no one else who could defend our country today.” A United States think tank said rail traffic along the North Korea-Russia border spiked this week to the highest in years, suggesting arms supplies by Pyongyang to Moscow after the leaders of the two countries discussed deeper military cooperation. The Center for Strategic and International Studies said satellite imagery showed an “unprecedented” 73 or so freight cars at Tumangang Rail Station in the North Korean border city of Rason. The traffic was far greater than that observed in the past five years, including pre-pandemic levels, it said. Denmark’s defence ministry said it aims to restart ammunition production after a 55-year gap to ensure its domestic supplies as Russia’s war in Ukraine creates increased demand for military hardware across Europe.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/8/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-592
US ‘disturbed’ by Russia’s plan to reverse nuclear test ban ratification,"Russia says withdrawal from ratification of nuclear weapons test ban treaty places Moscow on ‘equal footing’ with US, which has not ratified the pact.","The United States said it was “disturbed” by a Russian envoy’s announcement that Moscow will reverse its ratification of a 1996 treaty that banned thetesting of nuclear weapons. Russia’s envoy to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), Mikhail Ulyanov, said on Friday that Moscow will revoke its ratification of the pact. The announcement by Ulyanov added new fuel to tensions betweenthe world’s largest nuclear weapons powersamid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and US military support for Kyiv. Ulyanov said on social media that “Russia plans to revoke ratification [which took place in the year 2000] of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty [CTBT]”. “The aim is to be on equal footing with the US who signed the treaty, but didn’t ratify it. Revocation doesn’t mean the intention to resume nuclear tests,” he said. #Russiaplans to revoke ratification (which took place in the year 2000) of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (#CTBT).

Revocation doesn’t mean the intention to resume nuclear tests — Mikhail Ulyanov (@Amb_Ulyanov)October 6, 2023   Though Washington signed but has not ratified the CTBT, it has observeda moratorium on nuclear weapons test explosionssince 1992. Responding to Russia’s announcement, the US State Department said it was “disturbed” by the move. “We are disturbed by the comments of Ambassador Ulyanov in Vienna today,” a US State Department spokesperson said in a statement. “A move like this by any state party needlessly endangers the global norm against nuclear explosive testing,” the State Department said. Russia should not be “wielding arms control and irresponsible nuclear rhetoric in a failing attempt to coerce other states”, the State Department added, appearing to suggest that Moscow’s plan to withdraw from the ratification of the treaty was aimed at pressuring the US and other countries who are supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russian forces.    Ulyanov’s statement followeda day after Russian President Vladimir Putinsaid that Moscow could reassess its ratification of the treaty. Speaking on Thursday at a forum with foreign affairs experts, Putin noted that the US had signed but not ratified the 1996 nuclear test ban treaty, while Russia had signed and also ratified. Russia might adjust its stance to mirror that of the US, Putin said. “Theoretically, we may revoke the ratification,” he said. “It’s up to the state duma members.” Putin also said that while some have discussed the need for Russia to conduct nuclear tests, he had not yet formed an opinion on the subject. “I’m not ready to say yet whether it’s necessary for us to conduct tests or not,” he said.    Asked if Russia’s rescinding of the ban would pave the way for the resumption of nuclear bomb tests, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that “it doesn’t mean a statement about the intention to resume nuclear tests”. Revoking Russia’s ratification of the ban would “bring the situation to a common denominator” with the US, Peskov said. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged “all nuclear weapon states to publicly reaffirm their moratoriums against nuclear testing and their commitment to the CTBT”, UN deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said on Friday. Robert Floyd, the executive director of the CTBTO, which monitors compliance with the pact,said in a statementthat it would “be concerning and deeply unfortunate if any State Signatory were to reconsider its ratification of the CTBT”.

‘They miscalculated’: Ukraine turns the tables on Russia’s Black Sea Fleet,Russia relocates ships from their main base in Sevastopol while the UK lauds Kyiv’s ‘functional defeat of the Black Sea Fleet’.,"Kyiv, Ukraine –“Russian warship, go f*** yourself!” is the phrase dating back to the first days of the Russia-Ukrainian war, that spawned countless memes and bumper stickers. It is what Ukrainian servicemen stationed on the ZmiinyIsland, or Snake Island, in the Black Sea replied to the Russian warship’s urge to surrender. But by early 2022, the Russian Black Sea Fleet based in annexed Crimea, seemed to have gained absolute control over Ukraine’s territorial waters in the Black Sea and its smaller, shallower sibling, the Sea of Azov. Its larger ships shelled Ukraine’s main seaport, Odesa, and other southern cities with missiles and drones, killing civilians and destroying apartment buildings, military installations and port infrastructure. Smaller Russian navy vessels stopped and officiously inspected merchant ships carrying grain and sunflower oil, Ukraine’s key exports. Russian navy felt at ease in all of the Black Sea’s northern part – but after almost 600 days of war, the tables have turned. “They miscalculated,” Lieutenant General Ihor Romanenko, the former deputy chief of Ukraine’s general staff of armed forces, told Al Jazeera. “We won’t let them rest and won’t rest ourselves until we fully de-occupy our lands.” Satellite imagery shows that at least a dozen Russian vessels, including guided missile frigates, landing ships and submarines, have been hastily relocated from their main base in Sevastopol, a subtropical port in annexed Crimea. Most were moved to the Russian port of Novorossiisk more than 300km (186 miles) east of Sevastopol, or on other, smaller bases or bays in eastern Crimea or along Russia’s Black Sea coast. British Defence Minister James Heappey compared the “functional defeat of the Black Sea Fleet” to the liberation of Kharkiv Oblast one year ago. “The fleet has been forced to disperse to ports from which it cannot have an effect on Ukraine,” he said on Tuesday. The relocation follows a series of daring Ukrainian attacks with Western-supplied cruise missiles and domestically assembled aerial and naval drones that destroyed flagships, smaller cutters and even a docked submarine. They also annihilated two advanced S-400 air defence systems creating sizeable “holes” in the sky over Crimea. And, most importantly, they damaged a major shipyard with a dry dock that was essential for repairing decades-old Russian ships. “What was critical for Russia wasn’t damage to vessels, it was damage to the shipyard,” Kyiv-based analyst Ihar Tyshkevich told Al Jazeera. “This is the reason why a large part of the Black Sea fleet vessels were relocated to Novorossiisk.” On September 22, Kyiv barraged and partially destroyed the Fleet’s headquarters in a snow-white Stalinist building in Sevastopol. The attacks dramatically reduced Russia’s capabilities to land troops near Odesa and back occupying forces in the southern region of Kherson, analysts have said. “Ukraine’s actions have wrestled control of Ukraine’s western territorial waters back from Russia and prevented the Black Sea Fleet from threatening Odesa with amphibious assault or providing tactical fires and logistical support to Russian forces in Kherson,” retired US Army Major General Gordon Skip Davis Jr told Al Jazeera. The success seems even more staggering given that Ukraine’s minuscule navy lost most of its ships during Crimea’s 2014 annexation and consists of two dozen obsolete vessels that can all fit into a tiny bay. The possibility of future sea drone attacks deterred Russian ships that inspected vessels with Ukrainian grain. Russian ships “can defend themselves with a relative effect only if there’s a group of vessels”, while inspections make logistical sense only if carried out by individual ships, analyst Tyshkevich said. However, these days, Ukrainian and international shipping companies prefer to use smaller vessels that can move along the Black Sea coast towards Romanian ports on the Danube, a gateway to Eastern and Central Europe. But “the Danube ports are not deep, a Panamax ship [with a tonnage of more than 50,000] won’t enter them, and the cargo needs to be reloaded either at sea or in other ports,” Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kushch told Al Jazeera. Therefore, the overall capacity of the Odesa port fell tenfold, and only about 20 vessels carrying about 100,000 tonnes of wheat leave it every month, he said. The irony is that the entire Black Sea fleet could have been Ukrainian if it was not for the pacifism of its early leaders – and Ukraine’s dire economic situation in the 1990s. Founded in Sevastopol in 1783, the fleet won naval battles with Ottoman Turkey, fought Nazi Germans and often confronted NATO in the Mediterranean. Ukraine proclaimed independence on August 24, 1991, and just days later, Moscow appointed Admiral Igor Kasatonov as head of the gargantuan fleet that employed some 100,000 servicemen and 60,000 auxiliary staffers serving 833 warships and hundreds of aircraft. It had bases in what is now Russia, Moldova and Georgia, and Soviet naval outposts in Syria and Libya reported to it. Kasatonov arrived in Kyiv in early 1992 to meet Ukraine’s first post-Soviet President Leonid Kravchuk and pledge allegiance to Kyiv, a witness said. But the meeting did not go well, and he ran out of it “absolutely crazy”, photographer Efrem Lukatsky told Al Jazeera. “He began to spill his guts to me, and said that [Kravchuk], as it turns out, didn’t need the Fleet,” he said. The decision seemed logical at the time as Ukraine simply could not afford to maintain the fleet, and Kasatonov pledged allegiance to Russia on January 4, 1992. Moscow and Kyiv decided to run the fleet jointly as idle ships rusted away and were often sold for scrap metal. Rumours had it that even Colombian drug cartels could buy a small submarine for smuggling cocaine. Only in 1997, Moscow and Kyiv partitioned the fleet – very unevenly. Kyiv got 30 warships and cutters, one submarine, 34 auxiliary ships and 90 aircraft. Moscow got 338 warships, 106 planes and helicopters and agreed to lease several bases in and around Sevastopol and several other locations in Crimea. The lease cost Russia almost $100m annually, and the fleet remained the largest employer in Sevastopol. Since the 1944 Stalinist deportation of several Crimean communities – Tatars, Greeks, Armenians and Bulgarians – Moscow moved hundreds of thousands of ethnic Russians to the peninsula. They largely remained loyal to Moscow and stubbornly resisted Kyiv’s attempts to promote Ukrainian as the language of administration and education. Politically, they were close to the Russian “red belt” regions that supported Communists. “Ukrainian Crimea mentally was a total part of it,” Sergey Biziykin, a fugitive Russian opposition activist who visited Crimea in the early 2000s, told Al Jazeera. Kremlin-controlled media widely available in Crimea transformed its residents’ pro-Communist sympathies into loyalty to Russia in general as cash-strapped Kyiv did not invest in the peninsula’s decaying infrastructure. “They ignore us, they see us as a place for cheap vacations,” Valentina Minina, a pro-Moscow protester in Sevastopol holding a Russian flag, told this reporter just days before the March 16, 2014 “referendum” that heralded Crimea’s annexation. “We want to be with Russia because it respects us, it will make things right here.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/6/they-miscalculated-ukraine-turns-the-tables-on-russias-black-sea-fleet
‘You can still smell the blood’: Shock turns to grief in Ukraine’s Hroza,Relatives struggling to cope after attack that killed more than 50 people in tiny village in northeastern Ukraine.,"The missile attack was sudden and devastating. In an instant, more than 50 people – or one-sixth of the population of Hroza, a remote village in Ukraine’s northeast – werewiped out. Among those killed on Thursday in one of thedeadliest attackssince Russia invaded Ukraine some 20 months ago was Olya, 36, who is survived by three children. Her husband died, too. “It would have been better if I had died,” Olya’s father, Valeriy Kozyr said at the local cemetery as he prepared to bury her and his son-in-law. “Oh God, you cannot punish me like this. To leave the father and take the children!” he told the Reuters news agency as he wept. Wiping tears from his face, the 61-year-old explained that he must now work out how to care for his three grandchildren aged 10, 15 and 17.    He said he was not in the cafe at the time of the attack because he worked night shifts as a security guard, and so was spared. “Half the village is gone, families are gone,” said Kozyr, standing beside his wife as she wept. “All the time they miss. Well, this time, they hit. Now I’ll have to cross out half my phone book.” Nearby, three brothers were readying a plot in which to bury their parents, both killed in what President Volodymr Zelenskyy has called a “deliberate” Russian assault on civilians.  Ukrainian officials say early findings suggest that Russia used an Iskander missile in the attack on the village of about 330 people. “From every family, from every household, there were people present at this commemoration,” Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko told Ukrainian television. “This is a terrible tragedy.” On Friday, the UN human rights office spokeswoman Elizabeth Throssell also said that “given the location, given the fact that the cafe was struck, the indications are that it was a Russian missile.” But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Friday denied that Russia was responsible for the attack in Hroza and repeated that the Russian military does not target civilian facilities.    Reporting on Friday from the site of the attack, Al Jazeera’s Zein Basravi said Hroza’s tiny community “has been absolutely devastated” by the attack. “You can still smell the blood in the air, the blood that was soaked up by the ground from the bodies that were strewn all over,” he said. “The building that was hit is unrecognisable, completely gone. There is just rubble,” Basravi added, standing next to a massive mound of broken concrete blocks, twisted metal and shattered glass. “There are clothes, children’s toys … patches of blood where bodies were pulled out and were laying here.” Not all of the victims have been identified. Regional police investigator Serhiy Bolvinov told reporters late on Thursday that authorities would have to use DNA to identify some of the victims, because their remains were beyond recognition. “Corpses lay there in that yard, and nobody could identify them,” said Valentyna Kozienko, 73, speaking near her home close to the site. As darkness fell on Thursday, dazed emergency crews carried bodies placed in white bags onto the back of a pick-up truck. A local man knelt dnd wept as he lay his hand on the remains of a loved one before they too, were taken away. Resident Oleksandr Mukhovatyi said he lost his mother, brother and sister-in-law. “Someone betrayed us. The attack was precise, it all landed in the coffee shop.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/6/you-can-still-smell-the-blood-shock-turns-to-grief-in-ukraines-hroza
Putin says Ukraine would last ‘a week’ if Western military support stops,Putin’s prediction comes as concerns mount about future of US funding for Ukraine amid political turmoil in Washington.,"Russian President Vladimir Putin said Ukraine could not survive for more than “a week” without Western military and financial aid, a claim made on the same day as a European Union official warned that the bloc could not replace the funding gap if support for Kyiv from the United States dried up. Putin made hisremarks on Western funding for Ukraineas fears mount that political turmoil in Washington could jeopardise crucial military and humanitarian aid that Kyiv requires to battle Russia’s invasion. US President Joe Biden admitted this week that he “does worry”US support for Ukraine might get derailed. Speaking on Thursday ata meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club, a Moscow-based think tank, in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, Putin said that Ukraine was being propped up “thanks to multi-billion donations that come each month”. “If one just stops, it will all die in a week,” Putin said. “The same applies to the defence system. Just imagine the aid stops tomorrow. It will live for only a week when they run out of ammo,” he said. Putin also claimed that Ukraine had lost more than 90,000 troops since Kyiv’s counteroffensive against Russian forces began in June.    At a meeting of the European Political Community (EPC) in Spain on Thursday, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the EU could not replace the US as Kyiv’s primary donor. “Can Europe fill the gap left by the US? Well, certainly Europe cannot replace the US,” Borrell said. The EU and the US – together comprising most NATO members – are vital in Ukraine’s fight against Russia. The EU and its member states have promised more than $100bn in multi-year support to Ukraine, including financing weapon deliveries. Washington has committed $43bn in military assistance, while Congress has approved $113bn, which includes humanitarian aid. But new US funding for Ukraine has been put on hold as part of a weekend deal struck with opposition Republicans to avert a US government shutdown. The removal by hardline Republicans of their ownHouse of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthythis week has added to the uncertainty around aid for Ukraine. Some of the hardliners want US aid to Ukraine to cease.    Jim Dubik, a senior fellow at the Washington, DC-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) think tank, said that Putin is counting on NATO and the US to wane in their support for Ukraine, and recent events in the US Congress play into Putin’s hands. “By cutting aid to Ukraine, Congress is directly supporting Putin’s desire to divide the alliance … Congress’s recent action does not manifest the strategic leadership the world expects of the United States,” Dubik said in a comment posted on social media. ""#Putinisn’t going to quit unless he’s forced to. Given the poor state of#Russianforces, he’s barely been hanging on and is counting on US and#NATOsupport to wane. By cutting aid to#Ukraine, Congress is directly supporting Putin’s desire to divide the alliance."" 2/4 — ISW (@TheStudyofWar)October 4, 2023  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, speaking to the meeting in Spain of European leaders on Thursday, expressed concern about Washington’s “political storms” but said he was confident he still had US bipartisan backing. Leaders at the EPC summit said Putin’s calculation was that the West would become fatigued at long-term support of Ukraine, handing him a path to victory. “I think Russia wants us to be tired,” Estonia’s Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said, adding: “We should show them that we are not. We have to help Ukraine as long as it takes.”. French President Emmanuel Macron reinforced that message in a meeting with Zelenskyy, pledging “tireless” support for Ukraine. But within the EU there are fissures. Slovakia announced it has frozen decisions on military aid to neighbouring Ukraine following parliamentary elections on Sunday which were won by former Prime Minister Robert Fico’s SMER-SSD party, which campaigned on a promise to end military support for Ukraine and sanctions on Russia.

Putin suggests Wagner boss Prigozhin’s plane brought down by grenade blast,Russian leader says grenade fragments were found in the bodies of those killed in the jet crash in which Wagner’s Yevgeny Prigozhin died.,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has suggested that the plane crash whichkilled the head of the Wagner mercenary force, Yevgeny Prigozhin, was caused by the detonation of hand grenades inside the aircraft. Putin suggested on Thursday thatPrigozhin’s plane was blown upfrom the inside, not hit by a missile as rumoured, saying that the head of Russia’s investigative committee had reported that traces of explosives were discovered in the bodies of those who died in the crash in August. “Fragments of hand grenades were found in the bodies of those killed in the crash,” Putin told a meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club in the Black Sea resort of Sochi. “There was no external impact on the plane – this is already an established fact,” Putin said, appearing to rubbish claims by United States officials who believed the plane was shot down. The private Embraer jet on whichPrigozhin was travelling to Saint Petersburgcrashed north of Moscow killing all 10 people on board on August 23. Two other top Wagner figures, Prigozhin’s four bodyguards and a crew of three were also killed. Putin did not give any more details about how a grenade or grenades could have been detonated on board the executive jet, but said he thought investigators were wrong not to have carried out alcohol and drug tests on the bodies of those who died in the crash. “In my opinion, such an examination should have been carried out, but it was not,” Putin said.    Putin also claimed that searches of Wagner’s offices in St Petersburg after the crash turned up 10 billion roubles ($100m) in cash and 5kg (11 pounds) of cocaine. The investigators of the crash have yet to report publicly on their findings. Moscow rejected an offer from Brazil, where the Embraer business jet was built, to join the crash inquiry. The Washington, DC-basedInstitute for the Study of War (ISW), a think tank monitoring the conflict in Ukraine, described Putin’s explanation for the crash as “bizarre” and intended to “deflect blame from the Kremlin”. The ISW said that Putin appeared to be sketching a scenario involving alcohol, drugs and the mishandling of explosives by people on board the plane in an attempt to blame the victims for their own deaths. The Russian president “implied that the plane crash victims may have been using alcohol or drugs onboard that could have led to the negligent handling of grenades (that were presumably on board for some unexplained reason)”, the think tank said. “Putin’s bizarre explanation of the plane crash is likely an attempt to blame Prigozhin for his own and his comrades’ deaths and further disgrace him among his remaining supporters,” the ISW added. #Putinoffered a bizarre explanation for#WagnerGroup financier Yevgeny#Prigozhin’s death during a press conference at the Valdai Discussion Club on October 5 to deflect blame from the#Kremlin.https://t.co/go1WolGnbGhttps://t.co/aIKTcDWBTvpic.twitter.com/P43L2G1QI6 — ISW (@TheStudyofWar)October 6, 2023  Prigozhin died in the crashexactly two months to the day after leading a short-lived mutinyagainst Russia’s defence establishment and presented the biggest challenge to Putin’s rule since he came to power in 1999. A preliminary US intelligence assessment concluded that an intentional explosion caused the crash, and Western officials have pointed to a long list of Putin foes who have been assassinated. The Kremlin has rejected as an “absolute lie” the suggestion that Putin had Prigozhin killed in revenge for the rebellion by the Wagner private army. The fate of Wagner has been unclear since Prigozhin’s death.    Putin has ordered Wagner fighters to sign contracts with Russia’s defence ministry, a move which Prigozhin and many of his men had opposed. When asked about the future of so-called private military companies in Russia, Putin said on Thursday that as there had been no law on such groups, the experience of them in Russia had been “clumsy”. “We do not yet have a consensus in Russia about whether we need such formations or not, but today I can say for sure that several thousand fighters of this company have already signed contracts with the armed forces,” Putin said. Before his death,Prigozhin had accused Russia’s military leaders,  particularly Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov, of incompetence and warned that Russia could lose the war in Ukraine unless it raised its game. After his death, Putin described the Wagner chief as a man who had made “serious mistakes in his life but he achieved the right results”. The Wagner Group mercenary force that Prigozhin created was active in Ukraine, Syria, Libya and several African countries and counted tens of thousands of fighters at its peak.    Sanctioned by the European Union and the US for gross human rights abuses in the countries where Wagner deployed, the force played a key role in the fighting in Ukraine, where it spearheaded the capture of the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut in May after months of bloody combat.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/6/putin-suggests-wagner-mercenary-chiefs-plane-brought-down-by-grenade-blast
Putin hints Russia could return to nuclear testing,The Russian leader said that his country could ‘theoretically’ withdraw from landmark nuclear test ban treaty.,"Russian PresidentVladimir Putinhas suggested that Russia could return to nuclear weapons testing and might withdraw its ratification of a landmark nuclear test ban treaty. In an address on Thursday that touched on topics such as nuclear weapons, energy, and the war in Ukraine, Putin also said that Russia had tested a new nuclear-powered missile delivery system but had not decided whether to resume thetesting of explosives. “I think no person of sound mind and clear memory would think of using nuclear weapons against Russia,” Putin said in the speech at a forum of foreign policy experts in Sochi. “I hear calls to start testing nuclear weapons, to return to testing,” he added. “I am not ready to say whether we really need to conduct tests or not.” He announced that Russia has effectively completed the development of the Burevestnik cruise missile and the Sarmat heavy intercontinental ballistic missile and will work on putting them into production. “We conducted the last successful test of the Burevestnik nuclear-powered global-range cruise missile,” he said. His statement was the first announcement of a successful test of the Burevestnik, which translates as “Storm Petrel.” It was first mentioned by Putin in 2018. Little is known about the Burevestnik, which was code-named Skyfall by NATO, and many Western experts have been sceptical about it, noting that a nuclear engine could be highly unreliable. It is believed to be able to carry a nuclear warhead or a conventional one, and potentially could stay aloft for a much longer time than other missiles and cover much more distance, due to nuclear propulsion.    Putin’s speech is the latest in which the Russian leader underscored the country’snuclear capabilities, as relations between Russia and Western powers remain tense over Russia’s war in Ukraine. Putin said that it was “theoretically” possible for Russia to withdraw from the nuclear test ban treaty, which generally prohibits the testing ofnuclear weapons, but that no decision has been made. He also noted that the United States has not signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, stating that Russia, which ratified the agreement in 2000, may follow in its steps. In the wide-ranging speech, the Russian president said that the West was trying to create “a new Iron Curtain” and laid responsibility for the Russian invasion of Ukraine at the feet of Western powers. “The war, which was started by the Kyiv regime with active support from the West, has been going on already for 10 years,” he said. “The special military operation was launched to stop it.” Russia launched its full-scale invasion ofUkrainein February 2022. Since then,thousands of civilianshave been killed and millions of others have fled the country, according to the United Nations. Tens of thousands of soldiers have been killed or wounded on each side and large swathes of eastern and southern Ukraine have been devastated in the fighting. Earlier on Thursday, Ukrainian officials reported that a Russianmissile strikehad slammed into a grocery store and cafe near the city of Kharkiv, killing at least 51 people. In his speech, Putin also said that Russia was attempting to create a “new world” in defiance of Western “hegemony”, praising the rising influence of Eastern countries such as India and China. He also reiterated Russia’s opposition to Ukraine’s accession to NATO, which he deemed a tool of US foreign policy, but said that he has no objections to Ukraine joining the European Union.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/5/putin-hints-russia-could-return-to-nuclear-testing
Ukraine says 51 people killed in Russian attack on Kharkiv village,"Ukrainian officials say a six-year-old boy among those killed in attack on Hroza village, where residents were attending a wake.","At least 51 people have been killed and six wounded in a Russian missile attack on a northeastern village, Ukrainian officials say. Oleh Syniehubov, governor of the Kharkiv region, said the afternoon strike on Thursday hit a cafe and a store in the village of Hroza, about 30km (20 miles) west of the front-line town of Kupiansk, with many civilians present at the time of the attack. He added that a six-year-old child was among the dead. Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said residents of the village of about 330 people had been holding a memorial service in the cafe that was struck. “From every family, from every household, there were people present at this commemoration. This is a terrible tragedy,” Klymenko told Ukrainian television. There was no immediate comment by Russia, which in the past has denied hitting civilian targets. The attack was the deadliest in the Kharkiv region since Russia’s invasion began more than 19 months ago, a regional official told public broadcaster Suspilne. It appeared to be one of the biggest civilian death tolls in any single Russian strike. Footage released by Ukrainian authorities showed rescue workers sifting through piles of rubble and bodies coated in dust laid out next to the site of the attack. Klymenko cited preliminary information that he said showed the attack was carried out with an Iskander ballistic missile. “The terrorists deliberately carried out the attack during lunchtime to ensure a maximum number of casualties,” Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said. “There were no military targets there. This is a heinous crime intended to scare Ukrainians.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who was attending asummitwith European leaders in Spain, said: “Russian terror should be stopped.” I’ve just visited Kharkiv, the city of 1.2 million people. Border with Russia is less than 40 km away. Less than 3 minutes for a S-300 missile. Russia terrorizes the city with them and has already destroyed thousands of houses, schools, universities, power plants, and transport. — Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa)October 5, 2023  Zelenskyy called on Western countries to redouble their support for Ukraine’s war effort and air defence systems. A spokesman for the head of the United Nations said he “strongly condemns” the attack. “Attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure are prohibited under international humanitarian law, and they must stop immediately,” Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said in a statement. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said in a message posted by his office on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter, that he was “shocked and saddened” by the attack. “Our human rights monitors will visit the site to gather information. Accountability is key,” he said. Maria Adeeva, the research director at the European Expert Association in Ukraine, said the Hroza attack was “clearly deliberate”. “Russians knew that all those people were there, and they precisely attacked this building,” Adeeva told Al Jazeera. “This strike was so huge that from what we know now, only 30 bodies are being able to be identified from 51 people killed so that means that 20 bodies still aren’t identified,” she said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/5/dozens-killed-attack-on-kharkiv-village
UK warns of Russia laying ‘sea mines’ to deter Black Sea cargo ships,Russian sea mines warning comes as Ukrainian navy says 12 cargo vessels preparing to travel to Ukraine Black Sea ports.,"Russia may use sea mines against civilian shipping in the Black Sea, including by laying them on the approach to Ukrainian ports, the United Kingdom has said citing intelligence sources. The warning comes as Ukraine’s navy said that 12 cargo vessels were ready to enter a fledgling Black Sea shipping corridor on their way to Ukrainian ports, a significant increase in maritime traffic to Ukraine in defiance of a de facto Russian blockade of the country’s sea ports. The UK’s foreign office said in a statement on Wednesday that intelligence assessments indicated that Russia was considering the use of sea mines to deter civilian ships travelling through a“humanitarian corridor” established by Ukraineto facilitate grain exports from the Black Sea ports. “Russia almost certainly wants to avoid openly sinking civilian ships, instead falsely laying blame on Ukraine for any attacks against civilian vessels in the Black Sea,” the Foreign Office said in a statement. “By releasing our assessment of this intelligence, the UK seeks to expose Russia’s tactics to deter any such incident from occurring,” it added.    The UK’s Foreign Secretary James Cleverly was quoted as saying that “the world is watching” what unfolds in the Black Sea and “Russia’s cynical attempts to lay blame on Ukraine for their attacks”. Russia pulled out of a deal in Julythat had allowed Ukraine to safely ship food products out through the Black Sea, which is traditionally its main export corridor. Moscow shortly after announced that ships in the vicinity of Ukraine’s Black Sea ports would be considered potentialsupporters of Kyiv’s war efforts and “parties to the Ukrainian conflict”. Russia has alsostepped up aerial attacks on Ukraine’s portswith drones and missile raids that have so far damaged 130 infrastructure facilities and destroyed nearly 300,000 tonnes of grain –enough to feed more than one million people for a year, the UK said.    Ukraine responded by setting up a temporary “humanitarian corridor” on the Black Sea for cargo vessels willing to risk travelling to its ports, and several ships have since used the route. On Wednesday, Ukrainian Navy spokesperson Dmytro Pletenchuk said that more than 20 ships were preparing to exit and enter Ukraine’s sea ports. “In total to enter the new corridor we have 12, and 10 to leave. That is as of now,” Pletenchuk said, though he did not say when the vessels were expected to sail. Ukrainian defence forces are doing everything to ensure the safety of civilian ships in Ukraine’s territorial waters, he said, and the vessels were also proceeding into the waters of Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey, all of which are NATO member countries. At least seven new ships have entered Ukrainian waters in the past several days, and they are due to ship abroad at least 127,000 tonnes of Ukrainian-origin grain, local Ukrainian officials and lawmakers said. Kyiv has also increased exports from its ports on the Danube river to Romania and then onwards by road to international markets. Since the end of the grain deal, Ukraine’s attacks on Russia’s Black Sea fleet in the Moscow-annexed Crimean peninsula and the port city of Sevastopol have increased.    Attacks by Kyiv on Sevastopolwere likely responsible for Moscow recently transferring the Black Sea fleet vessel from Crimea to the Russian port of Novorossiysk in the Krasnodar Krai region of Russia, Washington, DC-based think tank, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), said in its latest Ukraine war monitoring report. Satellite imagery between October 1 and 3 showed that Russia had transferred 10 vessels to Novorossiysk from Sevastopol, the ISW said.

"Ukraine holds the line against Russian attacks, makes small gains",What happened in the 84th week of Russia’s war in Ukraine?,"Russian and Ukrainian forces remained largely static on the battlefield in the 84th week of the war after a month of vigorous Ukrainian advances that saw Kyiv break through the first of three Russian lines of defence on the southern front. Still, Ukraine proved it could hold onto its gains against Russian counterattacks and even made a few advances. Russian forces appeared to have lost a kilometre-long (0.6-mile-long) trench west of Verbove, a village on the front line of the main Ukrainian thrust through Russian defences in the Zaporizhia region in southeastern Ukraine. Vladimir Rogov, an occupation official, said at least four companies of Ukrainian troops had launched an attack on the trench on September 26 supported by armoured fighting vehicles. Geolocated footage that Russian sources released the following day confirmed that Ukraine held the position it had stormed. Verbove sits on the eastern side of a U-shaped salient into Russian-occupied territory in western Zaporizhia. Ukrainian forces also mounted an attack on Russian positions north of Robotyne, a town on the eastern side of that salient, on Thursday. Russian units posted that the assault was insufficiently supported by armour and was repulsed. Ukraine also appears to have fought for – and held – a trench system south of Robotyne against a Russian attempt to recapture it on Sunday. A Ukrainian soldier analysing the footage described the system as “a strongpoint in an interconnected system of trenches, firing systems and dugouts that lie between Robotyne and Novoprokopivka”, Ukraine’s next target on the eastern side of its salient. The system was interconnected by tunnels and Russia was prioritising its defence, the soldier told the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington, DC-based think tank. Although Ukrainian assault forces have taken over Russian trenches and are using them to their own advantage, their slow assault tactics of using platoon-sized units to take Russian positions one at a time has deprived them of the ability to achieve a breakthrough, according to an assessment by the independent Russian newspaper Meduza. Those tactics have allowed the retreating Russians to keep rebuilding defences and forcing the Ukrainians to continue to move slowly. This reality, Meduza said, has kept Ukrainian troops stuck in a triangle between Robotyne, Novoprokopivka and Verbove, and it forecast rains could slow them further. The head of Britain’s armed forces, Admiral Tony Radakin, told War on the Rocks, an American podcast, of his belief that Russian defences had turned out stronger than the West had anticipated and predicted a long war lay ahead after Ukraine failed to achieve a breakthrough in its summer counteroffensive. He also said Russian President Vladimir Putin has lost control of the war he started and Ukraine would ultimately win. Radakin has previously said he believed Russia has lost half its combat capability in Ukraine. Ukraine said it successfully continued its long-distance attacks on Russian soil. AUkrainian dronedropped two bombs on an electricity substation in the Russian village of Belaya near the Ukrainian border, setting the substation alight on Friday. Kursk Governor Roman Starovoyt reported the attack on Telegram. “One of the transformers caught fire. Five settlements and a hospital were cut off from power supply. Fire crews rushed to the scene,” he said. Ukraine’s military intelligence said on Sunday that it had disrupted the production of Russian Kh-59 missiles, which have a range of 280km (175 miles), when its drones struck the Smolensk plant where they are made. “Three out of four drones hit the target, causing significant damage to the production facilities,” its military intelligence said. Russia has consistently used Kh-59 cruise missiles to hit infrastructure and civilian targets in Ukraine. “When we work out certain actions on the objects of the defence industrial complex, we have only one goal: to slow down the production of Russian weapons,” military intelligence chiefKiril Budanovtold NV television. He said attacks on the Russianborderby anti-Putin Russian militias were ongoing and had recently claimed the lives of border guards and Federal Security Service (FSB) personnel. Ukraine also has focused on building up its defence industry, which has produced the missiles, aerial drones and surface naval drones that have enabled long-distance attacks on Russian targets. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced the start of a new defence industrial programme on Saturday that would be funded partly by confiscated Russian assets. Representatives from several countries attended the first meeting of what he called a Defence Industries Forum, through which Ukraine plans to draw on international expertise, funding and technology. “Manufacturers of weapons and military equipment from all over the world can join its basic declaration and demonstrate that they are ready to build the arsenal of the free world together with Ukraine,” Zelenskyy said. “The fund will be replenished from dividends from state defence assets and from profits from sale of confiscated Russian assets.” The chairwoman of the German Bundestag Defence Committee, Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmerman, called for the immediate delivery of Taurus missiles to Ukraine in the wake of the US decision to supply 300km-range (186-mile-range) Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, in late September. The German-made Taurus is a stealth cruise missile with a range of 500km (310 miles). Germany has consistently followed the US is the supply of new military technologies to Ukraine. Strack-Zimmerman said strikes against Crimea using Taurus missiles would be legitimate because the Russian army was supplied through that territory. “International law allows Ukraine to attack military targets and on the territory [of Russia] completely regardless of where the gun is made and who supplies it,” she was reported as saying. There was alsopossible bad newson the rearmament front. Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said there “could be impacts to training” of Ukrainian pilots on F-16 fighter jets due to a looming US government shutdown. While military personnel would continue to implement the programme, government-contracted civilian interpreters might not, she said. Far-right Republicans in the US Congress have refused to fund the US government if spending bills also include aid to Ukraine. Congress has funded the government until the middle of November through a stopgap measure that cost Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy his job. The European Union, which has provided Ukraine with 77 billion euros ($81bn) in financial and military aid during the war, may also be witnessing fatigue. Robert Fico, a former Slovak prime minister, won parliamentary elections in the Central European country on Saturday on a pro-Russia platform.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/4/ukraine-holds-the-line-against-russian-attacks-makes-small-gains
"In a ghost town, Ukraine’s aid workers toil as Russian shells whizz above","Alex Gatopoulos, Al Jazeera’s defence editor, films in Zaporizhzhia on patrol with a front-line team delivering the bare basics.","Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine –We meet Yulia in the early morning. The autumn weather, still sunny, has turned sharp, and we all wish we’d brought warmer jackets. She is the coordinator for Ukraine’s emergency and rescue services, in charge of distributing aid to villages just behind the frontlines, where normal life has long since vanished. Organised yet sanguine, we are clearly not the first media team she has shepherded. The drive towards the front takes a good hour, the signs of war more evident by the kilometre. Civilian and military vehicles speed up the closer we get. No one wants to become a target. We arrive at an aid distribution centre, a fire station with a tarp roof, an old fire engine and a newer ambulance as its centre pieces. A small crowd of expectant villagers has gathered. Before the war, Orikhiv was a town of 14,000 people. Now, just hundreds live here. Old men and women gather in a small chatty knot. I briefly blush with shame as I stand next to them in full body armour while they natter in old clothes and slippers. One woman gives us a glance with a gentle smile on her face, feet encased in floral crocs; her only protection is a pair of earbuds she has in the whole time. I wonder why, and as if on cue, the sharp bang from a nearby artillery battery reminds me. The barrage isn’t intense but a regular reminder of the proximity of the conflict, the whizz of an occasional Russian shell in reply. No one bats an eyelid. Receiving bread and bottles of water, the small crowd disperses, leaving as good-natured as they came but with armfuls of loaves, most on slow bikes back home. There isn’t an intact house in the entire town. Street after street, building after building lie shattered, roofs smashed in, doors and windows boarded up or left open to the coming cold. In the distance, the singular sound of a hammer on wood as the residents, old yet resilient, repair what they can, putting up with what they can’t. We follow a fire tender on its way to deliver water to a home nearby. Empty barrels wait to be filled by the open door. An angry woman storms out and shouts at both us and the firemen, complaining that she is fed up with the food they bring, that it’s never enough, and that the presence of journalists will bring attacks upon her family. The firemen start filling the barrels, doing their best to ignore her, but these are local volunteers caring for local people, and the discomfort is evident. Her fury doesn’t mask the despair in her voice as she tells us her house was destroyed at the beginning of the war, and she, her disabled husband, and several others, have lived in the basement ever since. We pause for a bit before the next location. Yulia quickly munches on an apple, her helmet off for once, then we head across the road from the aid centre. An old man  – all the young people have left – is up a ladder banging at an exposed roofing joist, working methodically as the weather is due to turn bad soon. Unsweetened grapes hang unpicked from his trellis vine as he takes us into his back garden where a crater, nine metres wide and three deep, occupies the centre. He is interviewed by the crater’s lip, telling us it was caused by a KAB 500, a precision-guided munition with a 500kg (1100-pound) warhead. Living in his smashed home has taken its toll. “You are living, but it’s hard on the soul … we had a life here,” he says. Next to the house, white-marked trails from the tracks of tanks run along the tarmacked road. An APC loudly rumbles towards the front. A military pickup truck with a flat tire slowly trundles squeakily past in the opposite direction; exhausted soldiers in the back, matted with dust, stare at us blankly. Walking through the deserted streets looking for a good spot to shoot our “piece to camera”, we come across an intersection, an abandoned church with a smashed spire on the corner. Police immediately pull up in a van, ask us who we are, impressing on us that a crossroads isn’t perhaps the safest place to film. They tell us to listen out for Russian spotter drones. A Ukrainian colleague jokes, “Better be quick”. The whoosh of Grad rockets being launched from a battery close by makes us wary of incoming return fire, and we decide to pack up. On a gate on the other side of the road, a gang of sparrows, oblivious to the destruction, tweet and jostle each other for position. We head off in the van, past the skeleton of a town, burned fields on either side of us. A quiet day.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/4/on-patrol-with-ukraines-frontline-aid-workers
"As Russia’s war grinds on, is global support for Ukraine waning?","As Slovakia votes for a pro-Russia politician, Poland drops military aid, and the US wavers; Ukraine is likely worried but not yet panicking, analysts say.","On Sunday, Slovakia’s former Prime Minister Robert Fico, a left-wing populist, wonparliamentary electionswith his SMER-SSD party, having campaigned on a promise to withdraw military support for Ukraine and stop sanctioning Russia. It sent a worrying signal to Kyiv, which in recent weeks has been rowing with one of its staunchest allies,Poland, over the issue of Ukrainian grain imports, while watching on as US Republican lawmakers threaten to scupper a new aid deal. These developments have stirred talk of a global shift in sentiment towards supporting Ukraine as the war grinds on, more than a year and a half after it began. According to Teona Lavrelashvili, an analyst at the European Politics Centre, they could signal that several allies are ready for a “pragmatic solution” to the end of the war,. But Kyiv will be “worried but not panicking” by the growing sense that some traditional allies have “fallen out of step”, said Sean Hanley, an associate professor in Comparative Central and East European Politics at University College London. Fico still needs to form a coalition, but the pro-Kremlin, anti-Kyiv rhetoric that saw his party win marked a significant departure from Slovakia’s position since the start of the war. As recently as April, Slovak President Zuzana Caputova travelled to Kyiv in what had been a then-routine show of support. Hanley told Al Jazeera that Kyiv will likely be concerned about the Slovak pivot towards Russia because it signals that “Ukraine fatigue” is setting in among allies, while fears of Slovakia’s military aid potentially being cut are less worrying. Even so, pro-Kremlin sentiment in Slovakian politics, Hanley said, is not as widespread as in countries such as Serbia or Bulgaria. Instead, you see more “Ukraine-sceptic” views that prioritise national interests over international causes, as populist illiberal trends challenge “the idea that you’ve got to emulate the West”. Kyiv will also be concerned by Slovakia potentially joining Hungary in carving out a Ukraine-sceptic alliance within the European Union bloc. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has maintained close relations with Moscow during the war and argued against supplying arms to Ukraine or providing economic aid. On Sunday, Orban congratulated Fico with a post on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, saying: “Guess who’s back! … Always good to work together with a patriot.” This budding friendship represents a shift. Previously, relations were strained between Slovak and Hungarian nationalists, according to Hanley. Now, he said, there is a departure from “traditional kind of nationalist enmities whereby you pick a fight with the guy next door” to “culture wars” with the focus on scepticism of the rest of the EU, of LGBTQ rights, feminism and potential immigration from non-European countries.    Lavrelashvili said although Slovakia will now likely “be a troublemaker” regarding the EU’s support of Ukraine, bombastic rhetoric often gives way to a more pragmatic approach to diplomacy. It is a trait that Fico has often displayed, according to Hanley, who said for him to become leader, he must compromise with another party to form a coalition. Observers also say Slovakia, with the eurozone’s biggest budget deficit of nearly 7 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) this year, needs EU modernisation and recovery funds, meaning Fico may think twice before aggravating Brussels. Since the outbreak of the war in February 2022,Polandhas been one of Kyiv’s most committed allies. The country, which shares a border with the war-torn nation, hosts millions of Ukrainian refugees, has transferred an array of weapons to Kyiv’s army in its fight against Russia, and acted as a transit hub for arms shipments from other nations.  But in recent weeks, a seemingly unbreakable bond began to crack as the neighbours rowed over Ukrainian grain imports, leading Poland to announce that it would no longer send arms to Ukraine and may cut aid to refugees. Mateusz Morawiecki, Poland’s prime minister, warned Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy tonever “insult” Poles againafter theUkrainian leader toldthe United Nations that “political theatre” around grain imports was helping Moscow’s cause. The dispute began in September when Poland imposed restrictions on Ukrainian grain imports in a bid to protect local farmers. Ukraine was enraged and the two nations traded warnings repeatedly, setting the stage for a row that played out in the international arena. Robert Pszczel, a senior fellow at the Casimir Pulaski Foundation in Poland, told Al Jazeera that despite the “unpleasant rhetoric” between the two nations, key strategic support for Ukraine will not change. He said the recent spat is a culmination of various ongoing rifts, including anincidentin November, during which an air defence missile killed two people in southern Poland. At the time, Poland and NATO said a Ukrainian missile likely caused the deaths but that Russia bore ultimate responsibility, having instigated the war. Kyiv denied any responsibility. But Lavrelashvili said Poland and Slovakia cannot be compared. In Slovakia, pro-Kremlin narratives have been more successful in influencing society, creating an East-West divide among those who now view the United States as a “security threat”, she said. Poland, however, has not changed its view of Russia as a dangerous force. Instead, the discussions around Ukraine have revolved around balancing national interests while continuing some form of support. When asked whether a close relationship with the U.S. or Russia is more important for their country, 76% of Poles say it is more important to have a close relationship with the U.S. Just 17% of Hungarians say the same of their relationship with the U.S.https://t.co/ig4Lh40YBPpic.twitter.com/ufRmTVtOci — Pew Research Global (@pewglobal)October 2, 2023  Meanwhile,recent developments in the UScould be causing Ukraine further alarm. At a NATO summit in July, US President Joe Biden reassured G7 leaders and President Zelenskyy, “Our commitment to Ukraine will not weaken.” But late on Sunday, a compromise reached in US Congress to prevent a government shutdown saw a new funding deal for Ukraine abandoned, largely because of resistance from hardline Republicans. The subsequentremoval of Kevin McCarthyas speaker of the House of Representatives has added to the uncertainty around aid for Ukraine. Joshua Tucker, head of the Jordan Center for the Advanced Study of Russia and professor of politics at New York University, told Al Jazeera the stopgap bill should be viewed “in the context of the very peculiar situation of US domestic politics at this point in time”. He said the bill was forced by a small section of the Republican Party and does not reflect an overarching shift in US politics. Instead, support for Ukraine will depend more on the direction former President Donald Trump, the frontrunner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, chooses to take. Tucker explained that in the US, the political narrative around Ukraine is focused on whether the government is spending too much money on the war, unlike in Europe, where there is more of a desire for the “conflict to be over” because of its direct effect on energy prices and quality of life. Perhaps sensing this shift, most EU foreign ministers convened outside the bloc for the first time this week, visiting Kyiv on Monday in a public display of unwavering solidarity, while Poland and Hungary sent representatives. “I don’t see any member state faltering,” Josep Borrell, the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs, said after promising Ukraine billions of euros in military aid and training for fighter pilots.

What does this mean for Ukraine?,"As campaigning for next year’s United States presidential election heats up, Ukraine has emerged as a central theme. President Joe Biden is currently scrambling to muster support for anew aid packagefor the war-torn country, facing hardening scepticism from Republicans in a deeply divided Congress. His challenge just got harder, with hardline Republicans pushing through a vote that on Tuesday led to the ouster of the party’s own House of Representatives speaker, Joe McCarthy. So what does this presage for Ukraine? Is the US, the country’s staunchest ally to date, about to scale down its generous aid packages? And, given its role in rallying support across the West, will others waver? Recent developments, which saw Congress ditch provisions for further funding to avert agovernment shutdown, sent shock waves across the Atlantic. Biden is now pressing members of Congress to back a separate deal for Ukraine funding. He was relying on support from McCarthy, who was howeverremoved from officeon Tuesday. Prior to his dramatic departure, McCarthy had already raised members’ concerns about accountability regarding funds sent to Kyiv. With some of his potential successors strongly in favour of continuing funding and others strongly opposed, who succeeds him could influence the flow of US aid to Ukraine – and potentially the direction of the war that started with Russia’s full-fledged invasion of its eastern neighbour in February 2022. In the midst of the head-spinning drama, Biden had told Congress on October 1 that the “vast majority” of both parties in the Senate and Congress backed Ukraine in their fight against Russia’s “brutal aggression”. However, while senators from both parties have shown unity on the subject, with dozens attending a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during hisvisit to Washingtonin September, the House is more polarised. Republicans control the chamber by a narrow 221-212 majority. The battle was thrown into sharp focus on Monday, October 2, when billionaire Elon Musk lashed out at Kyiv on his X social media platform (formerly Twitter), posting a meme featuring Zelenskyy with the caption: “When it’s been 5 minutes and you haven’t asked for a billion dollars in aid”. pic.twitter.com/W9i9YEM8uA — Elon Musk (@elonmusk)October 1, 2023 Ukraine’s parliament hit back on its official X account, posting a meme of Musk with the words: “When it’s been 5 minutes and you haven’t spread Russian propaganda”. Last month, Russian president Vladimir Putin hailed Musk as an “outstanding person” afterrevelationsthat the entrepreneur had stymied a Ukrainian attack on Russian-occupied Crimea last year, issuing orders that his Starlink satellite communications be turned off. Musk had allegedly feared Moscow would retaliate with nuclear weapons. The US has thus far been a major backer of Kyiv, providing over $113bn in military, humanitarian and economic aid. Military spending, which accounts for more than half of US aid, pays for the drones, tanks and missiles crucial to the ongoing Ukrainian counteroffensive. Humanitarian assistance provides for medical supplies and essentials like food and safe drinking water for the displaced population. Republican opponents of aid argue that the money should be spent on domestic concerns, such as border security, law and order, and relief for climate-related natural disasters hitting the country with increasing frequency. Aid to Ukraine is a considerable fraction of the $773bn defence budget request for 2023. It is far more than the $25bn slated for border security this year — a key bugbear for conservatives. Department of Defense (DoD) Comptroller Michael McCord last month attempted to bring McCarthy onside, explaining that the Pentagon had already scaled down support. In a letter to the speaker, dated September 29, he highlighted the impact of foreign security assistance on jobs and production in congressional districts, mentioning facilities in Tuscon, Arizona and Camden, Arkansas. Money is running low. As McCord pointed out, the DoD has only $1.6bn left to replenish military stocks flowing to Ukraine and a mere $5.4bn worth of Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA). The Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) has now been exhausted. But, as the presidential campaign intensifies, such pleas are likely to go unheard. Military aid is simply not regarded as a winning campaign strategy. Hardline Republicans like Gaetz, a supporter of Donald Trump, the latter seeking re-election to the White House next year, look set to continue their drumbeat against aid in the coming months. On October 3, the White House announced thatBidenhad spoken to the leaders of allied countries about continuing coordinated support. In his annual address to the UN General Assembly last month, Biden attempted to counter war fatigue, which has become apparent in Europe, most notably in Poland and Slovakia. “Russia believes that the world will grow weary and allow it to brutalise Ukraine without consequence,” he said. “But I ask you this: If we abandon the core principles of the United States to appease an aggressor, can any member state in this body feel confident that they’re protected?” Beyond multilateralism, it’s also clear the US’s reputation as a global leader, shaken by its chaotic exit from Afghanistan in 2021, would suffer drastically if it walked away from Ukraine. Can Washington afford this at a time of rising tensions with Beijing? None of this would have come as a surprise to Zelenskyy, struggling to beat back Russian forces before another harsh winter sets in. On hisvisit to Washingtonlast month, dressed in military green, he reportedly described the situation to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in the baldest of terms. “If we don’t get the aid, we will lose the war,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/4/is-us-funding-for-ukraine-under-threat

Who is the Wagner Group officer Putin asked to form ‘volunteer battalions’?,"And what could be next for the Russian mercenary group in Ukraine, after Yevgeny Prigozhin’s death?","Kyiv, Ukraine –The lean, grey-haired man lying on the asphalt was so drunk he couldn’t utter his own name. Ambulance workers found Andrei Troshev near a nine-storey apartment building in uptown St Petersburg, Russia’s second-largest city, on June 5, 2017, according to the independent Fontanka.ru news portal. The inebriated Troshev had about $25,000 in cash, maps of Syria and purchase documents for tents intended for Russian forces fighting for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime, Fontanka.ru reported, citing hospital records. The 61-year-old, whose nom de guerre is “Sedoy” (“Grey-haired”), turned out to be one of the top officers of the Wagner mercenary group, which had formed a couple of years earlier. “He is a typical character for Wagner,” Nikolay Mitrokhin of Germany’s Bremen University told Al Jazeera. Just like many other staffers of the security wing of Concorde, Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin’s multifaceted company, Troshev fought in the Soviet-Afghan war and later joined the police force in St Petersburg, Mitrokhin said. On June 23, Troshev made a fateful decision – he refused to take part in Wagner’s abortedmutinyin Russia and was not in the private jet withPrigozhinand his top officers that crashed in western Russia on August 23. Since the mutiny, Wagner hasleftUkraine and fractured, no longer playing a part in Moscow’s faltering war effort. Some of its veterans have been lured to smaller private armies put together by state-run corporations or Kremlin-friendly oligarchs. Some found a haven in Belarus, whose hardline president, Alexander Lukashenko,strengthenedhis law enforcement agencies in his power play with Russia. And some are garrisoned in severalAfrican nations, whose leaders gave Wagner access to mineral riches and raw materials in exchange for security services. The Kremlin did not want entire Wagner units back on the Ukrainian battlefields because they proved too unruly as Prigozhin engaged in widely publicised conflicts with Russia’s top brass, military analysts said. “Whole Wagner Group units could lead to problems of Russian Ministry of Defence’s control as experienced under Prigozhin,” retired US army Major General Gordon Skip Davis Jr told Al Jazeera. “Former Wagner veterans, however, could provide needed tactical expertise and small unit leadership to Russian formations,” he said. These new formations will be helmed by Troshev even though he played a nefarious role in one of the bloodiest defeats Wagner has ever faced. In February 2018, he and Prigozhin reportedly ordered an attack on an oil- and gasfield near the eastern Syrian town of Khasham without knowing that the area was controlled by US forces and the Syrian opposition. Wagner suffered a humiliating defeat and heavy losses in what became the first post-Cold War armed clash of Russian and US nationals. However, Troshev was awarded the Hero of Russia medal for his service in Syria. Prigozhin’s mutiny began after the Defence Ministry said each Wagner fighter had tosign contractsto become part of the military machine known for corruption, ineffectiveness and miscalculations that proved lethal to thousands of Russian servicemen. Prigozhin ultimately refused to sign these contracts, increasing tensions. And it is these contracts that are exactly what Troshev is after these days. On Saturday, Troshev, clad in a bespoke dark-blue suit common among Russian officials, was filmed in the Kremlin heeding President Vladimir Putin. Putin told him to “form volunteer battalions” that would include Wagner fighters. “You know what it’s like, how it’s done. You know about the issues that need to be resolved in advance so that combat work goes on in the best and most successful way,” Putin said. But the task is doomed because of Troshev’s reputation within Wagner, analysts said. “The core of most battle-tested Wagnerites is not joining him for sure,” Kyiv-based analyst Maria Kucherenko, who authored several in-depth reports on Wagner, told Al Jazeera. Troshev also faces a new rival. Prigozhin’s son and heir, Pavel, is “making a deal with the Russian national guard so that Wagner returns to Ukraine for a certain task without signing a contract,” Kucherenko said. Wagner mercenaries will also fight “under their own insignia” of a human skull against a black and red backdrop, she added. However, it’s crystal clear who would control these mercenary groups. “One can shuffle these alcoholic pensioners, one can make up a dozen noms de guerre, but the essence doesn’t change – both kinds of crap are controlled from [Russia’s] general staff of armed forces,” she said. Meanwhile, the Kremlin is pressuring the Wagner fighters in Africa who are reluctant to sign up for service in Ukraine by “deliberately blocking supply chains”, Mitrokhin said. As a result, a Telegram channel with ties to the Russian military and Wagner claimed that “three stormtrooper squads” flew from Africa to Ukraine last week. The deployment followed a deal between their commanders and Russia’s national guard to sign individual and group contracts, the Russian pro-war Telegram channel Rybar claimed. It’s not clear where the units are going, but their arrival will “contribute to the fall-winter campaign”, it said. So far, Ukrainian intelligence reported the return of about 500 Wagner fighters to the front lines and said their presence is not expected to crucially change the deadlock. At Wagner’s height in June, Prigozhin bragged he had 25,000 fighters, who were largely recruited from prisons, Davis said. They played a key role in capturing the eastern Ukrainian town of Bakhmut “at  great cost in casualties”, he said. Therefore, “some 500 men are not likely to make any significant impact, especially if dispersed among various Russian units”, Davis concluded.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/3/who-is-the-wagner-group-officer-putin-asked-to-form-volunteer-battalions
Ukraine to build first underground school to protect from Russian air raids,"The school planned for Kharkiv will allow students to study in a classroom ‘even during missile threats’, the mayor says.","Ukraine plans to build its first fully underground school in theeastern city of Kharkivto shield students from Russian bomb and missile attacks, the city’s mayor said. Parts ofKharkiv City, which is located less than 35km (20 miles) from the Russian border, have been subjected to nearly daily Russian aerial attacks, which can strike before residents have time to reach underground shelters. “We are planning to build Ukraine’s first underground school, which will address the most modern regulatory requirements for protective structures,” Kharkiv’s Mayor Ihor Terekhov wrote on the Telegram messaging app. “This shelter will allow thousands of children in Kharkiv to continue safe, in-person education even during missile threats,” Terekhov said. The mayor did not provide details on when the school will open but noted that authorities in Kharkiv would not reduce spending on education in the 2023-24 period, “despite the lack of funds from the budget”, the independent, Russian-language news site Meduza reported on Tuesday.     While Ukrainian schools in front-line areas have been forced to move online throughout the war, Kharkiv organised some 60 separate classrooms throughout its metro stations before the beginning of the new school year on September 1, creating space for more than 1,000 children to study safely. Ukraine’s Ministry of Education says that 363 educational institutions have been destroyed and nearly 3,800 damaged throughout the country since the war began with Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Kharkiv, which is Ukraine’s second-largest city, had a pre-war population of more than 1.4 million. Oleh Synyehubov, the governor of the Kharkiv region of which the city of Kharkiv is the administrative centre, said that in the 24 hours to Monday, one civilian was killed and several houses damaged as a result of Russia’s shelling and rocket attacks.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/3/ukraine-to-build-first-underground-school-to-protect-from-russian-air-raids

EU dismisses doubts over long-term commitment to Ukraine in Kyiv meeting,"While Western assistance for Ukraine remains robust, critics of that support have become increasingly vocal in EU and US.","The European Union has brushed aside questions over whether the bloc will remain committed toassisting Ukrainein the long term as schisms over the issue begin to form in the United States and Europe. A delegation of EU foreign ministers made anunannounced visitto the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, on Monday, offering an image of cohesion and reiterating their support for the country’s struggle against Russia’s invasion. “The EU remains united in its support to Ukraine. … I don’t see any member state folding on their engagement,” EU foreign policy chiefJosep Borrelltold reporters. Borrell described the gathering as “historic” but made clear there would be no new concrete announcements. “It is the first time that we met in a candidate country. And unfortunately, it was also the first time that the foreign ministers of the European Union met in a country at war,” he said at a press conference. When we are together, we are stronger. The EU is and remains Ukraine’s first supporter. Thank you@ZelenskyyUaand@DmytroKulebafor hosting us today.pic.twitter.com/HyGBhrdbqE — Josep Borrell Fontelles (@JosepBorrellF)October 2, 2023  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the ministers the duration of the war – now in its 20th month – was linked to the quality and quantity of support Ukraine receives from its allies. “Our victory directly depends on our cooperation: the more strong and principled steps we take together, the sooner this war will end,” Zelenskyy said in a statement. To bring about a speedy end to fighting, he urged the EU to expand sanctions on Russia and Iran, which has supplied attack drones for Russian forces. And he called for the “acceleration” of work to direct “frozen Russian assets to finance the restoration of war-torn Ukraine”.    The Kyiv meeting was convened amid growing signs that Westernsupport for assistanceto Ukraine is becoming more fractured. In the US, right-wing conservatives have become increasingly vocal in their attacks on US support, and a former Slovakian prime minister who promised “not a single round” of assistanceled his party to victoryin parliamentary elections over the weekend. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has also become more critical of Kyiv in recent months and said Hungary is in no rush to approve Sweden’s accession to NATO. Some countries in the Global South have also cooled on efforts bycountries like the USto rally support for Ukraine. They have been hammered economically by the war and are sceptical of being forced to choose between amicable relations with either the West or Russia.    As the war grinds on, supporters of Ukraine worry that governments and voters could lose interest in the conflict and move away from commitments to provide Kyiv with essential military and economic support. “Our victory directly depends on our cooperation: the more strong and principled steps we take together, the sooner this war will end,” Zelenskyy said in a statement after meeting the foreign ministers. In both the US and the EU, however,support for assistanceremains widespread and substantial. “The vast majority of both parties – Democrats and Republicans, Senate and House – support helping Ukraine and the brutal aggression that is being thrust upon them by Russia,” US PresidentJoe Bidensaid on Sunday as assistance to Ukraine figured in negotiations to avoid a government shutdown.

"Pussy Riot’s Tolokonnikova: ‘Russia wants me poisoned, dead, or in jail’","A founding member of the punk feminist art collective, who is on Russia’s most wanted list, talks to Al Jazeera about Ukraine, women’s rights, and the threats she faces.","Nadya Tolokonnikova, an artist and activist, was placed on Russia’s most wanted list in March. Weeks earlier, she had released an irreverent short film entitled Putin’s Ashes, in which a group of women from Ukraine, Russia and Belarus, dressed in lingerie and wearing red balaclavas, press the nuclear button and set alight a 10-foot portrait of the Russian president. “Join our movement against the most dangerous living dictator on the planet,” reads the caption accompanying the three-minute clip. A member of Pussy Riot, the Russian feminist protest art collective formed in 2011, she was reportedly accused by Moscow of “insulting the religious feelings of believers”. She has recently spent much of her time focused on the conflict in Ukraine, raising nearly $7m for Ukrainian war efforts through her cryptocurrency UkraineDAO. She has also curated My Body, My Business at Sotheby’s in support of abortion rights in the United States. Al Jazeera spoke with Tolokonnikova, who currently lives outside of Russia, about her art, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and her views on Moscow’s crackdown on dissent. Al Jazeera: You’ve spent several years in the kind of penal colonies dissidents will now be detained in. What is life like there, in terms of conditions and treatment, and do you think these sites have changed in nature since the war began? Nadya Tolokonnikova:A lot of things have changed since I was in jail, and I was hoping they would change for the better. I’d noticed a few main things to tackle in the Russian prison system: First, we need to get rid of forced labour. We still have this gulag Soviet inheritance of forced labour. Second is the lack of medical treatment – many prisoners die from treatable conditions. And lastly, living conditions. A lot of those facilities have not been updated since the gulag times. A lot of people still live in barracks, in very depressing conditions, often with no access to running water. We would go for weeks sometimes without being able to wash ourselves or our clothes. When I got out of jail, I was hoping that I’d be able to change it. And I did talk to some people who were leaving government offices at the time because it was still 2014, so some people from the opposition were still in government. We were hoping they were going to be able to bring prison reform in Russia. But instead, Russia went back to the new dark ages, starting with the war. It’s the same thing with feminist rights and LGBTQ+ people’s rights. Today, we cannot have any constructive conversations about the rights of prisoners, many of whom are being sent to the warzone to fight for the Russian side. They’re being used as canon meat for the war. Al Jazeera: How do you characterise the state of women’s rights in Russia, and how has the war in Ukraine impacted the struggle for gender equality? Tolokonnikova:With the beginning of the war in Ukraine, it became practically impossible to run a truly independent non-profit. And since our government does not really care about women’s rights, everything [is impacted] – from helping victims of domestic violence, to providing shelters for women, to fighting for our rights in the courts. In Russia, our self-defence law doesn’t work; if a woman killed someone who was threatening her or beating her up, she is sentenced for murder. And the only person who can help her is a human rights lawyer who could argue self-defence. But the government, or judge, or prosecutor, or cops – they don’t let you do that. So really the only people who can help women in Russia are women themselves and the non-profit sector. But the non-profits in this space that were actually legitimate and useful and independent – not just government puppets – were labelled as foreign agents [after the war erupted]. And most of the founders and members of those had to leave Russia because in the last couple of years, even projects that are not directly connected to politics – like helping women or protecting victims of domestic violence. Anna Rivina, the founder of nasiliu.net (No to Violence), Russia’s most prominent anti-domestic violence organisation, [who anticipated the increase in gender-based violence with the onset of the war in Ukraine] was labelled a foreign agent and had to leave Russia. There are numerous cases like this. When you have an extraordinary situation like this, when your country wages war, the conversations around human rights are set back hundreds of years. Nobody talks about feminism anymore or LGBTQ+ rights. There’s no one left in Russia who can talk about it. People are trying to help from the outside. Al Jazeera: What do you think awaits you if you were to return to Russia? Tolokonnikova:I currently have a criminal case opened on me for one of the works I did earlier this year for Putin’s Ashes, a performance that we showed for the first time at Jeffrey Deitch Gallery in LA. They used the Pussy Riot article, which they quite literally created while we were under investigation. They created this article in 2012 about hurting religious feelings. And it’s unclear how I was hurting religious feelings with my art, to me at least. [Editor’s note: Pussy Riot members including Tolokonnikova were charged in 2012 with “hooliganism motivated by religious hatred” after performing called Punk Prayer in Moscow’s Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, a song which attacked Putin and the Orthodox establishment.] If I go to Russia I’ll be immediately arrested. It was funny at first, and then I realised this comes with a price. The Russian passport is the only one I have, and it basically pretty much makes me a stateless person with few rights in the world. The only country that is supposed to protect my interests and defend my rights is the one which wants me poisoned, dead, or in jail. It does not feel good to be unprotected and stateless and having lots of troubles with travelling. Travel is very important for our job as activists and artists, and that creates complications. Al Jazeera: As an artist – and I know your politics and your art are inextricable – can you talk about how your aesthetic has developed? How have you found your artistic voice? Tolokonnikova:Contrasts are always very important for me. When we were coming up with the name Pussy Riot, we combined something traditionally seen as welcoming, cozy, nice, cute, sometimes even weak – that’s how people see it for some reason – with riot, which is the opposite of it. Contrasts are part of the Pussy Riot look, too. We have bold masks on our faces – they are purple, pink or neon. Yet at the same time, they’re not threatening, they’re still colourful so we signify we came with peace, not war or violence. And we wore very feminine dresses, which is not our everyday attire. When you’re running away from cops, it’s much easier to do it in pants rather than a bright colourful dress, but we decided to use it on purpose to show that femininity can be strong and bold, and riotous and rebellious, contrary to what a lot of people still believe. Al Jazeera: I see that contrast in your recent Putin’s Ashes work – the soft, plush frames combined with splattered blood, or traces of violence… Tolokonnikova:If you see Putin’s Ashes, it features women in practically lingerie. It’s important for me to state the fact that a woman can look how she wants to look. But it doesn’t take away anything from what she has to say. I think across the world really, conservatives are trying to push women into wearing something specific to be taken seriously. Al Jazeera: Can artistic production help people suffering within authoritarian regimes? Tolokonnikova:I think it can help on the emotional level. In my work, I try to combine my art with direct activism that influences people’s wellbeing, like helping prisoners or raising money for Ukraine, and making sure that I help someone in a very constructive and pragmatic manner. Art has a much more subtle influence on things, but it doesn’t mean that it’s less needed. A lot of us are talking specifically about Russian people and Russians who do not support Putin. A lot of us have this open wound after the war started. And we don’t really know how to talk about it, because obviously, our suffering cannot be compared to the suffering of Ukrainians. We still feel that wound and we cannot talk about it because it’s almost unethical. [Through my art, I’m trying to give a voice to], or at least acknowledge, the feelings of those people in Russia who feel unrepresented and silenced. If they decide to stay in Russia they cannot talk anymore, otherwise they’ll just end up in jail for dozens of years or be killed. Or maybe they’re outside of Russia, but they find they have a hard time talking about their feelings because, you know, who wants to hear about our feelings right now? Al Jazeera: How would you characterise Pussy Riot’s place within the history of political art of the past century? Tolokonnikova:Growing up, I really loved the Russian avant-garde movement – though that’s a very imperial phrase since many of its members were actually from Belarus or Ukraine. We have to come up with so many new terms. Russia has such a long way to go in decolonising itself, its history, its language. It’s pretty insane, and we’re just at the beginning of it. Anyway, I was really into [artists] like [Kazimir] Malevich, [Vladimir] Tatlin, [Vladimir] Mayakovsky. All of whom were men – they had women among them who were not that known at the time, unless they were lovers or wives. But then later feminist histories revealed that there were a lot of women in that movement. I always loved the avant-garde’s utopian vision for the world. Our godmothers are Valie Export, Judy Chicago, Marina Abramovic and Cindy Sherman. Guerrilla Girls, Riot grrrl, Jenny Holzer, Martha Rosler, Tracey Emin. We stand on the shoulders of these giants. Al Jazeera: And what do you think is next for you? Tolokonnikova:Well, I guess I’m hoping to not get poisoned or killed. Yeah.

EU foreign ministers in Ukraine’s Kyiv for unprecedented meeting abroad,Top diplomats of the bloc gather in Kyiv in the first-ever meeting outside the EU borders in show of solidarity.,"The foreign ministers of all 27 European Union member states are meeting in war-torn Ukraine in their first-ever meeting outside the bloc’s borders, displaying support for Kyiv. The unannounced meeting takes place as the Ukrainian government pushes to join the EU in the future, amidRussia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which is in its 20th month. “I am convening today the EU Foreign Ministers in Kyiv, for the first-ever meeting of all 27 Member States outside the EU,” the EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a post on social media platform X on Monday. “Ukraine’s future lies within the EU,” he added. Top officials from EU capitals have often visited Kyiv since the beginning of the war, but this is the first time an official EU summit is being held in the Ukrainian capital. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba hailed the ministers’ meeting “within future borders” of the EU in a post on social media platform X. “Glad to welcome EU foreign ministers at the historic meeting in Ukraine,” he said, adding: “For the first time in history, outside current EU borders. But also within its future borders.”    French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna said the meeting was a signal to Moscow of the bloc’s determination to support Ukraine over the long term. “It is a demonstration of our resolute and lasting support for Ukraine, until it can win. It is also a message to Russia that it should not count on our weariness. We will be there for a long time to come,” she told reporters in Kyiv. The EU member states, along with the United Kingdom and the United States, have provided massive military and financial support to Ukraine, enabling it to stand up to theRussian offensive. Al Jazeera’s Zein Basravi, reporting from the Ukrainian city of Lubny, said the meeting symbolises a crucial moment in EU-Ukraine relations. “The Russian war in Ukraine is an existential threat not just to Ukraine, but to the European project,” he said. “The majority of EU countries speak in one voice when it comes to supporting Ukraine in this war,” Basravi said. Monday’s meeting comes days after the US Congressblockednew aid for Ukraine in a government spending deal despite calls from the White House in the opposite direction. As uncertainty sets in over how long Kyiv’s allies will keep sending billions of dollars for the war, Kuleba said that Washington’s support for Ukraine was not weakening. “We do not feel that the US support has been shattered … because the United States understands that what is at stake in Ukraine is much bigger than just Ukraine,” he told reporters as he greeted Borrell for the summit. “The decision was taken as it was, but we are now working with both sides of the Congress to make sure that it does not repeat again under any circumstances,” Kuleba added. US President Joe Biden on SundayreassuredKyiv and allies of continued financial support for the war effort despite the US Congress’s decision. He pressed congressional Republicans to back the aid, saying he was “sick and tired” of the political brinkmanship that had nearly closed the government down.

"Wagner’s Prigozhin hailed a hero, 40 days after death in plane crash",Dozens pay respects in several Russian cities on a key date for mourning in the Eastern Orthodox church.,"Dozens of Russians from family to former fighters have held memorial services for Wagner mercenary group chief Yevgeny Prigozhin to mark 40 days since his death, hailing him as a hero of the people. Prigozhin was killed when his private jet crashed on its way from Moscow to St Petersburg on August 23, two months after he led afailed mutinyon Moscow. Two other top Wagner commanders, Prigozhin’s four bodyguards and the plane’s three crew were also killed in the still-unexplained crash.  At the 62-year-old’s grave in St Petersburg, his mother, Violetta, and his son, Pavel, laid flowers. Supporters waved the black flags of Wagner which sport a skull and the motto “Blood, Honour, Motherland, Courage”. In the Eastern Orthodox church, it is believed that the soul makes its final journey to either heaven or hell on the 40th day after death. Memorials also took place in Moscow and other Russian cities with dozens of Wagner fighters and everyday Russians paying their respects. There was no coverage on Russian state television or any official tributes. Wagner fighters have played a key role in the fighting in Ukraine, helping Russia capture the eastern town of Bakhmut in May after weeks of bruising battles. Wagner, whose troops were moved to camps in Belarus as part of a deal to end the mutiny, was also active in a number of African countries. “He can be criticised for certain events, but he was a patriot who defended the motherland’s interests on different continents,” Wagner’s recruitment arm said ofPrigozhinin a statement on Telegram. “He was charismatic and importantly he was close to the fighters and to the people. And that’s why he became popular both in Russia and abroad.” Prigozhin’s mutiny, which followed months of expletive-laden videos insulting Russia’s top military officials, was arguably the biggest challenge to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s rule since the former KGB spy rose to power in 1999. The Wagner troops took over the southern city of Rostov, shot down several Russian aircraft and advanced towards Moscow before turning back 200 km (125 miles) from the capital following a purported deal brokered by Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko. Mourners spoke of respect for Prigozhin, who got to know Putin while running a restaurant business in St Petersburg in the 1990s. He went on to win lucrative state catering contracts earning him the nickname, “Putin’s chef” and expanded into media as well as an infamous internet “troll factory” that led to his indictment in the United States for meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Wagner brought him further into the limelight with themercenary groupdeveloping a reputation for brutality and ruthlessness. “He was a real authority, a leader,” Mikhail, a soldier in Russia’s armed forces who refused to give his second name, told the Reuters news agency. Moscow resident Marta, who also refused to give her surname, said the people believed in Prigozhin but that Wagner had been “decapitated” by the deaths of him and co-founder Dmitry Utkin, a former special forces officer and aNazi sympathiser. Prigozhin was also supposed to have moved to Belarus as part of the deal to end the mutiny. Russia looks set to continue using Wagner units despite the recent turmoil. On Friday, the Kremlin said Putin had told Andrei Troshev, one of Wagner’s top commanders, that he should “deal with forming volunteer units that could perform various combat tasks, primarily in the zone of the special military operation” – a term Moscow uses for its war in Ukraine.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/2/wagners-prigozhin-hailed-a-hero-40-days-after-death-in-plane-crash

Biden says US ‘will not walk away’ from Ukraine amid budget turmoil,The US president reassures allies and Kyiv after a last-minute budget deal in Congress axes funding for the war-torn country.,"United States President Joe Biden says aid to Ukraine will keep flowing for now as he seeks to reassure allies of continued support for the war effort. But time is running out, the president said on Sunday in a warning to Congress, which has voted to avert a government shutdown by passing a short-term funding package that dropped assistance forUkraine in the fight against Russia. “We cannot under any circumstances allow American support for Ukraine to be interrupted,” Biden said. “We have time, not much time and there is an overwhelming sense of urgency,” he said, noting that the funding bill lasts only until mid-November. Biden urged the Congress to negotiate an aid package as soon as possible. “The vast majority of both parties – Democrats and Republicans, Senate and House – support helping Ukraine and the brutal aggression that is being thrust upon them by Russia,” he said in an address from the White House. “Stop playing games. Get this done,” Biden said, adding that he expected Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy to secure passage of a separate bill for Ukraine funding soon. “I want to assure our American allies, the American people and the people in Ukraine that you can count on our support. We will not walk away,” he said.    Despite Biden’s attempts to reassure Kyiv, the future of US aid for Ukraine hangs in the balance after a last-gasp deal to avoid a government shutdown. Although the compromise struck in Congress late on Sunday dropped new funding for Ukraine amid opposition from hardline Republicans, it remains unclear what might happen next. Biden and his Democratic party say the US has a duty to help Ukraine stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion, warning that failure to do so could embolden other nations in the future. But the issue has become so politicised in Washington that the fate of vital military aid is now in jeopardy, just as Kyiv tries to make progress in its sluggish counteroffensive before winter sets in. The US has been a major supporter of Ukraine after Russia invaded it last year, and Biden has sought to rally the world, as well as his own country, to maintain that support. Biden assured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a visit to Washington last month that strong US support for his war to repel Russian invaders would be maintained despite opposition from some Republican lawmakers. Biden urged Republicans to move ahead quickly to avoid another crisis in November. “The brinkmanship has to end. And there shouldn’t be another … crisis,” he said. “I strongly urge my Republican friends in Congress not to wait. Don’t waste time as you did all summer. Pass a year-long budget agreement. Honour the deal we made a few months ago.” Biden declined to weigh in on whether Democrats should support McCarthy if he needed their votes to keep his job as House speaker. The president said he would leave that to Democratic leaders in the Congress to decide. The US has approved four rounds of aid to Ukraine in response to Russia’s invasion, totaling about $113bn, with some of that money going towards replenishment of US military equipment that was sent to the front lines. In August, Biden called on Congress to provide for an additional $24bn.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/1/biden-says-us-will-not-walk-away-from-ukraine-amid-budget-turmoil
Ukraine tempts Western arms producers with plan for ‘large military hub’,Incentives available to partner with Ukrainian manufacturers as Kyiv looks to create ‘world class military products’.,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced plans to expand the country’s domestic defence industry through partnerships with Western weapons manufacturers, in a bid to increase supplies for its counteroffensive against Russia. Speaking at the opening of the International Defence Industries Forum, Zelenskyy said he wanted to make Ukraine’s defence sector into a “large military hub” where military equipment and weapons could be built and repaired. “Ukraine is in such a phase of the defence marathon when it is very important, critical to go forward without retreating. Results from the front line are needed daily,” the president told executives representing more than 250 Western weapons producers. “We are interested in localising production of equipment needed for our defence and each of those advanced defence systems which are used by our soldiers, giving Ukraine the best results at the front today.” Zelenskyy said that air defence and de-mining were his immediate priorities. Ukraine also aims to boost domestic production of missiles, drones and artillery ammunition. The foreign ministry said Ukrainian producers had signed about 20 agreements with foreign partners for joint production, exchange of technology or supply of components to make drones, armoured vehicles and ammunition. It did not identify the companies. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, who spoke by video link during the forum after visiting Kyiv earlier in the week, threw his weight behind the initiative. “Heroism alone cannot intercept missiles. Ukraine needs capabilities, high quality, high quantity, and quickly,” Stoltenberg said. “There is no defence without industry.” Ukraine retook the southern city ofKhersonin November last year, and began a long-awaitedcounteroffensivein early June to try and recapture other territories seized by Russia, which launched itsfull-scale invasionof the country in February 2022. Kyiv has reported advances in several directions and liberated more than a dozen villages since but Moscow still controls about 18 percent of Ukrainian territory. Ukraine’s allies have provided financial and military support worth tens of billions of dollars to help it push back Moscow’s forces. Ukrainian officials see the development of the country’s domestic defence industry as a potential boost to the economy, which shrunk by about a third last year as a result of the war. Several leading Western arms makers including Germany’s Rheinmetall and the United Kingdom’s BAE Systems have already announced plans to team up with Ukrainian producers. Ukraine will create new incentives to draw Western defence investment and establish a special fund, through dividends from state defence resources and profits from the sale of confiscated Russian assets, to support new technology development, officials said. “It will be a mutually beneficial partnership. I think it is a good time and place to create a large military hub,” Zelenskyy said during a separate meeting with weapons producers from the United States, the UK, Czechia, Germany, France, Sweden and Turkey. Recently appointed Defence MinisterRustem Umerovsaid Kyiv had to do everything possible to produce all the necessary military services andproductsin Ukraine for the needs of its army. “Our vision is to develop world-class military products,” Umerov said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/1/ukraine-tempts-western-arms-producers-with-plan-for-large-military-hub

Russian power substation hit in latest Ukrainian drone wave attack,Moscow’s Ministry of Defence reports downing more than a dozen Ukrainian drones in latest attacks on Russian territory.,"A combat drone dropped explosiveson an electricity substation in a Russian village near the border with Ukraine, while Russia’s Ministry of Defence reported shooting down more than a dozen Ukrainian drones over the Russian regions of Belgorod, Kursk and Kaluga. In the Russian village of Belaya, located less than 25km (16 miles) from the border, “a Ukrainian drone dropped two explosive devices on a substation”, Kursk regional governor Roman Starovoyt said on the Telegram messaging app early on Friday. “One of the transformers caught fire. Five settlements and a hospital were cut off from power supply. Fire crews rushed to the scene,” he said. “Power will be restored as soon as it is safe to do so.” Russian authorities said earlier that two Ukrainian drones were destroyed over the neighbouring Belgorod region. The Defence Ministry in Moscow said the first drone was “thwarted” at about 5pm local time (14:00 GMT) on Thursday. A second drone was brought down about four hours later.    Russia’s state-run TASS news agency later reported, citing Russia’s Defence Ministry, that10 Ukrainian drones were brought downover the Kursk region overnight and one over the Kaluga region. Ukraine has intensified its attacks on Russian territoryin recent weeks, with regions of the country now regularly subject to waves of Ukrainian drone attacks that have sporadically damaged buildings, including in Moscow. While Russian officials have downplayed their significance, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reiterated this week that attacks on targets in Russia would increase. “We clearly see the areas where pressure on Russia needs to be increased so that terrorist capabilities do not grow,” he said in his nightly address on Tuesday. “Sanctions are not enough. There will be more. There will be more of our own – Ukrainian actions against the terrorist state. As long as Russia’s aggression continues, Russia’s losses must be tangible,” he said.

"Belarus says Polish helicopter violated airspace, Warsaw denies",Belarus has repeatedly accused the EU member of breaching its airspace. Warsaw denies the claims.,"Belarus has claimed that a Polish helicopter had violated its airspace as tensions are high between the two countries amid the conflict in Ukraine. “Around 1520 (1220 GMT), the aircraft crossed the border of the Republic of Belarus, flew to a depth of up to 1.5 km. At 1622, the helicopter repeatedly violated the state border, going 300 metres deep,” the Ministry of Defence of Belarus said on Thursday on its Telegram channel. Belarus,Russia’s closest ally, said it had scrambled military aircraft in response. The Polish army said the Belarusian claim was “false”. “Records made by flight control stations and radar stations confirm: such an event did not take place,” the army’s operational command said in a statement. “The Polish army respects and follows all provisions and regulations relating to the inviolability of borders.” Belarus has repeatedly accused the EU member of breaching its airspace. Warsaw has denied the claims. Belarus’s foreign ministry said it had summoned the Polish charge d’affaires, Marcin Wojciechowski, to protest. According to the ministry, Minsk has demanded Warsaw conduct “an objective investigation into the incident” and take measures to prevent such incidents in the future. Last week, the Kremlin said that Moscow and its ally Belarus were “watching” Poland closely, calling it a “rather aggressive” country.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/28/belarus-says-polish-helicopter-violated-airspace-warsaw-denies
"Turkish neutrality: How Erdogan manages ties with Russia, Ukraine amid war","‘The West is reliable, Russia is equally reliable,’ the Turkish president said in a recent interview, a comment that reflects his delicate balancing act.","Kyiv, Ukraine– In Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s opinion, Russia and the West are “equally” reliable and trustworthy. That is what the Turkish president said on September 18 commenting on the collective West’s dependability and on his frustration with Turkey’s long-stalled attempts to join the European Union. “To the extent the West is reliable, Russia is equally reliable,” he told the PBS, a US broadcaster. “For the last 50 years, we have been waiting at the doorstep of the EU, and, at this moment in time, I trust Russia just as much as I trust the West.” After his September 4 visit to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin, Erdogan also believes the Kremlin’s master wants a prompt end to his faltering quagmire in Ukraine. “Mr Putin is on the side of ending this war as soon as possible. That’s what he said. And I believe his remarks,” Erdogan said. Erdogan may appear to sound naive, but he is directing a careful balancing act between the warring sides, the West, China and his own domestic audience. His equidistant position reaped enormous economic and political benefits both for him and his nation hobbled by a five years-long recession and traumatised by the February 6 earthquake that killed tens of thousands. “Erdogan’s geopolitics is based on balancing on three points of geopolitical confrontation – the West, Russia, China,” Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kushch told Al Jazeera. “From every direction, Erdogan gets maximal profit – markets, technologies and the economic modernisation from the West, cheap raw materials, fuel and a natural gas hub from Russia, transit [of goods] and investments from China,” he said. To some Ukrainians, this balance may look cynical. “He’s like a market trader – he smiles and asks about your family, but all he wants is your money and your recommendation to another buyer,” Valentin Aleksashenko, a Kyiv-based IT analyst who regularly holidays in Turkey, told Al Jazeera. But Erdogan’s stance does help Kyiv’s war effort. He calls Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a “dear friend”, recently gave him a red-carpet reception in Istanbul, and has helped negotiate the release of war prisoners and the extension of the “grain deal” to ship Ukrainian wheat via the Black Sea. The Bayraktar attack drones produced by the company that belongs to Erdogan’s son-in-law proved to be so lethally effective against Russian troops that Ukrainians name radio stations, cell phone plans, and business lunch menus after them. Erdogan’s reluctance to take sides works for him at home – especially since his voters realise how reluctant most EU member states are to let their nation in, and how Western “double standards” on migration spur anti-Western sentiments among them, said Seda Demiralp of Istanbul’s Isik University. “His voters are convinced that an independent position benefits Turkish interests most. Turkish voters do appreciate closer ties with the West while at the same time realising Turkey is never treated as an equal partner by the West,” she told Al Jazeera. “From Erdogan’s point of view, it’s perfectly rational to pursue policies that are not seen as exclusively supporting one party. He can neither alienate the West nor Russia,” Gonul Tol, a Turkish-born analyst with the Middle East Institute, a think tank in Washington, DC, told Al Jazeera. On the other hand, Brussels, Washington and Moscow have no choice but to approach Erdogan time and again.“From Western and Russian points of view, no matter how frustrated they get with Erdogan, they, too, think they must cooperate with Turkey,” Tol said. And then there is a personal connection between Erdogan and Putin, whose political trajectories are somewhat similar. Both were born in the 1950s and have been in power for more than two decades pursuing what critics call increasingly authoritarian and nationalist policies, though Erdogan and his supporters deny this. Both are nostalgic about their nations’ imperial heyday – and strive to revive it despite all odds. And both try to find common ground. “Time has shown that both leaders follow their nations’ interests, but can agree and compromise at the same time,” said Emil Mustafayev, an analyst based in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, Turkey’s key ally in the former Soviet Union. “And despite their myriad disagreements, it makes their relationship somewhat unique in today’s world,” he told Al Jazeera. Both are rewriting the centuries-old history of very uneasy ties. Russian czars and Ottoman sultans were at war a dozen times, and Czar Nicolas I famously called Turkey “Europe’s sick man” before the Crimean war that pitted Turkey and Western powers against Russia in the 1850s. A century and a half later, Moscow looks like “Europe’s sick man” as its annexation of Crimea and the war in Ukraine prompted tensions between roughly the same players. In 2015, during Russia’s campaign to rescue Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s crumbling regime, Turkish air force downed a Russian fighter jet that Ankara claimed violated its air space. The incident provoked tensions as Moscow imposed sanctions, banned charter flights to Turkey and ordered holiday companies to “evacuate” tens of thousands of tourists. Gazprom, Russia’s natural gas exporter, suspended the construction of a 1,100-kilometers-long (683-mile) pipeline to Turkey. But tensions soon ended, Russian gas was pumped to Turkey and farther to Eastern Europe, and Moscow even allowed Ankara to defer a $600m gas bill. After the disruption of Nord Stream, a Russian natural gas pipeline to Germany, the Kremlin decided to create a “gas hub” in Turkey. But the plan stalled because of something that could be emblematic of ties between Erdogan and Putin – the sides cannot agree on who is going to have more control over the hub, Reuters reported in mid-September.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/28/turkish-neutrality-how-erdogan-manages-ties-with-russia-ukraine-amid-war
Russia says Ukraine’s Western allies assisted in Black Sea Fleet HQ attack,"Moscow says US, UK had role in planning and executing of attack by providing spy plane, satellite intelligence to Kyiv.","Russia accused Ukraine’s Western allies of helping plan and execute a missile attack on the Russian Black Sea fleet’s headquarters inthe annexed Crimean Peninsula last week. Moscow’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Wednesday that Western reconnaissance data, NATO country satellites and spy planes were all used in the attack carried out by Ukraine on the fleet’s headquarters. “There is no doubt that the attack had been planned in advance using Western intelligence means, NATO satellite assets and reconnaissance planes and was implemented upon the advice of [United States] and British security agencies and in close coordination with them,” Zakharova said at a briefing. “The obvious aim of such terrorist acts is to divert attention from the failed attempts of the counteroffensive by the Ukrainian armed forces and to frighten people, to stir up panic in our society,” she said. Moscow has repeatedly claimed that the US and its NATO allies have become involved in the war in Ukraine by supplying weapons to Kyiv and providing Ukrainian forces with intelligence information and helping plan attacks on Russian facilities. Unconfirmed news reports said Storm Shadow missiles, which have been provided to Ukraine by the United Kingdom and France, were used in the missile attack onthe fleet’s headquarters in Sevastopol on Friday.    Zakharova’s criticism of the West followed comments made on Tuesday by Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy head of Russia’s Security Council, who said the arrival this week of US-made Abrams battle tanks in Ukraine and a promise by Washington to supply Kyiv withan unspecified number of long-range ATACMS missiles, would push NATO closer to a direct conflict with Russia. Friday’s missile attack on the Black Sea fleet’s headquarters in Sevastopol was just the latest against targets in the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia illegally annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Crimea has served as the key hub supporting the invasion of Ukraine and has increasingly come under fire by Ukrainian forces, who have promised to see the peninsula returned under Kyiv’s control. Ukraine said the missile strike put a large hole in the main building of the fleet’s headquarters and that 34 officers were killed, including the fleet’s commander Admiral Viktor Sokolov, and more than 100 Russian personnel were wounded. However,Sokolov was seen participating in a Russian defenceofficials’ meeting on Tuesday that was broadcast by Russian media.    On Wednesday, Russian state television stations also showed Sokolov purportedly speaking to journalists in Sevastopol after handing awards to a Black Sea fleet football team. Washington, DC-based think tank,the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), said on Wednesday that while Russian media were at pains to “publish inconclusive ‘proof’” that the Black Sea fleet commander is still alive, the institute would reserve judgement until more is known. “ISW is unprepared at this time to make an assessment about the authenticity of the footage or the date of its filming,”the think tank said. “The Kremlin and Russian Ministry of Defense have been notably silent on the matter and have not directly confirmed that Sokolov is alive,” it added. Ukraine’s Special Operation Forces posted a statement on Tuesday saying its sources had claimed that Sokolov was among the dead from the missile strike and that it was trying to verify those reports after the video of Sokolov surfaced.

Czech gov’t plans to buy 24 F-35 stealth fighters in $6.5bn defence spend,Czech PM Petr Fiala says purchase of US-made F-35 fighter jets tells military allies ‘that they can count on us’.,"The Czech government has approved a plan to buy 24 US-made F-35 advanced fighter jets in a deal valued at approximately $6.5bn, the largest defence contract ever signed by the Czech Republic that will see the country significantlyboost its military capabilities and integration with NATO. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala told reporters on Wednesday that the first of the supersonic stealth fighters would arrive by 2031 and the country’s military would have all 24 planes at its disposal by 2035. “The first F-35s will be ready in 2029 and our pilots will start training with them in the United States then,” Fiala said. Fiala said the F-35s “will solve the future of our tactical air forces for dozens of years to come”. “For our defence, it is important to boost our ties with NATO allies,” he said. In acquiring F-35s, “we are telling our allies that we take the defence of our country seriously and that they can count on us”, he said in a statement on social media.

State broadcaster Radio Prague International said the purchase of the F-35s “will be the biggest defence contract ever signed by [The Czech Republic]”. The US State Department approved the sale of F-35 jets, munitions and related equipment to the Czech Republic in June amid the country’s plans to replace 14 leased JAS-39 Gripen fighter jets from Sweden that are currently used by the Czech army. Czech Defence Minister Jana Cernochova said the state will pay 150 billion Czech crowns ($6.47bn) for the aircraft by 2034, a bill that includes the cost of the aircraft, training of pilots, ammunition, upgrades to the Caslav air force base in central Czech Republic and fuel. A member of the European Union and NATO with a population of some 10.5 million people, theCzech Republic has provided substantial military aid to Ukrainesince Russia’s invasion, including aircraft, tanks, howitzer artillery, armoured vehicles and ammunition.    In exchange for its military aid to Kyiv, Prague has received German-made Leopard tanks and financial compensation from the US and the EU. Chief of the general staff of the Czech armed forces Lieutenant General Karel Rehka said that the new jets would ensure “that in the case of need, we’ll manage to effectively defend ourselves against aggression, together with our allies”. The announcement of the F-35 deal comes as theCzech government plans to spend two percentof its gross domestic product on defence, in line with its NATO pledge. Produced by Lockheed Martin and equipped with anti-detection stealth technology, F-35s are used across NATO, but also by Australia, Japan, Israel and South Korea. Other countries including neutral Switzerland have also signed deals to buy the planes, which were launched in 2006.

Trudeau apologises after Nazi honoured in Canada’s parliament,Canadian prime minister says ‘terrible mistake’ violated memory of all who suffered under Nazi regime.,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has apologised after a man who served in a Nazi unit during World War II was honoured in Parliament, saying the “terrible mistake” harmed the memory of all those who suffered during the Holocaust. “On behalf of all those who were present in this chamber, I would like to offer my most sincere apologies for what happened on Friday,” Trudeau said in French in the House of Commons on Wednesday afternoon. “Paying tribute to this individual, without knowing who he was, was a terrible mistake and a violation of the memory of those who cruelly suffered at the hands of the Nazi regime.” Yaroslav Hunka, 98, received two standing ovations in the House last week during a special session attended byUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who was in Ottawa to appeal for Canada’s continued support against Russia’s military offensive. Jewish community groupslater reportedthat Hunka served in the 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Nazi military unit during World War II, and they called for an explanation and an apology.    Trudeau on Wednesday also apologised to Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian delegation that travelled to Canada to take part in the parliamentary session, saying the incident has fuelled Russian “propaganda”. “It is extremely troubling to think that this egregious error is being politicised by Russia and its supporters to provide false propaganda about what Ukraine is fighting for,” the prime minister told reporters during a news conference before he spoke in Parliament. Russia, which launched its all-out invasion of Ukraine last year, has described the decision to honour Hunka as “outrageous”. “Many Western countries, including Canada, have raised a young generation that does not know who fought whom or what happened during the Second World War. And they know nothing about the threat of fascism,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov previously said. The Russian authorities have justified their continued assault on Ukraine as part of a push to “de-Nazify” the country. Kyiv and its allies have dismissed that, accusing Moscow of trying to conduct a land grab. Trudeau’s office and senior members of his Liberal Party government have said they had no advance knowledge of Hunka’s invitation to Parliament. The prime minister reiterated on Wednesday that the speaker of the House of Commons, Anthony Rota, was “solely responsible” for his recognition. “All of us who were in this House on Friday regret deeply having stood and clapped, even though we did so unaware of the context,” Trudeau said. Rotaannounced his resignationearlier this week — which he said would come into effect at the end of Wednesday — amid mounting pressure to step down over the incident. “I reiterate my profound regret for my error in recognising an individual in the House,” the speaker said on Tuesday. Still, Trudeau — who hasseen his popularity dropin recent months — continues to be hammered by his political opponents, with the head of the opposition Conservative Party, Pierre Poilievre, accusing the prime minister of failing to adequately vet Hunka. “This is by far the biggest hit Canada’s diplomatic reputation has ever taken in its history, and it happened under Justin Trudeau’s government,” Poilievresaidearlier on Wednesday. Jagmeet Singh, leader of the progressive New Democratic Party (NDP), also said that “real damage has been done — real damage to the Jewish community, real damage to the war effort in Ukraine and real damage to Canada’s reputation”. “What is [Trudeau] going to do in concrete terms to clean up this mess?” Singh asked in the House of Commons.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/27/trudeau-apologises-after-nazi-honoured-in-canadas-parliament
"Ukraine strikes deep inside Crimea, cuts through Surovikin Line","Ukraine dealt a crippling blow to the Black Sea Fleet leadership, reportedly killing many of its officers during a planning meeting in their headquarters.","Ukraine scored devastating deep strikes against Russian-occupied Crimea in the 83rd week of the war, as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy toured Europe andthe United Statespicking up pledges of new long-range weapons and financing. At the same time, Ukrainian and Western sources confirmed that Ukrainian troops had broken through the first and strongest line of Russian defence on the southern front, known as the Surovikin Line after the general who devised it. That success could accelerate their march towards the cities of Tokmak and Melitopol. Ukraine attacked three targets in occupied Crimea in as many days, honing its signature tactic of using a wave of drones to destroy or distract air defences, followed by a wave of missiles. Satellite images showed that attacks destroyed half of the Black Sea Fleet’s communications command centre in Verkhnosadove, 16 kilometres (10 miles) northeast of the fleet base in Sevastopol, on September 20.

Russia claimed that all the rockets were intercepted, and the smoke seen on the video was caused by a burning grass.pic.twitter.com/p7jTlFv8U6 — Mark Krutov (@kromark)September 21, 2023  The following day Ukraine attacked the Saky airfield – the second time it has done so during the war. The Ukrainian broadcaster Suspilne reported the attack caused “serious damage” and that 12 Russian combat aircraft were present, including Su-24 and Su-30 fighter-bombers. The most crippling attack came on September 22. Ukraine hit the Black Sea Fleet command headquarters and claimed to have killed 34 officers, including fleet commander Admiral Viktor Sokolov. A further 105 were reportedly wounded. One Sevastopol resident filmed the moment when the second missile struck. Russia’s defence ministry attempted to deny the attack, and laterdeniedSokolov was dead, circulating a video purporting to show him taking part in a teleconference on September 26. Ukraine’s military intelligence chief said the attack also seriously wounded the commander of Russian forces on the southern front, Colonel General Alexander Romanchuk. Russian occupation authorities said Ukraine targeted Sevastopol again the following day, but air defences neutralised the attack. Improved intelligence to “understand when the Russian leadership is getting together” was one reason for Ukraine’s success, Colonel Seth Krummrich, who has led special forces detachments in Afghanistan and the Middle East, and currently serves as vice president for Global Guardian, a security consultant, told Al Jazeera. The second was improved weapons systems from the West. Ukraine used Storm Shadow missiles provided by the United Kingdom and France. The political result was that “people are going to feel vulnerable,” said Krummrich. “You have a lot of wounded coming back to Russia who are disillusioned or resentful and you have a lot of people who are not coming back at all,” he said. “The truth is definitely on the Russian street … this is like radiation or toxicity, slowly building up in the population, and over time it could become lethal to a government.” Ukrainian knowledge of the terrain was also important, US special forces commander Dimitries Andrew Grimes told Al Jazeera. “They know the territory; they know where the targets are. They know Crimea and Sevastopol and how to achieve the effects they want to achieve,” he said. The attacks in Crimea coincided with a series of visits abroad by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, designed to pick up diplomatic, military and financial aid. The tactic apparently worked. US media, citing government sources, confirmed Washington would provide Army Tactical Missiles, or ATACMS, which Ukraine has been seeking. The 300km-range (186-mile) weapon has significantly greater reach than the 250km-range (155-mile) Storm Shadow missile, but independent weapons analyst Colby Badhwar said the ATACMS’ key advantage was speed. Storm Shadows are launched from aircraft, meaning a two-hour delay between identifying a target and striking it, allowing for time to mount the missiles and flying the aircraft within range of the target. “Ground launched ballistic missiles on the other hand, can be fired from a launcher already near the front line, and hit their target within a matter of minutes, thanks to their speed,” wrote Badhwar. “This responsiveness is critical for engaging Time Sensitive Targets.” These include missile launchers, aircraft and battlefield armour. ATACMS would also boost Ukraine’s thin inventory of sophisticated missiles. The Washington Post said the administration of US President Joe Biden was considering only the cluster version of ATACMS, but retired Lieutenant General Ben Hodges said this was unsuitable for Ukraine because it has a shorter range than the single warhead version. It would “not [be] as effective at destroying large Russian facilities in Crimea,” he told Newsweek. “The [Biden] administration still seems to have a fear of providing long-range precision strike capability, which Ukraine might use against targets inside Russia,” Hodges said. Ukraine has been using only weapons of its own manufacture to hit Russia, and on September 24 it struck the Khalino Airfield near Kursk, reportedly killing aviation officers. Geolocated footage placed Ukrainian armoured vehicles behind the Russian first line of defence in Verbove, western Zaporizhia, on September 21. The Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, a think tank, said this was the first instance of Ukrainian forces operating beyond the tri-layered defence – part of what is known as the Surovikin Line. Two days later, Ukraine’s southern forces commander told CNN, “we have a breakthrough”, and the ISW confirmed the advance. “These fortifications are not the final defensive line in Russia’s defence in depth in western Zaporizhia Oblast, but rather a specific series of the best-prepared field fortifications arrayed as part of a near-contiguous belt of an anti-vehicle ditch, dragon’s teeth, and fighting positions about 1.7 – 3.5km (1.05-2.17 miles) west of Verbove,” the ISW said. Russian military reporters confirmed that Ukrainian units broke into Verbove itself on September 22. They also reported Ukrainian progress towards Novoprokopivka, in the same sector of the Zaporizhia region. According to one, Ukrainian forces were within 800 metres of the settlement. Ukraine’s success has not come easily. The ISW said Ukrainian forces were pinning down elements of three Russian divisions, and that additional elements of other divisions had been called forward from rear defence positions in Tokmak, 18km (11.2 miles) away from the front, to assist them. “It’s obvious the Russians are on the defensive right now,” said Grimes. “They’re operating with conscript forces because they’ve lost a lot of their élite forces, so they’re throwing their conscripts into the meat grinder.” Russian commanders have also ignored their own playbook, whereby “one echelon of Russian forces slows a Ukrainian tactical advance while a second echelon of forces counterattacks,” said the ISW. “Russian forces continue to expend significant combat power on counterattacking to hold their current positions and appear to be resisting the operationally sound course of action of falling back to prepared defensive positions further south,” it said. Some observers have said Ukraine risks losing global support because its advance has been slow. Krummrich believed Ukraine’s deliberative approach was key to its success. “When [countries] see Ukraine moving forward, that strengthens their righteous position on the world stage to say, ‘You need to back us’. If the Russians were blowing through Ukraine, a lot of midrange countries might say, ‘We’re going to hedge our bets on this.’”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/27/ukraine-strikes-deep-inside-crimea-cuts-through-surovikin-line
Slovakia’s knife-edge election to determine stance on Ukraine,Robert Fico’s win could raise the prospect of Slovakia dropping its staunch support of the war-torn country.,"Robert Fico, Slovakia’s three-time prime minister, has a chance to return to power in a closely fought early election on Saturday, raising the prospect of the central European country dropping its staunch support of neighbouring Ukraine. Fico’s SMER-SSD party has a narrow lead over liberal Progressive Slovakia (PS), which has pledged to stay the course on foreign policy, in two out of four final opinion polls. Late voter shifts put PS a whisker ahead in the other two polls. A government led by Fico’s party could forge an alliance with Hungarian leader Viktor Orban, who has been an outlier on Ukraine and spars with the European Union over the rule of law. Such an alliance may be reinforced if Poland’s conservative PiS wins another term in October, although PiS has a hawkish view on Russia. The leading Slovak party is expected to get the first chance from liberal President Zuzana Caputova to form a cabinet. But who succeeds will depend on the results of half a dozen smaller parties as SMER-SSD and PS will fall short of a majority and need several allies in the 150-seat parliament. The third-largest party and possible kingmaker is the moderate-left Hlas (Voice) of Peter Pellegrini, a former member of SMER-SSD and prime minister in 2018-20. He has kept his options open but is seen closer to Fico. Fico, 59, resigned in 2018 after protests against corruption following the murder of an investigative journalist. He adopted more pro-Russian views, amplified by disinformation on social networks, in opposition to a centre-right coalition that ruled the country from 2020. That coalition fell apart last year and was replaced by a caretaker cabinet. Fico has pledged to end military aid to Ukraine, a sharp U-turn from Slovakia’s current position as a supplier of heavy equipment to its eastern neighbour. “We refuse statements and positions that state that the current Russia-Ukraine conflict is our conflict as well,” Fico told the Reuters news agency in an email. Political analyst Grigorij Meseznikov said that, despite fiery rhetoric, Fico had a record of avoiding unnecessary clashes with Brussels or NATO allies, but having Orban as an ally would embolden him. “Orban has managed to at least complicate adopting [Russia] sanctions packages … Fico will be doing the same,” he said. “They will support each other.” “He will stop the weapons [for Ukraine], that is what he gains support on.” Fico has criticised migrants being allowed through Slovakia and said in a Tuesday television debate he would immediately impose controls on the border with Hungary. Fico’s policies would depend on what coalition SMER-SSD could form. Potential partners range from Hlas to the far-right Republika, which foreign diplomats said would be a red line for Slovakia’s allies. Centrist liberal voters have flocked to the nonparliamentary PS, led by Oxford political science graduate and European Parliament Vice-Chairman Michal Simecka, 39. PS has ruled out working with extremists or with Fico. The party has run a strongly pro-European campaign and would be closer within central Europe to the Czech Republic. It is open to working with small conservative parties, though any such alliance could be unstable due to ideological differences. Fico faced criminal charges in 2022 of using sensitive information on political opponents. The charges, which he denied, have been dropped, though the investigation continues. Fico has sought the removal of the country’s special prosecutor dealing with high-level corruption cases. Any such steps would be closely watched by Brussels, which could withhold EU subsidies – as it has in rows with Poland and Hungary – if it deems they go against rule of law, an EU diplomat told Reuters.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/27/slovakias-knife-edge-election-to-determine-stance-on-ukraine

Canada parliament speaker steps down after honouring Nazi,Anthony Rota resigns in face of mounting pressure after he honoured a man who served in Nazi World War II unit.,"The speaker of Canada’s Parliament has stepped down, days after hehonoured a manwho fought in a Nazi unit during World War II as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited the House of Commons last week. Addressing Canadian lawmakers in Ottawa on Tuesday afternoon, Speaker Anthony Rota said he was resigning “with a heavy heart”. “This House is above any of us. Therefore, I must step down as your speaker,” said Rota, who invited Yaroslav Hunka to Friday’s special parliamentary session in the House of Commons, where he recognised the 98-year-old as a “Ukrainian hero”. Hunka served in the 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the Nazi’s SS military unit,saidthe Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish community group. He received standing ovations in the House of Commons, including from Zelenskyy and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who were in attendance. “I reiterate my profound regret for my error in recognising an individual in the House,” Rota said in Parliament on Tuesday afternoon, as he faced mounting calls to resign from advocacy groups, Canadian lawmakers and even top members of his own Liberal Party. “That public recognition has caused pain to individuals and communities, including the Jewish community in Canada and around the world, in addition to survivors of Nazi atrocities in Poland, among other nations,” he said. His resignation will come into effect at the end of the day on Wednesday, Rota added.    Canadian legislators from all major parties had called for Rota to step down, with Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly telling reporters on Tuesday morning that the episode was “an embarrassment to the House and to Canadians”. “And I think the speaker should listen to members of the House and step down,” she said. The progressive New Democratic Party’s House leader, Peter Julian, said earlier this week that Rota had made “an unforgivable error that puts the entire House in disrepute”. Asked about his resignation on Tuesday afternoon, Julian told reporters that steps need to be taken “to ensure that this never happens again in a Canadian Parliament”. He added that it remained unclear when a vote on the next speaker would take place. The speaker of the House of Commons is elected by fellow parliament members to preside over the proceedings in the chamber. The episode came as Zelenskyy, who is Jewish, on Friday addressed Canadian parliamentarians for the second time since Russia launched itsfull-scale invasionof his country in February of last year. The Russian authorities justified their continued assault on Ukraine as part of a push to “de-Nazify” the country. Kyiv and its allies have dismissed that as Russian propaganda, accusing Moscow of trying to conduct a land grab. I'm glad the Speaker of the House of Commons quickly apologized and took responsibility for this mistake, but it was so egregious – so injurious to Canada, our Parliament and our Ukrainian partners, and so offensive to Jews everywhere – he needs to resign.https://t.co/8gENJMQpbx — Roland Paris (@rolandparis)September 25, 2023  Russia said it was “outrageous” that Hunka was honoured in Canada. “Such sloppiness of memory is outrageous,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. “Many Western countries, including Canada, have raised a young generation that does not know who fought whom or what happened during the second world war. And they know nothing about the threat of fascism.” Roland Paris, director of the Graduate School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Ottawa, said earlier this week that while Rota’s quick apology was welcomed, it did not go far enough. “It was so egregious – so injurious to Canada, our Parliament and our Ukrainian partners, and so offensive to Jews everywhere – he needs to resign,” Paris wrote on social media. Trudeau, who described the events as “deeply embarrassing” for Canada, also has faced questions from opposition Conservative Party lawmakers over what he knew about Hunka’s background and how he was vetted. Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the Conservatives, earlier on Tuesday accused the prime minister of failing “to have his massive diplomatic and intelligence apparatus vet and prevent honouring a Nazi”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/26/canada-parliament-speaker-faces-calls-to-step-down-after-honouring-nazi
Russian Black Sea commander seen in video after Ukraine said it killed him,"Viktor Solokov, Moscow’s top admiral in Crimea, was shown in a Russian defence ministry video conference after allegedly being killed in a weekend missile attack.","Viktor Sokolov, commander of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet in Crimea, has been shown attending a meeting a day after Ukrainian special forces claimed he died in a barrage of missiles. In video and photographs released by the Russian defence ministry and shown on state television on Tuesday, Sokolov is seen taking part in a video conference with Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu and other top admirals and army chiefs. Ukraine’s special forces said on Monday that Sokolov was killed in theRussian-annexed peninsulaalong with 33 other officers in amissile attackon the headquarters of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet in the port of Sevastopol. The statement added 105 others were wounded in the strikes. While the report did not name Sokolov, Anton Gerashchenko, adviser to Ukraine’s minister of internal affairs, posted the admiral’s name and a photo on social media. The defence ministry released a statement saying the meeting had taken place earlier in the day. Sokolov appears on screen several times without speaking. Russia has suffereda string of attackson the strategically important port of Sevastopol in recent months. Sokolov was appointed commander of the Black Sea Fleet in September 2022. According to media reports, his predecessor was removed after Ukraine’s sinking ofthe missile cruiser Moskva, the flagship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, a few months after Moscow’s full-scale war against Ukraine began. Earlier on Tuesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on the Ukrainian claim about Sokolov’s demise, referring reporters to the defence ministry. In the video released by the ministry, Shoigu said more than 17,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed in September and 2,700 weapons, including seven American Bradley fighting vehicles, were destroyed. “The Ukrainian armed forces are suffering serious losses along the entire front line,” Shoigu said, adding the Ukrainian counteroffensive had so far produced no results. “The United States and its allies continue to arm the armed forces of Ukraine, and the Kyiv regime throws untrained soldiers to their slaughter in senseless assaults,” Shoigu said.    Ukraine’s counteroffensive has yet to yield significant territorial gains against Russian forces, which control about 17.5 percent of the internationally recognised territory of Ukraine. According to a September 19 scorecard by the Belfer Center at Harvard’s Kennedy School,Russia has gained90 sq km (35 square miles) of territory from Ukraine in the past month while Ukrainian forces have taken 41 sq km (16 square miles) from Russian forces. Kyiv has stepped up attacks in the Black Sea and on the Crimean Peninsula as its forces press on with the nearly four-month-old counteroffensive to take back Russian-occupied territory. Russian territory, including the capital Moscow, has been subject to numerous drone attacks in recent months.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/26/ukraine-says-russian-black-sea-fleet-commander-among-34-officers-killed

Russian media rhetoric could be ‘incitement to genocide in Ukraine’: UN,"Some rhetoric disseminated by Russian media could amount to incitement to genocide, the Human Rights Council probe says.","UN investigators probing violations in Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion have warned that some rhetoric transmitted by Russian media could amount to incitement to genocide. Speaking before the UN Human Rights Council on Monday, the head of the investigation team, Erik Mose, voiced concern “about allegations of genocide in Ukraine”. “For instance, some of the rhetoric transmitted in Russian state and other media may constitute incitement to genocide,” he said, adding that the team was “continuing its investigations on such issues”. The Norwegian judge heads a three-person Commission of Inquiry (COI), which was created by the council to investigate violations committed since Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbour in February last year. In its first full report in March, the team determined that Russian authorities had committed “a wide range of war crimes”. Mose said at the time that the commission was aware of accusations of genocide, including the forced transfer of Ukrainian children to areas under Russian control, and promised to investigate.    In his update to the council on Monday, Mose lamented a “lack of clarity and transparency on the full extent, circumstances, and categories of children transferred”, and said the team was continuing to investigate. “Whether that will also raise issues of genocide will then be clarified in the course of our investigations,” he told reporters. The March report had also determined that Moscow was behind a vast array of other war crimes, including widespread attacks on civilians and infrastructure, killings, torture and rape and other sexual violence. Mose said on Monday that the commission, which had travelled more than 10 times to Ukraine, was now “undertaking a more in-depth investigation” that “may also clarify whether torture and attacks on energy infrastructure amount to crimes against humanity”. Among other things, he said the team was investigating the cause of the disastrous destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam in Russian-held territory on June 6. The team had also collected more evidence indicating “widespread and systematic” use of torture by Russian armed forces, commission member Pablo de Greiff told reporters. The torture was mainly taking place in detention centres controlled by Russian authorities, and was in some cases so brutal the victims died, he said. “Not having access to places of detention under the control of the Russian Federation, it is impossible to quantify exactly the number of people that may have died as a result of this practice,” he said, adding that it appeared to be “a fairly large number”. Rape and other sexual violence was also widespread. In the Kherson region, the commission found that “Russian soldiers raped and committed sexual violence against women of ages ranging from 19 to 83 years”, Mose said. Pointing to “the scale and gravity of violations and corresponding crimes that have been committed in Ukraine by Russian armed forces”, he emphasised “the need for accountability”. The investigators are in the process of drawing up a list of suspected perpetrators, which “will be in due course submitted to the High Commissioner for Human Rights”, he said. The team, he said, has also urged Ukrainian authorities to ” expeditiously and thoroughly investigate the few cases of violations by its own forces”. The cases of abuse found on the Ukrainian side largely involved the use of explosive weapons that affected civilian populations and the mistreatment of detained Russian soldiers, the investigators said. But Mose stressed that there was no comparison to the variety and vast numbers of violations committed on the Russian side.

‘Deepest apologies’: Canada official backtracks after Ukraine Nazi honoured,"Canadian parliament’s speaker says ‘deeply sorry’ for honouring Yaroslav Hunka, 98, during Zelenskyy visit to Ottawa.","The speaker of Canada’s House of Commons has apologised for praising an individual who served in a Nazi unit during World War II in a session attended by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and visiting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Speaker Anthony Rota recognised Yaroslav Hunka, 98, as a “Ukrainian hero, a Canadian hero” before the Canadian Parliament on Friday, saying “we thank him for all his service”. Hunka served in World War II as a member of the 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS, according to the Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights group, that demanded an apology. The centre said Hunka’s ties to the Nazi war machine “are well-documented”. Both Zelenskyy and Trudeau joined in acknowledging Hunka during the parliament session with applause. Rota took responsibility for what he characterised as an oversight, calling the initiative “entirely my own”. “I have subsequently become aware of more information which causes me to regret my decision,” he said in a statement on Sunday, offering his “deepest apologies to Jewish communities in Canada and around the world”. He reiterated his apology on Monday in Parliament, telling Canadian lawmakers that he was “deeply sorry” for his gesture and remarks. “I would also like to add that this initiative was entirely my own,” Rota said. “No one, including you – my fellow parliamentarians – or the Ukraine delegation was privy to my remarks prior to their delivery.” The recognition came following the visit to parliament by Zelenskyy, who thanked Canada for its assistance inUkraine’s war against Russia. Following Zelenskyy’s remarks, Rota acknowledged Hunka – who was seated in the gallery – praising him for fighting for Ukrainian independence against the Russians. Hunka received two standing ovations from those gathered. As Canadian lawmakers cheered, Zelenskyy raised his fist in acknowledgement and Hunka saluted. “At a time of risinganti-Semitism and Holocaust distortion, it is incredibly disturbing to see Canada’s parliament rise to applaud an individual who was a member of a unit in the Waffen-SS – a Nazi military branch responsible for the murder of Jews and others,” the Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center said in a statement. “An explanation must be provided as to how this individual entered the hallowed halls of Canadian parliament and received recognition from the Speaker of the House and a standing ovation.” Russia’s RIA state news agency cited Russia’s ambassador to Canada, Oleg Stepanov, as saying the embassy will send a letter to Trudeau and a note to the Canadian foreign ministry on Monday. “We will, of course, demand clarification from the Canadian government,” Stepanov was quoted as saying. Dominique Arel, chair of Ukrainian studies at the University of Ottawa, said the incident “is highly problematic”. “We have the issue of symbolism here, the optics of serving in a military unit whose logo is that of arguably the greatest criminal organisation in the 20th century … so obviously the optics are not good,” AreltoldCBC News. Trudeau in particular has come under pressure from opposition Conservative lawmakers, who have questioned how the Canadian prime minister’s office could have been unaware of Hunka’s background. “Your statement doesn’t answer the questions around how this individual was vetted,”Andrew Scheer, the former Conservative Party leader, told Rota in the House of Commons on Monday. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, saying the goal of the “special military operation” was todenazify and demilitarise its neighbour. Zelenskyy is Jewish and lost relatives in the Holocaust. Kyiv and its Western allies say Russia’s attack, which has killed tens of thousands and displaced millions, has been an unprovoked land grab. The United States says Moscow’s false justification for the war has been nothing but the Kremlin’s attempt to “manipulate international public opinion”. B’nai Brith Canada’s CEO Michael Mostyn said it was outrageous that parliament honoured a former member of a Nazi unit. Mostyn said Ukrainian “ultranationalist ideologues” who volunteered for the Galicia Division “dreamed of an ethnically homogenous Ukrainian state and endorsed the idea of ethnic cleansing”. “We understand an apology is forthcoming. We expect a meaningful apology. Parliament owes an apology to all Canadians for this outrage, and a detailed explanation as to how this could possibly have taken place at the centre of Canadian democracy,” Mostyn said.

‘Empire of lies’: Russia’s Lavrov slams West in UN speech,"Russia’s foreign minister glosses over Ukraine, accuses Western allies of neo-colonialism at the UN General Assembly.","Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has called the West an “empire of lies” and accused it of adopting a neo-colonial mindset in its overtures to the Global South to win backing for Ukraine in the war. Speaking after a week of intense global diplomacy at the annual gathering of world leaders at UN headquarters in New York, where Ukraine and its Western allies sought to drum up support for Kyiv as it fights against Russia’s invasion, Lavrov said a “global majority” was being duped by the West. “The US and its subordinated collective continue to fuel conflicts which artificially divide humanity into hostile blocks and hamper the achievement of overall aims,” Lavrov said. “They are trying to force the world to play according to their own self-centred rules.” James Bays, Al Jazeera’s diplomatic correspondent, said Lavrov’s speech was part of a “tour around the world of Russia’s views” that contained no real mention of Ukraine and few indications of Moscow’s plan one year into the conflict. During a news conference following the speech, the foreign minister dismissed a10-point proposalput forward by Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as well as the latest UN proposals to revive theBlack Sea grain initiative. “It is completely not feasible,” he said of the peace blueprint promoted by Kyiv. “It is not possible to implement this. It’s not realistic and everybody understands this, but at the same time, they say this is the only basis for negotiations.” He also said the UN proposal would not fly because the West did not deliver on its promises to Moscow, including removing sanctions on a Russian bank and reconnecting it to the global SWIFT system. The February 2022 invasion of Ukraine triggered trade disruptions and significant increases in internationalprices for energy, agricultural commodities, and fertiliser, which were already elevated due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Russia’s foreign minister placed the blame for the crises in the food and energy markets on Western nations, who impose “unilateral coercive measures” – or sanctions – on weaker ones.    Lavrov’s speech came as Zelenskyy awarded two Polish volunteers state awards during a stopover, as relations between the two countries are strained over grain imports. He did not meet with any officials. Zelenskyy angered his neighbours when he told the UN General Assembly that Kyiv was working to preserve land routes for grain exports, but that the “political theatre” around imports was only helping Moscow. Poland decided last week to extend a ban on Ukrainian grain imports, shaking Kyiv’s relationship with a neighbour that has been one of its staunchest allies since Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year. Zelenskyy thanked all Poles who “from the first days opened their families, their homes, opened themselves up and helped”. “I believe that any challenges on our common path are nothing compared to the fact that there is such strength between our people,” he said. Continuing fighting Ukraine is continuing a counteroffensive to repel the Russian invasion and recapture its lost territories. On Saturday morning, it launched another missile attack on Sevastopol on the occupied Crimean Peninsula, a day after an attack on the headquarters of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet that left a serviceman missing and the main building smouldering. Ukraine’s intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, told Voice of America on Saturday that at least nine people were killed and 16 others wounded as a result of Kyiv’s attack on the Black Sea Fleet on Friday. Budanov claimed Alexander Romanchuk, a Russian general commanding forces along the key southeastern front line, was “in a very serious condition” following the attack. Al Jazeera’s Zein Basravi, reporting from Kyiv, said Ukraine’s military intelligence confirmed the death toll. At least two senior generals were wounded, while the fate of the head of the Russian Black Sea navy, Viktor Sokolov, remained unknown. Russia did not confirm the number of casualties. Crimea has served as the key hub supporting Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Sevastopol, the main base of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet since the 19th century, has had a particular importance for navy operations since the start of the war. Hanna Shelest, a security analyst with the Ukrainian Prism NGO, said Kyiv’s attacks on Crimea were important for its strategy and morale. The majority of the attacks on Ukraine’s southern region come from Crimea, and moves to diminish the capabilities there have strategic importance, Shelest told Al Jazeera. Ukraine’s military said the air force conducted 12 attacks on the Black Sea Fleet headquarters on Friday, targeting areas where personnel, military equipment and weapons were concentrated. It said that two anti-aircraft missile systems and four Russian artillery units were hit. Ukraine has increasingly targeted naval facilities in Crimea in recent weeks while the brunt of its counteroffensive makes slow gains in the east and south of Ukraine.

Nord Stream sabotage one year on: What to know about the attack,"Investigators from Germany, Sweden and Denmark remain tight-lipped while speculation and theories abound.","A year has passed since explosions rocked theNord Stream pipelines, cutting off a major route for Russian gas exports to Europe and fuelling geopolitical tensions already at a fever pitch after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. However, despite official investigations in three countries, the question of who is responsible for the act of sabotage remains unanswered. Without hard evidence, many theories have emerged pointing the finger at Ukraine, Russia or the United States, all of which have denied involvement. Here is what we know about the Nord Stream attack: On September 26, 2022, several underwater blasts ruptured three of the four pipelines comprising Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2, spewing vast amounts of gas into the Baltic Sea near Bornholm, Denmark. Russian energy giant Gazprom halted flows through Nord Stream 1, the main conduit for Russian natural gas to Germany, amid disputes over the war in Ukraine a month earlier. The newly completed Nord Stream 2 twin pipelines never opened as Berlin pulled the plug on the project days before Russian troops entered Ukraine on February 24, 2022. The 10-billion-euro ($10.6bn) Nord Stream 2 had long been opposed by Ukraine, the US and Eastern European countries which feared it would give Russia too much influence over Germany’s energy security. The blasts occurred in the economic zones ofSwedenandDenmark, so both countries launched investigations into the incident. So far, they say the explosions were deliberate, but they have yet to single out who was behind the blasts. Germany also launched an investigation withfederal prosecutors searching a yacht in Januarythat might have been used to transport the explosives. They seized objects from the vessel and found traces of explosives. They have refused to comment on media speculation that a team of five men and one woman chartered the Andromeda yacht from Rostock port to carry out the operation. “The identity of the perpetrators and their motives” remains the subject of ongoing investigations, Germany’s prosecution office told AFP news agency. The fact all three countries have kept a tight lid on their investigations is unsurprising, according to analysts, given the potential diplomatic fallout of what they might uncover. Investigative journalists have been carrying out their own research to solve the Nord Stream whodunnit, leading to sometimes sensational, if unconfirmed, reports. Dutch military intelligence warned the CIA of a Ukrainian plan to blow up the pipelines three months before the attack, Dutch broadcaster NOS and Germany’s Die Zeit and ARD reported in June. The Washington Post made a similar claim. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly denied his country was behind the sabotage. “I would never do that,” he told Germany’s Bild newspaper, adding he would “like to see proof”. In March, The New York Times wrote that US officials had seen intelligence indicating a “pro-Ukrainian group” was responsible, without Zelenskyy’s knowledge. German media have focused on the Andromeda, with reporters from Der Spiegel magazine and broadcaster ZDF recreating the journey they believe was made by the six-person crew. According to their reporting, a forged passport used to hire the sailboat leads back to a Ukrainian soldier, while the charter fee was paid by a company registered in Poland with ties to a woman in Kyiv. In June, The Wall Street Journal reported Germany was trying to match DNA samples found on the vessel “to at least one Ukrainian soldier”. The Journal also said evidence found in the investigation included data from Andromeda’s radio and navigation equipment, satellite and mobile phones, and Gmail accounts allegedly used by the perpetrators. Danish media have reported a Russian naval vessel specialised in submarine operations, the SS-750, was photographed near the site of the blasts days before the attack. US investigative journalist Seymour Hersh reported in February theUS was behind the blasts and that Norway assisted. It was dismissed as “fiction” by the White House. Experts have not ruled out a “false flag” operation by Russia, with clues deliberately placed to pin the blame on Ukraine. Andreas Umland, an analyst at the Stockholm Centre for Eastern European Studies, said he sees Russia as “the most likely” culprit. Any suspected involvement by Kyiv in an attack on Europe’s energy infrastructure could threaten the support of allies, which would benefit Russia. At the same time, the destroyed pipelines could help Gazprom avoid compensation claims for undelivered gas, even though the company was reluctant to keep the taps open before the blasts. Moscow may have sought “to kill two birds with one stone”, Umland said. The Kremlin has strongly denied responsibility. Russia has alleged the US was behind the attack, noting the sabotage “occurredafter the repeated threatsto the Nord Stream by the leadership of the United States”. In March, Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed the argument that Kyiv was behind the explosions, insteadlaying blame on the US. “Who is interested? Theoretically, the United States is interested in stopping the supply of Russian energy to the European market and supplying volumes of its own,” he told an interviewer. “Such an explosion, so powerful and at such depth, could only be conducted by experts backed by the entire potential of a state that has relevant technologies,” said Putin.

"Ukraine to receive US long-range ATACMS missiles, US media report",Ukrainian President Zelenskyy did not respond directly to a question about the US supplying long-range missile system.,"United States President Joe Biden has informed his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, that Washington will provide Kyiv withATACMS long-range missiles, US broadcaster NBC News has reported. Ukraine has repeatedly asked the Biden administration for the long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) to help hit supply lines, airbases and rail networks deep behind Russia’s front lines in occupied regions of Ukraine. But the White House has not announced a decision to provide Ukraine with the ATACMS system and the missiles were not publicly discussed when Zelenskyy visited Washington, DC on Thursday for talks with Biden, even as the US announced a new $325m military aid package for Kyiv. The White House and the Pentagon declined to comment on the NBC report on Friday. The Pentagon also declined to say whether any promise of ATACMS was given to Zelenskyy during his meetings on Thursday at the Department of Defense, saying: “In regards to ATACMS, we have nothing to announce.” A date for delivery of the ATACMS was not revealed, according to NBC. Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs warned earlier this month thatthe supply of longer-range missiles to Kyivwould cross a “red line” and the US would be viewed as “a party to the conflict” in Ukraine if it did provide such weapons. Zelenskyy did not answer directly when asked about the NBC reports on ATACMS, but he noted that the US was the biggest single supplier of weaponry to Ukraine. “We are discussing all the different types of weapons – long-range weapons and artillery, artillery shells with the calibre of 155mm, then air defence systems,” Zelenskyy said, speaking through an interpreter.

The Washington Post also reported that the US plans to provide Ukraine with a version of the ATACMS that will be armed with cluster bomblets rather than a single warhead, citing several unnamed sources familiar with the deliberations, and that can fly up to 306km (190 miles). ATACMS is designed for “deep attack of enemy second-echelon forces”, a US Army website states, and could be used to attack command and control centres, air defences and logistics sites well behind the front line.

Poland’s PM tells Ukraine’s Zelenskyy to ‘never insult’ Polish people again,Poland’s PM Mateusz Morawiecki accused the Ukrainian leader of insulting Poles in his United Nations address this week.,"Poland’s prime minister has told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to never “insult” Poles again, returning to harsh rhetoric towards Kyiv after the Polish president had sought todefuse a simmering dispute between the two countriesover the issue of Ukrainian grain imports. Zelenskyy angered his neighbours in Warsaw –a key military ally against Russia– when he told the United Nations General Assembly in New York this week that Kyiv was working to preserve land routes for its grain exports amid a Russian blockade of the Black Sea, but that “political theatre” around grain imports was helping Moscow’s cause. Poland extended a ban last week on Ukrainian grainimports in a unilateral move thatbroke with a European Union ruling. The move has shaken Kyiv’s relationship with Warsaw, which has been seen as one of its staunchest allies since Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year. “I … want to tell President Zelenskyy never to insult Poles again, as he did recently during his speech at the UN,” Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told an election rally on Friday, according to the State-run news agency PAP.    Earlier on Friday, Poland’s President Andrzej Duda said the dispute between Poland and Ukraine over grain imports would not significantly affect good bilateral relations,in an apparent move to ease tensions. “I have no doubt that the dispute over the supply of grain from Ukraine to the Polish market is an absolute fragment of the entire Polish-Ukrainian relations,” Duda told a business conference. “I don’t believe that it can have a significant impact on them, so we need to solve this matter between us.” Duda’s comment followed after Prime Minister Morawiecki was reported as saying that Poland would no longer send weapons to Ukraine amid the grain dispute. “We are no longer transferring weapons to Ukraine because we are now arming Poland with more modern weapons,” Morawiecki said on Wednesday, according to a local media report.    Poland is scheduled to hold parliamentary elections on October 15, and Morawiecki’s ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party has come in for criticism from the far right for what it says is the government’s subservient attitude to Kyiv. Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau said in an article by Politico that Poland wanted to see “a strong Ukrainian state emerge from this war with a vibrant economy”, and that Warsaw “will continue to back Ukraine’s efforts to join NATO and the EU”. However, speaking to reporters in New York, Rau said that while Poland had not changed its policy towards Ukraine, there had been a “radical change in Polish public opinion’s perception” of the countries’ relationship. Asked by the PAP news agency what it would take to improve this perception, Rau said repairing the atmosphere would require a “titanic” diplomatic effort. Slovakia, Poland and Hungaryimposed national restrictions on Ukrainian grain imports after the EU executive decided not to extend its ban on imports into those countries as well as fellow EU members Bulgaria and Romania.    The countries have argued that cheap Ukrainian agricultural goods – meant mainly to transit further west and to ports – get sold locally, harming their own farmers. Speaking in Canada on Friday, Zelenskyy did not mention the tension with Poland but said that when Ukraine lacked support, Russia was strengthened. “You help either Ukraine or Russia. There will be no mediators in this war. By weakening assistance to Ukraine, you will strengthen Russia,” Zelenskyy told reporters after a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. “And a powerful Russia and what to expect from it… I think history in books and witnesses has long since answered this question. If someone wants to take a risk, fine, weaken assistance to Ukrainians,” he said, according to a statement posted on theUkrainian president’s website. “To be frank and honest, freedom, democracy and human rights must be fought for,” he added. The Kremlin said on Friday that it was watching the situation between Kyiv and Warsaw closely, adding that tensions would inevitably grow between Kyiv and its European allies as the dispute over grain escalates. “We predict that these frictions between Warsaw and Kyiv will increase. Friction between Kyiv and other European capitals will also grow over time. This is inevitable,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. “We are, of course, watching this closely,” Peskov said, calling Kyiv and Warsaw “the main” centres of Russophobia.

Ukraine’s Zelenskyy blasts Russian ‘genocide’ before Canadian parliament,President Volodymyr Zelenskyy joins Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for a historic second parliamentary address.,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has issued a forceful rebuke to Russian “genocide” from the floor of Canada’s Parliament, as he continues to rally support for hiswar-torn country. “Moscow — now, as always — is bent on controlling Ukraine and makes use of all available means to do that, including genocide,” he told a packed House of Commons in Ottawa on Friday. “It is genocide, what Russian occupiers are doing to Ukraine,” he said. “And when we want to win, when we call on the world to support us, it is not just about an ordinary conflict. It is about saving [the] lives of millions of people.” Zelenskyy’s fiery speech, delivered in English, marks his latest appeal to world leaders as he completes awhirlwind tourof North America, which began earlier this week withan appearanceat the United Nations in New York. But the Ukrainian leader’s warm reception in Canada marked a stark contrast to what he experienced a day before, when he visited the US legislature in Washington, DC. There, Zelenskyy faced a Republican Party more vocal aboutcurtailing support for Ukraine, as the deadline to pass budget legislation looms, with just over a week remaining. The Ukrainian president’s request to speak before a joint session of the US Congress was also declined, with House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy telling reporters, “We just didn’t have the time.” In Canada, however, leaders gave the Ukrainian president the rare honour of delivering a second address before Parliament. He had previouslyspoken to the legislaturevia video in March 2022, just weeks after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of his country. Few other world leaders have had the opportunity to speak twice before Canada’s Parliament. They include such notable figures as South Africa’s Nelson Mandela, the UK’s Margaret Thatcher and US Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau introduced Zelenskyy on Friday with remarks that included a pledge forincreased aid to Ukraine. “Canada has provided nearly nine billion [Canadian] dollars in military, financial and humanitarian support to Ukraine since Putin began his war of aggression,” Trudeau said. “We are making a longer-term, multiyear commitment that provides predictable steady support to Ukraine. It will include 650 million [Canadian] dollars over three years for 50 armoured vehicles, including medical evacuation vehicles that will be built by Canadian workers in London, Ontario.” Trudeau also announced funding for mental health initiatives helmed by Ukraine’s First LadyOlena Zelenska, saying, “The toll of this war on the mental health and wellbeing of Ukrainians is immeasurable.” Zelenska was in the audience, along with Ukrainian Defence MinisterRustem Umerovand the family of a Canadian volunteer, Antony Ihnat, who was killed earlier this month during a Russian missile attack in Ukraine. While much of the focus was on Russian aggression, Trudeau took a swipe at China as well in his introductory remarks, mentioningits detentionandreleaseof two Canadian citizens:Michael KovrigandMichael Spavor. “There are countries that are bending or breaking the rules,” Trudeau said. “In this era of uncertainty and resurgent great-power competition, rules are what will protect us. And it’s not enough for them to be written down somewhere. We must advocate for them, stand up for them and live by them. History will judge us on how we defend democratic values.” He called Ukraine “the tip of the spear” in that fight. For his part, Zelenskyy began his speech by recognising a monument in Edmonton, Alberta, that honours the victims of the Holodomor, sometimes called the Ukrainian Famine of 1932. Canada recognises the Holodomoras a genocidedesigned “to systematically destroy the Ukrainian people’s aspirations for a free and independent Ukraine”. Erected in 1983, the Edmonton memorial was one of the first to commemorate the famine, even while Ukraine remained under Soviet rule. “At that time, Ukraine didn’t yet have memorials commemorating the victims of genocide of Ukrainians because Ukraine was under Moscow’s control back then,” Zelenskyy said. A lot has changed since that time, the Ukrainian president added, but not the violence perpetrated by Russia. “This Russian aggression must end with our victory,” he said. “So that Russia will never bring back genocide to Ukraine and will never, ever try to do so. Moscow must lose, once and for all.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/22/ukraines-zelenskyy-blasts-russian-genocide-before-canadian-parliament
"Ukrainian missile hits Russian navy headquarters in Crimea, one missing",Ukraine claims responsibility for attack leading to a huge fire and leaving at least one Russian serviceman missing.,"Ukraine struck the headquarters of Russia’s Black Sea Fleetin a missile attackthat left the main building in flames and a serviceman missing, according to military officials. The Russian Ministry of Defence initially said one service member was killed on Friday but then issued a statement saying he was missing following the attack in the port city of Sevastopol. The Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014 in a move largely considered illegal, has been a frequent target since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered afull-scale invasionof Ukraine almost 19 months ago. The Russian-installed governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhayev, said no one was injured outside of the burning headquarters building. The Ukrainian military claimed responsibility for the attack. “We promised that ‘there will be more,'” Lieutenant General Mykola Oleschuk, the air force commander, said in a social media post that thanked pilots and showed video of air sirens blazing and smoke rising from the building. Razvozhayev said on social media earlier Friday that missile fragments had fallen near a theatre and urged residents to stay clear of the site. “The headquarters of the fleet have been hit in an enemy missile attack,” Razvozhayev said. In a second post, he warned that another aerial attack could be imminent, urging residents of the city, which is home to more than 500,000 people, to remain indoors. “Attention everyone! Another attack is possible. Please do not go to the city centre. Do not leave buildings,” he said. “Everyone who is near the headquarters of the fleet – at the sound of the siren proceed to shelters,” Razvozhayev added. He said rescue workers were at the scene, adding, “Firefighters are taking all measures to eliminate the fire as soon as possible.” Later on Friday, the Moscow-appointed governor of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, said on Telegram that several cruise missiles had been intercepted over Crimea. “Over the territory of the Republic of Crimea, air defence has shot down cruise missiles,” he said, without specifying how many missiles were shot down.    Ukrainian and Russian attacks in and around the Black Sea have increased since Moscow withdrew from an accord that allowed safe passage to civilian cargo ships from three Ukrainian ports. Ukraine has urged its allies to provide its armed forces with long-range missiles so it can target positions deeper inside Russia-controlled territory. Western leaders have hesitated over concerns Ukraine could target Russian territory and thereby escalate the conflict. Both France and the United Kingdom, however, have supplied Kyiv’s forces with the weapons. As part of the increasingly frequent barrages on Crimea, Ukraine said earlier this week it had attacked a military airfield near the town of Saky. A source in Ukraine’s SBU security service said there were at least a dozen warplanes and Pantsir missile defence systems at the airfield when the attack took place. The airfield also housed a training centre for operators of drones that Russia has used to target Ukraine. The SBU source said that Ukraine had deployed a swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles that “overwhelmed Russian air defences” and then launched Neptune cruise missiles. Kyiv has also repeatedly targeted and hit – the only bridge that connects the peninsula to the Russian mainland, on several occasions leaving damage that took weeks to repair. The last significant attack in July affected the road section of the bridge, which can also accommodate rail traffic and has also been used to transport military equipment. Russian officials said on Friday that traffic across the bridge had been temporarily paused. Civilian maritime traffic was stopped earlier on Friday in Sevastopol, Russian-installed authorities said, without providing details. The Russian Defence Ministry said its forces had shot down one guided missile and two drones that had targeted the peninsula.

What we know about US Abrams tanks arriving in Ukraine ‘next week’,Long-awaited M1 Abrams tanks are to arrive in Ukraine next week and come at a crucial time for Kyiv’s forces.,"United States President Joe Biden has announced that the first US-made Abrams tanks will be delivered to Ukraine next week, a crucial delivery at a time when Ukrainian forces are engaged in brutal fighting on the front lines with Russia after months of a slow-moving counteroffensive. Biden made the announcement on Thursday after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Washington, DC, where the US unveiled a new $325m military aid package for Ukraine. “Next week, the first US Abrams tanks will be delivered in Ukraine,” Biden said at the White House, alongside Zelenskyy, who was making his second visit to the US since the Russian invasion in February 2022.

"China reiterates ceasefire, peace talks ‘only way’ to end Ukraine war","Vice President Han Zheng, a second-tier official, repeats familiar talking points in speech to 78th UNGA.","China has reiterated its position that a ceasefire and peace talks are the “only way” to end the war in Ukraine, which began with Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. “Cessation of hostilities and the resumption of peace talks is the only way to settle the Ukraine crisis,” Vice PresidentHan Zhengtold the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) at its annual meeting. China has tried to position itself as apeacemakerand neutral arbiter in the conflict, although it has refused to condemn Moscow over the invasion. In February, on the first anniversary of the war, it released aposition paperon how to bring about an end to the fighting, but the proposals received a lukewarm response in Moscow and Kyiv. China, one of five permanent members of the UN Security Council, wants to “continue playing a constructive role”, Han added. He did not elaborate. Visiting Moscow this week, China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov that China would uphold an independent and impartial position on Ukraine as it tried to find a political settlement to the issue. Beijing’s efforts at mediating a resolution to the conflict have made little progress amid scepticism about its professed neutrality given its deepening ties with Russia. Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Moscow in March, where he met Vladimir Putin and toasted a “new era” of cooperation, while Putin has accepted an invitation to visit China next month. Han, a second-tier official, also used his UNGA speech to reiterate China’s vision for analternative world orderfree from what it has long called “Western hegemony”.    Appealing to the world’s developing nations, he said China, the world’s second-biggest economy, considered itself part of the Global South. “As the largest developing country, China is a natural member of the Global South. It breathes the same breath with other developing countries and shares the same future with them,” Han said. He also said China supports those nations’ development path “in keeping with their national conditions”. The loosely defined term “Global South” has come up frequently at the UN this year and is usually used to refer to countries from Africa, Asia and Latin America. China has cast itself as a leader for the developing world, stepping up its claim with the launch more than a decade ago of Xi’sBelt and Road Initiativeto drive Chinese development, infrastructure and influence mainly in developing economies. China is the world’s second-largest economy after the United States with a GDP of $18 trillion. Xi was one of four leaders from the permanent members of the Security Council who did not attend this year’s meeting. French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Russia’s Putin also skipped the event, leaving US President Joe Biden the only leader of a permanent Security Council member to address the assembly.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/22/china-reiterates-ceasefire-peace-talks-only-way-to-end-ukraine-war

Zelenskyy culminates Washington visit with a White House pledge of $128m,"Zelenskyy’s appearance comes during tense negotiations over US budget legislation, with Republicans seeking steep cuts.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has made his second visit to Washington, DC, since Russian forces launched a full-scale invasion of his country. But unlike in his first trip to the United States Capitol, Zelenskyy faceda congress less inclinedto back the war effort with large aid packages, despite pledges from top Democrats to “stand behind” Ukraine. In brief public remarks before the White House Cabinet on Thursday, Zelenksyy struck a note of gratitude, calling his negotiations in Washington “productive” and “strong”. “Thank you for all these 575 days,” he said, referencing the length of time since Russia invaded in February 2022. “Thanks to the American people, all these days they are together with us, with Ukrainians, with ordinary people, all of us.” He also highlightednew military assistance, worth $128m, announced by US President Joe Biden on Thursday. “It has exactly what our soldiers need now,” he said, calling it a “very powerful package”. Biden, a Democrat, used his presidential “drawdown authority” to authorise the aid, as further funds for Ukraine prove to be a sticking point in the US Congress. “Today, I approved the next tranche of US security assistance to Ukraine, including more artillery, more ammunition, more anti-tank weapons,” he said. “And next week, the first US Abrams tanks will be delivered to Ukraine.” The Cabinet meeting culminates a whirlwind charm offensive from the Ukrainian president, who travelled to New York earlier this week torally supportamong world leaders atthe United Nations. But as Zelenskyy faced US lawmakers on Thursday, the stakes were particularly high. Since the full-scale Russian invasion began in 2022, the US has committed more money than any single country to aid Ukraine, with much of that support taking the form of military assistance. The US Congress itself has approved aid amounting to over $113bn. But the last time Congress voted on an aid package wasin December— andcontrol of the House of Representativeshas since switched hands, from Democrats to Republicans. Nevertheless, Biden has called on Congress to approvean additional $24bnfor Ukraine aid, a request that Republicans, particularly on the far right, have baulked at. Some have called instead to slash funding for Ukraine, in favour of domestic priorities and limited government spending. That perspective was on full display on Thursday, as Zelenskyy toured Capitol Hill. US media reported that House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy refused Zelenskyy’s request to address a joint session of Congress during his visit, as he hadlast December. And while the Ukrainian leader was meeting with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle,28 Republican Congress memberssigned and published a letter on Thursday opposing additional expenditures for Ukraine. The US Congress is facing a September 30 deadline to pass budget legislation or face a government shutdown. “The American people deserve to know what their money has gone to,” the 28 Republicans wrote. “How is the counteroffensive going? Are the Ukrainians any closer to victory than they were 6 months ago? What is our strategy, and what is the president’s exit plan?” They added it would be “an absurd abdication of congressional responsibility” to grant President Biden’s request for more aid without answers first. Al Jazeera correspondent Kimberly Halkett said the contrast in reception to Zelenskyy’s first wartime appearance in Washington, DC, last December was stark. “There is a lot more pushback on Capitol Hill than Volodymyr Zelenskyy is used to,” she said from outside the White House. “Initially, he had received a warm welcome, bipartisan support in terms of approvals for funding for Ukraine’s defence and standing ovations all around. But this time there have been questions about how that money will be spent, where the past money has gone, and even whether the US can afford it.” She warned that “war fatigue” among the US public would be an ongoing hurdle to Zelenskyy’s cause.    Still, Congressional Democrats rallied in support of Ukraine spending, echoing the party’s commitment to “stand behind” the war-torn country. “This is a struggle between Ukraine and Russia,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in hisweekly press briefingon Thursday. “But it is also a struggle on the global stage between democracy and autocracy, between freedom and tyranny, between truth and propaganda, between good and evil. And it’s important for us to stand behind Ukraine until victory is won.” Biden echoed those sentiments later at the White House Cabinet meeting. “The entire world has a stake in making sure that no nation, no aggressor, is allowed to take a neighbour’s territory by force. The American people will never waver in their commitment to those values,” he said. As Biden shook hands with Zelenskyy and prepared to leave the Cabinet meeting, a reporter shouted from the sidelines to ask whether the US Congress would ultimately pass the requested aid for Ukraine. Biden paused before responding. “I’m counting on the good judgement of the United States Congress,” he said. “There’s no alternative.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/21/zelenskyy-culminates-washington-visit-with-a-white-house-pledge-of-128m
What US lawmakers have said about Ukraine aid as Zelenskyy urges more,Ukrainian President Zelenskyy’s visit to Washington comes as Republican opposition to more US aid for Ukraine grows.,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is in the United States capital to meet US President Joe Biden, legislators, and defence officials in an effort to rally continued funding from Washington for the fight againstRussia’s invasion. The US has sent about $114bn in security and humanitarian aid to help Zelenskyy’s government since the beginning of theconflictin February 2022. Since then, lawmakers in the US Congress – where Democrats have a majority in the US Senate and Republicans have a hold on the House of Representatives – have maintained bipartisan support for assistance to Kyiv. But Zelenskyy’s visit on Thursday has come amid signs that the sands could be shifting, with some high-profile Republicans expressing growing scepticism over the steep price of continued US support for Ukraine’s defences. Other segments of the GOP haveoutright rejectedthe prospect of more aid and threatened to wield their influence to scuttle or slow-roll legislation that would be needed to approve additional funding. The issue has coalesced around a government spending bill that needs to be passed by the end of the month to avoid a federal government shutdown, with some Republicans opposing the White House’s push to attach $24bn more in aid to Ukraine to the legislation.    Here is what US legislators have recently said about more US aid to Ukraine: Reflecting the position of the Democratic Party and the White House, Schumer has decried efforts by some Republicans to pass a spending bill that does not include further aid to Ukraine. On Monday, he called the proposal “an insult to Ukraine and a gift to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin”. He decried the effort on social media as a “far-right screed”. Despite opposition within his party, McConnell has remained forceful in his support for aid to Ukraine. Instead, he has criticised Biden, a Democrat, for being too “timid” in rallying that support. “I sometimes get the sense that I speak more about Ukraine matters than the president does,” he told reporters on Wednesday. I was proud to welcome President@ZelenskyyUato the Capitol this morning and hear firsthand about the status of Ukraine’s counteroffensive. American support for Ukraine is not charity. It’s in our own direct interests – not least because degrading Russia helps to deter China.pic.twitter.com/u0W32MIRrw — Leader McConnell (@LeaderMcConnell)September 21, 2023  Paul has gone a step further than many of his colleagues, saying he would seek to slow-roll any government funding bill if it contains further funding for Ukraine. “Today I’m putting congressional leadership & [Biden] on notice that I will oppose any effort to hold the federal government hostage for Ukraine funding. I will not consent to expedited passage of any spending measure that provides any more US aid to Ukraine,” the US senator wrote on X, the website formerly known as Twitter. The stance means that the Senate would likely be unable to fast-track approval of a spending bill once it is approved by the US House of Representatives. While a bill with more aid to Ukraine would likely still pass in the Senate, the slowdown would bring legislators to the brink of a government shutdown, and increase leverage for opponents seeking to drop the Ukraine aid from the package. Today I'm putting congressional leadership &@POTUSon notice that I will oppose any effort to hold the federal government hostage for Ukraine funding. I will not consent to expedited passage of any spending measure that provides any more US aid to Ukraine.… — Rand Paul (@RandPaul)September 20, 2023  McCarthy, whoseparty controls the House, has also become increasingly tepid towards the prospect of more aid for Ukraine, a departure from his staunch support earlier in the year. Underscoring that softened position is McCarthy’s decision not to give Zelenskyy the opportunity to address the House during his visit to Capitol Hill, although the Ukrainian president is expected to meet some House legislators elsewhere during his visit. “Look, what Russia has done – invade – is wrong,” McCarthy told reporters on Tuesday. “We want to make sure that ends. I also have always said from the beginning, no matter what the issue is, I want accountability for whatever the hardworking taxpayers spend their money on, and I want a plan for victory.” He added he did not need to commit anything to Zelenskyy, and he had “questions” for the Ukrainian leader. “Where is the accountability on the money we already spent? What is the plan for victory? I think that’s what the American public wants to know.”    In advance of Zelenskyy’s visit, a group of 23 Republican legislators – including Senators JD Vance, Rand Paul, Mike Braun, Tommy Tuberville, Mike Lee, and Roger Marshall – said they would oppose approving further aid to Ukraine until several questions were answered. In a letter to the director of the Office of Management and Budget, they said the public has not been given a clear accounting of how US funding has been used in Ukraine. They also said they wanted more information about Ukraine’s long-term strategy, progress on its continuing counteroffensive against Russian forces, and what the Biden administration defines as “victory in Ukraine”. “It would be an absurd abdication of congressional responsibility to grant this request [for further Ukraine aid] without knowing the answers to these questions,” they wrote.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/21/what-us-lawmakers-have-said-about-ukraine-aid-as-zelenskyy-urges-more
Ukrainians aghast as Poland stops sending weapons to fight Russia,"Warsaw, one of Kyiv’s top allies since the Russian invasion began, took the surprise decision amid a row over Ukrainian grain.","Kyiv, Ukraine –“I can’t believe the friendship is over.” That is what Maryna Vasilevskaya, a Ukrainian woman of Polish origin, told Al Jazeera with a heavy sigh on Thursday after learning that Warsawhaltedarms supply to Kyiv – and may cut aid to a million Ukrainian refugees it hosts. Poland has supplied hundreds of Soviet-era tanks and 14 Mig-29 fighter jets to Ukraine in its time of need amid Russia’s invasion, served as a major transit hub for weapons from other Western nations, and provided its military bases for training Ukrainian servicemen. It has also spent billions of euros on other forms of aid from the construction of temporary houses for refugees to donating medical supplies and power generators. Vasilevskaya and her children were among the most vulnerable and desperate recipients of Poland’s aid – as well as its overwhelming, heart-melting moral support. Her paternal grandparents were ethnic Poles, and she spent four months in the eastern Polish city of Krakow with her daughters aged five and eight last year after fleeing the Russian onslaught. She returned to Kyiv in August because her husband Vladislav had a medical emergency and her eldest daughter Darya missed her schoolmates. But despite the latest tensions, Vasilevskaya says she remains “eternally grateful” to Polish authorities and public. She arrived in Krakow in mid-March 2022 on a slow overnight train jam-packed with crying children and frightened, disoriented grownups, but Poles welcomed them all like “dearest friends”. “They helped us any way they could with everything, absolutely everything, from food and clothes to lodging and healthcare,” the 34-year-old, who works in marketing, recalled with tears in her eyes. “I thought, ‘Oh my God,’ our dislike to each other is finally over.’” Poland once conquered huge swaths of Kyivan Rus, a medieval Eastern European confederation of principalities that spawned what is Ukraine, Belarus and Russia. It also was a conduit of Western influences from philosophy to visual arts, but its efforts to convert its Orthodox Christian subjects in what is now Ukraine to Roman Catholicism met resistance that partly paved the way to Moscow’s takeover. The fertile “black earth” of Ukraine was Poland’s breadbasket – and the continuing diplomatic spat is also grounded in grain. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Wednesday that Warsaw is “no longer transferring weapons to Ukraine because we are now arming Poland with more modern weapons”. His announcement followed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’sspeechat the United Nations General Assembly in which he accused Poland, Slovakia and Hungary of aiding Russia by banning the import of Ukrainian grain. Presently, the grain cannot be shipped across the Black Sea because Russia pulled out of a UN-brokered “grain deal” allowing safe passage of cargo ships. “It’s alarming to see how some in Europe play solidarity in a political theatre – making a thriller from the grain,” Zelenskyy, a former comedian and film actor, said. “They may seem to play their own role, but in fact, they are helping set the stage to a Moscow actor.” Kyiv complained to the World Trade Organization about Poland, Slovakia and Hungary, and embargoed the imports of Polish apples, cabbages, tomatoes and onions. The embargo became a final straw – it enraged Poland’s governing right-wing Law and Justice, which relies on the support of farmers and rural residents and is readying for the October 15 parliamentary elections. On Monday, Warsaw said it may also not extend support for Ukrainian refugees that includes work permits, free schooling and access to healthcare and other benefits. “These regulations will simply expire next year,” government spokesman Piotr Mullter said. The halt of Poland’s military aid is “sensitive”, said a top Ukrainian military expert. “This is all abnormal, it all waters [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s mill,” Lieutenant General Ihor Romanenko, the former deputy chief of Ukraine’s general staff of armed forces, told Al Jazeera. “In the nearest future, [Polish and Ukrainian] presidents have to meet and find points of understanding,” he said. Other analysts were less optimistic. “Polish elites are enraged, and this could become a freezing point of relations,” Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kushch told Al Jazeera. He believed that ties could only be mended after dismissals in the Ukrainian halls of power. Deputy Economy Minister Taras Kachka who introduced the embargo on Polish foodstuffs and his boss Yulia Sviridenko may be among those who have to be sacked, he said. Some Ukrainians viewed the spat as nothing but a temporary blunder. “Of course, they have to protect their farmers, just like we have to protect ours,” Volodymyr Sinitsa, a retired bus driver who grew up in a village in the central Ukrainian region of Cherkasy, told Al Jazeera. But some responded with indignation. “They’re revengeful; they always accuse us of genocide and other things we never did,” Konstantin Davydenko, a 22-year-old serviceman, told Al Jazeera. He referred to what Warsaw calls the “Volyn massacre” of civilians in Nazi Germany-occupied Poland. Warsaw has claimed the Ukrainian Insurgent Army that sided with Nazi Berlin to expel Russians from Ukraine killed up to 100,000 ethnic Poles and considers their massacre “genocide”. Ukraine, where UPA’s key leaders are lionised as war heroes and freedom fighters, has disagreed with the term and the number of victims. The massacre took place in the regions of Volyn and Galicia, which were annexed by Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin and are now part of western Ukraine. After World War II, ethnic Poles who remained there faced discrimination. One of them was former refugee Vasilevskaya’s great-grandfather Felix, who lost his job as chief doctor at a children’s hospital in the western city of Lviv. He was sentenced to 10 years in Siberian jails and survived only because he “helped fix career criminals” who provided him with food and support from prison guards, she said. When growing up, she occasionally heard an ethnic slur demeaning her Polish roots, but hoped that the help Poland provided to Ukrainians during the war would put an end to tensions. “I hoped our countries could overcome this darkness between us. I still do,” Vasilevskaya said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/21/ukrainians-aghast-as-poland-stops-sending-weapons-to-fight-russia
"Russian air attacks hit Ukraine cities from east to west, more than 20 hurt","Reports of attacks on Ukraine’s Cherkasy, Kyiv, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskiy, Rivne, Vinnytsia, Ivano-Frankivsk, Lviv regions.","More than 20 people have been injured inRussian missile attackson at least eight regionsin Ukraine, according to local officials, and two people were killed in shelling of a residential building in Kherson city. “Since the beginning of the current day, the Russian occupiers have launched a massive missile attack on the civilian infrastructure of a number of regions,” Ukraine’s General Staff said on Thursday morning. Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces Valery Zaluzhny said that 36 of 43 Russian cruise missiles launched overnight were intercepted and destroyed by Ukraine’s air defences. Seven people were reported injured in the capital, Kyiv, including a nine-year-old girl, the city’s Mayor Vitalii Klitschko said. Some residential and commercial buildings also suffered damaged. Missile debris fell in central Kyiv and non-residential buildings were damaged in the east of the city, causing a fire, he said. Russia launched more than 20 cruise missile against targets in Kyiv, said Sergiy Popko, head of the city’s military administration. “According to initial reports, cruise missiles of the X-101/555/55 type were launched from about 10 Tu-95MS strategic aircraft,” Popko said on the Telegram messaging app. “More than 20 enemy targets were destroyed by air defence forces…. As a result of the downing of the missiles, debris fell in several areas of the capital,” he said. Officials and local media also reported attacks in Ukraine’s Cherkasy, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskiy, Rivne, Vinnytsia, Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk regions. In the southern city of Kherson, two people were killed and five injured by Russian artillery shelling that hit a residential building, the regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. “We know of two dead civilians…they were inside the dormitory,” Prokudin said on Telegram. At least six blasts hit the Slobidskyi district of Kharkiv, damaging civilian infrastructure, regional Governor Oleh Syniehubov said. Two people were sent to hospitals, according to reports. Approximately 10 people were injured and at least one person was rescued from beneath rubble in the Cherkasy region, said Ihor Klymenko, Ukraine’s Minister of Internal Affairs. More than 20 people may still be buried under the rubble, the region’s Governor Ihor Taburets said. Rescue services were working to clear the debris, he said. An industrial zone was hit in the western Lviv region, damaging buildings and starting a fire but no information on casualties was immediately available, Klymenko said. Air attacks were also reported in Rivne city in the region of the same name, Governor Vitalii Koval said without providing details.

"Russia says 19 Ukrainian drones downed over Crimea, Black Sea, and regions",Russia’s Ministry of Defence did not release information regarding possible casualties or damage in the latest air raid.,"Russian aerial defence systems destroyed a wave of 19 Ukrainian drones that were launched overnight in attacks against targets in the Russia-annexed Crimean peninsula, the surrounding Black Sea and other regions of Russia. The Russian defence ministry said early on Thursday that it had“thwarted” the attacks by Ukraine’s aircraft-typeunmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). “In the night from 20th to 21st September, an attempt by the Kyiv regime to commit a terrorist attack with lethal drones on sites in the Russian Federation was intercepted,” the defence ministry said on the Telegram messaging app. “Air defence systems destroyed 19 Ukrainian UAVs over the Black Sea and the territory of the Republic of Crimea, and one each over the territories of Kursk, Belgorod and Oryol regions,” the ministry said. The Belgorod and Kursk regions of Russia border eastern Ukraine, while Oryol is closer to the capital, Moscow. The defence ministry provided no details on casualties or possible damage.    Kyiv has promised to recapture the Black Sea peninsula and Ukrainian forces have launchedaerial attacks with increasing frequency on targets in Crimea, which was seized and annexed by Russia in 2014. Russian naval targets in the Black Sea have also been hit, including attacks by surface seaborne drones launched by Kyiv. On Wednesday, the Ukrainian military said its forces hadsuccessfully struck a Russian Black Sea fleetcommand post near Sevastopol in Crimea. Ukrainian media reported that loud explosions were heard in Crimea, particularly in the area of the Belbek and Kacha military airfields. Both are located north of Sevastopol. Authorities in Crimea have downplayed the incident and said that Ukrainian attacks are being successfully repelled.    Oleg Kryuchkov, an adviser to the Russia-appointed governor of Crimea, Sergey Aksyonov, said on Telegram: “We are asking all Crimeans to remain calm. “If you hear the sounds of a drone flying by or air defence systems, move away from the windows … If you find the wreckage of a UAV shot down by air defence or landed by electronic warfare, please contact special services or hotlines.” Ukraine’s ability to launch long-range attacks against targets in Crimea, the Black Sea and Russia has been noted by military analysts as displaying Kyiv’s growing offensive sophistication. Phillips O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, saida recent attack by Ukraine on the Russian Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopoldemonstrated Kyiv’s ability to launch complex attacks using missiles and drones. “This kind of operation is one of the reasons I remain confident that Ukraine will win the war – they have the ability to execute complex operations at a much higher level than the Russians,”O’Brien saidearlier this week.

"Ukraine strikes Russian ships, state-of-the-art aerial defences in Crimea","Ukraine’s forces also capture two towns in the east as they flank Bakhmut city, erode Russian defences in the south.","Ukrainedestroyed state-of-the-art Russian air defences in Crimeaand captured two key towns near the eastern city of Bakhmut in the 82nd week of the war. Ukrainian forces may also have put three modern Russian warships out of action, demonstrating anincreasing ability to attack enemy assets at rangewhile maintaining the momentum of their territorial gains. Ukraine appears to have used naval drones to mount two separate attacks on Russian warships on September 14. Ukraine’s Strategic Command claimed it struck two of Russia’s Vasily Bykov Project 22160-class patrol ships causing unspecified damage. The Ukrainian government released videofootageof the Vasily Bykov, commissioned in 2018, firing at a surface drone as it apparently closes in for attack. Russia’s defence ministry said only that its Black Sea Fleet had “destroyed two unmanned semi-submersible boats… in the southwestern part of the Black Sea”, belonging to Ukraine. Separately, the Ukrainska Pravda news outlet reported that a naval drone had caused damage to the rear starboard hull of a Bora-class guided missile corvette, the Samum, near the entrance to Sevastopol port, forcing it to be towed for repairs “with a roll to starboard”. “For this attack, the SBU [Ukraine’s secret service] used an experimental model of a marine drone, which is capable of operating in a storm, hiding from detection behind high waves,” Ukrainska Pravda reported. “During the special operation, the height of the waves reached 1.5-2 metres,” the news outlet added.    Russia’s defence ministry saidthe Samum had successfully defended itselfand destroyed the “unmanned naval boat”, but photographs circulated online showed the Samum being towed by two tugboats. A day later, Ukraine reportedly attacked another Russian patrol boat, the Askold, with unknown results. Phillips O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, called the attack on the Samum “one of the most well executed and planned operations of this war so far”, adding, “Ukraine is not only holding its own in the seapower war – it is actually winning it”. Ukraine has been stepping up attacks on Russia’s Black Sea Fleet and its base in Crimea, at Sevastopol. On September 12, Ukraine launched missiles and drones to successfully hit the Russian landing ship, Minsk, and a Kilo-class submarine docked at Sevastopol for repairs. The war at sea has escalated since July 17. Ukraine used unmanned surface drones to damage the Kerch Bridge – the second time it succeeded in doing so – connecting Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula, which was annexed by Moscow in 2014, to the Russian mainland. Russia pulled out of a UN-backed agreement in July that had allowed Ukraine to export many thousands of tonnes of grain from its blockaded Black Sea ports. After pulling out of the deal, Russia warned that it would use its naval power to stop Black Sea exports by Ukraine.    Russia has since struckUkrainian ports and grain silos on the Danube riverin a clear effort to prevent exports across the river to Romania and onward through European overland. Ukraine has responded by intensifying long-distance attacks against Russia’s Black Sea Fleet and against Crimea. Ukraine destroyed a Russian state-of-the-art S-400 ‘Triumf’ air defence missile system in Crimea on August 23, and two days later used a drone swarm to attack the Russian 126th Guards Coastal Defence Brigade of the Black Sea Fleet near Perevalne in Crimea. On September 14, Ukraine destroyed another S-400 battery, near Yevpatoria, a western Crimean port. Russia said only that it had shot down 11 drones in Yevpatoria, but geolocated footage showed plumes of smoke in the area of the reported attack. A source with Kyiv’s secret service told Ukrainian Pravda that a combination of unmanned aerial drones and Neptune missiles were used in the attack, with the drones hitting the Russian air defence battery’s antennae and the missiles striking its launchers.    The combination ofaerial and surface drones with missiles, as used in Yevpatoria and Sevastopol, is becoming a hallmark of Ukrainian long-distance attacks which military analysts say points to evolving sophistication of strategy. According to reports, the attack on the S-400 missile defence system in Yevpatoria could leave Russia with just three S-400 batteries protecting the occupied Crimean peninsula. “If the Ukrainians can keep it up and continue to sink Russian shipping in Sevastopol, they could force the Black Sea Fleet to rebase to Russia, which would be a key step in their plan to seize back Crimea,” O’Brien said. Ukraine’s pushback against the Russian fleet appeared to be having results. Ukraine’s Infrastructure Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said five merchant vessels had docked in Ukrainian grain ports and departed with cargoes since August 15. Ukrainian officials say the attacks on the Russian navy will continue, and that the Black Sea Fleet is already keeping its ships constantly on the move between Crimea and Russian naval bases due to fear of attack. Ukrainian forces captured the town of Andriivka, five kilometres south of Bakhmut, on September 14, Ukraine’s general staff said. Ukraine’s 3rd Separate Assault Brigade said that it conducted “a lightning operation” which surrounded the Russian garrison at Andriivka, cut it off from the main force, and in two days destroyed “almost all the infantry of the 72nd [Separate Motorised Rifle] Brigade, together with officers and a significant amount of equipment”. Since the Russian capture of Bakhmut in late May, Ukraine has been slowly flanking the city to the north and south. Three days after the recapture of Andriivka, Ukrainian troops hoisted their flag over the neighbouring town of Klishchiivka, also south of Bakhmut.    Ukrainian ground forces commander Oleksandr Syrskyi saidthe liberation of Andriivka and Klishchiivkahas also destroyed the combat capabilities of two elite airborne Russian formations, the 31st Guards VDV Brigade, and the 83rd Guards VDV Brigade. Geolocated footage showed that Ukrainian troops were also advancing near Rozdolivka, northwest of Bakhmut. “The liberation of Klishchiivka, as well as continued Ukrainian tactical gains northwest of Bakhmut, are tactical gains of strategic significance because they are allowing Ukrainian forces to fix a considerable portion of Russian airborne [VDV] elements in the Bakhmut area,” Washington, DC-based think tank, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), said. The ISW believes that the military resources Russia has thrown into holding Bakhmut for reasons of political prestige have enabled Ukraine to poke holes in well-prepared Russian defences on the southern front lines, particularly western Zaporizhia. There, Ukrainian forces were advancing west of Robotyne on September 16, a town they captured in late August, and west of Verbove, a town they are now focused on. In this sector, Ukrainian and Western officials agree that Ukrainian troops have penetrated the first Russian defensive layer and are now attacking the second layer of Russia’s front line. If they manage to break through Russian defences here, Ukrainian troops could in theory pour behind Russian positions.

Zelenskyy says UN Security Council ‘ineffective’ due to Russian veto,Ukraine’s Zelenskyy tells special Security Council meeting that the only way to lasting peace is the full withdrawal of Russian troops.,"In Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’sfirst in-person appearance at a UN Security Councilmeeting on Moscow’s invasion of his country, he told a special meeting that the Russian veto has rendered the world body “ineffective”. Zelenskyy said that the United Nations was at a dead end regarding aggressions and suggested Russia be stripped of its veto right as one of five permanent members of the post-World War II Security Council as punishment for attacking Ukraine. “Everyone in the world can see what exactly makes the UN ineffective. In this seat in the Security Council, which Russia occupies illegally due to behind-the-scenes manipulations after the collapse of the Soviet Union, sit liars whose job it is to justify the aggression and genocide committed by Russia,” he said. “The veto in the hands of the aggressor is what drove the UN into a dead end. No matter who you are, the existing UN system still makes you less than the veto power that only a few have and that is used by one – Russia – to the detriment of all other UN members,” he said. “Many years of talks and projects on reforming the UN should become a process of reforming the UN. The use of the veto is what needs reform, and this could be a key reform,” he noted. He added that the only way to a lasting peace was a full withdrawal of Russian troops and restoration of Kyiv’s control over its territory within the 1991 borders following the fall of the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, Russian forces on Wednesday shelled the city of Toretsk in eastern Ukraine, killing four people, the Ukrainian General Prosecutor’s Office has said. Zelenskyy’s visit to the United Nations coincided with a pivotal moment for Ukraine’s military campaign to eject Russian forces from Ukraine.    Public enthusiasm for the war effort is waning in many NATO countries, Ukraine’s summer counteroffensive has hit stubborn Russian defenses and soon colder, wetter weather will make many rural roads impassable for heavy vehicles. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the council on Wednesday that Russia’s war in Ukraine “is aggravating geopolitical tensions and divisions, threatening regional stability, increasing the nuclear threat, and creating deep fissures in our increasingly multipolar world”. Before the meeting started, Russia’s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia objected to Zelenskyy addressing the council, which is chaired by Albania for September, before the 15 members. “I want to assure our Russian colleagues and everyone here that this is not a special operation by the Albanian presidency,” Albania’s Prime Minister Edi Rama told Nebenzia. “There is a solution for this. If you agree, you stop the war and President Zelenskyy will not take the floor.” Russia has said it is carrying out a “special military operation” in Ukraine because that country’s ambitions to integrate with the West – including NATO – pose a threat to Russia’s national security. On Thursday, Zelenskyy heads to Washington to meet with US President Joe Biden, members of Congress and military officials to urge continued support for his country’s war effort. While a majority in Congress still support supplying military aid to Ukraine, sceptical voices among Republicans are growing louder as the war’s cost rises. Biden plans to announce a new military aid package during Zelenskyy’s visit. In a speech to the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, Biden appealed to world leaders to stand with Ukraine against Russia, saying only Moscow has the power to end the war.

"Ukraine oil refinery fire sparked by drone attack, Russia downs four UAVs","A refinery hit in Ukraine’s Poltava region as Kyiv and Moscow trade drone attacks, four UAVs shot down over western Russia.","Ukraine and Russia launched waves of drone attacks overnight with reports of a fire at an oil refinery in Ukraine’s Poltava region and four Ukrainian unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) being shot down over two regions in Russia’s west, officials say. A Russian dronehit the Kremenchuk oil refineryin the central Poltava region of Ukraine, causing a fire, the regional governor, Dmytro Lunin, said on Wednesday. “Last night, Russians repeatedly attacked Poltava region. Our air defence system did a good job against enemy UAVs,” he said on the Telegram messaging app. The General Staff of Ukraine’s Armed Forces said air defence systems shot down 17 of 24 drones that Russia launched against targets in Ukraine. The Kremenchuk refinery has come under repeated Russian air raids since Moscow launched its invasion last year. Meanwhile, Russian authorities reported on Wednesday that their air defences intercepted four Ukrainian drones.    The Ukrainian drones were shot down overRussia’s Belgorod region which borders Ukraineand the Oryol region, which is closer to Moscow, the Russian Ministry of Defence said, with local officials reporting no damage or casualties. The aircraft-type drones were shot down between 9pm (18:00 GMT on Tuesday) and 11:45pm (20:45 GMT), the ministry said on Telegram. A drone attack was also suspected in a fire involving a large fuel storage tank early on Wednesday morning near an airport in the Russian Black Sea beach resort of Sochi. Veniamin Kondratyev, governor of the Krasnodar region, said preliminary information indicated that there were no casualties. “The reasons for the incident are being investigated,” Kondratyev said on Telegram.    A Russian-language online news portal reported that a drone could have been involved in the fire that engulfed the 1,200 tonnes of fuel, noting that a loud explosion was heard before the fuel tank erupted in flames.

Ukraine calls for return of ‘abducted’ children as more arrive in Belarus,"Ukraine says more than 19,000 children have been taken illegally by Russia since it began its full-scale invasion.","Ukraine’s first lady Olena Zelenska has called on world leaders to help ensure the return of thousands of Ukrainian children forcibly taken by Russia as Belarusian state media published photos of dozens of Ukrainian children arriving in Belarus from Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine. Speaking on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), Zelenska said more than 19,000 Ukrainian children had beenforcibly transferred or deportedto Russia or the territories it has occupied. So far, only386have beenbrought home. In Russia, “they were told that their parents don’t need them, that their country doesn’t need them, that nobody is waiting for them,” Zelenska said. “The abducted children were told that they are no longer Ukrainian children, that they are Russian children.” Her call came as Belta, Belarus’s state-run news agency, reported 48 children from the Donetsk, Luhansk and Zaporizhia regions arrived in the country, a close Russian ally, for a “three week holiday” on Tuesday. The children were shown getting off a train carrying backpacks and suitcases, mostly looking solemn. Belta said the initiative was organised by a Belarusian charity backed by President Alexander Lukashenko, who has previously called the state-funded removals a “recuperation” programme. “The president, despite external pressure, said this important humanitarian project should continue,” Alexei Talai, the charity’s head, was quoted as saying by the news agency. “All the Belarusian people,” he said, want to help “children from dilapidated cities and towns in the new territories of Russia.”    In March, the International Criminal Court issuedarrest warrantsfor Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russia’s children’s rights commissioner, Maria Lvova-Belova. The judges in The Hague said they found “reasonable grounds to believe” the two were responsible for war crimes, including theillegal deportation and transfer of childrenfrom occupied parts of Ukraine to Russia. In June, Belarusian opposition figures gave the ICC materials, which they said showed more than 2,100 Ukrainian children from at least 15 Russian-occupied Ukrainian cities had been forcibly transferred to Belarus with Lukashenko’s approval. Ukraine says the children are being indoctrinated and deprived of their national identity, which President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described as a genocide in his speech to the UNGA on Tuesday. “Those children in Russia are taught to hate Ukraine, and all ties with their families are broken,” Zelenskyy told the General Assembly. “This is clearly a genocide.” Russia denies the allegations, saying instead it has saved Ukrainian children from the horrors of the war. More than 500 children have been killed in Ukraine since Russia began its full-scale invasion of its neighbour some 19 months ago, and hundreds of others have been injured. Ukrainian authorities are also investigating more than 230 cases of sexual violence by Russian soldiers against civilians, including 13 children, according to Zelenska. She said the child victims include 12 girls and one boy, with the youngest victim only four years old at the time of the alleged crime. “I am turning to the UN secretary-general and the entire organisation to help us save Ukrainian children,” Zelenska pleaded. “Help us receive information on the children taken to Russia… Help us take children out of occupied territories through special safe corridors. Our children need justice.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/20/ukraine-calls-for-return-of-abducted-children-as-more-arrive-in-belarus
Full text: Zelenskyy’s speech to the UN General Assembly,The Ukrainian president used his 15 minute slot to warn UN members of the dangers of not standing up to aggression.,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy travelled to New York toaddressthe United Nations General Assembly in person for the first time since Moscow began its full-scale invasion of his country in February 2022. Dressed in his trademark khaki green shirt, heurged member statesto come together to oppose Russian aggression and stressed the need for a peace recognising Ukraine’s territorial integrity. Here is the full text of Zelenskyy’s speech from September 19. I welcome all who stand for common efforts! And I promise – being really united we can guarantee fair peace for all nations. What’s more, unity can prevent wars. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Secretary General! Fellow leaders! This hall saw many wars but not as active defender against the aggressions. In many cases, the fear of war, the final war, was the loudest here – the war after which no one would gather in the General Assembly Hall again. The Third World War was seen as a nuclear war. A conflict between states on the highway to nukes. Other wars seemed less scary compared to a threat of the so-called “great powers” firing their nuclear stockpiles. So, the 20th century taught the world to restrain from the use of the weapons of mass destruction – not to deploy, not to proliferate, not to threaten with, and not to test, but to promote a complete nuclear disarmament. Frankly, this is a good strategy. But it should not be the only strategy to protect the world from this final war. Ukraine gave up its third-largest nuclear arsenal. The world then decided Russia should become a keeper of such power. Yet, history shows it was Russia who deserved nuclear disarmament the most, back in 1990s. And Russia deserves it now – terrorists have no right to hold nuclear weapons. But truly not the nukes are the scariest now. While nukes remain in place, the mass destruction is gaining its momentum. The aggressor is weaponising many other things and those things are used not only against our country but against all of yours as well. Fellow leaders! There are many conventions that restrict weapons but there are no real restrictions on weaponisation. First, let me give you an example – the food. Since the start of thefull-scale war, the Ukrainian ports in the Black and Azov Seas have been blocked by Russia. Until now, our ports on the Danube River remain the target for missiles and drones. And it is a clear Russia’s attempt to weaponise the food shortage on the global market in exchange for recognition for some, if not all, of the captured territories. Russia is launching the food prices as weapons. The impact spans from the Atlantic coast of Africa to the Southeast Asia. This is the threat scale. I would like to thank those leaders who supported ourBlack Sea Grain Initiative, and program “Grain from Ukraine”. United, we made weapons turn back into food again. More than 45 nations saw how important it is to make Ukrainian food products available on the market… from Algeria and Spain to Indonesia and China. Even now whenRussia has underminedthe Black Sea Grain Initiative, we are working to ensure food stability. And I hope that many of you will join us in these efforts. We launched a temporary sea export corridor from our ports. And we are working hard to preserve the land routes for grain exports. And it is alarming to see how some in Europe play out solidarity in a political theatre – making thriller from the grain. They may seem to play their own role but in fact, they are helping set the stage to a Moscow actor.    Second, weaponisation of energy. Many times, the world has witnessed Russia using energy as a weapon. Kremlin weaponised oil and gas to weaken the leaders of other countries. Now the threat is even greater. Russia is weaponising nuclear energy. Not only it is spreading its unreliable nuclear-power-plant-construction-technologies, but it is also turning other countries’ power plants into real dirty bombs. Look what Russia did to ourZaporizhzhia power plant– shelled it, occupied it and now blackmails others with radiation leaks. Is there any sense to reduce nuclear weapons when Russia is weaponising nuclear power plants? Scary question. The global security architecture offers no response or protection against such a treacherous radiation threat… And there is no accountability for radiation blackmailers so far. The third example is children. Unfortunately, various terrorist groups abduct children to put pressure on their families and societies. But never before the mass kidnapping and deportation would become a part of the government policy. Not until now. We know the names of tens of thousands of children and have evidence on hundreds of thousands of otherskidnapped by Russiain the occupied territories of Ukraine and later deported. The International Criminal Court issuedarrest warrant for Putinfor this crime. We are trying to get children back home but time goes by. What will happen to them? Those children in Russia are taught to hate Ukraine, and all ties with their families are broken… This is clearly a genocide. When hatred is weaponised against one nation, it never stops there. Each decade Russia starts a new war. Parts of Moldova andGeorgiaremain occupied. Russia turned Syria into ruins. And if not Russia, the chemical weapons would have never been used there in Syria. Russia has almost swallowed Belarus. It is obviously threatening Kazakhstan and the Baltic states… And the goal of the present war against Ukraine is to turn our land, our people, our resources into a weapon against you – against the international rules-based order. Many seats in the General Assembly Hall may become empty if Russia succeeds with its treachery and aggression.    Ladies and gentlemen! The aggressor scatters death and brings ruins even without nukes but the outcomes are alike. We see towns and villages in Ukraine wiped out by Russian artillery. Levelled to the ground completely! We see the war of drones. We know the possible effects of spreading the war into the cyberspace. The artificial intelligence could be trained to combat well – before it would learn to help the humanity. Thank God, people have not yet learned to use climate as a weapon. Even though humanity is failing on its climate policy objectives – this means that extreme weather will still impact the normal global life and some evil state will also weaponise its outcomes. And when people in the streets of New York and other cities of the world went out on climate protest – we all have seen them… And when people in Morocco andLibyaand other countries die as a result of natural disasters… And when islands and countries disappear under water… And when tornados and deserts are spreading into new territories… And when all of this is happening, one unnatural disaster in Moscow decided to launch a big war and kill tens of thousands of people. We must act united – to defeat the aggressor and focus all our capabilities and energy on addressing these challenges. As nukes are restrained, likewise the aggressor must be restrained and all its tools and methods of war. Each war now can become final, but it takes our unity to make sure that aggression will NOT break in again. And it is not a dialogue between the so-called “great powers” somewhere behind the closed doors that can guarantee us all the new no-wars-era, but open work of all nations for peace. Last year, I presented the outlines of the Ukrainian peace formula at the UN General Assembly. Later in Indonesia, I presented thefull Formula. And over the past year, the Peace Formula became the basis to update the existing security architecture – now we can bring back to life the UN Charter and guarantee the full power of the rules-based world order. Tomorrow, I will present the details at a special meeting of the UN Security Council. The main thing is that it is not only about Ukraine. More than 140 states and international organisations have supported the Ukrainian Peace Formula fully or in part. The Ukrainian Peace Formula is becoming global. Its points offer solutions and steps that will stop all forms of weaponisation that Russia used against Ukraine and other countries and may be used by other aggressors.    Look – for the first time in modern history, we have the chance to end the aggression on the terms of the nation which was attacked. This is a real chance for every nation – to ensure that aggression against your state, if it happens, God forbid, will end not because your land will be divided and you will be forced to submit to military or political pressure, but because your territory and sovereignty will be fully restored. We launched the format of meetings between national security advisers and diplomatic representatives. Important talks and consultations were held in Hiroshima, in Copenhagen, and in Jeddah on the implementation of the Peace Formula. And we are preparing a Global Peace Summit. I invite all of you – all of you who do not tolerate any aggression – to jointly prepare the Summit. I am aware of the attempts to make some shady dealings behind the scenes. Evil cannot be trusted – askPrigozhin[the former head of the mercenary Wagner group] if one bets on Putin’s promises. Please, hear me. Let unity decide everything openly. While Russia is pushing the world to the final war, Ukraine is doing everything to ensure that after Russian aggression, no one in the world will dare to attack any nation. Weaponisation must be restrained. War crimes must be punished. Deported people must come back home. And the occupier must return to their own land. We must be united to make it. Слава Україні!

Speaking from the UN headquarters in New York for the first time since the conflict broke out last year, Zelenskyy on Tuesday portrayed the Russian invasion of Ukraine as an existential threat to the global order akin to nuclear weapons. “We must act united to defeat the aggressor and focus all our capabilities and energy on addressing these challenges,” he said in English. “It takes our unity to make sure that [such] aggression will not [happen] again.” Zelenskyy criticised Moscow for what he said was an “attempt to weaponise [a] food shortage on [the] global market in exchange for recognition of some, if not all, of captured territories”. He also accused Russia of committing genocide by kidnapping Ukrainian children and said Kyiv was working on preparing a global peace summit. The war in Ukrainehas figured prominentlyon the first day of the high-level UN General Debate, with several world leaders pledging continued support for Kyiv during the most widely watched event of the UN’s annual calendar.    The United States and its allies have provided billions of dollars worth of humanitarian and security aid for Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022. At the UNGA on Tuesday morning, US President Joe Biden – who will meet Zelenskyy later this week at the White House – told other leaders that “Russia believes that the world will grow weary and allow it to brutalise Ukraine without consequence.” “If we allow Ukraine to be carved up, is the independence of any nation secure?” Biden asked during his UNGA speech, drawing applause when he said the US and its allies would stand with Ukraine in its fight. “Russia alone bears responsibility for this war,” he said. “Russia alone has the power to end this war immediately.” Biden’s address at the annual gathering was the centrepiece event of his three-day visit to New York, which will include meetings with the heads of five Central Asian nations, and the leaders of Israel and Brazil. The Democratic president has made rallying US allies to support Ukraine a leading component of his administration’s foreign policy amid criticism from some Republican legislators over the breadth and cost of that assistance to Kyiv.    More than 140 heads of state and government ministers are taking part inthis week’s 78th session of the UNGA, which offers a chance for countries to present issues of particular concern in a series of live public speeches. In-person attendance has steadily recovered since the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced leaders three years ago to send in prerecorded video messages due to safety precautions. The UN is composed of 193 member states. Al Jazeera’s Mike Hanna, reporting from the UN on Tuesday afternoon, said Zelenskyy used his UNGA speech to make it “very clear” that Ukraine needs support. However, Hanna said the address was unlikely to change the views of nations that have remained neutral. “Among some members of the Global South, as well, there’s been public discontent about the amount of time the UN spends on the Ukraine issue at the expense, they believe, of the problems facing the Global South in particular,” he added. Zelenskyy is also expected to speak at a UN Security Council meeting on Ukraine on Wednesday, which could place him at the same table as Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. The Ukrainian leader will then travel to Washington, DC, on Thursday to meet with Biden. He will also visit the US Capitol, where lawmakers face a September 30 deadline to pass a federal spending bill that will include further aid to his war-torn country.    US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivantold reporters last weekthat he believed Zelenskyy was “looking forward” to visiting congressional leaders “to make the case” for continued US support for Ukraine. Meanwhile, in an interview with the Reuters news agency on the sidelines of the UNGA, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Tuesday that Ukraine urgently needs air defences, including ammunition and spare parts. Stoltenberg said the conflict was a “war of attrition” but not a stalemate, given the gains Ukraine has made witha counteroffensiveit began in June to try to reclaim territory occupied by Russian forces. “If we want an end to the war, if we want a just and lasting peace, then military support to Ukraine is the right way,” the NATO chief said. “Ukraine needs many different types of support.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/19/zelenskyy-urges-global-unity-against-russia-in-un-general-assembly-speech
Russia launches air attacks against Ukraine’s western Lviv city,Lviv’s mayor says one person was reported injured so far and a warehouse damaged in the early morning aerial attacks by Russia.,"The western Ukrainian city of Lviv was rocked by early morning explosions as air defences engaged in stopping waves of Russian air attacks, local officials said. The city’s mayor, Andriy Sadoviy, wrote on the Telegram messaging app early on Tuesday that “air defences are operating in our region”, and warned residents to seek shelter. Ukraine’s Air Force wrote on Telegram that “the threat of Shahed [Iranian-made drones] remains in the Lviv region. Air defences are operating”. WesternUkraine came under an air raid alertstarting at about 00:00 GMT. According to reports, several waves of drones attempted to hit targets in Lviv city starting at about 01:30 GMT with numerous explosions heard as air defences intercepted the incoming unmanned aerial vehicles. Sadoviy later reported that a fire at an industrial warehouse had broken out and emergency services were tackling the blaze. Initial reports were of one person injured, he said. “So far, only one person has been injured in the attack,” the mayor said on Telegram, adding that a man in his mid-20s was found under the rubble of a warehouse and transported to hospital. The scale of the attack and full extent of the damage were not immediately known. There was no immediate comment from Russia. The head of the Lviv region’s military administration, Maksym Kozytskyi, said that two people, a man and a woman, were rescued from beneath rubble in the city. “The woman is initially believed to have no injuries. The man is in a serious condition,” he said, adding that the city received the all-clear from air raids at 03:00 GMT. Though far from the front lines of fighting in the east and south of Ukraine, Lviv has come under deadly Russian missile and drone attacks that have targeted civilian infrastructure and residential buildings leading to considerable damage and loss of life among city residents.

Ukraine’s army commander claims 3 elite Russian brigades ‘crushed’ in east,Ukraine’s ground forces commander General Oleksandr Syrskyi claims three Russian brigades left with no combat capabilities after fighting in east around Bakhmut.,"The general in command of Ukrainian ground forces said his troops have routed three of the best Russian brigades fighting on the front lines in the eastern Donetsk region of Ukraine. General Oleksandr Syrskyi also said on Monday that the recapture of two eastern Ukrainian villages in recent days –Klishchiivka and Andriivka, both of which are located on higher ground near the destroyed town of Bakhmut – was an important breakthrough. “In the fighting in the Bakhmut section, some of the enemy’s best units have been crushed and have completely lost their combat power,” Syrskyi said in a statement. The Russian units in question were the 72nd Motor Rifle Brigade as well as the 31st and 83rd Air Assault Brigades. Hailing the recapture of Klishchiivka and Andriivka, Syrskyi said Ukrainian forces were continuing their advance and had some success piercing Russian defence lines, though Moscow’s forces were counterattacking from multiple directions in a bid to regain their lost positions. “These settlements, at first glance small, were important elements in the enemy’sdefensive line which stretched from Bakhmutto Horlivka,” Syrskyi said on the Telegram messaging app, referring to a town about 40km (25 miles) from Bakhmut. “As a result of our troops’ successful actions, the enemy’s defensive line – which it tried to close by throwing all available reserves into battle – was breached,” he said. ⚡️Commander: Ukrainian forces breach Russian defensive line near Bakhmut. Ukrainian troops have broken through one of the Russian defensive lines near Donetsk Oblast’s Bakhmut, Land Forces Commander Oleksandr Syrskyi reported on Sept. 18.https://t.co/JFn2GCcE0i — The Kyiv Independent (@KyivIndependent)September 18, 2023   Ukrainian military spokesperson Ilia Yevlash also underlined the tactical importance of Klishchiivka, saying in televised comments that its recapture exposed the southern flank of Bakhmut and was “a favourable springboard for further progress”. Russian forces captured the town of Bakhmut in May but Ukrainian forces continued to fight in fierce urban warfare that became one of the bloodiest and longest battles since Russia invaded last year. Russia denied on Saturday that it hadlost control of Andriivkaand the latest Ukrainian claims of battlefield gains against Russian forces could not be independently verified.    Washington, DC-based think tank The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said on Monday that Ukraine’s advances south of Bakhmut and claims of destroying the combat capabilities of the three Russian brigades could indicate significant losses for Moscow. “These VDV [Russian airborne] elements were involved in counterattacking and attempting to roll back Ukrainian advances around Bakhmut… and likely suffered heavy losses,” the ISW said. The ISW also said that Russian forces south of Bakhmut were “likely battle-weary from recent efforts to hold” Klishchiivka and Andriivka. 3/ Russian forces south of#Bakhmutare also likely battle-weary from recent efforts to hold#Klishchiivkaand#Andriivka… — ISW (@TheStudyofWar)September 19, 2023  Ukraine has now regained approximately 50sq kms (more than 19sq miles) of land around Bakhmut since the start of its long-anticipated counteroffensive in June, the slow progress of which has been criticised by some of Kyiv’s Western backers. Ukraine officials have acknowledged the slow pace of their advance but have pointed to the strength of Russian defences, including trenches and huge minefields, which Moscow had months to prepare while Kyiv was waiting on the delivery of promised tanks from Western allies.     Ukraine’s Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar, who was one of six deputy defence ministers removed on Monday as part of a reshuffle under the new defence minister, said earlier that Ukrainian forces had retaken 51sq km (19sq miles) near Bakhmut and more than 260sq km (100sq miles) of land in the south of the country during the counteroffensive.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/19/ukraines-army-commander-claims-3-elite-russian-brigades-crushed-in-east

China’s foreign minister holds talks with Russia’s Lavrov in Moscow,Wang Yi and Sergey Lavrov say they share a commitment to a ‘multipolar world’ in their discussion in Moscow.,"China’s foreign minister has held talks with his Russian counterpart in Moscow as the two countries inch closer amid fraying ties with the West over the Ukraine war and the militarisation of the Pacific. Wang Yi opened his talks with Sergey Lavrov by hailing “strategic cooperation” between the two countries and their shared commitment to a “multipolar world” and a “more just world order”. “China and Russia, as leading global powers and permanent members of the UN Security Council, bear special responsibility for maintaining global strategic stability and global development,” Wang said. The Moscow trip comes days afterWang held talkswith United States President Joe Biden’s National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan in Malta. Sino-US ties have deteriorated in recent years over issues ranging from trade to the Chinese military threat to Taiwan. China’s top diplomat, who will be in Russia until Thursday, plans to hold strategic security consultations with officials there, the Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, emphasised “the importance of Russian-Chinese cooperation for ensuring justice in world affairs, for ensuring a balance of interests in the processes that are developing in a variety of directions”. He noted that Russia and China will coordinate their efforts during this week’s United Nations General Assembly and other international forums. Meanwhile, Wang stressed that Russia-China cooperation “isn’t directed against anyone and isn’t influenced by any other countries”. Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin have promised to strengthen bilateral ties as Beijing has faced criticism from the West for not condemning Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. China has refrained from taking sides in the conflict, saying that while a country’s territory must be respected, the West needs to consider Russia’s security concerns about NATO expansion. It has accused the US of prolonging the fighting by providing arms to Ukraine, weaponry the US says Kyiv needs to fight back against Russia. China and the US have been making efforts to reduce tension, and Beijing and Washington described the talks between Wang and Sullivan, which went on for 12 hours, as “candid, substantive and constructive”. The relationship between the two countries,global and regional security issues, the Ukraine war and the Taiwan Strait were among the topics of discussion, the White House said in a statement, adding that it was eager to maintain open lines of communication with China to better manage the relationship. Similar issues were discussed on Monday between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and China’s Vice President Han Zheng. “The world expects us to responsibly manage our relationship,” Blinken said in brief remarks at the beginning of his meeting with Han. “The United States is committed to doing just that. “From the perspective of the United States, face-to-face diplomacy is the best way to deal with areas where we disagree, and also the best way to explore areas of cooperation between us.” The talks between Wang and Sullivan were also aimed at laying the groundwork for a meeting between Biden and Xi later this year. Ryan Hass, a China expert at the Brookings Institution, said the pace of high-level exchanges between Washington and Beijing suggested that efforts were “purposeful” and not just part of relationship management. “I expect both sides are working to set the stage for a productive meeting between both leaders in November,” Hass said. Wang’s trip to Moscow also comes a day after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un left Russia following a six-day visit that included talks with President Vladimir Putin at a far eastern spaceport, visits to aircraft plants andinspections of nuclear-capable strategic bombersas well as an advanced warship. Kim’s trip fuelled Western concerns about an arms alliance that could boost Russia’s arsenal for fighting in Ukraine.

Russia says it has ‘nothing’ to reveal on Ramzan Kadyrov health rumours,Talk of the Chechen leader’s health grows on social media after unconfirmed reports say he is in a coma.,"Russia says it has no information on the health of Ramzan Kadyrov after reports suggested the Chechen leader was sick. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday: “We have no information on this.” “In any case, the presidential administration can hardly give out health certificates, so we have nothing to tell you here.” Peskov made the remarks after unconfirmed reports on social media said Kadyrov was in a coma. After the rumours began to spread, two videos were released on Sunday of Kadyrov at an unidentified location. In the first, he is seen smiling while on a stroll. In the second, he recommends people play sports. He is heard speaking Chechen and Russian. “I strongly recommend that everyone who cannot distinguish the truth from lies on the internet go for a walk, get some fresh air and put their thoughts in order,” the video’s captions said. “The rain can be wonderfully invigorating”. Рамзан Кадыров призвал «прогуляться на свежем воздухе» тех, кто поверил фейкам о его тяжелой болезни «Советую всем, кто в интернете не может отличить правду от лжи… привести мысли в порядок… Дождь прекрасно бодрит», — отметил глава Чечни.pic.twitter.com/hDjAENHGXw — Газета.Ru (@GazetaRu)September 17, 2023  It was impossible to immediately establish when the videos were recorded. Speculation grew about Kadyrov’s health after a report from the Ukrainian news outlet Obozrevatel on Friday cited a spokesperson from the security service saying Kadyrov was in “serious condition. His existing diseases have worsened.” Earlier on Monday, Obozrevatel reported that Kadyrov had allegedly undergone an unsuccessful kidney transplant. Despite a lack of evidence supporting the spokesperson’s claims, they were made after months of rumours that Kadyrov was suffering from kidney issues. Kadyrov has been an ardent backer of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, and his soldiers have fought alongside regular Russian forces there. The former rebel warlord turned Kremlin ally has long called himself President Vladimir Putin’s “foot soldier”. Kadyrov was elected president of Chechnya in 2007. He has ruled majority-Muslim Chechnya while being accused of ordering extrajudicial killings and torture of his opponents.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/18/russia-says-it-has-nothing-to-reveal-on-ramzan-kadyrov-health-rumours
"Ukraine to sue Poland, Slovakia and Hungary over grain ban: Politico","Poland, Slovakia and Hungary imposed bans after an influx of Ukrainian grain led to local  farmers’ protests.","Kyiv is considering suing Poland, Hungary and Slovakia over their bans on Ukrainian agricultural products, thePoliticonews outlet reported. The magazine on Monday quoted Ukrainian Trade Representative Taras Kachka as saying that Kyiv could also impose reciprocal measures on Poland if Warsaw did not drop its additional steps. “We would be forced to retaliate on the additional products and would prohibit the import of fruit and vegetables from Poland,” he said. In May, the European Union restricted Ukrainian grain to allow Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia to ban the domestic sales of Ukrainian wheat, maize, rapeseed and sunflower seeds while permitting transit of such cargoes for export elsewhere. While the restriction expired last week, Warsaw, Bratislava and Budapest announced their bans on Ukrainian grain and said they were acting in the interests of their economies and that the move was intended to protect their farmers. The three countries have complained that a glut of Ukrainian grain threatens their domestic markets. Kachka said the bans are “ridiculous”. “I think that Hungary here is making a political statement that it wants to block trade with Ukraine and as well disregard Brussels completely. And that’s why I think that this is a very bold movement against both of us from Budapest,” he said. The EU allowed its ban to expire on Friday after Ukraine said it would take measures to tighten control of exports to neighbouring countries. Kachka said Kyiv was ready to “take on the responsibility to ensure that export from Ukraine is not creating any tsunami in neighbouring countries” and would impose a system of “real-time” export licences for grains. But the Ukrainian official also pointed out that the decision to enforce their bans outside of backing from the EU has raised “the biggest systemic concern” if partners cannot trust that Brussels speaks for the bloc. According to Politico, Kyiv also plans to sue the countries at the World Trade Organization, not through its trade accord with the EU. “I think that all the world should see how member states in the EU behave towards trade partners and their own union, because it can influence other states as well”, he added.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/18/ukraine-to-sue-poland-slovakia-and-hungary-over-grain-ban-politico
UN General Assembly: What to expect as world leaders gather this week,World leaders head to New York to take part in high-level United Nations talks. Here’s all you need to know.,"The climate crisis and the war in Ukraine are expected to figure prominently at the United Nations this week, as more than 140 leaders and state representatives from around the world descend on New York to address the 78th session of theUN General Assembly(UNGA). The high-levelGeneral Debate, which begins on Tuesday following two weeks of meetings, is the most widely watched event in the UN’s annual calendar. It provides world leaders and heads of state the opportunity to lay out their priorities for the coming year, urge cooperation on pressing issues, and often, call out their adversaries. “It is a one-of-a-kind moment each year for leaders from every corner of the globe to not only assess the state of the world but to act for the common good,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters last week. “And action is what the world needs now.” This year’s General Debate is being held under the theme, “Rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity: Accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals towards peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all”. A series of bilateral discussions will also be held on the sidelines of the event. Here’s all you need to know: New page dedicated to the United Nations General Assembly High-level Week has just been launched! One-stop-shop with lots of useful information on key events during the high-level week of#UNGA78:https://t.co/oZ6fCJVHZl — United Nations Geneva (@UNGeneva)August 28, 2023  The 193-member UN General Assembly debates matters of human rights, international law and cooperation in “economic, social, cultural, educational, and health fields”. It has the ability to pass resolutions and declarations meant to set out the guiding principles of the organisation. According to the UN Charter, the body is also charged with addressing matters of international peace and security not currently being addressed by the UN Security Council (UNSC). The UNGA approves the UN’ssprawling annual budgetand one of its six main committees directly oversees the funding of peacekeeping missions around the world. The UNGA president typically delivers the first speech of the General Debate. This session’s leader, Dennis Francis from Trinidad and Tobago, has said (PDF) that he wants to prioritise greater multilateralism and equal opportunity during his tenure. Brazil then traditionally delivers the first country speech, with President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva expected to make climate change a centrepiece of his address. Lula, who took office in January, has vowed tore-establish Brazilas a global leader in the environment and bolster the protection of the critical Amazon rainforest after years of destruction. The United States, as the host country, will then follow Brazil, with US President Joe Biden set todeliver an addressto the General Assembly on Tuesday seeking to assert Washington’s role as a global leader. From there, “the order of speakers then follows a complex algorithm reflecting level of representation, geographical balance, the order in which the request to speak was recorded, and other considerations”, the UNsayson its website. About 150 leaders are expected to attend the high-level talks, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the UN, said late last week. Among others, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be there, as will Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Both are expected to address the General Assembly and hold talks with Biden on the sidelines of the event. The Reuters news agency also reported last week that Zelenskyy will speak on Wednesday at a UN Security Council meeting on Ukraine, which “could place him at the same table as Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov” amid Russia’songoing military offensive. Biden will be the only top leader of the UN Security Council’s five permanent, veto-wielding countries – the US, China, Russia, France and the United Kingdom – to attend the high-level week, media outlets have reported. Rishi Sunakwill be the first British prime minister in more than a decade to skip the event, saying his busy schedule prevents him from going to New York. French President Emmanuel Macron will also miss the event, citing scheduling conflicts. It remains unclear which Chinese official will attend the summit after the Wall Street Journal reported in early September that Beijing planned to dispatch Vice President Han Zheng instead of sendingForeign Minister Wang Yion a broader US trip as previously signalled.    Given the diversity of speakers, the General Debate usually covers a range of issues of regional and global interest. Last year’s predominant themes included efforts to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic,Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and climate change – all of which are expected to again figure prominently during this year’s event. Speaking to reporters in late August, the US envoy, Thomas-Greenfield, said she expects most Western countries to exert “intense pressure” on Russia to withdraw troops from neighbouring Ukraine. The invasion has renewed calls toexpand decision-making poweron the 15-member UN Security Council, where Russia is among the five permanent members – alongside China, France, the United Kingdom and the US – who wield veto power. Concerns over China, maritime security in the Pacific, supply-chain disruptions and human rights are also likely to emerge, particularly as some observers have questioned Beijing’s growing influence at the UN.    Recent coups in Africa,notably in Niger, may also receive heightened attention, as will ongoing conflicts in Sudan and Ethiopia. Meanwhile, ongoing humanitarian crises in places such as Afghanistan, the Horn of Africa and Latin America – and their role in a global migration crisis – may also feature prominently. Meanwhile, the General Debate comes two months before the United Nations’ climate summit, COP28, will be held in Dubai and Guterres, the UN secretary-general, will host a Climate Ambition Summit on the sidelines of this week’s event in New York. “My appeal to world leaders will be clear: This is not the time for posturing or positioning. This is not the time for indifference or indecision. This is a time to come together for real, practical solutions,” Guterres said during a news conference on September 13. Themes set out by UNGA presidents are traditionally broad – and this year’s is no exception. Francis said in a June letter to his predecessor that the 2023 theme “encompasses the recognition that we are at a crossroads in history and that the path ahead will be decisive in determining not only our future, but that of generations to come”. He called for a renewed commitment to multilateralism and urged UN member states to see how they can “undertake coordinated purposive action” to promote peace and security, fight climate change, and promote human rights. The theme also stresses the need to accelerate efforts to meet the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.    The UN has described the Sustainable Development Goals as “an urgent call for action” between nations to address poverty, hunger and other global issues. They were laid out in the so-called “2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”, which was adopted in 2015 and provides a blueprint for achieving several benchmarks by 2030. The list includes 17 goals, including ensuring quality education, providing clean water and sanitation, and taking urgent action to tackle the climate crisis. The General Debate will be streamed live on UN Web TV,here.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/18/un-general-assembly-what-to-expect-as-world-leaders-gather-this-week
"Ukraine recaptures Klishchiivka, second eastern village in three days",Zelenskyy welcomes breakthrough that analysts say is of ‘strategic  significance’ to the war in the east.,"Ukraine said it has taken back the eastern village of Klishchiivka, in what would be Ukraine’s second significant gain in three days in its months-long counteroffensive against the Russian army. The village lies on higher ground about 9km (6 miles) south of Bakhmut and has been the scene of intense fighting for weeks. “Today, I would like to particularly commend the soldiers who, step by step, are returning to Ukraine what belongs to it, namely in the area of Bakhmut,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the nation on Sunday. The breakthrough in Klishchiivka comes days after Kyiv said it had gained control of the tiny nearby village of Andriivka and as Zelenskyy prepares for hissecond wartime visit to the United States, a key ally. Zelenskyy said that Kyiv was “preparing new defence solutions for Ukraine” and that “air defence and artillery are the priority”, without providing details. It began its counteroffensive to clear Russian troops from its territory in June. Oleksandr Syrsky, commander of Ukraine’s ground forces who is also in operational control of the counteroffensive, posted a video of Ukrainian troops displaying the blue and yellow national flag on ruined buildings with the sound of fighting in the background. “Klishchiivka was cleared of the Russians,” Syrsky, who has often visited the Bakhmut front line to devise strategy and boost the troops’ morale, said on social media. Klishchiivka was home to about 400 people before Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, and was captured by Russian troops in January of this year. There was no word from Moscow on its positions in the area. Itpreviously denied reportsthat its troops had been pushed out of Andriivka. Ilya Yevlash, spokesman for Ukrainian troops in the east, said that control over Klishchiivka could help the Ukrainian army encircle Bakhmut, captured by Russia in May after one of the war’s longest and bloodiest battles.    Yevlash said the battle had inflicted “powerful damage” on Russian airborne units, the Akhmat battalion of Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, Storm-Z made up of Russian criminals, the Russian General Staff’s military intelligence and motorised rifle units. “We have now gained a staging ground, which will in the future allow us to continue to develop offensive actions and liberate our land from the occupiers,” he said in a televised statement. Analysts said the capture of the two villages was an important breakthrough. “The liberation of Klishchiivka, as well as continued Ukrainian tactical gains northwest of Bakhmut are gains of strategic significance because they are allowing Ukrainian forces to fix a considerable portion of Russian airborne elements in the Bakhmut area,” the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington, DC-based think tank, wrote in its daily update on the fighting. The latest news from Kyiv came as the US’s highest-ranking military officer sought to temper hopes for a swift advance in thecounteroffensive. General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that while the effort had been “slower than the planners had anticipated”, it had been “steady”. He dismissed suggestions from some that the offensive had failed, arguing that Ukraine had “a lot of combat power remaining. The Ukrainians are not a spent force”. However, he warned: “It’ll take a considerable length of time to militarily eject all 200,000 or plus Russian troops out of Russian-occupied Ukraine. That’s a very high bar. It’s going to take a long time to do it.” NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg also warned there would be no swift end to the conflict, in an interview published on Sunday. “Most wars last longer than expected when they first begin,” Stoltenberg told Germany’s Funke media group. “Therefore we must prepare ourselves for a long war in Ukraine,” even if everyone is wishing for a swift peace.    Kyiv has also begun pushing back against Moscow’s forces in the south after building up Western weapons and recruiting more soldiers for its assault battalions. Intelligence updates from the US and United Kingdom suggested there had been more progress on the southern front with the ISW saying Ukrainian forces had probably “made a significant tactical breach” along a section of the southern front line. The UK’s Ministry of Defence, meanwhile, said that Russian forces were reinforcing their secondary defensive line around the occupied town of Tokmak, about 16km (10 miles) behind the southern front line, amid “Russia’s growing concern about Ukrainian tactical penetrations of the first main defensive line to the north”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/18/ukraine-recaptures-klishchiivka-second-eastern-village-in-three-days

Jewish pilgrims flock to historic Ukrainian city despite war with Russia,"Thousands of Hasidic Jews visit Uman to see the grave of Rabbi Nachman for Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, ignoring the threat from Russia’s invasion.","Uman, Ukraine– David Meinhart is confident he arrived in the safest place on Earth. He is in Uman, a city in central Ukraine that annually hosts tens of thousands of Hasidic Jewish pilgrims for Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year. This year some 32,000 arrived – even though the Russian-Ukrainian war rages 300km (120 miles) to the south, and cruise missiles have struck Uman several times, killing two dozen people, including five children. The war did not scare them off because they believe in their Rabbi’s help from beyond the grave – and remember their forefathers’ millennia-long survival in communities that barely tolerated Jews and occasionally turned hostile to them. Pilgrims chose to flock to the grave of Rabbi Nachman, the founder of the Breslav branch of Hasidism, who died here in 1810. A blessed new year will come to fruition if they celebrate its eve near Nachman’s grave, they say. “We are a people who have lived and survived persecution, wars and dangers for thousands of years,” Meinhart, 62, told Al Jazeera. His family’s past reflects this survival experience. His father moved to the United States from Germany before World War II and fought against the Nazis who killed his relatives during the Holocaust. Meinhart was born in the US but moved to Jerusalem 40 years ago to join a Hasidic community and father nine children. This year, he came to Uman with his sons – leaving his wife and daughters behind was his only concession to the possible dangers of war. “I could have brought my wife and my children, but I opted not to,” he said. Some female pilgrims, however, braved the Russian invasion. “There’s no fear,” said Rachel, a 25-year-old French Jew. She is adamant the pilgrimage does change people’s lives for the better, and they return to their rabbi’s grave again and again. “People wouldn’t come back here if [positive] things didn’t happen to them,” Rachel said, standing on Pushkin Street in central Uman, the epicentre of pilgrimage. The pilgrims who usually spend between two days and a week here transform the sleepy, impoverished city of 80,000. They throng the streets leading to Nachman’s grave and pay hundreds of dollars for a single bed. Less affluent visitors pitch tents next to apartment buildings or garages. Cafeterias and fast food joints along their way display signs in Hebrew and promise kosher food and drink, while Israeli authorities and charities provide refreshments free of charge. The pilgrims sport white or black robes, curly or braided sidelocks and long beards, and their skullcaps or shiny fur hats contrast the casual attire of the Ukrainian locals. On Saturday, the day when they abstain from anything unrelated to religion, they left empty coffee cups and plastic plates on the ground and tables. They loudly conversed and prayed in Hebrew and Yiddish, looking jubilant and breaking into cheerful chants. Their self-confident strides occasionally made locals step aside with some whispering obscenities or anti-Semitic slurs. “Our mentalities differ,” admitted Boris, 28, a burly Jewish-Ukrainian volunteer who knows Hebrew and helps Uman police and residents mediate conflicts with the pilgrims. “It’s hard for police without us because they don’t speak Hebrew or English,” he said. Most Uman residents welcome the Hasidim and the influx of cash they bring to Ukraine, one of Europe’s poorest nations whose economy shrank by one-third because of the war. “There are [negative] moments but they are compensated by a chance to earn money,” Aleks Melnik, who lives on Pushkin Street, told Al Jazeera. He is far more unhappy about tough security measures in Uman,Ukraine’s endemic corruption, and the non-transparent ways authorities spend the obligatory $200 payments from each pilgrim. Melnik, 42, said he has to show his identification card to police officers guarding the street, and cannot drive his car there unless he pays a $100 bribe. But over the decades he has befriended many pilgrims and said Ukrainians can take lessons when it comes to devotion to faith or national defence. “We can definitely learn from them,” he said, sitting on a bench less than 50 metres (164 feet) away from Nachman’s grave. The grave site looked like a beehive humming with the sound of prayers of hundreds of men shaking their heads and holding religious books or leaflets. Anti-Semitism used to be rampant in what is now Ukraine. Its most celebrated writer Nikolay Gogol described the casual, totally unprovoked killing of Jewish adults and children by warlike Cossacks. Nobel Prize-winning Belarusian writer Svetlana Alexievich was blacklisted in Ukraine in 2018 for mentioning some anti-Soviet nationalists who sided with Nazi Germans during World War II and participated in the mass killing of Jews. Three hundred years ago, this anti-Semitism – along with the influence of Protestant Christianity that emphasised a mystical and personal connection to God –spurred the emergence of Hasidismamong the world’s largest population of Ashkenazim, or Eastern European Jews. Hasidic communities are still centred around “dynasties” of rabbis, and only Nachman’s followers are known as “dead Hasidim” because he never named a successor. The lifestyle of Rabbi Nachman and his followers confined to the Pale of Settlement in the western part of the Russian Empire could not be more different from that of their rulers. Nachman died in Uman of tuberculosis when he was only 38 – at a time when a local aristocrat completed a giant park with marble statues, artificial lakes, and grottoes for his wife, a former courtesan he bought for two million golden coins. Nachman’s teachings were quickly accepted by many Ashkenazim, and these days his followers include Jews of Middle Easternor Ethiopian origin– some of whom were seen in Uman. The city has seen its share of pogroms that forced millions of Jews to leave for the United States and, later, British-controlled Palestine. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and some of his cabinet members hail from Jewish families, and his government has tried to rein in ultranationalists who occasionally espouse anti-Semitism. On Friday night, the pilgrims held a collective prayer for peace in Ukraine, and some urged Zelenskyy to visit the grave so Nachman helps Kyiv win the war against the Russian invaders. “Come here and beseech God and I assure you, as does Rabbi Nachman — victory will be yours,” one of the pilgrimsreportedlysaid.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/17/jewish-pilgrims-flock-to-historic-ukrainian-city-despite-war-with-russia

Russia denies claims Ukraine retook village of Andriivka near Bakhmut,,"Russia has said its forces remained in control of villages near theshattered city of Bakhmutin eastern Ukraine, denying a Ukrainian claim that their own troops had liberated the front-line village of Andriivka. On Saturday, Russia dismissed Ukrainian allegations that its forces had been pushed out of Andriivka. This came after the commander of Ukraine’s land forces posted a video purporting to show the capture of Andriivka amid a landscape of scorched territory and devastation. The video shows Ukrainian soldiers advancing on empty devastated ground marked by the burned remnants of trees and taking cover in the shattered hulks of buildings reduced to rubble. Another video showed trucks driving at high speed down a deserted road. Andriivka is around 14km (9 miles) south of Bakhmutin the Donetsk region, where Kyiv has been pushing back against Moscow’s forces since June. But in its daily bulletin, Russia’s defence ministry said that “the enemy… continues to carry out assaults … trying in vain to dislodge Russian troops in the localities of Andriivka and Klishchiivka”. The statement adds to the confusion surrounding the situation on the ground in the village, which had just a few dozen residents before Russia’s offensive. The account of fighting by Russia’s defence ministry said its troops were still holding at least two key villages south of Bakhmut, known in Russia by its Soviet-era name, Artyomovsk. “The enemy did not abandon plans to capture the city of Artyomovsk of the Donetsk People’s Republic and continued to conduct assault operations … unsuccessfully trying to oust Russian troops from the population centres of Klishchiivka and Andriivka,” the ministry said in its daily briefing. The report said Russian forces had, in the past week, repelled 16 Ukrainian attacks, with enemy losses at more than 1,700 dead and wounded, along with 16 tanks.    On Thursday, Ukraine’s Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Mailar had to backtrack on an announcement earlier that day that Kyiv had retaken Andriivka, after troops there said fighting was still going on. Then on Ukrainian television Friday, a spokesperson for a brigade fighting in the area said the village had been “completely destroyed”, adding that “Andriivka no longer exists”. In the east and the south, Ukraine has been reporting minimal territorial gains after months of intense fighting and heavy losses. Despite being bolstered byNATO-standard weapons worth billionsof dollars, Ukrainian military officials have said there are no quick solutions to puncture Russian defensive lines — only slow, grinding battles. Ukraine’s strategy appears to be to spread Russian forces thin across multiple directions along the front line, from vast agricultural tracts in the east to theDnipro River, which marks the line of contact in the south, in hopes that Ukrainian troops can exploit their opponents’ vulnerabilities. The wet weather of fall and winter will likely slow Ukrainian advances. President VolodymyrZelenskyy is expected to visit Washington next weekas Congress debates approving more aid.

"Hungary, Poland, Slovakia to continue own bans on Ukraine grains",Farmers in countries neighbouring Ukraine have repeatedly complained about a product glut hitting their domestic prices.,"Poland, Slovakia and Hungary will impose their ownrestrictionson Ukrainian grain imports, the governments said after the European Commission decided not to extend a ban affecting Ukraine’s five EU neighbours. Restrictions imposed by the European Union in May allowed Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia to ban domestic sales of Ukrainian wheat, maize, rapeseed and sunflower seeds while permitting transit of such cargoes for export elsewhere. “We will extend this ban despite their disagreement, despite the European Commission’s disagreement,” Polish PM Mateusz Morawiecki told a rally in the northeastern town of Elk on Friday. “We will do it because it is in the interest of the Polish farmer.” Hungary imposed a national import ban on 24 Ukrainian agricultural products, including grains, vegetables, several meat products and honey, according to a government decree published on Friday. Slovakia’s agriculture minister followed suit announcing his country’s own grain ban. All three bans only apply to domestic imports and do not affect transit to onward markets. The EU created alternative land routes, so-called Solidarity Lanes, for Ukraine to use to export its grains and oilseeds after Russia backed out of the UN-brokered Black Sea grain deal in July that allowed safe passage for the cargo ships.    The European Commission said existing measures would expire as originally planned on Friday after Ukraine agreed to introduce any legal measures within 30 days to avoid grain surges. “It has concluded that thanks to the work of the Coordination Platform and to the temporary measures introduced on 2 May 2023, the market distortions in the 5 Member States bordering Ukraine have disappeared,” the European Commission said in a statement. The EU said it would refrain from imposing any restrictions as long as the effective measures by Ukraine are in place and fully working. Farmers in the five countries neighbouring Ukraine have repeatedly complained about a product glut hitting their domestic prices and pushing them towards bankruptcy. The countries, except Bulgaria, had been pushing for an extension of thebanpassed its September 15 expiry. Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Romania previously said they may extend the restrictions unilaterally while Bulgaria on Thursday voted to scrap the curbs. Romania’s government, which unlike its peers did not unilaterally enforce a ban before May, said on Friday it “regretted that a European solution to extend the ban could not be found”. It added it was waiting for Ukraine to present its action plan of measures to prevent an import surge by September 18 before deciding how to protect Romanian farmers. Romania sees over 60 percent of the alternate flows pass through its territory mainly via the Danube River and its farmers have threatened protests if the ban is not extended. For the last year, Ukraine had been moving 60 percent of its exports through the Solidarity Lanes and 40 percent via the Black Sea thanks to the deal. In August, about four million tonnes of Ukraine grains passed through the Solidarity Lanes of which close to 2.7 million tonnes were through the Danube. The Commission wants to increase exports through Romania further but the plan has been complicated by Russian drone attacks on Ukraine’s grain infrastructure along the Danube and near the Romanian border.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/15/poland-hungary-to-continue-ban-on-ukrainian-grain-after-eu-lifts-embargo
Russia’s central bank raises key interest rate amid weaker rouble,The third rate hike in two months comes as Russia grapples with higher inflation and a weaker rouble.,"Russia’s central bank has raised its key interest rate by 100 basis points to 13 percent, hiking the cost of borrowing for the third time in two months as it grapples with higher inflation and a weaker rouble. Inflation in Russia accelerated in recent months and has remained stubbornly high, with the central bank failing to meet its target of four percent. The central bank said on Friday its board of directors decided to increase the key rate from 12 percent to 13 percent. “Inflationary pressure in the Russian economy remains high,” the bank said in a statement. The bank also pointed to the “depreciation of the rouble”, which has shed about 30 percent of its value against the US dollar since the start of the year. “The Bank of Russia will assess the feasibility of further increases of the key rate at its upcoming meetings,” it said. The central bank adjusted its year-end forecast for inflation to 6.0-7.0 percent from 5.0-6.5 percent. Annual inflation was running at 5.33 percent as of September 11, above the 4 percent target. Capital Economics said it was not convinced inflation would return to the bank’s 4 percent target in 2024, and expected more rate hikes to come. “Russia’s central bank is a hawkish institution that takes its commitment to inflation fighting seriously,” Liam Peach, senior emerging markets economist, told Reuters news agency. “With fiscal policy set to remain loose, the economy likely to continue overheating and inflation pressures to build further, there will be more pressure on the central bank to tighten monetary policy,” he added. The central bank last hiked its key rate at an emergency meeting in August, a day after the rouble tumbled to a more than 16-month low against the US dollar. On Tuesday, President Vladimir Putin downplayed the weakening of the currency, which has been weighed down by lower export revenues and higher military spending in the wake of the conflict in Ukraine. “This issue requires its own painstaking research by the central bank and the Russian government and financial authorities,” he said at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok. Russian officials have largely shrugged off the economic effects of Moscow’s dragging offensive in Ukraine, despite an exodus of foreign companies and unprecedented Western sanctions.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/15/russias-central-bank-raises-key-interest-rate-amid-weaker-ruble
Romania ups flight restrictions at Ukraine border as drone debris found,Russian drone debris found in Romanian territory as Moscow increases drone attacks on Ukraine’s Danube river ports.,"Romania has imposed additional flight restrictionsin parts of its air space along the Ukrainian border as Russian attacks on Ukraine’s Danube river ports have intensified fears of a spillover on nearby Romanian territory. Drone debris following Russian attacks on Ukraine’s Danube riverports has been found in Romania – a NATO member – underlining security risks for the military alliance, whose members have a mutual defence commitment. An order from the Romanian defence ministry on Thursday banned piloted and unmanned aircraft from flying within 30km (19 miles) of the border with Ukraine at an altitude of less than 4,000 metres (more than 13,000 ft). Romania already imposed an 8km (almost 5 miles) border exclusion zone for flights of less than 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) in places since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.    Romania and Ukraine share a border of more than 100km (62 miles) along the Danube at a point where the river nears the Black Sea. Romania’s defence ministry said it had enforced the additional restrictions between its Danube river ports of Sulina and Galati because of Russia’s attacks nearby. “Given the intensifying Russian attacks on Ukraine’s river ports, measures to extend restrictions were necessary to ensure a more efficient monitoring and control of air space,” the ministry said. Romania’s foreign ministry has twice summoned the Russian charge d’affaires following the discovery on Romanian soil of drone debris. The defence ministry said it would deploy additional troops to southeastern Romania near the border with Ukraine and increase patrols and observation points, in an effort to prevent risks to residents. Russian attacks on Ukraine’s river ports across the Danubefrom Romania have increased since mid-July when Moscow abandoned a year-old deal that lifted a Russian blockade of Ukraine’s Black Sea ports.    NATO has said Russian air attacks near the border were “destabilising” even if there was no indication that Russia intended to hit a NATO member. Ukraine is one of the world’s biggest grain exporters and the Romanian Black Sea port of Constanta is now Kyiv’s largest alternative export route, with grains arriving by road, rail or barge across the Danube from ports that are coming under attack from Moscow.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/15/romania-ups-flight-restrictions-at-ukraine-border-as-drone-debris-found

"Ukraine says Russian missile defence destroyed in Crimea, 2 warships hit",Russian S-400 ‘Triumf’ surface-to-air missile defence system was reportedly destroyed in ‘special operation’ in Russian-annexed Crimea.,"Ukraine said its forces attacked two Russian patrol ships operating in the Black Sea and destroyed a sophisticated “Triumf” surface-to-air missile defence system in Russian-occupied Crimea, with military analysts describing the loss of such equipment as “tactical failures” by Russia. The attacks reported on Thursday followed a day after Kyiv said it had carried out a missile strike thatbadly damaged a Russian submarine and a naval landing shipthat were undergoing repairs in a shipyard in the Crimean port of Sevastopol, home to Russia’s Black Sea Fleet. In a post on the Telegram messaging app on Thursday, Ukraine’s military said it hit two Russian patrol vessels in a southwest region of the Black Sea, causing “certain damage” in a morning attack. “The [Sergei] Kotov was hit,” military intelligence official Andriy Yusov told the Reuters news agency, sharing a grainy video circulated online by a Ukrainian government minister that appeared to show sea drones attacking a vessel at sea. Footage of a maritime drone attack on a Russian warship, presumably the ""Vasily Bykov"", has appeared.pic.twitter.com/6L3LDLrY3P — NEXTA (@nexta_tv)September 14, 2023  The Russian Defence Ministry confirmed an attack on the Sergei Kotov ship in a morning statement but said the assault involving five sea drones was repelled. It made no mention of damage. Ukraine’s military also said it had hit aRussian air defence system in a long-range attackin the early hours of Thursday near the town of Yevpatoriya in the west of Crimea. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made special reference to the Crimea attack in his nightly message to the nation on Thursday. “I thank you for today’s triumph – the destruction of the occupiers’ air defence system on the land of our Crimea. It is a very significant achievement. Well done!” he said. “The entire staff of the Security Service of Ukraine and our Navy should be specially commended for this.” Today, there are reasons to praise the work of Ukraine’s Security Service, its personnel, and the Ukrainian Navy. I thank them for today’s triumph—destroying the occupant’s air defense system in our Crimea. Very significant outcome! Glory to everyone who fights for Ukraine!pic.twitter.com/52o83hpmlq — Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa)September 14, 2023  A Ukrainian intelligence source said that aerial combat drones first incapacitated the Russian air defence system by attacking its radar and antenna and that two Neptune cruise missiles were fired and had destroyed the defence system’s launchers. Footage circulated on social media showed powerful explosions and a plume of smoke rising in the night sky, illuminated by a blaze. Reuters could not verify the video. Russia’s Defence Ministry said its air defences shot down 11 drones overnight over the peninsula and did not mention damage. Washington, DC-based think tank,the Institute for the Study of War (ISW),said on Thursday that the reported destruction of the Russian S-400 “Triumf” surface-to-air missile system based in Crimea in a “special operation” points to serious issues in Russia’s defence of the occupied peninsula. “The strike suggests that Russian forces were unprepared to intercept missiles with the system or were unable to do so,” the ISW said. According to the ISW, Ukrainian forces hit a Russian S-400 air defence system near Olenivka, Crimea, in late August. A “second Ukrainian strike on a significant Russian air defence system in recent weeks indicates that such tactical failures may reflect a wider systemic issue with Russian air defences in occupied Crimea,” the think tank said.

While Kyiv’s counteroffensive in the south and east has been slowed by minefields and Russian defensive lines, Ukrainian forces haveescalated attacks in the Black Sea region, where Russia is imposing a de facto blockade on Ukraine’s seaborne exports. Ukraine has increasingly relied on seaborne drones to attack Russian targets, hitting the Olenegorsky Gornyak landing ship near Russia’s naval base at Novorossiysk early last month, as well as a Russian fuel tanker. Ukraine continues to press on with its gruelling counteroffensive with fierce fighting reported in many parts of the front line, but no significant breakthroughs in the three-month-old campaign.

Ukrainian President Zelenskyy set to visit Washington amid budget debate,"The US Congress is facing a September 30 deadline to pass budget legislation, including further aid for Ukraine.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to visit the seat of the United States government in Washington, DC, next week, as he makes the case for ongoing aid to his war-torn country. Details of the visit started to appear in US media on Thursday afternoon, with anonymous government sources confirming the plans. Zelenskyy is expected to meet withUS President Joe Bidenat the White House on Thursday, along with a stop at the Capitol. His appearance will coincide with a debate in Congress over federal spending, as lawmakers face an impending September 30 deadline to pass a budget. The Biden administration has asked Congress to allocate atotal of $24bnfor Ukraine support, including $13.1bn in additional military aid and $8.5bn for humanitarian support. But some politicians, particularly in the Republican Party, have balked at the prospect of sending more money and supplies to Ukraine, as it attempts to repel Russian forces. Congress has already approved aid totalling over $113bn. But the last time the legislature approved funding for Ukraine was in December — before Republicanstook controlof the House of Representatives.    Now, with a narrow conservative majority in the lower chamber, far-right politicians hold greater sway over how budget legislation is decided. Just last July, 70 House Republicans, led by Florida Representative Matt Gaetz, backed a proposal to cut off security assistance to Ukraine altogether. Next week’s appearance at Capitol Hill will beZelenskyy’s secondsince the full-scale invasion of his country began in February 2022. In his first visit, heldlast December, the Ukrainian president delivered animpassioned speechbefore Congress, rallying lawmakers against Russian “aggression”. “It is just a matter of time when they will strike against your other allies if we do not stop them now. We must do it,” Zelenskyy told the US Congress. “Your money is not charity. It’s an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way.”    Zelenskyy has made few trips outside his native Ukraine since the invasion, but he is set to be in the US already next week for the annual United Nations General Assembly in New York. His presence was, until recently, uncertain, but experts believe he is attempting to generate support for the Ukrainian war effort by meeting with world leaders in person. Earlier this, Zelenskyy also made surprise visits to theNetherlandsandJapan, in a similar effort to drum up backing among global powers. Ukraine is currently in the midst of achallenging, months-long counteroffensive, as it attempts to claw back territory occupied by Russian forces.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/14/ukrainian-president-zelenskyy-set-to-visit-to-washington-amid-budget-debate
Vladimir Putin accepts Kim Jong Un invitation to North Korea,Kim is continuing his tour of eastern Russia after his summit with Putin at the Vostochny Cosmodrome.,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has accepted an invitation from Kim Jong Un to visit North Korea after the two leaders held their first face-to-face summit in four years. Kim is in Russia’s far east as Putin looks to reinforce alliances amid Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine, and as the North Korean leader continues to advance his country’s military modernisation. He extended the invitation to Putin at “a convenient time” at a reception to mark the end of a day where the two held more than four hours of talks andtouredthe Vostochny Cosmodrome space centre. “Putin accepted the invitation with pleasure and reaffirmed his will to invariably carry forward the history and tradition of the Russia-DPRK friendship,” North Korean state news agency KCNA said on Thursday, using the acronym for the country’s official name. The talks in Russia have raisedconcernin the United States and elsewhere that Kim might be prepared to sell arms to Moscow for itswar in Ukraine, perhaps in exchange for technology that would further his military ambitions.    The North Korean leader is also expected to visit an aircraft factory and travel to Vladivostok where he will view Russia’s Pacific fleet. Kim’s delegation includes his defence minister, his top military commander and the director of the country’s munitions department. Leif-Eric Easley, professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, said the members of Kim’s delegation, as well as the location for the summit, were “quite telling” even though no joint statement was issued. “The composition of Kim’s delegation suggests North Korea may send munitions to Russia in exchange for military technology. Meeting at Russia’s eastern spaceport was equivalent to Putin thumbing his nose at UN Security Council Resolutions,” Easley said in emailed comments. “This should be a wake-up call to all other UN member states about the need to redouble efforts at enforcing sanctions on Pyongyang.” In its report, KCNA said the two leaders agreed to further strengthen strategic and tactical cooperation in the face of the “military threats, provocations and tyranny of imperialists”. Putin, meanwhile, praised the “strengthening of cooperation and friendship between our countries” and told reporters he saw “possibilities” for military cooperation with North Korea. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, who was aguest of honourat events to mark the 70th anniversary of the armistice that ended the fighting in the 1950-53 Korean War, in Pyongyang in July, was also involved in the talks. The Russian leader said earlier that Moscow could help Pyongyang build satellites – Kim has argued a spy satellite is crucial for North Korea’s weapons development but its two attempts this year to put one into orbit have both ended infailure. Some analysts suggested North Korea might want to try using a Russian space launch vehicle for the satellite and work with Russia to build a more powerful piece of equipment. “It’s possible that North Korea pushes to participate in the production process of the satellite, rather than just acquiring a finished product, to set up a natural transfer of technologies,” Yang Uk, a military expert at South Korea’s Asian Institute for Policy Studies, told the Associated Press news agency. Just before Putin and Kim met, North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles, the latest in a series of launches in breach of United Nations sanctions that prohibit such activities. US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said it was “troubling” that Russia was talking about cooperation with North Korea on programmes that potentially would violate UN Security Council resolutions. South Korea’s unification minister, Kim Young-ho, who is in charge of relations with Pyongyang, expressed “deep concerns” over military cooperation and possible arms deals, saying the two countries were apparently continuing to pursue “some kind of” a military deal. “We once again urge Russia and North Korea to halt illicit acts that cause their isolation and regression, and follow international rules including the Security Council resolutions,” the minister told reporters on Thursday. Japan’s newly-appointed Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa also warned against “violations” of UN resolutions. The resolutions – passed with Russian support – ban the development of technology that could be used in North Korea’s ballistic missile programmes. They also prohibit any scientific and technical cooperation with North Korea in nuclear science and technology, aerospace and aeronautical engineering and technology, or advanced manufacturing production techniques and methods.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/14/vladimir-putin-accepts-kim-jong-un-invitation-to-north-korea

Kim Jong Un’s support for Russia sparks warnings from the West,US says it ‘won’t hesitate’ to impose more sanctions on Russia and North Korea if they conclude any new arms deal.,"A raremeetingbetween North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin has been met with warnings from Western nations who suspect an arms deal may be imminent. The United States and the United Kingdom have expressed concerns that Kim could provideweapons and ammunitionto Russia, which has expended vast stocks in more than 18 months ofwar in Ukraine. Moscow and Pyongyang have denied such intentions. The US Department of State said on Wednesday that US President Joe Biden’s administration “won’t hesitate” to impose more sanctions on Russia and North Korea if they conclude any new arms deals. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller issued the warning at a briefing in response to questions about the meeting in Russia between Putin and Kim. “We have taken a number of actions already to sanction entities that brokered arms sales between North Korea and Russia and we won’t hesitate to impose additional actions if appropriate,” Miller said. It was troubling that Russia and North Korea were discussing increased cooperation that could violate UN Security Council resolutions, he said. “When you see what looks to be increased cooperation and probably military transfers, that is quite troubling and would potentially be in violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions,” Miller said. James O’Brien, head of the Office of Sanctions Coordination, told The Associated Press news agency such a deal would trigger a US attempt to identify the individuals involved and the financial mechanisms they used to “at least limit their ability to be effective”. “Russia is scraping the bottom of the barrel looking for help because it’s having trouble sustaining its military,” he said. “Russia is now overtly engaging with a country that the UN has sanctioned. And that’s very problematic for Russia’s global position.” During the meeting, which lasted more than four hours at Russia’s Vostochny Cosmodrome, Putin showed Kim around the advanced space rocket launch site, and discussed the possibility of sending a North Korean cosmonaut into space. Kim, who arrived by train from North Korea, asked detailed questions about rockets as the two leaders toured the site in Russia’s east. When asked by Russian media, who were given significant access at the summit, if Russia would help Kim build satellites, Putin said, “That’s why we came here.” Across the Atlantic, the United Kingdom also urged North Korea to end arms talks with Russia and said Kim’s visit showed how isolated Moscow had become on the world stage. “We urge the DPRK to cease its arms negotiations with Russia and to abide by public commitments Pyongyang has made not to sell arms to Russia,” Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s spokesperson told reporters, referring to North Korea by its official name.    “This visit serves to highlight Russia’s isolation on the global stage, and as the world unites against Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine and he has been forced to turn to regimes such as North Korea.” Putin gave numerous hints that military cooperation was discussed but disclosed few details. Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu attended the talks. The Kremlin said sensitive discussions between neighbours were a private matter. During a news briefing on Wednesday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also signalled that Moscow had to tread carefully. “Any form of cooperation of any country with North Korea must respect the sanctions regime that was imposed by the Security Council,” Guterres told reporters, adding that it was “extremely relevant” in the case of Russia and North Korea. Reporting from Seoul, Al Jazeera’s Florence Looi said it was significant that Kim had chosen Putin to be the first foreign leader that he has met since the pandemic. Looi also explained what North Korea and Russia’s closer ties will look like after the meeting between the two leaders. “North Korea is one of the few countries to publicly support Russia in its invasion and war in Ukraine. Now, Kim has stated that he considers this war a righteous endeavour, and he also said that North Korea is ready to stand with Russia, against imperialism,” Looi said. Thetwo leaderscalled each other “comrades” at lunch and Putin repeatedly reminded Kim that it was the Soviet Union that backed North Korea – and was first to recognise it just more than 75 years to the day since it was established. Russia has joined China in opposing new sanctions on North Korea, blocking a US-led push and publicly splitting the UN Security Council for the first time since it started punishing Pyongyang in 2006. Asked about military cooperation, Putin said Russia complied with international rules but that there were opportunities to explore.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/13/north-koreas-kims-support-for-russia-concerns-western-nations
"US has little leverage against Russia-North Korea cooperation, experts say","Washington could impose more sanctions, but analysts say penalties are unlikely to halt Moscow-Pyongyang alliance.","Washington, DC –For weeks, the United Stateshas been warningNorth Korea against providing weapons to Russia for its war in Ukraine. But experts say there is little Washington can do to halt cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang, particularly as their leaders take steps to strengthen the countries’ relationship. “The US right now doesn’t have any leverage over North Korea,” said Jenny Town, a senior fellow at the Stimson Center, a Washington, DC-based think-tank. “We can impose more sanctions. We can step up interdictions. We can make life more difficult, but we can’t stop it from having equal relations with other countries — especially when we don’t have a relationship with it ourselves.” In a rare meeting on Wednesday, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un pledged to help Russian President Vladimir Putin fight against the “hegemonic forces” that threaten Moscow’s security and interests. Kim seldom leaves his country. But he travelled to Vostochny Cosmodrome, a spaceport in Russia’s Far East, this week to visit with Putinfor several hours. The two leaders did not make public any arms deals, which would be in violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions against North Korea and US sanctions against Russia. But Kim signalled strong backing for the Kremlin’s war in Ukraine without explicitly mentioning the conflict. “The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has always expressed its full and unconditional support for all measures taken by the Russian government,” he said. “And I take this opportunity to reaffirm that we will always stand with Russia onthe anti-imperialistfront and the front of independence.”    US officials have said Russia is seeking munitions from North Korea, which possesses large stockpiles of Soviet-era ammunition and produces arms domestically. Last week, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said there will be a “price” to pay if the two countries agree to an arms deal. And on Monday, the US Department of Statethreatened sanctionsif North Korea provides weapons to Russia. But North Korea and Russia are already two of the most sanctioned countries in the world. Mark Barry, an independent Asian affairs analyst, said the US can impose more “toothless” sanctions on North Korea, but they would not stop Pyongyang from working with Moscow. He said Russia, North Korea and China are likely to deepen their ties going forward, as Moscow looks to “project an image of solidarity” with its two Asian neighbours. But Washington has repeatedly warned both Beijing and Pyongyang against coming to Russia’s aid in Ukraine. Last year, the US accused North Korea ofcovertly shippingartillery shells to Russia, an allegation that was denied by both Moscow and Pyongyang. Experts say that, while North Korean weapons could add to Russia’s dwindling firepower in Ukraine, they would not have a decisive impact on the war. “Can North Korean small arms, artillery munitions help prolong Russia’s efforts? Probably. But it’s not going to be a game changer by any means,” Town said. For his part, Barry said an increasingly isolated Putin is mainly pushing to show some geopolitical reach by bolstering ties with North Korea. “Russia is in need of some things from North Korea — although I would argue that the real need is not so much 1950s-era ammunition and artillery shells, but it’s to project the power and influence that they really don’t have,” he said. Barry also noted the logistic difficulty of transferring ammunition across thousands of miles, from North Korea to the Ukrainian front. The transportation alone could take months.    Beyond the Ukraine war, Wednesday’s meeting between Kim and Putin points to a broader, growing alliance between North Korea and Russia that also includes China, according to experts. As the US helps Ukraine against the Russian invasion with billions of dollars in military aid, it is also working to counter North Korea bystrengthening security tieswith Japan and South Korea. Separately, Washington is locked in a strategic competition with Beijing. Town said Moscow, Pyongyang and Beijing may have different agendas, but they are strengthening their partnerships in opposition to what they see as the “reciprocal bloc” of Washington, Seoul and Tokyo in northeast Asia. Meanwhile, tensions have been escalating around the Korean Peninsula as the US continues to hold joint military drills with South Korea and Japan, and North Korea steps up its ballisticmissile testing. Earlier this year, North Korea warned of anuclear confrontationafter the US sent a submarine with nuclear-armed ballistic missiles to South Korea. Diplomacy between the US and North Korea has been on ice for years. Former US President Donald Trump held two summits with Kim in 2018 and 2019, but themeetingsdid not produce longterm, tangible results. The failure of the 2019 meeting in Hanoi — which was cut short by Trump — was particularly jarring to Kim, who had built up expectations among North Koreans that economic relief was imminent, analysts say. North Korea remains under heavy UN and US sanctions over its nuclear and missile programmes. Barry said Kim had travelled 65 hours by train to meet with Trump in 2019, but he ultimately left Hanoi with nothing to show. “He was incredibly embarrassed. He lost a lot of face,” Barry explained, adding that the North Korean leader has since given up on the US.    While the administration of US President Joe Biden says Washington is open to dialogue with Pyongyang, any negotiations would focus on North Korea’s nuclear programme, not broader relations. “There’san arms racegoing on in Northeast Asia,” Town said. “The idea that North Korea would agree unilaterally in the middle of this arms race … to put controls and limits on its own weapons development is really unrealistic to begin with.” With the “disillusionment” that followed the Hanoi summit, North Korea has entrenched itself more deeply with Russia and China, she added, especially as Moscow deals with its own sanctions. That bloc formation — absent comprehensive diplomacy — could lead to escalation and prolong conflicts, experts say. “It makes everything more difficult. It makes it harder to reach across ideological lines, first of all,” Town said. “It may lead to more emboldened actions if there is more a sense of collective security amongst those three countries.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/13/us-has-little-leverage-against-russia-north-korea-cooperation-experts-say
Fresh debris of Russian-style drones found in Romania,NATO says Romania alerted allies of drone fragments resembling Russian models on its territory ‘for a third time’.,"NATO member Romania has found new fragments of a drone deemedsimilar to thoseused by the Russian army near its border with war-torn Ukraine, in the third such finding in a week, defence and NATO officials said. Two helicopters from the Romanian Air Force were deployed with specialist teams to Nufaru and Victoria in the eastern county of Tulcea, where the fragments were spread over “several tens of meters”, the Ministry of National Defense said in a statement. It said in a separate statement that it has notified the General Inspectorate for Emergency Situations about areas near the border that could be at risk of incidents as Russian forces attack Ukraine’s Danube River ports across the river from Romania. In a statement, NATO spokesperson Dylan White said that the Romanian ambassador to the alliance updated allies on “Russia’s continued attacks on Ukrainian port infrastructure near Romania”. He added that “NATO has no information indicating any intentional attack by Russia against Allied territory”. As a NATO member, Romania is party to NATO’s mutual defence agreement. Emergency authorities in Romania have received phone calls “about possible cases of drone impacts” between three localities, including Nufaru, the ministry said. It later confirmed that samples collected from the site were similar to those used by the Russian army and that experts are continuing to establish the circumstances of the incident. The NATO spokesperson said Romania had “informed Allies that fragments of drones similar to those used by Russia have been identified on Romanian territory for a third time”. After Wednesday’s drone findings, Romania’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that it “reiterates its firm protest against the violation, once again, of Romania’s airspace” and that it will summon the head of Russia’s diplomatic mission. Wednesday’s findings are the third such discovery on Romanian soil since last Thursday. They come during sustained attacks by Russian forces on Ukraine’s Danube ports as Moscow aims to disrupt Ukraine’s ability to export grain to world markets. In the Danube village of Plauru, opposite Ukraine’s Danube port of Izmail, Romania’s defence ministry has erected prefabricated concrete shelters for residents. They measure 9.6 meters long, 2 meters wide inside, and 1.5 meters high (about 31 feet long, 6.5 feet wide and 5 feet high).  While it is unclear whether Romania has determined where or when the drones were launched, Romanian President Klaus Iohannis said of drone fragment findings on Saturday that they were “similar to those used by the Russian army”. Iohannis said it indicated there has been “an absolutely unacceptable violation of the sovereign airspace of Romania, a NATO ally, with real risks to the security of Romanian citizens in the area”. Asked about the previous drone fragment findings, Romanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu said on Wednesday: “No one attacked us, and no one is attacking us.” “Some remains jumped from a drone that was hit by the Ukrainian army. It didn’t have explosives, it didn’t have anything that could harm the citizens,” he said. Last week, Romania’s National Committee for Emergency Situations approved measures allowing authorities to issue localised text message alerts or sound alarms to warn inhabitants “adjacent to the conflict areas” in Ukraine of incidents or potential incidents.

"Ukraine’s long arm disrupts Crimea, its patience breaches Russian defences","Kyiv says it has broken through Russia’s ‘first line of defence’, an assessment Washington agrees with.","Ukraine increased the range and effectiveness of its long-distance strikes in the 80th and 81st weeks of war, while evidence mounted that it had breached the Russian first line of defence in the south of the country. Russia’s defence ministry admitted on September 12 that Ukraine had launched 10 cruise missiles and three unmanned surface vehicles against the naval port of Sevastopol in Crimea. “We confirm a large landing vessel and submarine were hit,” Andriy Yusov, Ukraine’s military intelligence spokesperson, told Reuters. It is believed to be the largest attack recorded against the strategically located port. “Sevastopol … represents both a base into which supplies can be sent by ship if necessary and also a naval base which can provide some protection to the Kerch Bridge and a base from which the Russians can present an offensive threat to Ukrainian shipping out of Odesa,” wrote strategy professor Phillips O’Brien on Substack. The Kerch Bridge is Russia’s only land connection to Crimea. “The two work symbiotically to provide the Russians supply and control over Crimea. If one is fully put out of action, the other would be in real trouble.” It appears that Ukraine may have been developing its own long-range cruise missile, and is using it to target Crimea. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on August 31 said a Ukrainian-produced long-range weapon successfully hit a target 700km (434 miles) away, without providing details. Geolocated footage the previous day showed an explosion near an electricity substation near Feodosia, a Russian port on the east side of Crimea. That day, the Russian defence ministry said it had intercepted a missile targeting rear positions. A week earlier, Ukraine destroyed a Russian S-400 air defence system in Crimea. Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council Secretary Oleksiy Danilov later attributed the strike to an unspecified Ukrainian-made missile. Ukraine has also developed its own long-range surface drones. On July 17, An explosion disabled the Kerch Bridge. Russian sources blamed naval surface drones. Russia’s defence ministry claimed to have foiled another Ukrainian attack on the Kerch Bridge on the night of August 11. Drone footage Ukraine released on August 4 showed the prow of a surface drone approaching the Olenegorsky Gornyak, a Ropucha-class Russian landing ship, before going blank at contact range. The ship had been patrolling just outside Novorossiysk – supposedly a safe port to which Russia evacuated much of its Black Sea fleet last year. Western allies have held back on long-range munitions for fear of provoking Russia. The advantage to Ukraine of self-produced weapons is that their use is unrestricted. Ukraine’s ground forces continued to expand and consolidate territorial gains in the south and east of the country during the first fortnight of September. Ukrainian forces continued a flanking manoeuvre to the south the eastern city of Bakhmut, where they have been trying to capture the town of Klishchiivka. They made marginal advances on September 1, and the general staff said they had liberated 2sq km (0.7sq miles) there 10 days later. But it was in the south that the Ukrainian counteroffensive has encountered its greatest success. Some of the best Ukrainian formations have been opening a gap in exhaustively prepared Russian minefields and trenches in western Zaporizhia. Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said on September 1 that Ukrainian troops had broken through the Russian “first line of defence”. The United States Defence Intelligence Agency’s head of analysis, Trent Maul, told The Economist he agreed with that assessment. “Their breakthrough on that second defensive belt … is actually pretty considerable,” he said, adding that Ukrainian forces had a “realistic possibility” of breaking through remaining defensive layers by the end of the year. Southern forces commander Oleksandr Tarnavskyi agreed, telling The Guardian he expected less resistance from the second and third lines of defence, because Russian forces had spent 60 percent of their time preparing the first line. “We are now between the first and second defensive lines,” Tarnavskyi said. “In the centre of the offensive, we are now completing the destruction of enemy units that provide cover for the retreat of Russian troops behind their second defensive line.” On August 31, Russian military reporters said Ukrainian forces had reached prepared defensive positions west of Verbove, and four days later geolocated footage showed they had passed Russian defences there. “Ukrainian forces advanced to tree-line positions that are east of the Russian anti-tank ditches and dragon’s teeth obstacles that are a part of a tri-layered defense immediately west of Verbove,” wrote the Washington, DC-based Institute for the Study of War, a think-tank. Dragon’s teeth are concrete triangles designed to stop tanks. Another branch of the Ukrainian counteroffensive in this area was manoeuvring between Robotyne, which Ukraine recaptured last month, and Novoprokopivka, its next target to the south. Footage released on September 5 showed Ukrainian forces overtaking Russian positions near Robotyne and the following day Russia’s occupation governor in Zaporizhia admitted Robotyne had been abandoned to pursue “more advantageous positions”. At the same time, Ukrainian troops were seen advancing along Russian trench lines toward Verbove. One of the biggest obstacles Ukrainian counteroffensive forces have faced is a dense network of minefields, but a report from the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) said the depth of those minefields going forward is unpredictable. Russian forces adapted to early clashes by increasing their minefield depth from the standard 120m (394 feet) to 500m (1,640 feet) – a depth unbreachable by mine-clearing equipment. “The increased depth of the fields means that Russian forces have had insufficient mines to consistently meet this lay down with a density of mines consistent with doctrine,” wrote RUSI. “The result has been improvisation of explosive devices, the diversification of the range of mines ceded, and the decreasing regularity of minefields.” Ukraine’s slow, deliberative approach was designed to save lives and equipment, said the RUSI report, a tactic that raised criticism from some Western observers. The success of the counteroffensive was also beginning to win converts. “NATO needs to lead a rapid re-evaluation of its doctrine now to develop the tactics and doctrine of combined arms on a shoestring,” retired Australian Army Major-General Mick Ryan wrote in Foreign Affairs. “That means, collectively, that the states of the West have to find a way to conduct ground combat in an environment where they will be subject to frequent air attacks – something they have not had to do in generations, but that Ukraine must do now.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/13/ukraines-long-arm-disrupts-crimea-its-patience-breaches-russian-defences
Talks between North Korea’s Kim and Putin end in Russia: What did they say?,The pair were expected to discuss arms deals as the Ukraine war rages. Their public comments signal deep ties.,"A meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who rarely travels outside his country, and President Vladimir Putin in Russia lasted about five hours and wrapped up on Wednesday, Russian media outlets have reported. The pair, arguably the world’s most isolated leaders, had not met since 2019. They hailed one another as Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine continues, lauding their “comradeship” as Western sanctions against both of their nations persist. The two leaders met at Russia’s most important satellite launch centre, the Vostochny Cosmodrome. North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles into the sea off its east coast, just an hour before Kim met Putin. Asked whether the two leaders would talk about obtaining supplies from North Korea to replenish Moscow’s dwindling stock of weapons and ammunition, Putin said they would discuss “all issues”. Washington and its allies believe defence cooperation was the priority of the meeting; speculation about military cooperation grew after Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu visited North Korea in July. Here’s what they have said so far about the talks, in public remarks: The pair would discuss “all issues”, Putin said, when asked if the two leaders would talk about getting supplies from North Korea. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, commenting on media speculation about a possible weapons exchange, said the West had breached many contractual obligations by sending Soviet-era weaponry to Ukraine, Reuters news agency reported. Kim did not openly speak about a possible weapons deal, which is thesubject of intense scrutinyand fear in the Asia Pacific and West. The White House warned last week that North Korea would “pay a price” if it supplied Russia with weaponry for the conflict in Ukraine. Kim promised support for Russia’s “just fight”, backing Moscow’s efforts to defend its interests. The comment was viewed as an apparent reference to the war in Ukraine. “Russia is currently engaged in a just fight against hegemonic forces to defend its sovereign rights, security and interests. I take this opportunity to affirm that we will always stand with Russia on the anti-imperialist front and the front of independence. “We believe with certainty that the Russian army and people will achieve a great victory in the just fight to punish the evil forces pursuing hegemonic and expansionary ambitions and create a stable environment for national development.” Putin welcomed Kim to the cosmodrome, saying: “Dear Mr Chairman, I am very glad to see and welcome you again in Russia – this time, as we agreed, at our Vostochny Cosmodrome. “We are proud of how this sector is developing here, and this is our new facility. I hope both you and your colleagues find this interesting. “We, of course, need to talk about questions of economic cooperation and questions of a humanitarian nature. We have a lot of questions. I want to say that I am very glad to see you. Thank you for accepting the invitation and coming to Russia.” Kim replied, “I express my gratitude to you for paying such attention to our visit to Russia. “We were also able to see with our own eyes the present and future of Russia in the construction of a space power. And we are holding a meeting with you at a very special time, right in the heart of a space power, Russia. “As you said, the Soviet Union played a very big role in the liberation of our country, as well as in the independence of our state, and our friendship has deep roots. And now, relations with the Russian Federation are the very first priority for our country. I am sure that our meeting will be the next step to take relations to a new level. “Now Russia has risen to the sacred fight to protect its sovereignty and security against the hegemonic forces that oppose Russia. And now we want to further develop the relationship. “We will always support the decisions of President Putin and the Russian leadership … I also hope that we will always be together in the fight against imperialism and for the construction of a sovereign state.”    While Putin said the “leader of the DPRK [North Korea] shows great interest in rocket engineering; they are also trying to develop space”, Kim was quoted as saying. He said he found it an “honour” to meet at the launch station, while he lauded Russia as a “space superpower”. “The glory to Russia, which gave birth to the first space conquerors, will be immortal,” Kim said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/13/putin-kim-share-warm-welcomes-in-during-second-meeting-in-four-years
Fire engulfs shipyard hit by Ukrainian missiles in Russia-annexed Crimea,Moscow-installed governor reports at least 24 injured as missile attack sparks large blaze at Sevastopol naval shipyard.,"At least 24 people have been injured and two Russian navy ships engulfed in flames following a Ukrainian missile attack on a shipyard in Sevastopol in Russian-occupied Crimea, authorities said. Sevastopol’s Russia-installed governor, Mikhail Razvozhayev, said on the Telegram messaging app that Ukraine carried out the missile attack in the early hours of Wednesday, and Russian air defences attempted to repel the incoming projectiles. Russian ships at sea had also repelled a sea-borne drone attack. Russia’s Ministry of Defence said later that Ukrainian forces launched 10 cruise missiles at the shipyard and three unmanned sea drones at Russian ships in the Black Sea. Seven missiles were shot down and the sea drones were destroyed, the ministry said, but some of the missiles damaged two ships that were being repaired at a shipyard in Sevastopol. “The Ukrainian armed forces launched a strike with 10 cruise missiles at the S. Ordzhonikidze ship repair plant,” the Russian Defence Ministry said on Telegram. “As a result of being hit by enemy cruise missiles, two ships undergoing repairs were damaged,” the ministry said. Sevastopol is the largest city in Crimea and a major port where the Russian Black Sea Fleet is based. Ukraine’s Kyiv Independent news outlet said the attack took place at approximately 3am local time (00:00 GMT). ⚡️Explosions reported near occupied Sevastopol. Photos and videos posted to Telegram on Sept. 13 appeared to show an explosion around Sevastopol, a major naval city in Russian-occupied Crimea. The blasts were reported around 3 a.m. local time. Photo: Crimeanwind/Telegrampic.twitter.com/dwIZBXFlcg — The Kyiv Independent (@KyivIndependent)September 13, 2023  Kyiv officials havepromised to retake Crimeafrom Russian control and Ukraine has stepped up air and sea attacks on the peninsula in recent weeks. Several Russian Telegram news monitoring channels reported that the shipyard, which carries out construction and repair on the ships and submarines of theBlack Sea Fleet, was on fire. The size of the fire and scale of damage at the shipyard was not immediately known, though images posted on social media showed large flames in the darkness engulfing what seemed to be port infrastructure. Russian Telegram channels posted videos and more photos of sizeable flames at a facility bordering water. Also on Wednesday morning, a Russian drone attack on the Danube River port of Izmail, inUkraine’s Odesa region, caused a fire and civilian injuries, the regional governor said. Ukraine’s military said 32 Russian drones were shot down during the attack. “Several groups of strike drones were directed to the Izmail district,” Odesa Governor Oleg Kiper said on Telegram, describing the Russian air raid on the civilian port as the action of “terrorists”. “Damage to port and other civil infrastructure was recorded … rescuers are putting out the fire,” Kiper said, adding that six civilians were injured and taken to hospital, with three in a serious condition and three others in “moderate condition”. Located on the border with Romania, Ukraine’s Danube River ports have become a key export route for Ukrainian agricultural products following Russia’s withdrawal from a United Nations-brokered grain deal in July and Moscow’s renewed blockade of the country’s Black Sea ports.

Russia’s Putin praises Elon Musk days after Ukraine Starlink controversy,Putin hailing of tech billionaire as ‘outstanding’ follows Musk’s revelation that he thwarted a Ukrainian military operation against Russia’s Black Sea fleet in Russian-annexed Crimea.,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has hailed tech billionaire Elon Musk as an “outstanding person” and businessman whose SpaceX company has become a key player in the space transportation industry. Putin’s public praise of Musk on Tuesday comes days after the South African-born and United States-based entrepreneur said herefused a Ukrainian requestlast year to activate his Starlink satellite communication network in the Russian-annexed Crimean port city of Sevastopol to aid an attack on Russia’s Black Sea fleet, saying he feared complicity in a “major” act of war. Putin, speaking at an economic forum in Russia’s Far East, did not refer to the Starlink controversy. But when asked about the success of Musk’s SpaceX company in launching rockets into space, he was full of praise. “As far as private business and Elon Musk is concerned… he is undoubtedly an outstanding person. This must be recognised, and I think it is recognised all over the world,” Putin said. “He [Musk] is an active and talented businessman and he is succeeding a lot, including with the support of the American state,” he added.    Putin also offered a defence of former US President Donald Trump and the multiple criminal cases that he is facing. The charges against Trump show the “rottenness of the American political system”, Putin said at the forum. “What is happening with Trump is a persecution of a political rival for political motives.” Trump is facing several separate criminal cases in the US, including being charged in federal court in Washington, DC with attempted election fraud over his alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. In a Georgia state court, he is charged with election interference and in federal court in Florida, he faces charges for allegedly mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House.     Earlier this month, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, one of the most hawkish voices in the Kremlin when it comes to Ukraine and the potential for a widening conflict with the West, also took to the Musk-owned X social media platform, previously known as Twitter, to praise Musk’s actions regarding Starlink, Crimea and Ukraine’s forces. Medvedev described Musk as “the last adequate mind in North America”. Ukrainian officials have criticised Musk’s decision to protect the Russian fleet from attack by Ukraine and US Democratic Party Senator Elizabeth Warren has called for an investigation of Musk’s actions. The US Congress should investigate “whether we have adequate tools to make sure foreign policy is conducted by the government and not by one billionaire”, Warren said on Monday, according to the Bloomberg news agency. Musk’s SpaceX firmwon a contractfrom the US Department of Defense to provide Ukraine with Starlink satellite communication services. Russia, which seized the strategic Crimean Peninsula in 2014 from Ukraine, bases its Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol and has used the fleet to blockade Ukrainian ports since its full-scale invasion of the country in 2022. The Russian fleet also fires cruise missiles at Ukrainian civilian targets. Kyiv has launched attacks on Russian ships using maritime drones. In a post on X last week, Musk said he had no choice but to reject an emergency request from Ukraine “to activate Starlink all the way to Sevastopol”. Musk did not give the date of the request and the excerpt did not specify it. Much appreciated, Walter. The onus is meaningfully different if I refused to act upon a request from Ukraine vs. made a deliberate change to Starlink to thwart Ukraine. At no point did I or anyone at SpaceX promise coverage over Crimea. Moreover, our terms of service clearly…https://t.co/jmNtScM5LY — Elon Musk (@elonmusk)September 9, 2023  “The obvious intent being to sink most of the Russian fleet at anchor,” Musk wrote. “If I had agreed to their request, then SpaceX would be explicitly complicit in a major act of war and conflict escalation.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/13/russias-putin-praises-elon-musk-days-after-ukraine-starlink-controversy

"China key to preventing possible Russia, North Korea arms deal, expert says",China is North Korea’s and Russia’s biggest trade partner and has influence that could prevent North Korean munitions being used in Ukraine.,"China is the key to restraining a potential arms deal between Moscow and Pyongyang, an expert on North Korean military and politics has said as Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un appear poised to meet for talks in Russia’s Far East. Kim arrivedonboard his armoured trainat the Russian border on Tuesday morning, crossing the frontier at Russia’s Khasan city en route to the meeting where the Russian leader is expected to seek access to stockpiles of North Korean ammunition, which Moscow badly needs to feed its war in Ukraine. The two leaders find themselves inchanged circumstancessince they last met in 2019, said Fyodor Tertitskiy, a historian of North Korea and leading researcher at Kookmin University’s Institute for Korean Studies in South Korea’s capital Seoul. Both leaders have items to trade,advantages to gainand pressures at home that might encourage them to align their strategic interests more closely when they meet in Russia. However, any agreement will be an “alliance of convenience” and one in which China – being the largest trading partner as well as Moscow and Pyongyang’s most powerful political patron – will tacitly have great influence in deciding the outcome, Tertitskiy said.    “The relationship between these two nations is based on lots of deception and rhetoric,” Tertitskiy told Al Jazeera, contextualising the current state of relations between Russia and North Korea. While North Korea’s Western-facing media output may take a strong stance in support of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the media North Koreans consume has remained silent on the war, Tertitskiy said. Many North Koreans may not even know that Russia has invaded its neighbour, he said. A fact not to be overlooked is that while the Soviet Union was an ally of North Korea, Russia is not, and Moscow’s approach to Pyongyang for many years has largely been to support China’s approach, Tertitskiy said. That has involved Moscow backing international sanctions on North Korea, which China supports, and refraining from supporting those Beijing does not back. While Putin’s meeting with Kim in Vladivostok in 2019 resulted in little – and their imminent meeting this week might follow a formula of smiles, mutual condemnations of the West and no follow-ups – conditions internationally and domestically have changed for both since 2022, Tertitskiy said.    Putin’s army needs a supply of millions of artillery shells to continue with its city-flattening tactics in Ukraine. Kim controls a vastdomestic arms industrythat produces munitions – artillery and rockets – compatible with Soviet-era weaponry still used by Russian forces. Similar to Putin, Kim is in dire straits at home. North Koreans are suffering serious food shortages, the economy needs commodities and fuel to keep going, and Kim wants hard currencies as well as access to the latest military technology to continue his plans for military modernisation, building more powerful intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), developingnuclear-armed attack submarinesand launching a satellite. Few could miss the symbolism should reports prove correct that the two leaders might hold their summit at Russia’s Vostochny Cosmodrome space centre in the Amur region. That Putin and Kim can satisfy one another’s strategic interest is of concern beyond the war in Ukraine, said Daniel Salisbury, a visiting research fellow at King’s College London. “North Korea desperately wants commodities such as food, oil, fertiliser and other goods,” Salisbury recently wrote in the academic news site,The Conversation.    On the other hand, Russia has “a vast military, nuclear and missile industrial complex, which…could provide Pyongyang much-needed technological fruits,” he said. “If Moscow does move towards becoming a regular customer for embargoed North Korean arms, it will help Putin sustain his illegal war on Ukraine. But the potential technological payoff for Pyongyang could pose longer-term hazards for the world and must also be considered,” he said. Last week, United Nations National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan warned North Korea that it would “pay a price” if it provided weapons to Russia, without going into detail on his threat. On Monday, the US State Department put more shape to those warnings, saying that any agreement between Kim and Putin on the trade in arms would be met witheven more sanctionsas a deal would violate United Nations Security Council resolutions. When asked at a press briefing how many entities remained in North Korea that did not have US sanctions already imposed on them, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said he was unable to answer. While the question may have sounded a little sardonic, Miller’s answer was not. North Korea has been subject to stringent UN sanctions for years due to its ongoing tests of ever more powerful ballistic missiles as well as efforts to develop nuclear weapons. Russia has also been subjected to rounds of sanctions since its invasion of Ukraine but has nevertheless continued on with its war.    Ankit Panda, an expert on North Korea’s weapons programme, lightly satirised US efforts to influence North Korea’s actions through such warnings on social media last week. “I suppose there are as-yet-untried adjectives with which we could pepper our sternly worded unilateral and joint press releases,” Panda wrote. For Tertitskiy, there is little value in pressuring Moscow and even less attempting to apply pressure on North Korea. It would be smart for the US to turn its focus to Beijing if it does not want to see North Korean weapons used on Ukrainian battlefields. The Kremlin views North Korea as firmly within China’s orbit and ”very rarely” would Moscow pursue a course of action that was not in lockstep with Beijing views. While North Korea might like to diversify from China’s outsized influence over its economy, Russia cannot afford to ignore Beijing’s position when it comes to something as controversial as a potential trade in munitions for military technology between Moscow and Pyongyang. And if a deal is done, Washington should know that, tacitly, it had the blessing of Beijing, Tertitskiy said. “My advice to President Biden or to [Secretary of State] Antony Blinken or to anyone, I would say, ‘Send your ambassador to the Chinese’,” Tertitskiy said. “China is the only power which can really stop them. Because, if they [China] say to Putin, ‘We are displeased at this, this is our sphere of influence, do not trade with these guys’, Putin will probably follow because he can’t afford angering the Chinese”.

Poland threatens to keep Ukrainian grain ban after embargo date expires,Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said he has requested that the European Commission extend the ban.,"Poland’s government has called on the European Union to extend theembargo on imports of Ukrainian grainbeyond an end-of-week deadline to protect Polish farmers. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Tuesday he has requested that the European Commission, the EU’s executive, extend the ban on the entry of Ukraine corn, wheat, sunflower and rapeseed or else “we will do it ourselves because we cannot allow for a deregulation of the market.” Speaking to farmers in Kosow Lacki, in Poland’s farming east region, Morawiecki said that the October 15 parliamentary elections will be key for the future of Poland’s agriculture. The governing conservative Law and Justice party is seeking to attract farmer voters in its campaign. Earlier on Tuesday, Morawiecki said on X, formally known as Twitter, “Poland will not allow Ukraine grain to flood us.” “Regardless of the decisions of the clerks in Brussels, we will not open up our borders,” he added. The European Parliament is also set to debate the topic. Ukraine’s neighbours, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Romania, agreed with the European Union to impose an embargo on grain produced from Kyiv from April until September 15 to prevent a knock-on effect on its farmers. Only sealed goods are allowed to help Ukraine send its produce overseas as Russia blocks its usual export routes during the war. On Tuesday, EU Agriculture Commissioner Janusz Wojciechowski said he was trying to extend the embargo. Wojciechowski is Poland’s former agriculture minister. Some leaders of Polish farm groups were to attend the EU Parliament debate, including Michal Kolodziejczak, an opposition candidate running in the October elections. Poland has been supporting neighbouring Ukraine with military and humanitarian assistance as it fights Russia’s invasion, but following farmer protests, Warsaw has been adamant in banning imports of Ukrainian agriculture products. “We are ready to support Ukraine during the war and during its reconstruction and we want to take part in the reconstruction but at the same time, we must remember about our citizens, our agriculture and our countryside,” Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the ruling party leader and deputy prime minister, said at the start of the Cabinet meeting. “Our Ukrainian friends should understand that,” he said. But Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmygal said on Tuesday that Kyiv was considering legal action about the ban. “We have no intention of harming Polish farmers … but in case of violation of trade law in the interest of political populism before the elections, Ukraine will be forced to turn to WTO arbitration to obtain compensation for violation of GATT norms,” he said on social media, referring to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

Putin calls Trump legal cases ‘politically motivated persecution’,"Trump, the frontrunner Republican candidate for the 2024 US presidential elections, is facing a series of criminal cases by US authorities.","Russian President Vladimir Putin says the cases against former US President Donald Trump are political revenge that shows the fundamental corruption of American politics. Trump, the frontrunner Republican candidate for the 2024 United States presidential elections, is facing a series of criminal cases. He is charged with, among other things, trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat to President Joe Biden. Speaking at the Eastern Economic Forum gathering in Russia’s Vladivostok on Tuesday, Putin said: “As for Trump, for us what is happening in today’s conditions, in my opinion, is good because it shows the rottenness of the American political system, which cannot pretend to teach others democracy. “Everything that is happening with Trump is the persecution of a political rival for political reasons. That’s what it is. And this is being done in front of the public of the United States and the whole world.” During his four years in office, Trump repeatedly praised his good relations with Putin and claimed more recentlyhe could resolve the Ukraine warin a matter of days if he regains the presidency. “We hear Mr Trump say he will solve pressing problems in a few days, including the Ukrainian crisis. Well, this cannot but bring happiness. This is good,” Putin said. But he said the idea Trump hadspecial ties with Russiawas “complete nonsense”. However, Putin reiterated that Russia’s relations with the US are unlikely to change regardless of who leads the country. “What to expect from the future, no matter who the president is, it’s hard for us to say, but it’s unlikely that anything will change radically,” Putin said. He claimed the Biden administration has a strong bias against Russia and “it will be very difficult for them to somehow turn this whole ship” in the other direction. Relations between Moscow and Washington, already strained during Trump’s presidency, have plunged to post-Cold War lows under Biden following Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine in February 2022. Putin, who served in the Soviet security services, said the legal efforts against Trump “show who we are fighting …As they said in Soviet times, ‘the bestial face of American imperialism’.” Putin added Western efforts to “restrain” China’s ascent as a global power were doomed to fail as he hailed Moscow’s “amazing” relations with Beijing. “Today the West is trying to restrain the development of China because it sees that China, under the leadership of our friend [President Xi Jinping] … is developing by leaps and bounds. This leaves them shocked,” said Russia’s leader. “They are doing everything to slow down the development of China, but this will not be possible. They are too late. That’s it, the train has left.” In separate comments, Putin said the West’s decision to supply Ukraine with cluster bombs anddepleted uranium munitionswas a crime, and while such supplies might prolong the war, they would not change its outcome.

"Ukraine says Black Sea gas, oil platforms recaptured from Russian control",Ukrainian military intelligence says offshore platforms in Black Sea retaken by Kyiv forces in ‘unique operation’.,"The Ukrainian militarysaid it has recapturedseveral strategic gas and oil drilling platforms from Russia in the Black Sea close to Crimea, which Moscow’s forces had occupied since 2015. The recapture of the so-called Boyko Towers platforms, which was reported on Monday, takes back an asset that Russia seized duringthe annexation of Crimeaand places Kyiv closer to retaking the occupied peninsula, according to Ukrainian military intelligence (GUR). The GUR said on the Telegram messaging app that Ukrainian forces had retaken the drilling platforms in a “unique operation”. “For Ukraine, regaining control of the Boyko Towers was of strategic importance and, as a result, Russia lost the ability to use them for military purposes,” the GUR said on Telegram. “Russia has been deprived of the ability to fully control the waters of the Black Sea, and this makes Ukraine many steps closer to regaining Crimea,” the agency added. During the operation, there was a clash between Ukrainian special forces on boats and a Russian fighter jet, which was damaged and forced to retreat, the GUR said, adding that “valuable trophies” such as helicopter munitions and a radar system that can track the movement of ships in the Black Sea were seized at the platforms. The Russian defence ministry did not make any immediate comment on the Ukrainian claim, but the ministry has previously reported that Russian warplanes destroyed several Ukrainian speedboats in the area in recent days. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s Ministry of Internal Affairs, said early on Tuesday that regaining control of the Boyko Towers was important as the structures were used by Russian forces for “all sorts of monitoring, control, and surveillance sensors, expanding the Russian operational capabilities” in the Black Sea. Ukraine has regained control over the so-called ""Boyko Towers"" –  Defense Intelligence of Ukraine.

This step was crucial not only in Ukraine’s struggle for the Black Sea but also for more space for its coastal and air operations,” he wrote. Russian military bloggers claimed on Monday that the platforms had been uninhabited for more than a year and that a Ukrainian operation to briefly land troops on the structures last month was not followed by a permanent military presence and came at a heavy cost to Ukraine’s forces.    Before Russia seized the Crimean Peninsula, Ukraine extracted a significant part of its natural gas from the Black Sea shelf, providing gas not only for Crimea but also to mainland regions of Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy haspromised to do all he can to liberate Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. The Ukrainian leader has urged international allies to support Kyiv’s efforts to retake the peninsula. The retaking of the Black Sea gas and oil platforms follows a report by the United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defence noting naval and air force skirmishes between Russian and Ukrainian forces at sea two weeks ago. Ukraine has struck several Russian-controlled platforms in fighting during the war and soldiers from both countries have occupied the structures periodically, the UK said in a military update on the war. Along with drilling, the platforms can be used to land helicopters, as deployment bases and to position long-range missile systems.

‘A new and terrifying world’: Kim and Putin to meet again in Russia,"With the Russian leader in need of weapons for the war in Ukraine, Kim Jong Un is expected to extract a high price.","North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin held their first-ever summit in 2019. Kim travelled to Vladivostok in his armoured train where the men spent two days enjoying folk dances, feasting on borscht and reindeer dumplings, and toasting the burgeoning relationship between their two countries. At that time, broadly supportive of the United Nations sanctions imposed on Pyongyang over its weapons programme, Putin promised to do what he could with China and the United States to break the impasse in denuclearisation talks. Four years later, Kim and Putin are due to meet again. This time, however, it is all about arms sales and technology transfer. “It’s a new and terrifying world we are entering,” In-bum Chun, a retired Lieutenant General in the South Korean army and an expert on North Korea’s military and politics, told Al Jazeera. “Putin will receive weapons and North Korea, [the] technology to improve its nuclear weapons’ capabilities.” A big reason for the change isMoscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukrainein February 2022. Moscow had hoped for a swift end to the conflict but the fighting has dragged on for more than 18 months. And Russia is now not only far more isolated on the world stage than it was in 2019, but also the target of sanctions. “This is a war of attrition,” said Mason Richey, an associate professor of international politics at Hankuk University for Foreign Studies in the South Korean capital Seoul. “We think of this as a war of people but that’s where Russia has a relative advantage. Where Ukraine has an advantage is in ‘metal’ – the military assets. It can count on support from the US and Europe. They’ve gone chips all in on supporting Ukraine.” According to the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank, Russiausedsome 12 million shells in Ukraine in 2022 and is expected to use some 7 million this year. Its munitions factories have the capacity to produce just 2.5 million shells a year. Given sanctions imposed on Moscow and the consequences of breaching them, “Russia’s search for ammunition partners has turned up a hodgepodge of aggrieved, ambitious and opportunistic nations,” Matthew Sussex, an expert in Russian foreign policy at the Australian National University, wrote in The Conversation on September 10. While North Korea has spent much of the recent past testing out the new weapons andmilitary equipmentit is developing to modernise its military, the country still has plenty of “metal” – from shells to ammunition – and the ability to produce it in large quantities. Bruce Bechtol, a professor in politics at Angelo State University in the US who has published books on the North Korean regime and its military proliferation, says Kim would probably be able to offer Russia 152mm artillery guns and different kinds of multiple rocket launchers, as well as small arms such as the Type 73 light machine gun, AK-47 assault rifle and the ammunition necessary for such systems. “There is no doubt that North Korea is very good at producing Soviet-designed systems of older design and turning them out rather quickly,” Bechtol told Al Jazeera. Chun agrees Pyongyang has a “full range of conventional weapons” on offer as well as drones, portable shoulder-fired missiles (MANPADS), and “a very capable anti-tank system called the Bulsae, which is similar to the Russian Kornet”. North Korea could even send soldiers, he added. And while the US, which first indicated last year that North Korea was prepared to send arms to Russia, has said Russia’s purchase of such weapons is a sign of desperation, analysts are not so sure. “North Korean weapons are reliable and inexpensive,” Chun said. “North Korea is also willing to sell. Why wouldn’t the Russians buy from them.”    Moscow and Pyongyang have maintained close ties since Soviet times – hence the older and compatible military hardware – but have moved closer since the start of the Ukraine invasion. But analysts point out that while Pyongyang once saw the Moscow relationship as largely transactional – useful for its leverage on China, its main ally – that is now changing. North Korea has emerged as one of the few emphatic supporters of the Russian invasion. It backed Moscow at the UN in March 2022, weeks after the invasion, and afew months later recognisedthe so-called Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic in partly-occupied eastern Ukraine as independent states. Moscow has also appeared to be moresupportive of North Koreain the UN, preventing any action on Pyongyang’s missile tests despite serial sanctions violations. In July, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu visited Pyongyang. The guest of honour at the Victory Day celebrations in Pyongyang, Shoigu was the first Russian defence minister to visit the country since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Shoigu stood next to Kim to watch the military parade through Kim Il Sung Square, the North Korean leader was alsopictured showing Shoiguaround a defence exhibition showcasing North Korea’s latest weaponry, including banned ballistic missiles. Writing to Putin in August, when Pyongyang commemorates the end of Japanese colonialism in the Korean Peninsula, Kim said Russia and North Korea’s friendship had been forged with the victory over Japan in World War II, and called for the further development of a “a long-standing strategic partnership … with the demand(s) of the new era”. Putin told Kim, meanwhile, that he expected the two countries would “strengthen bilateral cooperation in all fields”. The question for many is the price that Russia, a permanent veto-holding member of the Security Council, would be willing to pay for the weaponry. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the problems facing the North Korean economy but as he sits down with Putin, Kim’s focus is likely to be on the military and his ongoing plan to develop new weapons and equipment. “It’s Kim’s best chance in a long time to get some assistance from the Russians,” Robert Kelly told Al Jazeera. “Putin’s in a tight spot. He needs this stuff.” North Korea, which the UN has accused ofletting its people sufferwhile it develops its military might, will probably demand food or energy aid in exchange for the arms. But most analysts expect Kim to push Putin to share key military technology, including for Russia’s nuclear-powered submarines. Some already suspect Russian involvement – whether through technical assistance or proliferation – in recent North Korean weapons. Bechtol points to the new weapons’ similarities with Russia’s Iskander missile and its newfound capabilities in hypersonic missile technology. “All in all, Russia may be the biggest enabler of North Korea today, even more so than China,” wrote Victor Cha and Ellen Kim of the Washington, DC-based think tank the Center for Strategic and International Studies, in a commentary on September 6. “The latter has not been supportive of the denuclearization agenda and has not helped to bring Pyongyang back to the negotiating table, given the state of U.S.-China relations. But Beijing reportedly has been opposed to North Korea conducting a seventh nuclear test. This stands in contrast to potential arms and missile deals being negotiated by Moscow that could accelerate North Korea’s military satellite, nuclear submarine and ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) programs.” The US said last week that North Korea would “pay a price” for selling arms to Moscow but with Pyongyang sanctioned to the hilt, it seems there are few real options for Washington to increase pressure on Pyongyang. Kim, meanwhile, will be looking at his wish list of weaponry and hoping his friends in Moscow will provide him with the assistance he needs to ensure his military dreams move closer to reality. The security ramifications of the two men’s latest meeting in Vladivostok are likely to be felt far beyond Ukraine.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/12/a-new-and-terrifying-world-kim-and-putin-to-meet-again-in-russia

US threatens sanctions if North Korea sells arms to Russia,Biden administration says Vladimir Putin is ‘begging’ Kim Jong Un for weapons due to failures with his Ukraine invasion.,"Washington, DC –As Russian President Vladimir Putin prepares to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, the United States has threatened to “aggressively” enforce existing sanctions and add new ones if Pyongyang provides weapons to Moscow for itswar in Ukraine. US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Monday that the US will continue to “hold accountable” entities that help Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine. “I will remind both countries that any transfer of arms from North Korea to Russia would be in violation of multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions,” Miller told reporters. “We, of course, have aggressively enforced our sanctions against entities that fund Russia’s war effort, and we will continue to enforce those sanctions and will not hesitate to impose new sanctions if appropriate.” He did not specify whether the US would impose penalties on North Korea, Russia or both, saying that the US is monitoring the situation and will “wait and see what the outcome of the meeting is before speculating”. Both Russia and North Korea are already underheavy US sanctions. Moscow and Pyongyang have confirmed thatPutin and Kimare set to meet in the coming days.    On Monday, the Russian president travelled to attend an economic forum in the far eastern Pacific port city of Vladivostok, wherehe met Kimin 2019. Miller argued that, by turning to Kim — an “international pariah” — for help, Putin is showing that his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 was a“strategic failure”. “There’s no better evidence of that than now. A year and a half later, not only has he failed to achieve his goals on the battlefield, but you see him travelling across his own country, hat in hand, to beg Kim Jong Un for military assistance,” Miller said on Monday. After failing to capture the Ukrainian capital in the early weeks of the invasion, Russia has limited its war goals to occupying eastern parts of the country. Ukraine launcheda counteroffensiveearlier this year but has only made modest gains against Russian forces. “We continue to assess that the Ukrainians are making progress in their counteroffensive, and we have confidence in the ability of their forces,” Miller said.    The US, which provides billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine, has beenwarning its competitors and adversaries— including China — against helping Russia in its military offensive. In the past two weeks, Washington has repeatedly urged Pyongyang against selling arms to Moscow. When asked on Monday why the US is concerned that the Kim-Putin meeting would be about a weapons deal, Miller responded that it is not a “social gathering”. Russia and North Korea have signalled that their relations have grown closer in recent months. In July, for example, Russia’s Defence Minister Sergei Shoiguvisited North Korea— the first time a Russian defence chief had done so since 1991. While there, Shoigu met with Kim to discuss “strategic and tactical collaboration”. Kim and Putin alsoexchanged letterslast month vowing to bolster cooperation between their two countries. Last year, the US also accused North Korea ofcovertly shippingartillery shells to Russia, an allegation that was denied by both Moscow and Pyongyang. Separately, tensions have been intensifying betweenPyongyang and Washingtonover North Korea’s nuclear programme and increased missile testing. North Korea has framed these missile launches as a defensive response to joint US military drills with South Korea and Japan near the Korean Peninsula.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/11/us-threatens-sanctions-if-north-korea-sells-arms-to-russia
Brazil’s Lula backtracks on Putin arrest safety at Rio G20,Brazilian president faces criticism after saying ‘no way’ Vladimir Putin would be arrested in Brazil under ICC warrant.,"Brazil’s leader has withdrawnhis personal assurancethat Russian President Vladimir Putin would not be arrested if he attends next year’s Group of 20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, saying it would be up to the judiciary to decide. PresidentLuiz Inacio Lula da Silvaalso questioned Brazil’s membership in the United Nations war crimes court, saying on Monday that “emerging countries often sign things that are detrimental to them”. “I want to know why we are members but not the United States, not Russia, not India, not China,” Lula said. “I’m not saying I’m going to leave the court. I just want to know why Brazil is a signatory.” Putin missed this year’s G20 gathering in the Indian capital, New Delhi, avoiding possible criticism over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and any risk of criminal detention under an International Criminal Court (ICC) warrant.    The ICCannounced the arrest warrant for Putinin March over the Russian president’s suspected involvement in the unlawful deportation and transfer of children from occupied areas of Ukraine to Russia. The Kremlin has denied the war crime accusation, insisting the warrant against Putin is “void”. Russia also issued anarrest warrant in May for Karim Khan, the prosecutor at The Hague-based war crimes court, who also has been added to the “wanted list” of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs. Brazil is a signatory to the Rome Statute, which led to the founding of the ICC and obliges members to comply with its arrest warrants. Lula raised eyebrows at the weekend when he told Indian news network Firstpost: “If I’m the president of Brazil and if he [Putin] comes to Brazil,there’s no way that he will be arrested.” Oliver Stuenkel, a professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation in Sao Paulo, said the Brazilian president’s comments were “damaging and unnecessary”. “Rather than projecting himself as the elder statesman, Lula came across as inexperienced and ignorant,” Stuenkel wrote on social media. Amid the criticism, Lula changed tack on Monday at a press conference in Brazil, telling reporters that he didn’t know if Putin would be detained in the South American nation. “It’s the judiciary that decides, it’s not the government,” Lula said.    Putin has skipped recent international gatherings and sent his Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to New Delhi instead for the September 9-10 G20 meeting, even though India is not an ICC signatory. On Saturday, the G20 nations adopted a declaration that avoided condemning Moscow for the war in Ukraine but called on all states to refrain from using force to grab territory. The next summit is slated for November 2024 in Rio de Janeiro and Lula said he hoped “by thenthe waris over”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/11/brazils-lula-backtracks-on-putin-arrest-safety-at-rio-g20
Putin’s party wins controversial polls in annexed Ukraine regions: Reports,"State media says Putin’s United Russia won more than 70 percent of the vote in the war-battered territories of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhia and Kherson.","Russia has wrapped up widely condemned regional and municipal elections, including in four eastern regionsannexed from Ukraine, delivering strong support for President Vladimir Putin. The week-long polls, which wrapped up on Sunday, took place amid criticism of vote rigging andUkraine’s push to reclaim its territories. The Council of Europe, Europe’s leading rights group, called the polls a flagrant violation of international law, while Kyiv and its allies said they were an illegal attempt to tighten Moscow’s grip over regions in Ukraine’s south and east. Data published by Moscow and proxy officials showed voters in Ukraine’s war-battered regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhia and Kherson had backed Putin’s United Russia party with more than 70 percent of the ballot in each territory, state-run news agencies reported. Detailed voting figures were not immediately released. All but a handful of Russia’s allies recognise the regions as part of Ukraine. The results mean that Moscow’s handpicked governors in the territories, a mixture of veteran separatist bosses and small-time local pro-Russian politicians, win full terms in office. None of the four regions are fully controlled by the Russian army. Ukraine, which in June began a gruelling counteroffensive to liberate the lands, has been slowly regaining territory in the Zaporizhia region and has also claimed some advances in Donetsk around the shattered city of Bakhmut. Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president and leader of United Russia, thanked all voters who turned up to cast their ballots in the annexed regions. “We value votes of all voters, but, probably, people living in our new territories … their votes have an absolute significance for our party,” he was quoted as saying by the TASS news agency. “This is not a mere mandate of trust… to a certain extent, this is an act of civic courage indeed and our party should treat it this way.”    Across Russia, United Russia won every provincial governor’s race it contested. In the regions voting, however, electoral competition was limited as strong candidates, including some from Russia’s main opposition Communist Party, were blocked from running by authorities. All significant, legal political forces in Russia, including the patchwork of opposition parties that provide a semblance of competition at the polls, are broadly loyal to Putin and his 18-month-old war in Ukraine. Stanislav Andreychuk, co-chair of Golos, a voter rights group designated a “foreign agent” by the Russian government, said instances of vote rigging in many parts of Russia showed that “these are not real elections”. Andreychuk said his organisation had received reports of opposition candidates being detained, having their cars vandalised and, in one case, military draft papers being served to election observers. “They are doing some absolutely unthinkable things”, he said. But the Kremlin said elections were free and fair in Russia and that opinion polls and numerous election wins show that Putin is by far the most popular politician in the country. Among the regional chiefs re-elected was powerful Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin, a close Putin ally. With virtually no opposition, early results showed that Sobyanin took more than 75 percent of the vote in the Russian capital, considered among the most opposition-leaning parts of the country. In 2013, Sobyanin was almost defeated by anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny. The opposition politician, who was jailed in 2020 on old fraud charges his allies say were a pretext to end his political work, dismissed the vote from behind bars. Before the election, Moscow residents had praised Sobyanin for modernising Europe’s largest city. The Kremlin loyalist – who has been in office since 2010 – has presided over numerous mega-projects that have transformed Moscow’s skyline. “Moscow is blossoming in front of our eyes,” 21-year-old student Rukhin Aliyev told the AFP news agency. Musician Kirill Lobanov said Sobyanin had done “very well” as mayor, particularly “in the last year”marked by the conflict. Kremlin critics have said that elections in Moscow are easily rigged due to the capital’s system of electronic voting, which they say is impossible to audit. Similar systems have been rolled out in many other Russian regions. Observers say one of the few competitive races in Russia’s 11 time zones emerged in Siberia’s remote Khakassia, where Governor Valentin Konovalov is seeking re-election. The 35-year-old Communist defeated a Kremlin-backed candidate in 2018 after a wave of rare protests in the sparsely populated mountainous region. In this year’s campaign, he initially faced Moscow-backed candidate Sergei Sokol, who portrayed himself as a Kremlin-decorated “hero” who fought in Ukraine. Sokol dropped out at the last minute, citing health reasons. Konovalov is one of few regional leaders not backed by the Kremlin who remains in office.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/11/putins-party-wins-controversial-polls-in-annexed-ukraine-regions-reports

Five key takeaways from G20 summit: ‘We need bolder action’,"India managed to get the disparate group to sign off on a final statement despite pointed disagreements among powerful members, mostly over Russia’s war in Ukraine.","The Group of 20 summit in New Delhi managed to defy expectations on Sunday and reach consensus on a joint declaration by world leaders, but not without compromises over the Ukraine conflict and action on climate change. The consensus came as a surprise. In the weeks leading to the summit, sharply differing views on the war threatened to derail the meeting with Western nations demanding members call out Moscow for the invasion and Russia saying it would block any resolution that did not reflect its position. The Global South’s position in the talks helped prevent the G20 agenda from being overshadowed by Ukraine, according to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. “India has truly consolidated G20 members from the Global South.” Here are five key takeaways from the two-day summit: The G20 leading economies began the weekend’s proceedings by welcoming the African Union (AU), thenewest member of a blocthat already represented 85 percent of the world’s gross domestic product (GDP). Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has portrayed this weekend as India’s diplomatic coming of age and his country’s presidency as an opportunity to give a voice to the needs ofthe Global South. Modi opened the summit’s formal proceedings by inviting AU President Azali Assoumani to take a seat alongside world leaders with the ceremonial bang of a gavel. Before Saturday, the G20 comprised 19 countries and the European Union with South Africa its only member state from the continent. The AU at full strength has 55 members, but six military-ruled nations are currently suspended. It has a collective GDP of $3 trillion with some 1.4 billion people. G20 leaders have been deeply riven over the Ukraine war since Moscow’s invasion last year, with Russian President Vladimir Putin skipping the summit entirely to dodge political opprobrium. Facing the prospect of a major diplomatic embarrassment, host India pressed members to agree on a common statement that watered down its earlier condemnation of the war. The G20 denounced the use of force for territorial gain, but refrained from direct criticism of Russia by name. “There were different views and assessments of the situation,” the leaders’ statement said. Ukraine’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Oleg Nikolenko criticised the statement, saying the G20 had “nothing to be proud of”. Leaders failed to agree ona phase-out of fossil fuelsdespite a United Nations report a day earlier deeming the drawdown “indispensable” to achieving net-zero emissions. G20 nations account for about 80 percent of global emissions and an inability to agree on the phase-out is a cloud over a key round of climate discussions to begin in November in the oil-rich United Arab Emirates. “We need stronger, bolder action from leaders,” said Madhura Joshi, senior associate at climate think tank E3G. But for the first time, the G20 backed a target of tripling global renewable energy capacity and referenced the need for emissions to peak before 2025. It also acknowledged limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) will require slashing greenhouse gases 43 percent by 2030 from 2019 levels. A broad alliance – including the United States and Saudi Arabia – unveiled ambitious plans to createa modern-day Spice Routelinking Europe, the Middle East and India. If the initiative goes ahead, it would establish railways, ports, electricity and data networks and hydrogen pipelines across the Middle East in a counterbalance to lavish Chinese infrastructure spending, potentially speeding trade between India and Europe by up to 40 percent. The plans are also being touted as a means of helping to normalise relations between Israel and Gulf Arab states. For days, India has been abuzz with rumours that the official usage of the country’s English name would be dropped. Modi gave the biggest signal yet of a potential change in his opening address to the summit, seated behind a country nameplate labelled “Bharat”, a word steeped inHindu religious symbolismand dating back to ancient scripture. India and Bharat are both official names for the country under its constitution. Members of Modi’s Hindu nationalist party have campaigned against using the better-known moniker India, which has roots in Western antiquity and was imposed during the British conquest.

"Ukraine, Russia report downing dozens of drones over Kyiv, Crimea",The extent of damage and casualties from the rival attacks in Kyiv and Crimea is not immediately clear.,"Ukraine has reported downing more than two dozen Russian drones over the country’s capital, Kyiv, as Russia’s defence ministry announced the destruction of eight Ukrainian drones near the annexed Crimean peninsula. The extent of the damage from the rival attacks early on Sunday was not immediately clear. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said that at least one person was wounded in the city’s historic Podil neighbourhood and a fire broke out near one of its parks. Debris from downed drones fell on the Darnytskyi, Solomianskyi, Shevchenkivskyi, Sviatoshynskyi and Podil districts, Klitschko and the city’s military administration said. In the Shevchenkivskyi district, debris sparked a fire in an apartment, which was quickly distinguished. There were no immediate reports of injuries, Serhiy Popko, head of Kyiv’s military administration, said on the Telegram messaging app. “Drones entered the capital in groups and from different directions. Air defence forces managed to destroy more than two dozen enemy UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles),” Popko said, adding that the exact number would be announced by Ukraine’s air force. The AFP news agency said at least 10 explosions were heard over Kyiv. There was no immediate comment from Russia about the attacks. The Russian defence ministry, however, said the country’s air defence systems destroyed eight Ukraine-launched drones over the Black Sea near the Crimean Peninsula. The ministry, in a statement on Telegram, did not immediately say if there were any damages or injuries. There was no immediate comment from Ukraine.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/10/ukraine-russia-report-downing-dozens-of-drones-over-kyiv-crimea

He added that he himself planned to attend a BRICS bloc of developing nations meeting due in Russia before the Rio meeting. “I believe that Putin can go easily to Brazil,” Lula said. “What I can say to you is that if I’m president of Brazil, and he comes to Brazil, there’s no way he will be arrested.” The statement comes after the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued anarrest warrant against Putinin March, accusing him of the war crime of illegally deporting hundreds of children from Ukraine. Russia has denied its forces have engaged in war crimes or forcibly taken Ukrainian children. Putin has repeatedly skipped international gatherings and was not present at the G20 get-together in Delhi, sending Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Brazil is a signatory to the Rome Statute which led to the founding of the ICC. Lula’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On Saturday, the G20 nationsadopted a consensus declarationthat avoided condemning Russia for the war in Ukraine but called on all states not to use force to grab territory. The consensus came as a surprise as the G20 is deeply divided over the war in Ukraine, with Western nations earlier pushing for strong condemnation of Russia in the Leaders’ Declaration, while others demanded a focus on broader economic issues. “We call on all states to uphold the principles of international law including territorial integrity and sovereignty, international humanitarian law, and the multilateral system that safeguards peace and stability,” the declaration said. “We … welcome all relevant and constructive initiatives that support a comprehensive, just, and durable peace in Ukraine. “The use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible,” the statement added.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/10/lula-says-putin-will-not-be-arrested-at-brazil-g20-meeting
"North Korea’s Kim marks founding day with parade, promises to China, Russia",Paramilitary group the Worker-Peasant Red Guards – with 5.7 million members – featured prominently in the parade.,"Kim Jong Un has marked the 75th anniversary of the founding of North Korea with a parade of paramilitary forces and promises to deepen ties with Chinaand Russia. The North Korean leader attended the midnight parade on Friday in Pyongyang’s Kim Il Sung Square which was also attended by a visiting Chinese delegation and Russian diplomats, the country’s state Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported on Saturday. The event featured “paramilitary forces” from the capital, Pyongyang, state media said, rather than soldiers in the regular army, and it did not appear to showcase thecountry’s fearsome domestically produced weaponryincluding intercontinental ballistic missiles. Images in state media showed uniformed paramilitary brigades, including some riding tractors or in large red trucks, as Kim, flanked by his young daughter, looked on smiling and clapping. South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency noted that Kim did not deliver a speech at the event and that the parade was mostly led by the Worker-Peasant Red Guards, a civil defence organisation that is said to have about 5.7 million members. Kim met with avisiting Chinese delegation led by Liu Guozhong, vice-premier of the State Council, the second such visit by top officials from Beijing in six weeks. Russian diplomats also attended the event, as well as a Russian military song-and-dance ensemble which had arrived in Pyongyang to mark the occasion, KCNA reported. KCNA said Kim met with Liu and other Chinese delegates ahead of the parade, where they exchanged views on “further intensifying the multi-faceted coordination and cooperation” between the countries. In July, Kim invited delegations led by Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chinese Communist Party Politburo member Li Hongzhong to a huge military parade in Pyongyang, where he rolled out his country’s most powerful weapons. A day before the parade, Kim took Shoigu on a tour of a domestic arms exhibition, which has added to suspicions thatNorth Korea is willing to supply arms to Russia to help in its war on Ukraine. Moscow expanded its official presence in North Korea shortly before the parade, with its Pyongyang embassy saying this week that it had been allowed to bring in 20 diplomatic and technical staff – the first such rotation of personnel since 2019. Russian President Vladimir Putin sent Kim a message marking the anniversary, KCNA said, in which he called for the two countries to “expand the bilateral ties in all respects”. Kim is expected to travel to Russia this month to meet Putin to discuss weapons supplies to Moscow to support its invasion of Ukraine. According to Chinese state media, President Xi Jinping “extended congratulations in a call to Kim Jong Un” on the anniversary.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/9/north-koreas-kim-marks-founding-day-with-parade-promises-to-china-russia

Russia detains man accused of plotting rail bombing in Crimea,A Russian citizen is accused of preparing a bombing under the instructions of Ukraine’s military intelligence.,"Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) has detained a man for plotting a rail bombing inCrimeaas a drone was downed over the Moscow-occupied peninsula. Crimea, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014, has been targeted by Ukrainian drone raids andsabotage attacksas Kyiv tries to retake the peninsula. The FSB said on Friday the suspect – a Russian citizen in his mid-40s – had been “collecting information on the deployment of Russian defence ministry facilities and units” and was preparing a railway bombing. “In a hiding place he had organised [we] found and seized an improvised explosive device made using foreign-made plastic explosives,” it said. It said the man had been acting on the “instructions of Ukrainian military intelligence” and had been remanded in custody. Russia’s TASS news agency said the man was a resident of the Crimean city of Sevastopol. Video footage on the agency’s website showed a man dressed in a black T-shirt and jeans being taken out of a police van. It also showed the man with a blurred face giving a statement about how he was recruited by the Ukrainian military intelligence. The Russian-appointed governor of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, warned that transport infrastructure had become a main target for “terrorism” and that Ukrainian saboteurs would be punished. “An unenviable fate awaits the Ukrainian agents. They will be found and punished,” he said. He later said a Ukrainian drone had been shot down over the north of the peninsula but did not report any further details.

Ukraine’s Zelenskyy and Israel’s Netanyahu discuss Israeli support for Kyiv,"While Israel has backed Ukraine diplomatically, it has not assisted the war-torn country with arms against Russian invasion.","President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have held a meeting to discuss how Israel could assist Ukraine in its war with Russia. The pair met as Zelenskyy pressed for more open help from the Israeli state on Thursday. “The president noted the importance of Israel’s support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” said a readout on Ukraine’s presidential website. “The two sides discussed possible paths of Israeli support for Ukraine in opposing Russia’s invasion.” Netanyahu’s office said the two leaders discussed “the continuation of Israeli assistance to Ukraine, including to Ukrainian refugees in Israel, as well as the advancement of development assistance of civilian air defence systems”. While Israel has supported Ukraine diplomatically, it has not assisted the country with arms as the 18-month conflict persists. Israel has been taking heed it must coordinate its air strikes against Iran in Syria with Moscow, given Russia’s ties to Damascus.    During the meeting, Netanyahu also urged Zelenskyy to ensure the safety of Hasidic Jews arriving to the country later this month to central Ukraine for an annual pilgrimage. The pilgrims, traveling from around the world, will visit the city of Uman, the burial place of Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, who revived the Hasidic movement and died in 1810. Zelenskyy, who is of Jewish descent, said Ukraine is ready to accommodate the pilgrims, but noted air raid shelters can only hold 11,000 people, while Israel estimates up to 50,000 could take part. “This is a security challenge which will require an emergency joint response,” the presidential website quoted him as saying.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/8/ukraines-zelenskyy-and-israels-netanyahu-discuss-israeli-support-for-kyiv
Zelenskyy adviser claims Elon Musk allowed Russians to hit Ukrainian cities,Comments by Mykhailo Podolyak follow revelations in a book that Musk severed crucial Starlink satellite signal during a Ukrainian drone operation.,"Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak has slammed Elon Musk for indirectly allowing Russian forces to attack Ukrainian cities after it was revealed his Starlink satellite communications interfered with a drone operation. Details of the incident are laid out in a biography of Musk by Walter Isaacson, due out on Tuesday. The book describes how the network turned off communications near the coast of the Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula as Ukrainian drones were approaching Russian warships, resulting in “lost connectivity”. Musk allegedly ordered Starlink engineers to turn off the communications as he feared Russian President Vladimir Putin would respond with nuclear weapons to a Ukrainian attack on Crimea, according to Isaacson’s book. “I think if the Ukrainian attacks had succeeded in sinking the Russian fleet, it would have been like a mini Pearl Harbor and led to a major escalation,” Musk isquoted as saying. “We did not want to be a part of that.” Podolyak chose X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter that Musk owns, to launch a scathing attack on the tech billionaire. In his post, he said by “not allowing” Ukrainian drones to attack Russian warships, Musk “allowed this fleet to fire Kalibr missiles at Ukrainian cities” – an action he said resulted in the death of civilians and children. Sometimes a mistake is much more than just a mistake.

As a result, civilians, children are… — Михайло Подоляк (@Podolyak_M)September 7, 2023  Responding to the excerpt in the book, Musk on Friday said he refused the request saying he feared complicity in a “major” act of war. In the post on X, Musk said he had no choice but to reject an emergency request from Ukraine “to activate Starlink all the way to Sevastopol”. “The obvious intent being to sink most of the Russian fleet at anchor,” Musk wrote. “If I had agreed to their request, then SpaceX would be explicitly complicit in a major act of war and conflict escalation.” There was an emergency request from government authorities to activate Starlink all the way to Sevastopol.

If I had agreed to their request, then SpaceX would be explicitly complicit in a major act of war and… — Elon Musk (@elonmusk)September 7, 2023  Podolyak has criticised Musk before. In February, he wrote, “A year of Ukrainian resistance & companies have to decide: Either they are on the side of Ukraine & the right to freedom, and don’t seek ways to do harm. Or they are on Russia’s side & its ‘right’ to kill & seize territories.” SpaceX’s Starlink service, which boasts a fast-growing network of more than 4,000 satellites in low Earth orbit, has been used by Ukrainian troops for various efforts, including battlefield communications. SpaceX, through private donations and under a separate contract with a United States foreign aid agency, has provided Ukrainians and the country’s military with Starlink since the beginning of the war in 2022. Musk has been accused in the past of posting Russian narratives, which include suggesting parts of occupied Ukraine be handed over to Russia. The European Commission alsopublished a reportthat shows X, formerly known as Twitter, has played a significant role in spreading Russian propaganda. In Isaacson’s book, Musk complained about Starlink’s involvement in the conflict. “Starlink was not meant to be involved in wars. It was so people can watch Netflix and chill and get online for school and do good peaceful things, not drone strikes,” Muskreportedlysaid.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/8/zelenskyys-advisor-claims-musk-allowed-russians-to-hit-ukrainian-cities
Cuba arrests 17 for trafficking men to fight for Russia in Ukraine,Network based in Cuba and Russia alleged to have facilitated Cubans to join Russia’s war in Ukraine.,"Cuban authorities have arrested 17 people on charges related to a human trafficking ring that allegedly lured young Cuban men to fight in Ukraine with the Russian military. Cuba’s Foreign Ministry said earlier this week that authorities were working to dismantle the network, whichoperated in Cuba and Russia to facilitate Cubans joining the war against Ukraine. “As a result of the investigations, 17 people have been arrested so far, among them the internal organiser of these activities,” Cesar Rodriguez, a colonel with Cuba’s Interior Ministry, said late on Thursday on a TV programme. Rodriguez did not name any of those accused of participating in the ring but said the group´s leader relied on two people residing on the island to recruit Cubans to fight in exchange for payment on behalf of Russia in Ukraine. Cuban prosecutor Jose Luis Reyes said those involved in the scandal could be punished with up to 30 years in prison, a life sentence or the death penalty, depending on the severity and type of crimes, which range from human trafficking, fighting as mercenaries and hostile action against a foreign state. Russia, which has strong political ties with communist-run Cuba, has long been an important destination for Cubans seeking to escape economic stagnation at home. Russian President Vladimir Putin last year signed a decree allowing foreigners signing up for military service in the Russian army to receive citizenship via a fast-track procedure.    Cuba says it has no part in the war in Ukraine and that it rejects the use of its citizens as mercenaries. In May, Russian media reported that several Cubans had signed contracts with Russia’s military and were sent to fight in Ukraine in exchange for Russian passports. Fighting a Ukrainian counteroffensive with mounting casualties and making no significant battlefield gains in months, Russia had already sought the help of private military forces, such as Wagner Group mercenaries, which had hired fighters directly from Russian prisons. Wagner also recruited Syrians to fight alongsideRussian troops in Ukraine. In June, it was reported that anIraqi citizen, who was recruited from jail, was killedfighting for Wagner in Ukraine.

US to give $600m more in military equipment to Ukraine,"New $600m security assistance package follows a day after US pledges $1bn in military, humanitarian aid for Kyiv.","The United States has announced a new $600m security assistance package for Ukraine that includes demolition munitions, mine-clearing equipment, artillery shells and other weaponry, justa day after pledging $1bnin new military and humanitarian aid for Kyiv. Announced on Thursday, the $600m follows after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced during a visit to Ukraine on Wednesday that Washington would provide $1bn in military and humanitarian aid for Kyiv, includingdepleted uranium ammunition for US-made M1 Abrams tanksthat are expected to be delivered to Ukraine later this year. The latest $600m will “support Ukraine’s battlefield needs” and demonstrate “unwavering US support for Ukraine”, the Pentagon said in a statement on Thursday. But the military assistance will not immediately arrive on the battlefield, as it falls under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) through which Washington procures equipment from the defence industry or partners rather than drawing from US military stocks. The back-to-back military aid announcements come as US President Joe Biden’s administration works to show its continued support forUkraine’s three-month-old counteroffensiveas troops try to break through Russian defences and clear vast minefields.    Some allies have quietly expressed concerns about the slow-moving offensive, while others say Ukraine has made some progress and has successfully used air defences to knock down Russian missiles. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday that Ukraine’s counteroffensive was progressing slower than anticipated, but Kyiv’s forces were taking ground from Russian forces each day. “The Ukrainians are gradually gaining ground and it proves the importance of our support and also our ability and willingness to continue the support,” Stoltenberg told a committee meeting of the European Parliament in Brussels. “This is heavy fighting, difficult fighting, but they have been able to breach the defensive lines of the Russian forces,” he said. “The Russian army used to be the second strongest in the world, and now the Russian army is the second strongest in Ukraine. That’s quite impressive,” he added.    Trent Maul, director of analysis for the US Defense Intelligence Agency, told the Economist magazine in a rare interview on Wednesday that there was a “realistic possibility” that Ukrainian forces could push through the entire Russian front line in southern Ukraine by the end of the year. Russian defensive lines yet to be encountered could also be weaker than anticipated, Maul said, and may not pose as much of a challenge as the first line of Russian defence that has slowed the progress of the Ukrainian counteroffensive. Washington, DC-based think tank, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), said on Thursday that Ukrainian forces were making “tactical gains” and the counteroffensive may achieve “operational success” this year, though there was still hard fighting ahead. “Subsequent series of Russian defensive positions still pose significant challenges for Ukrainian forces and may in sections be strongly held,” the ISW said. The subsequent series of Russian defensive positions may be weaker, less mined, and less manned than the defensive layer that Ukrainian forces have breached.

What are depleted uranium munitions and why is US sending them to Ukraine?,Washington defends transfer of depleted uranium munitions amid criticism from Moscow and concerns over their effects.,"The United States has announced plans to supply Ukraine with depleted uranium munitions to stave off the Russian military’s offensive, drawing fierce condemnation from Moscow. The planned transfer, which comes as part ofa $1bn US aid packagefor Kyiv unveiled on Wednesday, also has raised questions about the possible effects depleted uranium could have on civilians in Ukraine. US President Joe Biden’s administration has defended its decision, with a White House spokesmantelling reportersthat the ammunition poses “no radioactive threat”. “They are simply denser than more conventional tank rounds. But there’s no carcinogenic or radioactive threat posed by depleted uranium rounds,” US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said. But Russia haslambasted the US, with the Russian embassy in Washington denouncing the Biden administration’s move as “an indicator of inhumanity” that will cause “indiscriminate effects”. Here’s all you need to know:    The US announced on Wednesday that it plans to send armour-piercing, depleted uranium munitions to Ukraine, which is fighting off Russia’s continuing invasion. The 120mm rounds will be used to arm the 31 M1A1 Abrams tanks that the US plans to deliver to Kyiv in the latter half of the year. The rounds were developed by the US during the Cold War to destroy Soviet tanks, including the same T-72 tanks that Ukraine nowfaces in its counteroffensive. Depleted uranium is a byproduct of the process to create the rarer, enriched uranium used in nuclear fuel and weapons. The roundsretain some radioactive properties, but they cannot generate a nuclear reaction like a nuclear weapon would, RAND nuclear expert and policy researcher Edward Geist said. Although far less powerful than enriched uranium and incapable of generating a nuclear reaction, depleted uranium is extremely dense – more dense than lead – a quality that makes it highly attractive as a projectile. “It’s so dense and it’s got so much momentum that it just keeps going through the armour – and it heats it up so much that it catches on fire,” Geist said. According to the Oak Ridge Associated Universities Museum of Radiation and Radioactivity in the US city of Tennessee, “as a DU [depleted uranium] penetrator strikes a target, its surface temperature increases dramatically”. And when that depleted uranium penetrates a target, “the larger fragments tend to chew up whatever is inside, while the pyrophoricity of the uranium increases the likelihood that the vehicle’s fuel and/or ammunition will explode”.    The US, United Kingdom, Russia, China, France and Pakistan produce depleted uranium weapons, which are not classified as nuclear weapons, according to the International Coalition to Ban Uranium Weapons. Another 14 states are known to store them, it says. The health effects of depleted uranium have been a subject of debate. While some scientists link depleted-uranium ammunitions to many ailments, including cancer, other studies dismiss such risks. The issue surfaced in the past decade after some researchers blamed depleted uranium for upticksin birth defectsnear US military bases and battlefields in Iraq. The US military, which says it has used depleted uranium since 1991 when it was involved in the first Gulf War, has described the ammunition as only “slightly” radioactive. It says depleted uranium only poses long-term health hazards if inhaled or ingested in large amounts. The United Nations nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, says the main health risk of depleted uranium is its chemical toxicity, not radioactivity. “High concentrations in the kidney can cause damage and, in extreme cases, renal failure,” the agency says. “The general medical and scientific consensus is that in cases of high intake, uranium is likely to become a chemical toxicology problem before it is a radiological problem.” In March, the US dismissedRussian protestsafter the UK said it would send depleted uranium munitions to Ukraine, calling Moscow’s concerns a “straw man” argument. In April, a UK government official confirmed that depleted uranium ammunition was already in possession of Ukrainian forces. On Wednesday, Politico quoted an unidentified US official as saying that Russia is simply concerned about its tanks in Ukraine. “What really is happening is that Russia simply doesn’t want to see Ukraine with tanks and more effective tank rounds that could be lethal against Russian tanks,” the officialsaid. “If Russia has an issue with that, they can withdraw their tanks from Ukraine.” The comment echoed a comment from Kirby, the White House’s national security spokesman, in March, when he told reporters that Russia “just doesn’t want Ukraine to continue to take out its tanks”. Kirby said on Wednesday that Washington wants to bolster Ukrainian forces in their counteroffensive and believes “that depleted uranium rounds will help them be more effective on the battlefield”.    Russia has strongly condemned the transfer of depleted uranium munitions to Ukraine. “The US Administration’s decision to send depleted uranium rounds to [Kyiv] is a clear sign of inhumanity,” the Russian embassy in Washington said in a statement on Wednesday. “Obviously, Washington, obsessed with the idea of inflicting a ‘strategic defeat’ on Russia, is ready to fight not only to the last Ukrainian but to put a cross on the future generations,” it added. Journalist Yulia Shapovalova told Al Jazeera from Moscow that Russia has said it “totally disagrees” with the US stance that the shells do not pose a radioactive threat. “Russia sees it as a new round of escalation,” Shapovalova reported. “The Kremlin said that this would not affect the course of the special military operation … The operation will continue no matter what.” Shapovalova added that Moscow has requested a meeting at the UN Security Council on the supply of Western weapons to Ukraine for September 12. “And no doubt, these latest developments with the depleted uranium munitions will also be discussed there.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/7/what-are-depleted-uranium-munitions-and-why-is-us-sending-them-to-ukraine
Five Ukrainian drones downed in latest raids on Russian territory,"Drones shot down over Russia’s Bryansk, Rostov and Moscow regions, leaving a person injured and cars, buildings damaged.","At least five Ukrainian combat drones have been downed over Russian territory as Kyiv continues witha pledge to bring Moscow’s war in Ukraine back to Russia. Two drones were shot down on approach to Bryansk city in Russia’s southwest, two were shot down over the southern Rostov region, and one was intercepted near the capital, Moscow, Russian officials and state news agencies reported early on Thursday. One person was injured and several vehicles damaged when one drone was shot down and crashed in the city of Rostov-on-Don in the early hours of Thursday, according to Russia’s state-run TASS news agency. “According to verified information, air defence systems shot down two unmanned aerial vehicles,” Rostov’s regional Governor Vasily Golubev said, according to TASS. A separate news report said that buildings were also damaged in Rostov-on-Don due to falling debris from the destroyed drone. The second drone came down outside the city, according to reports.    Bryansk regional Governor Aleksandr Bogomaz said that two drones were downed on approach to Bryansk city and did not cause damage or casualties. Moscow’s Mayor Sergey Sobyanin also reported that a drone was shot down by air defence systems in the capital’s Ramensky district, located approximately 60km (37 miles) from central Moscow. “Air defence forces thwarted a drone attack on Moscow. No damage or casualties were preliminarily reported from the site where the fragments hit the ground,” Sobyanin wrote on Telegram.

Russian veterans of Ukraine war will teach defence course for students,"New military-focused curriculum includes senior students learning to handle Kalashnikov assault rifles, hand grenades and aerial drones.","Russians who fought in Ukraine will be sent to teach a new practical course for schoolchildren on security and defence issues, according to the country’s education minister, in the latest sign ofgrowing militarism in Russian society. “A centre has been created this year … to retrain teacher-veterans of the special military operation,” Russia’s Education Minister Sergey Kravtsov said, using the officialname for the war in Ukraine, according to a report in the TASS state news agency on Wednesday. “Those who have taken part in combat”, the minister said, will participate in the “implementation of a new subject area with a prioritisation on practical training for a new ‘Fundamentals of Security and Defence of the Motherland’”, according to TASS. Moscow has been overhauling its school curriculum since its invasion of Ukraine last year.    New school textbooks have been printed with a revised interpretation of the fall of the Soviet Union, a focus on the era of Russian President Vladimir Putin, as well as what Russia claims caused the war in Ukraine. The United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defence said on Wednesday that the new school year in Russia started last week with a new curriculum focused on military skills, Moscow’s view of Ukraine’s history, and history exam questions that will include the war in Ukraine and the “reunification” of Crimea, which was annexed from Ukraine by Russia in 2014. Curriculum changes for senior students, which were approved by Russia’s parliament last year, include a military training module that will teach the use of Kalashnikov assault rifles and hand grenades, piloting of unmanned aerial combat drones, and the application of battlefield first aid, the defence ministry said. “The new curriculum serves three objectives: to indoctrinate students with the Kremlin rationale for the ‘Special Military Operation’, instil students with a martial mindset, andreduce training timelines for onward mobilisationand deployment,” the ministry added.

Russia blasts ‘inhumanity’ of US sending depleted uranium shells to Ukraine,Provision of controversial depleted uranium ammunition for US tanks is part of new $1bn assistance package to Kyiv.,"Russia has denounced as inhuman a plan by the United States to provide the Ukrainian military with ammunition containing depleted uranium. The Pentagon said on Wednesday that the controversial arms for US-made Abrams tanks would be part of a new military package worth up to $175m, out of more than$1bn in civilian and defence supportthat US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced during a visit in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. “The administration’s decision to supply weapons with depleted uranium is an indicator of inhumanity,” Russia’s embassy in Washington said on the Telegram messaging app following the announcement. “Clearly, with its idea of inflicting a ‘strategic defeat’, Washington is prepared to fight not only to the last Ukrainian but also to do away with entire generations,” the embassy said. “The US is deliberately transferring weapons with indiscriminate effects,” it added. “It is fully aware of the consequences: explosions of such munitions result in the formation of a moving radioactive cloud. Small particles of uranium settle in the respiratory tract, lungs, esophagus, accumulate in kidneys and liver, cause cancer and lead to the inhibition of the whole organism’s functions.” Along with the depleted uranium shells for tanks that the US plans to deliver to Ukraine, the new military assistance package includes Javelin anti-tank missiles, tactical air navigation systems and additional ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), according to the Pentagon. While theUnited Kingdom sent depleted uranium munitionsto Ukraine earlier this year, this will be the first US shipment to Ukraine of the controversial armour-piercing shells and it is set to stir controversy over the use of such weapons on the battlefield. The US was widely criticised recently forsending cluster bombs to Ukraine, despite concerns over the dangers such weapons pose to civilians.    The use of depleted uranium shells is not banned under international law. But their use has been fiercely debated, with opponents such as the International Coalition to Ban Uranium Weapons saying there aredangerous health risks from ingesting or inhaling depleted uranium dust, including cancers and birth defects. Uranium is an extremely dense metal – about 1.7 times more dense than lead – and is so hard that it does not change shape when it hits a target. A by-product of uranium enrichment, depleted uranium ammunition can easily punch through armour plating and self-ignite in a searing cloud of dust and metal. US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said on Wednesday that the ammunition is not radioactive and “not anywhere close to going into” the sphere of nuclear weaponry. “This is a commonplace type of munition that is used particularly for its armour-piercing capabilities,” he said. Following the UK’s provision of depleted uranium ammunition in March,Russian President Vladimir Putin warnedthat Moscow would “respond accordingly”, and accused the West of deploying weapons with a “nuclear component”.    Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also said at the time that the munitions were “a step towards accelerating escalation”. Putin announced that Russia would respond to the UK by stationing tactical nuclear weapons in neighbouring Belarus – the first outside Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union. Blinken said on Wednesday that the latest assistance to Kyiv would ensure that Ukraine “has what it needs” to succeed in its ongoing counteroffensive against Russian forces, and also strengthen Ukraine’s longer-term defence capabilities. “Certainly, we see the important progress that’s being made now in the counteroffensive, and that’s very, very encouraging,” Blinken told Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv. The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington, DC-based think tank, said on Wednesday that Ukraine’s military continued to report advances against Russia’s front lines in the counteroffensive, particularly around the city of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region and Robotyne in the Zaporizhia region.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/7/russia-blasts-inhumanity-of-us-sending-depleted-uranium-shells-to-ukraine

The senior Western officials arrived in the Gulf nation this week to discuss sanctions on Russia, as concerns mounted that Moscow was bypassing them through various means, a US embassy spokesperson told CNN on Wednesday. The report came on the heels of another by the Wall Street Journal on Monday – citing US and European officials – that discussed plans to jointly press the UAE to halt shipments of goods to Russia. This was part of a collective global push to keep computer chips, electronic components and other so-called dual-use products out of Russian hands, the WSJ report said. The UAE, a member of the OPEC+ oil alliance that includes Russia, has maintained good ties with Moscow despite Western pressure to isolate Russia over the invasion of Ukraine that began in February 2022. It has not matched the global sanctions imposed on Moscow. The WSJ first reported the visit, saying that it comes as part of “a collective global push to keep computer chips, electronic components and other so-called dual-use products, which have both civilian and military applications, out of Russian hands”. Last week, US artificial intelligence chip company Nvidia said in a regulatory filing that the US government had imposed curbs affecting its A100 and H100 chips designed to speed up machine-learning tasks for customers in the Middle East. The new restriction comes amid US concerns over technology transfer to sanctioned countries. “During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG [US government] informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East,” Nvidia said in the August 28 filing.    Rival chipmaker AMD also received an informed letter with similar restrictions, Reuters reported. The Department of Commerce, which administers licensing requirements on exports, said on Thursday through a spokesperson that the US “has not blocked chip sales to the Middle East” and declined to comment on whether it had imposed new requirements on specific US companies. A UAE official, in response to a Reuters request for comment, said the country “strictly abides by UN sanctions and has clear and robust processes in place to deal with sanctioned entities”. In August, the Financial Times reported that Saudi Arabia and the UAE are allegedly buying thousands of Nvidia chips to build artificial intelligence software, citing “people familiar with the moves”. The official added that the UAE “is continuously monitoring the export of dual-use products, ” which have both civilian and military applications, under its export control legal framework. The UAE official also said that the country remained in close dialogue with international partners, including the US and EU, about the conflict in Ukraine and its implications for the global economy. “UAE banks, under the supervision of the Central Bank and other relevant authorities, monitor compliance with sanctions imposed on Russia to prevent violations of international law,” the UAE official said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/6/us-eu-uk-officials-visit-uae-to-discuss-russia-sanctions-cnn-report
Blinken hails Ukraine counteroffensive as US announces $1bn in new aid,"The new US aid would include HIMARS missile systems, Javelin weapons, Abrams tanks as well as humanitarian assistance.","US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has announced new aid for Ukraine totalling more than $1bn in a visit to Kyiv, including about $665m in new military and civilian security assistance, as he hailed the months-long counteroffensive against the Russian forces in the country’s southeast. The new US aid would include HIMARS missile launch systems, Javelin antitank weapons, Abrams tanks and other weapons systems, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Wednesday. The Pentagon said it would also send depleted uranium ammunition, which is highly effective at piercing armour plates, but their use is controversial. “In the ongoing counteroffensive, progress has accelerated in the past few weeks. This new assistance will help sustain it and build further momentum,” Blinken told reporters at a news conference with Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba on Wednesday that coincided with a Russian attack in eastern Ukraine that killed at least 16 people. Al Jazeera’s Rosiland Jordan, reporting from Washington, said the latest military aid package is meant to support Ukraine in itscounteroffensive. “The $175m that the US is providing in direct military aid is to support the Ukrainian military counteroffensive namely by providing among other things depleted uranium munitions that would be fired from Abrams tanks, 10 of which will be arriving in Ukraine mid-September,” she said. Blinken also met President Volodymyr Zelenskyy who thanked the US for support but warned that Ukraine expected difficult months ahead as winter approached. “We’re happy that we’re not alone through this winter, we will do it together with our partners,” he told Blinken.    Asked about Blinken’s visit, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Moscow believed Washington planned to continue funding Ukraine’s military “to wage this war to the last Ukrainian”. He said US aid to Kyiv would not affect the course of what he called Russia’s special military operation. Blinken’s visit was overshadowed by theattack on Kostiantynivka– an eastern town of nearly 70,000 people about 20km (12 miles) from the front line. Russian shelling killed at least 16 people and wounded dozens at a market in the town, according to officials. “This Russian evil must be defeated as soon as possible,” Zelenskyy said, describing it as a deliberate attack on a “peaceful city”. Aides posted footage showing an explosion after what sounded like a missile approaching, and people scurrying for cover or falling to the ground. Russia did not immediately comment on the attack and has denied deliberately targeting civilians. The White House condemned the attack, calling it “brutal”. “These brutal Russian attacks underscore the importance of continuing to support the people of Ukraine as they defend their territory,” Jean-Pierre said. Meanwhile, the UN’s humanitarian envoy for Ukraine denounced the attack. “The despicable attack that a few hours ago hit a populated market in Kostyantynivka, in the Donetsk region, brutalised civilians in this war-torn community, killing and injuring dozens of adults and children,” humanitarian coordinator Denise Brown said in a statement. The European Union also condemned the attack, calling it “heinous and barbaric”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/6/blinken-hails-ukraine-counteroffensive-as-us-announces-1bn-in-new-aid
Romania claims parts of possible Russian drone fell on its territory,Defence Minister Angel Tilvar said possible drone parts were discovered near border between Romania and Ukraine.,"Parts of what could be a Russian drone fell on Romanian territory, Romania’s Defence Minister Angel Tilvar says, two days after Ukraine said Russian drones had detonated on the NATO member’s land. Romanian officials had earlier denied reports of drones falling on Romanian territory and said Russian attacks in neighbouring Ukraine did not cause a direct threat. Tilvar told local news channel Antena 3 CNN on Wednesday that parts of what was most likely a drone were discovered in the eastern Tulcea county, an area of the Danube that forms a natural border between Romania andwar-torn Ukraine. “I confirm that in this area, pieces that may be of a drone were found,” he said, adding that the pieces did not pose a threat. He said the area had not been evacuated because there was nothing to suggest that the parts were dangerous and said the pieces would be analysed to confirm their origin. Kyiv had said on Monday that drones detonated in Romania during an overnight Russian air raid on a Ukrainian port across the Danube River, where attacks had increased since July when Moscow abandoned a deal that lifted a de facto Russian blockade of Ukraine’s Black Sea ports. Speaking in Bucharest on Wednesday at the start of a summit of the presidents of Three Seas Initiative countries, Iohannis said the attacks were war crimes happening a “small distance” from Romania’s border. “If it is confirmed that the components [found] belong to a Russian drone, such a situation would be inadmissible and a serious violation of Romania’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” he said. “We are on alert and in constant contact with our NATO allies,” he added.  Tilvar reiterated there was no direct threat and told Agerpres it was possible the drone did not explode upon impact, but rather it simply crashed or pieces landed on Romanian territory. “[That] does not make us happy … but I don’t think that we can talk about an attack and, as I said before, I think we need to know how to distinguish between an act of aggression and an incident,” Agerpres quoted him as saying. A ministry spokesperson said search teams had been in the area for several days while the minister and other defence officials talked to residents. Moscow has conducted long-range air raids on targets in Ukraine since the start of the war last year, and Ukraine has reported suspected Russian weapons flying over or crashing into neighbours several times. In the most severe incident, two people were killed in Poland by a missile that fell near the border last November; Poland and NATO allies later said it was a misfired Ukrainian air defence missile.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/6/romania-says-parts-of-possible-russian-drone-fell-on-its-territory
Civilians reported killed as Russia shells outdoor market in east Ukraine,"Russia allegedly targeted the city of Kostiantynivka, killing and wounding many, Ukrainian officials say.","Russian shelling has killed at least 16 people and wounded dozens at a market in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kostiantynivka, officials said. The number of dead in Wednesday’s attack was feared to rise. The assault came as US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken visited Ukraine’s capital, where he is expected to announce more than $1bn in new funding in a display of Washington’s unflagging support for Kyiv’s fight.  President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attack, saying a market, shops and a pharmacy had been struck in the industrial city close to the battlefield, and about 30 kilometres (19 miles) from the city of Bakhmut, where fighting has been heavy for months. Ukrainian officials posted a video on the Telegram messaging app that showed a loud explosion ripping through shopping alleys, with people falling to the ground and some running for cover. Local media described it as a missile attack. “This Russian evil must be defeated as soon as possible,” Zelenskyy said. “When someone in the world still attempts to deal with anything Russian, it means turning a blind eye to this reality. The audacity of evil. The brazenness of wickedness. Utter inhumanity.” He later told a press conference in Kyiv that he believed it had been a deliberate attack on “a peaceful city”. “This is one more terrorist attack by the Russian Federation. They deliberately hit the market,” he said. Meanwhile, interior Minister Ihor Klimenko said that in addition to the 16 killed, at least 28 people were wounded in the attack and said it was on the central city market.    Emergency service workers extinguished the fire that damaged about 30 pavilions at the outdoor market, he said. Klimenko posted pictures on Telegram showing rescue workers sifting through the rubble and carrying out bodies in black sacks. Wednesday’s strike followed a series of Russian attacks on cities in eastern Ukraine in which civilian infrastructure has been hit, including a popular cafe, a hotel and shops. It also followed air strikes several hours earlier on Wednesday on Kyiv and the southern region of Odesa. No casualties were reported in the capital but local officials said one person was killed in the Odesa region. Local prosecutors later put the number of wounded in Kostiantynivka at 31 and said 20 shops, power lines, an administrative building and a residential building had been damaged. Eight retail facilities were burned to the ground and cars were destroyed, they said. Russia did not immediately comment on the attack, and has denied deliberately targeting civilians. The Kremlin had earlier on Wednesday said of Blinken’s visit that Moscow believed Washington planned to continue funding Ukraine’s military “to wage this war to the last Ukrainian”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/6/civilians-reported-killed-as-russia-shells-outdoor-market-in-east-ukraine
"Russian drone raid kills 1 in Ukraine’s Odesa, Kyiv repels missile attack","The night-time attacks on Odesa’s Izmail district lasted three hours, the regional governor said.","One person was killed in Russian drone attacks on a port district in Ukraine’s southwestern Odesa region while Ukrainian air defence successfully shot down a barrage of Russian missiles fired at targets in the capital Kyiv, officials said. The night-time attacks on Odesa’s Izmail district lasted three hours, regional Governor Oleg Kiper said on the Telegram messaging app early on Wednesday. “Unfortunately, one person died,” said Kiper, adding that it was an agricultural worker who had been seriously injured and died in hospital. “Destruction and fires were recorded in several settlements,” he added, saying that port and agricultural infrastructure had been damaged, including administrative buildings. The Danube river port of Izmail, which borders NATO member Romania, has become a main export route for Ukrainian agricultural produce since Russia’s withdrawal from a United Nations-brokered grain deal in July. Ukraine’s Danube ports have become targets ofsustained Russian attackin recent weeks.    Kyiv also came under Russian missile attack early on Wednesday but there were no initial reports of casualties or damage, authorities said. Russian aircraft fired cruise missiles at Kyiv while other missiles were also focused on hitting targets in the capital, Serhiy Popko, the head of the Kyiv City military administration, wrote on Telegram. “According to data at the moment, there are no victims or destruction in Kyiv,” Popko said. “Another missile attack by the enemy on a peaceful city with the aim of killing the civilian population and destroying the infrastructure,” he said. The exact scale of the attack on Kyiv was not immediately known. Witnesses in the city heard several blasts, which sounded like air defence systems being deployed at approximately 05:50am local time (02:50 GMT), the Reuters news agency reported. Ukraine’s Air Force said aerial defence systems had destroyed 23 out of the 33 air weapons that Russia had launched against the country. They included 25 Iranian-made Shahed drones, seven cruise missiles and one Iskander ballistic missile. The Russian defence ministry also said on Wednesday that its air defence systems destroyed a Ukraine-launched drone just before midnight on Tuesday over the Bryansk region, which borders Ukraine. Alexander Bogomaz, the governor of the Bryansk region, said on Telegram that there was no destruction or casualties.

Ukraine’s military intelligence spokesman, Andriy Yusov, said on Ukrainian television on Tuesday that the money would be paid in the national currency, the hryvnia, and called on other Russian military personnel to follow suit and defect to Kyiv’s side. The case of the 28-year-old Russian helicopter pilot, Maxim Kuzminov, has been widely reported on by Ukrainian media. “Once again, those Russians who don’t want to become war criminals, please, surrender, defect to the Ukrainian side anddefend your own honourand conscience, fight against [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s regime,” Yusov said in a television discussion on the high-profile defection. ⚡️Russian pilot who defected to Ukraine to receive $500,000 reward.

UK to declare Russia’s Wagner Group a ‘terrorist’ organisation,"Designation of the group, condemned as a ‘threat to global security’, could be made as early as Wednesday.","The United Kingdom government is set to designate Wagner, the Russian mercenary group, as a “terrorist” organisation. The BBC, the UK’s public service broadcaster, reported a draft order would be put forward in parliament to allow Wagner’s assets to be categorised as “terrorist” property and seized. The designation will make it illegal for anyone in the UK to be a member of the group or support it. The Guardian newspaper said the order would be presented on Wednesday. The decision to proscribe the group under the Terrorism Act 2000 was taken due to “the nature and scale of the organisation’s activities as well as the threat they pose to British nationals abroad,” the Guardian cited the Home Office as saying. Home Secretary Suella Braverman described Wagner as “violent and destructive… a military tool of [President] Vladimir Putin’s Russia” and said its activities were a “threat to global security”. The UK has already imposed sanctions on Wagner, some of its senior commanders and thoselinked to it in Africa, over alleged human rights abuses, but had been under pressure to go further. David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, noted the opposition Labour party had called in February for the proscription. “This is long overdue, but it’s welcome the government has finally acted,” Lammy wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. “Now the government should press for a Special Tribunal to prosecute Putin for his crime of aggression.” Wagner played a prominent role in Moscow’s war in Ukraine and was instrumental in Russia’scapture of Bakhmut cityin May. It has also been active inseveral African countriesand Syria. Its chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin, was killed when hisprivate jet crashedon its way from Moscow to St Petersburg in August, two months to the day that he launched a brief and unsuccessful mutiny against Russia’s top military leaders. Wagner troops have reportedly been sent to Belarus and their future role in Ukraine remains unclear. “While Putin’s regime decides what to do with the monster it created, Wagner’s continuing destabilising activities only continue to serve the Kremlin’s political goals,” Braverman said. “They are terrorists, plain and simple – and this proscription order makes that clear in UK law.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/6/uk-to-declare-russias-wagner-group-a-terrorist-organisation

"North Korea would pay ‘price’ if it supplies Russia with weapons, US says","White House adviser says Russia-North Korea arms negotiations are ‘actively advancing’, warns Pyongyang against deal.","A top White House official has said North Korea would pay “a price” if it sells weapons to Russia for itswar in Ukraine, after Washington warned that Pyongyang was in talks with Moscow about a potential arms deal. US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said on Tuesday that the United States believes the negotiations between North Korea and Russia are “actively advancing”. “Providing weapons to Russia for use on the battlefield to attack grain silos and the heating infrastructure of major cities as we head into winter, to try to conquer territory that belongs to a modern sovereign nation – this is not going to reflect well on North Korea, and they will pay a price for this in the international community,” Sullivan told reporters. His comments come afteranother officialin US President Joe Biden’s administration said on Monday that Washington expected North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to hold a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin has refused to comment on the US claims, stressing that it has “nothing to say” about reports of potential direct talks between the two leaders.    There have been public signs of closer ties between Russia and North Korea in recent weeks. Russia’s Defence Minister Sergei Shoiguvisited North Koreaand met with Kim in July. Kim and Putin alsoexchanged letterslast month vowing to bolster relations between their two countries. On Tuesday, US Department of State spokesperson Vedant Patel also warned North Korea against providing weapons to Russia, telling reporters that Moscow’s turn to Pyongyang for arms shows the effectiveness of US sanctions imposed over the war in Ukraine. “Russia has been forced to search desperately around the world for weapons it can use in its war in Ukraine because of our sanctions and export controls and the effects that those have had,” Patel said. Asked what potential consequences Washington would impose on Pyongyang should weapons be sent to Moscow, Patel did not provide details but said the US would “take appropriate steps as necessary” in coordination with its partners. Last year, the US accused North Korea ofcovertly shippingartillery shells to Russia – an allegation that was denied by both Moscow and Pyongyang. On Tuesday, Sullivan said the Biden administration will continue to push to “dissuade the North Koreans” from providing Russia with weapons. “We will continue to call on North Korea to abide by its public commitments not to supply weapons to Russia that will end up killing Ukrainians,” he said. Pavel Felgenhauer, a defence and military analyst, told Al Jazeera on Tuesday that it is “possible” that Putin could meet with Kim next week when he travels to Vladivostok, a city in the far east of Russia, for an economic forum. “Right now, it seems the relationships between Moscow and Pyongyang are blooming,” Felgenhauer said. “Both sides have things to offer each other, and both sides are under Western pressure and sanctions, so they seem to be natural allies.” The US has beenwarning its competitors and adversaries– including China – against helping Russia in its military offensive in Ukraine.    Washington has provided Kyiv withbillions of dollarsin military, humanitarian and budgetary aid since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of its neighbour in February 2022. The Biden administration also has imposed heavy sanctions on Moscow to penalise it for the war. After failing to capture the Ukrainian capital in the early weeks of the invasion, Russia has limited its war goals to occupying eastern parts of the country. Ukraine launcheda counteroffensiveearlier this year but has only made modest gains against Russian forces. “Ukraine’s armed forces have not achieved their goals on any front,” Russia’s Ministry of Defence quoted Shoigu as saying on Tuesday. Meanwhile, intense fighting has broken out in recent days in the southeastern Zaporizhia region of Ukraine. The Institute for the Study of War think-tank said on Tuesday that Ukrainian troops have advanced beyond some of the anti-tank ditches and dense minefields in Zaporizhia, appearing to make progress through the Russian defences. Ukraine also has been stepping up itscross-border attacksinside Russia.

Why would North Korea’s Kim and Russia’s Putin want to meet?,Moscow seeking to quash Kyiv counteroffensive while Pyongyang is extending pace of missile testing.,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un may travel to Russia for asummitwith President Vladimir Putin, a US official has said. The possible trip would underscore deepening cooperation as the two isolated leaders are locked in separate confrontations with Washington. US officials also said that Russia is seeking to buy ammunition from North Korea to refill reserves drained by its war in Ukraine. In return, experts said, North Korea will likely want food and energy shipments and transfers of sophisticated weapons technologies. A meeting with Putin would be Kim’s first summit with a foreign leader since North Korea closed its borders in January 2020. They met for the first time in April 2019, two months after Kim’s high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with then-US President Donald Trump collapsed. Here is a look at what Kim’s possible meeting with Putin would mean: Since last year, US officials have suspected that North Korea is providing Russia with artillery shells, rockets and other ammunition, many of which are likely copies of Soviet-era munitions. Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu travelled to Pyongyang in July and asked Kim to send more ammunition to Russia, according to US officials. “Russia is in urgent need of [war supplies]. If not, how could the defence minister of a powerful country at war come to a small country like North Korea?” Kim Taewoo, former head of Seoul’s Korea Institute for National Unification, said. He said Shoigu was the first Russian defence minister to visit North Korea since the 1991 disintegration of the Soviet Union. Pavel Felgenhauer, a defence and military analyst, told Al Jazeera is in an ideal position to provide Russia with weapons. “North Korea did not leave the Cold War; it still has that production, and it has ordinance of the same Soviet/Russian calibres copycats, so that can actually provide Russia with things that the Russian military needs on the front line,” Felgenhauer said. Buying munitions from North Korea would be a violation of UN resolutions, which were supported by Russia, that ban all arms trading with the isolated country. But now that it faces international sanctions and export controls over its war in Ukraine, Russia has been seeking weapons from other sanctioned countries, such as North Korea and Iran. North Korea has vaststores of munitions, but Cha Du Hyeogn, an analyst at Seoul’s Asan Institute for Policy Studies, doubted whether it could swiftly send significant amounts to Russia because the narrow land link between the countries can handle only a limited amount of rail traffic. Kim’s priorities would be aid shipments, prestige and military technology, experts said. “It would be a ‘win-win’ deal for both, as Putin is cornered over his exhausted weapons inventory while Kim faces pressure from the South Korea-US-Japan trilateral cooperation,” Nam Sung-wook, a former director of the Institute for National Security Strategy, a think tank run by South Korea’s spy agency, said. “Their needs are matched perfectly now.” Pandemic-era border closures have left North Korea with severe economic difficulties, and Kim is likely to seek supplies of food and energy to address shortfalls. Bong Youngshik, a research fellow at Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies, said a weapons-for-food aid deal was likely if the meeting went ahead. “The very fact that the summit meeting is required for these countries to finalise the weapons exchange and trade means that there are a lot of details to be ironed out and agreed at the highest levels of government,” Youngshik told Al Jazeera. “It has been a very difficult negotiation for both sides to strike the deal so the most likely scenario would be Russia to providing food aid and North Korea continuing to be aggressive in contemplating a weapons deal with Russia,” he said. Kim will likely also trumpet expanding relations with Moscow as a sign that the country is overcoming its years of isolation. North Korean leaders have long valued face-to-face meetings with world leaders as signs of international importance and for domestic propaganda purposes. Kim is likely also seeking Russian technology to support his plans to buildhigh-tech weaponssystems such as powerful long-range missiles, hypersonic ballistic weapons, nuclear-powered submarines and spy satellites, said Hong Min, an analyst at Seoul’s Korea Institute for National Unification. It’s unclear whether Russia would be willing to provide North Korea with advanced technologies related to nuclear weapons and ICBMs, Cha said. Russia has always tightly guarded its most important weapons technologies, even from key partners like China, he said. It’s also unclear how far Kim and Putin’s military cooperation could go, but any sign of warming relations will worry rivals like the US and South Korea. Russia seeks to quash a Ukrainian counteroffensive and prolong the war, while North Korea is extending a record pace of missile tests to protest US moves to reinforce its military alliances with South Korea and Japan. Shoigu told reporters Monday that Russia and North Korea were pondering the possibility of bilateral military exercise. Earlier, South Korea’s spy agency told lawmakers that Shoigu appeared to have proposed a trilateral training exercise involving China. Either way, it would be the North’s first joint military drills with a foreign country since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. The country has avoided training with a foreign military in line with its official “juche”, or “self-reliance”, philosophy. Felgenhauer, the defence and military analyst, said that it was “possible” that Putin would visit Vladivostok next week for an economic forum and meet the North Korean leader on the sidelines. “Right now, it seems the relationships between Moscow and Pyongyang are blooming, both sides have things to offer each other, and both sides are under Western pressure and sanctions, so they seem to be natural allies,” he said. Kim Taewoo, the former institute director, said expanding South Korea-US-Japan security cooperation could prompt Kim Jong Un to break that taboo and hold drills with Russia and China for the first time. But Nam, who is now a professor at Korea University, said North Korea would not likely accept the offer, as it could leave North Korea even more dependent on China and Russia. Park Won Gon, a professor at Seoul’s Ewha Womans University, said it was too early to predict what Kim’s diplomacy could yield beyond making a show of defiance towards the United States. “In any case, North Korea and Russia need to show that they’re working together, that they’re stepping up this cooperation,” Park said. “There clearly are practical areas of cooperation, and also some symbolic aspects they want to show to the United States.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/5/what-do-north-korea-and-russia-need-from-each-other
"In leaked phone calls, Russian soldiers appear angry at losses in Ukraine",Excerpts released by Kyiv of phone calls placed in early July appear to show Russian troops complaining.,"Ukraine’s counteroffensive was in its second month when Andrey, a Russian soldier, called his wife to say his unit was taking heavy casualties. They were so badly equipped, he said, it felt like the Soviet forces in World War II. “They are f*****g us up,” Andrey said by telephone on July 12, comparing the onslaught to the worst moments of Germany’s invasion of the Soviet Union. “No f*****g ammunition, nothing … Shall we use our fingers as bayonets?” The conversation was one excerpt from 17 phone calls placed by Russian soldiers fighting in the south and east of Ukraine that were intercepted in the first two weeks of July by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), the country’s main intelligence agency. The expletive-laden intercepts, shared with the Reuters news agency by a Ukrainian intelligence source, provide a rare – albeit partial – glimpse into the conditions of some Russian soldiers as Kyiv prosecuted a major counteroffensive, which started in early June, two military analysts told Reuters. While Russia has so far largely stemmed Ukraine’s military campaign and made some modest territorial gains of its own in places, the soldiers in the intercepts complain that their units have suffered from heavy losses, a lack of munitions, proper training and equipment, as well as poor morale. Both Russia and Ukraine treat their losses as a state secret. Ukraine has acknowledged that its efforts to recapture territory have been hindered by vast Russian minefields and well-prepared defensive lines. It has liberated a string of villages but retaken no major settlements so far and the front line has remained largely unchanged, frustrating Kyiv’s Western allies. Reuters was unable to determine how representative the intercepts are of the conditions in Russia’s armed forces. The Ukrainian intelligence source said they illustrated the challenges facing Russian soldiers but did not elaborate on how the recordings were selected.    Neil Melvin, director of International Security Studies at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a defence and security think tank headquartered in London, said the calls appeared to confirm some Russian forces were thrown into defensive operations with little preparation and were sustaining high casualties, sowing tensions between soldiers and commanders. Russia’s Ministry of Defence did not respond to requests for comment for this story. In December, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the military had to learn from and fix the problems it had experienced in Ukraine, promising to provide the army with whatever it needed. Reuters reported this month that Russia has doubled its defence spending target this year to more than $100bn – a third of all public expenditure. The SBU said in a statement it was constantly monitoring the situation in occupied parts of Ukraine, including via telephone intercepts, but it did not provide any further details. The source provided what the SBU said were the names, telephone numbers and, in most cases, the units of 15 soldiers speaking in the intercepts. Reuters verified that the mobile numbers provided were registered in the names of the enlisted men or their relatives but calls either went unanswered or the phones were turned off. Reuters is only using excerpts from some of the 10 soldiers whose identities it was able to verify using messaging accounts or social media in their names, which in some cases contained photographs of them in military uniforms. The news agency is not disclosing the full names of the soldiers as it was not able to obtain their comments about the excerpts. In three cases, the soldiers’ wives confirmed their husbands were at the front in messages to Reuters but declined to comment further. One cited Russian secrecy laws. In the excerpts, several soldiers used profane language to describe Russian units that had taken heavy casualties and had been unable to retrieve their wounded. One said his detachment had managed to advance but at a high price. “That’s it. There is no second battalion left. They f*****g turned it to crumbs,” Maxim, a soldier from the Siberian region of Irkutsk, told his wife Anna by phone on July 3. He said the battalion – a unit that usually comprises around 500 troops – had been on the Lyman front in the northeast, one of three areas where the Ukrainian General Staff were reporting heavy fighting and Russian counter-attacks at the time. British intelligence has said Russia has made some local advances around Lyman and Kupiansk in recent weeks. The SBU said Maxim served in Russia’s 52nd Regiment. Reuters was unable to verify that affiliation or establish which second battalion he was referring to. The regiment could not be reached for comment. According to an assessment by the US Defence Intelligence Agency leaked online in April, Russia had 35,500-43,000 soldiers killed in action during the conflict, compared to roughly 15,500-17,500 for Ukraine. Russia says US estimates of its losses are far too high – and propaganda. Maxim referred to his dead comrades as “Cargo 200”, a term that originated during the Soviet Union’s 1979-89 war in Afghanistan as a military codeword for the zinc coffins used to transport home the bodies of dead Russian soldiers. Often shortened to “200”, it is still widely used in both Russia and Ukraine to describe slain soldiers, while “Cargo 300” denotes the wounded. “Basically, they couldn’t even retrieve the [Cargo] 300s. The 300s became 200s,” Maxim said, meaning that the wounded soldiers had been left on the battlefield and died. Following months of fierce Ukrainian resistance on the battlefield, Putin in September announced a “partial” mobilisation of hundreds of thousands of reservists to replenish the ranks. He later acknowledged in a speech to defence chiefs in December that it had been dogged by “certain problems”. Reuters traced one soldier back to the day he was mobilised into the Russian army on September 29. His mother Elena posted a photograph online of her and her son in uniform on social media with the caption: “They took him today.” About nine months later, the soldier, Alexei, was on the phone with his mother from Ukraine, talking graphically about battlefield losses. “They were torn apart. They’re lying there: they can’t even collect some of them. They’re already rotten – eaten by worms,” he told her on July 12. Elena replied: “Really?” “Just imagine, thrown on the front line with no equipment, nothing,” he told his mother. She did not respond to Reuters’s requests for comment by phone and on social media. Alexei said that mobilised troops like him were being sent to the front line, despite public assurances by Putin that they would not be, and said they were not being provided with proper equipment to fight. The Kremlin did not immediately respond to a request for comment.    The SBU intercept said Alexei was located in Russian trenches around the occupied city of Rubizhne in Ukraine’s eastern region of Luhansk. Reuters was unable to verify that information or to determine the unit he belonged to. Alexei derided his superiors and the army high command for concealing troop losses from Putin. “Everything is covered up,” he said. “Everyone’s scared… They’re sending mobilised troops to the front line,” he added. “In the end, the generals couldn’t care less.” Russian officials have said there are no current plans for a new wave of mobilisation and it is focused on recruiting professional soldiers. Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of the Russian Security Council, said in July that 185,000 new recruits had joined the army as professional contract soldiers since the start of the year. A fourth soldier, also named Andrey, told his wife on July 5 about problems retrieving wounded and dead troops from the battlefield as well as heavy casualties sustained by a Russian company. The SBU intercept said the soldier was the deputy commander of a fighting vehicle. Reuters was unable to identify his unit or the company. “The guys got f****d up yesterday. The whole ninth company was turned to rubbish – that’s 72 people. There’s 17 guys left.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/5/in-leaked-phone-calls-russian-soldiers-appear-angry-at-losses-in-ukraine
"Egypt, reliant on imports, buys more Russian wheat",Egypt still buys from Russia and Ukraine but is also diversifying its purchases after the shock of the war.,"Egypt has bought a new shipment of Russian wheat, relying on imports to fill its domestic needs and trying to navigate the changes brought about by the war in Ukraine. The North African nation’s General Authority for Supply Commodities (GASC) bought about 480,000 metric tonnes of Russian wheat on Friday from the trading firm Solaris in a private deal at relatively low prices, the Reuters news agency reported on Tuesday, citing unnamed traders. Egypt, one of the world’s biggest importers of wheat, will reportedly pay about $270 a tonne, which could possibly be below an unofficial floor set by Russia’s government to control domestic wheat prices. It is not legally binding, but suppliers are expected to follow it. Reuters reported that GASC had privately bought one cargo of Bulgarian wheat at $270 per tonne on Friday as well, and the state company has recently been tempted by Romanian and French wheat that is cheaper than Russian wheat. Egypt has shifted towards direct purchases, instead of tenders, since the Russian invasion of Ukraine last year disrupted global wheat markets. Officials said direct purchases have helped it negotiate better prices at times of uncertainty. The Ukraine war significantly impacted the global wheat market, driving prices to unprecedented levels and ramping up market volatility. The value of the North African country’s currency and its foreign currency reserves have taken a significant hit, leading to deferred payments on wheat. It appears to be purchasing cargo at competitive prices at whatever volumes it can as the latest purchase from the Russian supplier will likely not even cover one month of consumption. Egypt imported about 12 million metric tonnes of wheat every year from 2017 to 2021, according to a report last year by the United States Department of Agriculture. The report said that during that period, of the 62.6 million metric tonnes of wheat the country imported, about 60 percent came from Russia and more than 22 percent from Ukraine. Both were favourite producers because of their competitive prices, lower freight costs and faster delivery times. Egypt still purchases from Russia and Ukraine but has also counted Australia, Brazil, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Lithuania and Romania among its suppliers. It also received its first shipment of wheat purchased from the private sector in India in June 2022, shortly after its plant quarantine authority approved Indian wheat. Last month, Egypt signed a $500m deal with the United Arab Emirates-based agribusiness Al Dahra and the Abu Dhabi Exports Office, the export financing arm of a government agency, for a five-year supply of wheat. Authorities said the deal would be worth $100m per year and Egypt would receive imported milling wheat “at competitive prices”. The Egyptian Ministry of Finance has said funding for subsidies on food, mostly bread, will rise 42 percent to 127.7 billion Egyptian pounds ($4.1bn) in the fiscal year from July 2023 to June 2024. Many of the country’s recent wheat purchases have reportedly been made with loans from the International Islamic Trade Finance Corporation and the World Bank.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/5/egypt-reliant-on-imports-buys-more-russian-wheat
Russia says it downed 3 Ukrainian ‘attack drones’ in latest raid on Moscow,"Drones reportedly shot down over Kaluga and Tver regions, bordering the Moscow region, and one over the Istra district of Moscow region.","Russia’s defence ministry said that at least three Ukrainian drones were shot down in the latest attempt by Kyiv toattack sites in Moscow. The ministry said early on Tuesday that air defence systems destroyed two drones over the Kaluga and Tver regions, which border the Moscow region. A third drone was shot down closer to the Russian capital, over the Istra district of the Moscow region, it added. Moscow’sMayor Sergei Sobyaninsaid the “attack drones which targeted Moscow” were destroyed, according to Russia’s TASS news agency. Sobyanin said on the Telegram messaging app that there had been “no casualties”, according to initial information. Debris from the downed drone in the Istra district damaged a household, he said, and drone debris in the Tver region fell in the Zavidovo village. The Russian Air Defense Forces have destroyed unmanned aerial vehicles flying towards Moscow in the air over the Kaluga Region and over the Istra district in the Moscow Region, Mayor Sergey Sobyanin wrote on his Telegram channel:https://t.co/3wd6kFJWnvpic.twitter.com/gNRcrgKcSm — TASS (@tassagency_en)September 5, 2023  According to Russia’s RIA state news agency, Zavidodvo is home to “Rus”, an official residence palace of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Putin’s main residences are the Novo-Ogaryovo residence in the Moscow region as well as the Grand Kremlin Palace – where official events are held. Russian news agencies also reported on Tuesday that almost 50 flights were cancelled or postponed at the four major airports around the capital – Vnukovo, Domodedovo, Sheremetyevo and Zhukovsky. Operations resumed later in the morning. Drone attacks on Russian territory have become analmost daily occurrencein recent weeks and disrupted flights in and out of Moscow as well as caused damage to residential and commercial properties in the capital city and other regions of the country.    A huge wave of drones reportedly destroyed four Russian military heavy transport aircraft last week at an airfield in Russia’s western Pskov region, located roughly 660km (some 411 miles) north of the border with Ukraine. Ukraine rarely takes direct responsibility for such attacks within Russian territory and areas of Ukraine annexed by Moscow. But, last week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyyappeared to hintthat Ukraine’s forces were behind the attack on Pksov and that Kyiv had developed a new long-range weapon capable of attacking much deeper inside Russia.

Cuba uncovers network trafficking Cubans to fight for Russia in Ukraine,Cuba says it has no part in war in Ukraine and would ‘act vigorously’ against those trafficking Cubans as fighters.,"Cuba has uncovered a human trafficking ring that has coerced Cuban citizens tofight for Russia in the war in Ukraine, its foreign ministry said, adding that authorities were working to “neutralize and dismantle” the network. The ministry’s statement on Monday gave few details but noted the trafficking ring was operating both in the Caribbean island nation and within Russia. “The Ministry of the Interior detected and is working on the neutralization and dismantling of a human trafficking network that operates from Russia to incorporate Cuban citizens living there, and even some from Cuba, into the military forces participating in war operations in Ukraine,” the statement said. “Cuba has a firm and clear historical position against mercenarism and plays an active role in the United Nations in repudiation of this practice,”the ministry added, according to an unofficial translation. “Cuba is not part of the war in Ukraine. It is acting and will act vigorously against whoever, from the national territory, participates in any form of human trafficking for the purposes of recruitment of mercenarism so that Cuban citizens use weapons against any country.” The Russian government has not commented on the allegations. In late May, a Russian newspaper in Ryazan city reported that several Cuban citizens had signed contracts with Russia’s armed forces and had been shipped to Ukraine in return for Russian citizenship. It was not immediately clear if the Cuban foreign ministry statement was associated with the Ryazan report. Russia last year announced a plan to boost the size of its armed forces by more than 30 percent to 1.5 million combat personnel, a lofty goal made harder by Russia’s heavy but undisclosed casualties in the 18-month war in Ukraine. Cuba also said in the statement that it had already begun prosecuting cases in which its citizens had been coerced into fighting in Ukraine. “Attempts of this nature have been neutralized and criminal proceedings have been initiated against people involved in these activities,” according to the statement. Al Jazeera reported last year that the Russian government, through the Wagner mercenary force, had recruited Syrians to fight alongsideRussian troops in Ukraine. Thousands across war-torn Syria had reportedlyexpressed an interest in signing up.    In June, it was reported that anIraqi citizen was killedfighting with Russia’s Wagner mercenary force in Ukraine. The deceased, Abbas Abuthar Witwit, was recruited from a prison in Russia with the promise that his sentence would be commuted following his service in Ukraine. According to court papers seen by the Reuters news agency at the time, Witwit had been sentenced to four-and-a-half years in prison on drug charges in July 2021 by a court in the Russian city of Kazan.

Putin says again Ukraine counteroffensive ‘has failed’ as Kyiv claims gains,Russian president and defence officials in Kyiv give conflicting accounts of situation on front lines in Ukraine.,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has again called Ukraine’s counteroffensiveagainst Russian forces a failureas Kyiv’s Ministry of Defence reported further gains on the front lines around Bakhmut city in the eastern Donetsk region. Speaking at a news conference with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in theBlack Sea resort of Sochion Monday, Putin denied reports of recent battlefield gains by Ukraine and said Kyiv’s forces had not stalled in their advance, but had failed. The Ukrainian counteroffensive “has failed, not stalled”, Russia’s state news agency TASS quoted Putin as saying. Putin also said he hoped “it will remain this way”, TASS reported. The Russian leader has repeatedly claimed that Ukraine has not made any progress against Russian defensive positions in regions of Ukraine controlled by Moscow’s forces.    But Russian military bloggers and international military analysts have reported onserious issues affecting Russian forceson the front lines, particularly a lack of artillery shells, which has forced Moscow’s military planners to focus more on artillery accuracy than their tradition of volume of shells fired in battle. On Monday, Ukraine’s Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said that Kyiv’s forces had retaken about 3 square km (1.16 square miles) of land in the past week around the eastern city of Bakhmut, which was captured by Russian troops in May after months of heavy fighting. Ukraine has now taken back about 47sq km (18 square miles) of territory around Bakhmut since starting its counteroffensive in early June, Maliar wrote on the Telegram messaging app. Maliar also reported unspecified “success” in the direction of the villages of Novodanylivka and Novoprokopivka in the southern region of Zaporizhia but gave no details. According to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a think tank based in Washington, DC, Ukraine’s infantry has advanced in Zaporizhia’s western region to positions beyond the first line of Russian defences, which included anti-tank ditches and anti-tank obstacles known as “dragon’s teeth”. But in the absence of Ukraine moving heavy equipment into those areas, the ISW said it was too early to say Kyiv had definitely breached the Russian defences in western Zaporizhia. NEW:#Ukrainianlight infantry has advanced beyond anti-tank ditches and dragon’s teeth anti-tank obstacles that comprise the current RU defensive layer ahead of the UKR advance in western#Zaporizhia, and UKR forces likely intend to hold those positions.🧵https://t.co/WYHWCm1pQhpic.twitter.com/bVNXEmnbme — ISW (@TheStudyofWar)September 5, 2023  “Ukrainian forces likely intend to hold those positions,” the ISW said, adding that it was “not prepared to assess that Ukrainian forces have breached this Russian defensive layer in the absence of observed Ukrainian heavy equipment in these areas”. Maliar said last week that after Ukrainian troops had broken through the first line of Russian defences, Kyiv’s military expects to advance more rapidly. Officials in Kyiv have in recent weeks bristled at international criticism reported in Western media that Ukraine’s counteroffensive has been too slow and hindered by poor tactics – particularly positioning troops in too many locations. Kyiv has argued that its soldiers have been hampered by vastRussian minefields and trenchesalong the front line and that Ukrainian forces were moving slowly and steadily to preserve life.    Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said last week that critics of Ukraine’s tactics should “shut up”. Videos posted on the Ukrainian presidential website on Monday showed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visiting troops in the eastern Donetsk region, where Bakhmut is located, and in the Zaporizhia region, where Kyiv’s forces are trying to push southward to the Sea of Azov.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/5/putin-says-again-ukraine-counteroffensive-has-failed-as-kyiv-claims-gains

He is on leave and available to the Defence Ministry”. Surovikin, who gained the nickname “General Armageddon” for his brutality during Russia’s military intervention in Syria’s civil war, was brieflyin charge of Moscow’s war effortin Ukraine before that role was handed in January to General Valery Gerasimov, chief of the general staff. Various international and Russian military bloggers reported that Surovikin had fallen under suspicion by the Kremlin following the brief mutiny by Wagner mercenaries in June and that he was being investigated for possible complicity.    Russia’s state news agency RIA said last month thatSurovikin had been removedas head of the country’s aerospace forces and his deputy Viktor Afzalov had assumed the job on a temporary basis. The late Wagner boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who died in a private jet crash last month with other senior Wagner figures, was fiercely critical of Russia’s military leaders but spoke highly of Surovikin, calling him “a man who is not afraid of responsibility”. Widely viewed by Russian war commentators as a forceful and capable figure, Surovikin was considered one ofPrigozhin’s most important alliesin the regular Russian army and in the Wagner chief’s bitter disputes with Russia’s Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of General Staff Gerasimov.

"Russia won’t renew grain deal until demands met, Putin tells Erdogan",The Russian leader’s stance dashes hopes that Erdogan could help revive the deal which is vital for global food supplies.,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has reiterated his stance on reinstating a United Nations-brokered deal to safely ship Ukrainian grain across the Black Sea only after the West meets Moscow’s demands on its agricultural exports. The Russian president’s remarks on Monday came after a meeting with his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the Black Sea city of Sochi in the hope of reviving the agreement seen as vital for global food supplies, especially in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Russiarefused to extend the dealin July, complaining that a parallel agreement promising to remove obstacles to Russian exports of food and fertiliser had not been honoured. It said restrictions on shipping and insurance hampered its agricultural trade, though it has shipped record amounts of wheat since last year. Putin reiterated those complaints and said that the Black Sea corridors should not be used for military purposes. He told reporters that if those commitments were honoured, Russia could return to the deal “within days”. Erdogan also expressed hope that a breakthrough could come soon. He said Turkey and the UN – which both brokered the original deal – have put together a new package of proposals to unblock the issue. “We believe that the initiative should continue by fixing the shortcomings,” said the Turkish president who has taken on the role of mediator between Ukraine and Russia. It was the first meeting between the two leaders since Erdogan’s re-election for a third term as president in May.    The United States and the European Union have dismissed Moscow’s complaints as without merit, saying their sanctions do not targetRussian grain and fertilisers. A failure to revive the agreement will have “drastic impacts” in several African countries that rely heavily on Ukrainian and Russian grain, experts say. In an effort to address that, Putin told reporters in Sochi that Moscow is weeks away from supplying free grain to six African countries. “We are close to completing agreements with six African states, where we intend to supply foodstuffs for free and even carry out delivery and logistics for free,” he said. “Deliveries will begin in the next couple of weeks.” The Russian leader alleged that a large chunk of the grain exported via the Black Sea deal went to the West instead of the poor countries.  Hopes were high in Turkey that Erdogan would be able to convince Putin to return to the Black Sea grain deal, Al Jazeera’s Resul Serdar reported from Istanbul. “Officials here say Ankara is trying to convince some of the Western countries to let Russia, in a limited way, back to the international payment system,” Serdar said, adding that insurance companies would now also provide insurance to Russian ships that are going to carry Russian grain and fertiliser. “It will be a major step if it happens. [It means] Russia is going to breach the international sanctions that were imposed particularly by the West,” he added. Erdogan has maintained close ties with Putin during the18-month war in Ukraine. Turkeyhas not joined Western sanctionsagainst Russia following its full-scale invasion, emerging as a main trading partner and logistical hub for Russia’s overseas trade. NATO member Turkey, however, has also supported Ukraine, sending arms, meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and backing Kyiv’s bid to join the alliance. According to Al Jazeera’s Rob McBride in Kyiv, the outcome of the meeting in Sochi has been treated with “cynicism” in Ukraine. “People [are] saying it was Russia that invaded Ukraine and turned the Black Sea into a war zone, pointing at Russia’s attacks on Ukraine’s grain exporting infrastructure,” McBride said. Russia has ramped up drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian grain ports and storage infrastructure. Ukraine says tens of thousands of tonnes of grain have been destroyed in the process. Ukraine has set up its own corridor since the end of the grain deal – from the port of Odesa – but Russia has threatened to treat all ships calling at Ukrainian ports as potential military targets. “We have had two more ships making a passage to the Black Sea from Odesa,” Mc Bride said. “Ukraine is finding ways to export its grain with or without help from Russia.”  The EU has condemned recent Russian attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure used for exporting grain. A spokesman for EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said the attacks show how Russia’s actions are increasing global food prices and putting millions of vulnerable people around the world at risk. Meanwhile, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock slammed Putin’s decision to block the Black Sea grain deal, accusing him of playing “cynical” games. Baerbock said Erdogan’s efforts to “get the agreement back on track” were important. “It is only because of Putin that the freighters do not have free passage again,” she said, referring to ships loaded with Ukrainian grain that have been stuck in the country’s Black Sea ports since July. “Russia is exacerbating global hunger,” she said.

North Korean leader Kim expected to meet Russia’s Putin: US,The White House says Kim Jong Un is expected to hold a ‘leader-level diplomatic engagement’ with President Vladimir Putin.,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is expected to hold a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to a White House official. On Monday, United States National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson indicated that the meeting would be part of ongoing discussions over weapons sales between the two countries. “As we have warned publicly, arms negotiations between Russia and the DPRK are actively advancing,” Watson said, using an acronym for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, or North Korea. “We have information that Kim Jong Un expects these discussions to continue, to include leader-level diplomatic engagement in Russia,” she added. Last week, the White House said Russia was already in secret, active talks with North Korea to acquire a range of munitions and supplies for Moscow’s war in Ukraine. White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said that, despite its denials, North Korea supplied infantry rockets and missiles to Russia last year for use by the privately controlled Wagner military group. Watson said on Monday that the US urged North Korea “to cease its arms negotiations with Russia and abide by the public commitments that Pyongyang has made to not provide or sell arms to Russia”. Russian Defence MinisterSergei Shoigualsotravelled in Julyto North Korea, in an effort to acquire additional munitions for the war, Watson said. It was the first time that a Russian defence minister had visited the country since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. In exchange for the additional weaponry, North Korea is expected to receive technology to improve its satellites and nuclear-powered submarines, according to The New York Times, which broke the story. Bong Youngshik, research fellow at Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies, said a weapons-for-food aid deal was likely if the meeting went ahead. “The very fact that the summit meeting is required for these countries to finalise the weapons exchange and trade means that there are a lot of details to be ironed out and agreed at the highest levels of government,” Youngshik told Al Jazeera. “It has been a very difficult negotiation for both sides to struck the deal so the most likely scenario would be Russia to providing food aid and North Korea continuing to be aggressive in contemplating a weapons deal with Russia,” he said. The US has tried to deter countries like China and North Korea from providing arms to Russia’s military, as it considers Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine an attack on the country’s sovereignty. Officials say Kim — who rarely travels outside his country — is likely to meet with Putin in the port city of Vladivostok on Russia’s Pacific coast, not far from North Korea. The trip is expected to echo asimilar visitKim made inApril 2019, for his first in-person talks with Putin. That voyage involved Kim travelling by armoured train to Vladivostok, where he toured Russia’s Pacific Fleet and held private talks with Putin on Russky Island. “I’ve heard so many good things about your country and have long dreamed of visiting,” Kim said at the time. Earlier on Monday, South Korea’s intelligence agency indicated that the Russian military leadership is pursuing joint naval exercises with North Korea and China, similar to those conducted by the US and its allies. Shoigu seemed to confirm the rumours to Russia’s Interfax news agency, saying “of course” discussions were underway for joint military exercises. “Why not? These are our neighbours,” he said on Monday. “There’s an old Russian saying: You don’t choose your neighbours and it’s better to live with your neighbours in peace and harmony.” Previously, on Saturday, Russia’s ambassador to North Korea Alexander Matsegora said he was unaware of any plans to collaborate with the two countries on military drills. But he added that any future exercises would be “appropriate”, given the US-led military drills in the region. North Korea has increased its missile tests in recent months, partly in response to joint exercises between the US, South Korea and Japan. Kim has vowed to “drastically boost” the country’s weapons production as part of its “war preparations”. On Saturday, North Korea reportedly held a“tactical nuclear attack” simulation, using long-range missiles capped with mock atomic warheads. State media framed the simulation as a warning to the country’s enemies. And in April, North Korea announced its first successful launch of asolid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), a key milestone in Kim’s five-year arms development plan, announced in 2021. Asecond launchtook place in July.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/4/north-korean-leader-kim-expected-to-meet-russias-putin-us
Erdogan visits Putin in Russia’s Sochi in bid to revive Ukraine grain deal,Putin says the deal that allowed Ukraine to export grain will not be restored until the West lifts embargo on Russia.,"Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, have heldtalkson Ukrainian grain exports at the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi. Monday’s meeting came nearly two months after Russia quit a UN- and Turkey-brokered agreement that allowed Ukraine to export grain and other commodities from three of its Black Sea ports during the war with Russia. Erdogan said after talks that it would soon be possible to revive the deal. “As Turkey, we believe that we will reach a solution that will meet the expectations in a short time,” he said. On his part, Putin said at a news conference with Erdogan that Russia was ready to return to the deal “as soon” as restrictions on its own exports were lifted. “We will be ready to consider the possibility of reviving the grain deal,” he said. “And we will do it as soon as all the agreements on lifting restrictions on Russian agricultural exports are fully implemented,” he added. Putin said Western claims that Russia had stoked a global food crisis by suspending participation in the grain deal were incorrect as prices did not rise on its exit from the deal. “There is no physical shortage of food,” Putin said. Since pulling out of the deal, Russia has been keen to ally African concerns about the impact of the deal’s collapse on food security. On Monday, he said Russia was close to a deal with six African countries over a plan to supply Burkina Faso, Zimbabwe, Mali, Somalia, the Central African Republic and Eritrea with up to 50,000 tonnes of grain. He said that Russia would supply the food and carry out logistics free of charge, adding that deliveries “would begin in the next couple of weeks”.  Reporting from Sochi before the meeting, Al Jazeera’s Dorsa Jabbari said Putin and Erdogan “have been friends for a long time, and this meeting is a critical point for both to reach an agreement, especially on the grain deal, which affects world food supplies”. Analysts expected tough negotiations in Sochi. “My gut feeling is that Putin recognises the leverage he has by using food as an economic weapon and thus will fight for all he can get in terms of concessions on his wish list,” said Tim Benton, a food security expert at the Chatham House think tank. Those may include Russia’s own grain, fertiliser exports or wider issues, he said. The abandoned deal was aimed at alleviating a global food crisis by allowing grain from Ukraine to leave ports while the conflict is ongoing. Russia and Ukraine are two of the world’s biggest agricultural producers and key players in the wheat, barley, corn, rapeseed, rapeseed oil, sunflower seed and sunflower oil markets. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said last week that he had sent Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov “a set of concrete proposals” to revive the deal. But Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Maria Zakharova said on Saturday that Russian demands implied by the agreement had yet to be implemented under the previous deal. She did not give details. Since quitting the grain deal in July, Russia has targeted Ukrainian ports with missile and drone strikes and threatened to treat all vessels on the Black Sea as potential military targets. Ukraine has announced a “humanitarian corridor” as an alternate route. It hugs the coast of neighbouring Romania and Bulgaria.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/4/erdogan-visits-putin-in-russias-sochi-in-bid-to-revive-ukraine-grain-deal
"Who is Rustem Umerov, Ukraine’s next defence minister?",The multilingual Crimean Tatar boasts a successful career in finance and is known for being a skilled negotiator.,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has proposed Rustem Umerov, head of Ukraine’s main privatisation agency, to serve as the country’s wartime defence minister followingOleksii Reznikov’s dismissal. Here is what you need to know about Umerov: Umerov, 41, is aCrimean Tatar, a Turkic group of Sunni Muslims whose ancestral home is the Crimean Peninsula, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. In 1944, 180,000 Crimean Tatars, including Umerov’s family, were deported from Crimea to Uzbekistan on the orders of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. He was born in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. In 1991, Rustam and his family returned to Crimea during the Crimean Tatar repatriation of the late 1980s and early 90s. At an elite boarding school, the young Umerov learned five languages: Ukrainian, Tatar, Russian, Turkish and English. As part of the Future Leaders Exchange Program run by the US Department of State, he was sent to study in the United States in 1998 before joining the European Youth Parliament. Umerov began his career in the private sector. He joined one of Ukraine’s leading mobile operators in 2004. In 2013, he established his own investment company, ASTEM, and its ASTEM Foundation. He has a bachelor’s degree in economics and a master’s in finance. In 2014, when Russia occupied Crimea, he was the adviser toMustafa Dzhemilev, the leader of the Crimean Tatar Mejlis. Since 2020, Umerov has been a member of a Ukrainian government task force working on a strategy to end the occupation of Crimea. In September 2022, Umerov, then a lawmaker from the pro-European Holos party, became head of the State Property Fund, an agency selling state assets to private investors. He is credited with turning around an institution frequently mired in corruption scandals. He also relaunched sales of state property, raising record proceeds for the state during the war. Umerov, described as a talented negotiator by people close to him, was a member of the Ukrainian team that negotiated with Russia in March 2022, one month after Russia’s full-scale invasion. He also participated in talkson the Black Sea grain dealand prisoner exchanges, including Ukraine’s Azov fighters who were captured during the battle for the southern city of Mariupol in 2022. He was also involved in securing the release from Russian authorities of Crimean Tatars Ahtem Chiygoz and Ilmi Umerov in 2017. He was a member of the delegation during a visit by Zelenskyy to Saudi Arabia in May and accompanied first lady Olena Zelenska during a visit to the United Arab Emirates in March. #UAEwill help#Ukraineto establish Ukraine Sovereign Fund.

Russia attacks Ukraine grain port ahead of Putin-Erdogan talks,Ukraine downs 17 drones over Izmail port on the Danube River as Russian and Turkish leaders prepare to hold talks on Ukrainian grain exports.,"Russia has launched a wave of drone attacks on one of Ukraine’s biggest grain exporting ports, hours before Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, weredue to hold talks. Ukraine’s Air Force early on Monday urged residents of Izmail port, one of the country’s two major grain-exporting facilities on the Danube River in the Odesa region, to seek shelter. Odesa Governor Oleh Kiper later said 17 drones were downed over the southern region, but that the attack caused widespread damage to port infrastructure. “17 drones were shot down by our air defense forces,” Kiper wrote on Telegram. “But, unfortunately, there are also hits. In several settlements of Izmail district, warehouses and production buildings, agricultural machinery and equipment of industrial enterprises were damaged.” Kiper added that preliminary information indicated no casualties or injuries. The drone assault came as Putin and Erdogan were to meet in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi to hold talks on a Ukrainian grain export deal that helped ease a food crisis in parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia. The deal – brokered by the United Nations and Turkey in July 2022 – had allowed nearly 33 million metric tonnes (36 million tonnes) of grain and other commodities to leave three Ukrainian ports despite the Russian invasion. But Moscowquit the agreement about six weeks ago, complaining that its food and fertiliser exports faced obstacles and that not enough Ukrainian grain was going to countries in need. Since then, it has launched frequent attacks on the ports of the Danube River, which has emerged as Ukraine’s major route for exporting grain. Monday’s attack – the scale of which was not immediately known – followed Russian attacks on Sunday on the other major Danube port of Reni, in which the port’s infrastructure was damaged and at least two people were injured.    A top aide to Erdogan told Turkey’s A Haber television channel on Sunday that the meeting between the Russian and Turkish leaders will “play the most important role” in reviving the grain corridor. “The current status [of the grain deal] will be discussed at the summit on Monday. We are cautious, but we hope to achieve success because this is a situation that affects the entire world,” said Alif Cagatay Kilic, Erdogan’s chief foreign policy and security adviser. Erdogan – who has maintained close ties to Putin during the 18-month war, including byrefusing to join Western sanctionsagainst Russia – has repeatedly pledged to revive the Black Sea deal. The Turkish president has previously indicated sympathy with Putin’s position, saying in July that the Russian leader had “certain expectations from Western countries” over the grain deal and that it was “crucial for these countries to take action in this regard”. Russia has said that if demands to improve its exports of grain and fertiliser were met, it would consider resurrecting the Black Sea agreement. While Russian exports of food and fertiliser are not subject to Western sanctions, Moscow has said restrictions on payments, logistics and insurance have hindered shipments. One of Russia’s main demands is for the Russian Agricultural Bank to be reconnected to the SWIFT international payments system. The European Union cut it off in June 2022. The United Nations has also stepped up its efforts to revive the deal. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Thursday that he had sent a letter to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov with “concrete proposals” aimed at getting Moscow’s exports to global markets. But Russian officials said they were not satisfied with the letter. A Russian diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the Reuters news agency that “there are no revelations” in Guterres’s letter to Lavrov and that it just “sums up of previous UN ideas, which didn’t fly”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/4/russia-attacks-ukraine-grain-port-ahead-of-putin-erdogan-talks

Ukraine’s Zelenskyy moves to replace Oleksii Reznikov in defence shake-up,"Zelenskyy will ask his parliament to replace Oleksii Reznikov with Rustem Umerov, head of Ukraine’s State Property Fund.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he would ask parliament this week to dismissDefence Minister Oleksii Reznikovand to replace him with Rustem Umerov, head of Ukraine’s main privatisation fund. The announcement on Sunday, made in Zelenskyy’s nightly video address to the nation, sets the stage for the biggest shake-up of Ukraine’s defence establishmentduring the war. Reznikov, who was named defence minister in November 2021, has helped secure billions of dollars of Western military aid to assist the war effort, but has been dogged by graft allegations surrounding his ministry that he described as smears. “I’ve decided to replace the Minister of Defense of Ukraine. Oleksii Reznikov has been through more than 550 days of full-scale war,” Zelenskyy said. “I believe the ministry needs new approaches and other formats of interaction with both the military and society as a whole.” The change of defence minister must be approved by parliament, but is likely to be supported by a majority of lawmakers in the Verkhovna Rada. Zelenskyy said he expected parliament to approve Umerov’s appointment. Umerov, a 41-year-old ex-lawmaker who is a Crimean Tatar, has headed Ukraine’s State Property Fund since September 2022 and has played a role in sensitive wartime negotiations on, for instance, the Black Sea grain deal. Zelenskyy’s announcement comes after Reznikov claimed the F-16 fighter jets supplied by Ukraine’s allies would be deployed by next spring and boasted about the country’s plans to increase drone production in an interview with the Ukrainian state news agency Ukrinform. “I think this autumn there will be a boom in the production of various Ukrainian drones: flying, floating, crawling, etc, and this will continue to grow in volume,” Reznikov said. Earlier on Sunday, Zelenskyy spoke with his counterpart French President Emmanuel Macron to discuss the “functioning” of asea corridorset up by Kyiv for safe navigation of ships after Moscow exited a landmark grain deal. The phone call came on the eve of asummitin Russia between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who wants to revive the grain deal, and as Moscow hit Ukraine’s Odesa region with drones. “We also discussed ways to ensure the functioning of the grain corridor and enhance the security of the Odesa region,” Zelensky said on social media after a phone call with Macron. Ukraine this week said four more ships had gone through its temporary maritime corridor in the Black Sea, set up last month to ensure safe navigation.

What’s at stake in the upcoming Erdogan-Putin meeting?,Monday’s meeting in Sochi comes amid international efforts to patch up the Black Sea Grain Initiative.,"Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is scheduled to meet Vladimir Putin on Monday, hoping to persuade the Russian leader to rejoin theBlack Sea grain dealthat Moscow broke off from in July. The meeting, to take place in Sochi on Russia’s southern coast, comes after weeks of speculation about when and where the two leaders might meet. Erdogan previously said Putin would travel to Turkey in August. Here are some key things to know and what’s at stake at the meeting: The Kremlinrefused to renew the grain agreementabout six weeks ago. The deal – brokered by the United Nations and Turkey in July 2022 – had allowed nearly 33 million tonnes of grain and other commodities to leave three Ukrainian ports safely despite the invasion by Russia. However, Russia pulled out after claiming that a parallel deal promising to remove obstacles to Russian exports of food and fertiliser had not been honoured. It also complained that restrictions on shipping and insurance hampered its agricultural trade, even though it has shipped record amounts of wheat since last year.  Since Putin withdrew from the initiative, Erdogan has repeatedly pledged to renew arrangements that helped avoid a food crisis in parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan met Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu in Moscow on Friday, saying at a briefing in the Russian capital on Thursday that reviving the deal was important for the world. Ukraine and Russia are leading suppliers of wheat, barley, sunflower oil and other goods that developing nations rely on. Erdogan has maintained close ties with Putin during the18-month war in Ukraine. Turkeyhas not joined Western sanctionsagainst Russia following its invasion, emerging as a main trading partner and logistical hub for Russia’s overseas trade. NATO member Turkey, however, has also supported Ukraine, sending arms, meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and backing Kyiv’s bid to join the alliance.    The Sochi summit follows talks between the Russian and Turkish foreign ministers on Thursday, during which Russia handed over a list of actions that the West would have to take for Ukraine’s Black Sea exports to resume. US wheat prices rose on Friday, a day after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Moscow saw no sign that it would receive the guarantees needed to revive the grain deal. Erdogan has showed sympathy with Putin’s position. In July, he said Putin had “certain expectations from Western countries” over the deal and that it was “crucial for these countries to take action in this regard”. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres recently sent Lavrov “concrete proposals” aimed at getting Russian exports to global markets and allowing the resumption of the Black Sea initiative. But Lavrov said Moscow was not satisfied with the letter. Describing Turkey’s “intense” efforts to revive the agreement, Turkey’s Fidan said it was a “process that tries to better understand Russia’s position and requests, and to meet them”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/3/whats-at-stake-in-upcoming-erdogan-putin-grain-meeting

Ukraine tycoon Ihor Kolomoisky taken into custody over fraud allegations,Court places billionaire businessman under arrest for two months over fraud and money laundering charges.,"A Ukrainian court has placed billionaire businessman Ihor Kolomoisky under arrest for two months over fraud and money laundering charges as part of the war-torn country’scrackdown on corruption. The court on Saturday gave Kolomoisky the option of posting bail of more than 509 million hryvnias, equivalent to more than $13m. In an oblique reference to legal proceedings against the business magnate, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday thanked law enforcement bodies for bringing long-running cases to justice. “I thank Ukrainian law enforcement officials for their resolve in bringing to a just outcome each and every one of the cases that have been hindered for decades,” Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address. Al Jazeera Rob McBride, reporting from Kyiv, said the court’s decision has caught many people by surprise. “This has come as a big shock here in Kyiv. There’s been rumblings of it on social media all day. Kolomoisky is one of Ukraine’s most high-profile, richest oligarchs in the country. He was a supporter of Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s presidential bid back in 2019. He has been under US sanctions since 2021,” McBride said. “This comes amid a campaign by the Ukrainian government totackle corruptionand to be seen to be tackling corruption. There is a prevailing mood in the country at the moment that the government is tackling corruption. A number of officials have been dismissed and also been prosecuted,” he added.    Early on Saturday, Ukraine’s main security agency, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), named Kolomoisky as a suspect in a criminal investigation. “It was established that during 2013-2020, Ihor Kolomoisky legalised more than half a billion hryvnias [$14m] by withdrawing them abroad and using the infrastructure of banks under [his] control,” the SBU said in a statement. Kolomoisky, who has previously denied allegations of wrongdoing, could not be reached for comment. The SBU published pictures on the Telegram messaging app of a group of detectives at the door of his home, Kolomoisky being served documents and signing them. The businessman is seen as one of the class of oligarchs who amassed huge industrial wealth after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union and who have wielded outsize political and economic influence. Before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February last year, Zelenskyy and his team tried to clip their wings with legislation requiring oligarchs to register and stay out of politics. The war has eroded their power as lucrative industrial assets have been destroyed in the east and south, and their television channels have been broadcasting under a centralised wartime signal.    Before he won the presidency, Zelenskyy rose to prominence as a comedian and played the role of president on a show aired on a Kolomoisky-owned TV channel. He denies Kolomoisky has had any influence over his government. During the war, Zelenskyy has been keen to stress Ukraine’scrackdownon corruption as Kyiv has applied to join the European Union. It hopes to secure tens of billions of dollars to help rebuild the country after 18 months of war that has no end in sight. Two lawmakers – Yaroslav Zheleznyak and Iryna Gerashchenko – suggested on Telegram that the move against Kolomoisky was aimed at generating positive publicity among Ukraine’s foreign backers as well as the public at home who are tired of the war and worried about the problem of entrenched corruption. The SBU’s announcement on Saturday is not the first wartime move involving Kolomoisky. In November, the state took control of stakes in major strategic companies, some of which were associated with him, invoking wartime laws to help the war effort. This year, security officials searched Kolomoisky’s home in connection with a separate investigation into embezzlement and tax evasion at the country’s two largest oil companies, which were partially owned by the businessman. Kolomoisky is a former owner of leading Ukrainian bank PrivatBank, which was nationalised in late 2016 as part of a major cleanup of the banking system. He has owned an array of assets in the energy, banking and other sectors, including one of Ukraine’s most influential television channels. The United States imposed sanctions on Kolomoisky in 2021 “due to his involvement in significant corruption”. US authorities have also alleged Kolomoisky and a business partner laundered stolen funds through the US. Kolomoisky has denied any wrongdoing.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/2/ukraine-tycoon-ihor-kolomoisky-taken-into-custody-over-fraud-allegations
"Nobel Foundation reverses invitations to Russia, Iran after backlash",The decision to invite representatives from Russia and Iran to awards ceremony was criticised over Ukraine war and human rights violations.,"The Nobel Foundation has reversed its invitations for representatives ofRussia, Belarus and Iran to attend this year’s Nobel Prize awards ceremony in Stockholm after the decision announced a day earlier “provoked strong reactions”. Several Swedish lawmakers said on Friday that they would boycott this year’s event after the private foundation that administers the prestigious awards changed its position from a year earlier and invited representatives of the three countries to attend. “The decision by the Nobel Foundation to invite all ambassadors to the Nobel Prize award ceremony, in accordance with previous practice, has provoked strong reactions,” the foundation said on Saturday in a press release. “The basis for the decision is that we believe that it is important and right to reach out as widely as possible with the values and messages that the Nobel Prize stands for. ”    Some of the protesting lawmakers citedRussia’s war on Ukraineand the crackdown on human rights in Iran as reasons for their boycott. Moscow was not invited last year because of its invasion of Ukraine. Belarusian opposition figure Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya on Friday called on the Swedish Nobel Foundation and the Norwegian Nobel Committee not to invite representatives of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko’s “illegitimate regime to any events”. Lukashenko is accused of launching a crackdown on opposition figures and critics after his disputed victory in the 2020 presidential election. Last year, the Norwegian Nobel Institute still invited all ambassadors to the Peace Prize ceremony it organises in Oslo, and the foundation said this would be the case again this year. “As before, all ambassadors will be invited to the ceremony in Oslo,” it noted. The remaining Nobel Prizes – for chemistry, economics, literature, medicine and physics – are presented in Stockholm. Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Oleg Nikolenko called the reversal a “victory for humanism”. “We thank everyone who demanded the restoration of justice. We are convinced that a similar decision should be made regarding the Russian and Belarusian ambassadors to Oslo,” he said in a post on Facebook. Writing on X, formerly known as Twitter, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson also welcomed the new decision. “The many and strong reactions show that the whole of Sweden unambiguously stand on Ukraine’s side against Russia’s appalling war of aggression,” Kristersson said. This year’s Nobel Prize winners will be announced in early October. The laureates are then invited to receive their awards at prize ceremonies on December 10, the anniversary of award founder Alfred Nobel’s death in 1896.

Russia says Ukraine sea drones destroyed in failed attack on Crimea bridge,"One naval drone was destroyed late on Friday and two others early on Saturday morning, Russia’s defence ministry says.","Russia said it destroyed three Ukrainian naval drones that attempted to crash into the Crimea bridge, in what appeared to bethe latest effort by Kyiv to disable the crucial transport linkbetween the Russian mainland and the Moscow-annexed Crimean peninsula. One naval drone was destroyed late on Friday and two others early on Saturday morning, Russia’s defence ministry said in separate posts on the Telegram messaging app. “On 1st September at about 11.15 pm (20:15 GMT), an attempt was undertaken by the Kyiv regime to launch a terrorist strike with a half-loaded unmanned boat,” the ministry said on Telegram. The drone boat was “spotted and destroyed in time off the Black Sea coast”, it said. “On September 2, at about 02:20 am Moscow time (23:20 GMT Friday), the third Ukrainian semi-submersible unmanned boat, sent by the Kyiv regime to carry out a terrorist attack on the Crimean bridge, was destroyed in the Black Sea,” the ministry said in a later post.    The 19km (11-mile) bridge consists of two parallel structures, one reserved for road traffic and the other for rail traffic, and isa key infrastructure project for Russia’s President Vladimir Putinas it symbolises the attaching of Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula to Russia, analysts say. Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014,has recently come under more frequent and intense attacksas Kyiv has promised to take the peninsula back from Russian control. An attack on the bridge in July killed two peopleand caused significant damage to the road section, which is also used to transport military equipment in the continuing conflict with Ukraine. The bridge, which spans the Kerch Strait, was badly damaged in October 2022 in an explosion that Russian officials said was caused by the detonation of a truck laden with explosives. The Kyiv Independentreported recently that Russia was in the process of sinking ferries in the Kerch Strait to protect the Crimean bridge from attacks. Citing Ukraine’s military intelligence, the newspaper reported that “Russian forces believe the submerged boats will provide a protective lane in the water in front of the bridge”. “One ferry has already been sunk and Russia plans to sink at least six in total,” the newspaper said.

Russia puts advanced Sarmat nuclear missile system on ‘combat duty’,"Russian space agency chief Yuri Borisov says new intercontinental ballistic missile system is now in service, Russia’s news agencies report.","Moscow has put into service an advanced intercontinental ballistic missile that Russian PresidentVladimir Putin has said would make Russia’s enemies “think twice”about their threats, according to reported comments by the head of the country’s space agency. Yuri Borisov, the head of the Russian space agency Roscosmos, said Sarmat missiles have “assumed combat duty”, according to Russian news agency reports on Friday. “The Sarmat strategic system has assumed combat alert posture,” the state-run TASS news agency quoted the Roscosmos chief as saying. “Based on experts’ estimates, the RS-28 Sarmat is capable of delivering a MIRVed warhead weighing up to 10 tonnes to any location worldwide, both over the North and South Poles,” TASS said in its report. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said on Friday that he was not in a position to confirm reports that Russia had put the Sarmat on combat readiness. Putin said in February that the Sarmat– one of several advanced weapons in Russia’s arsenal – would be ready for deployment soon. In 2022, some two months after Russian troops invaded Ukraine, Putin said the Sarmat would “reliably ensure the security of Russia from external threats and make those, who in the heat of aggressive rhetorictry to threaten our country, think twice”.    The Sarmat is an underground silo-based missile that Russian officials say can carry up to 15 nuclear warheads, though the United States military estimates its capacity to be 10 warheads. Known to NATO military allies by the codename “Satan”, the missile reportedly has a short initial launch phase, which gives little time for surveillance systems to track its takeoff. Weighing more than 200 tonnes, the Sarmat has a range of some 18,000km (11,000 miles) and was developed to replace Russia’s older generation of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICMBs) that dated from the 1980s. Russia test-fired the Sarmat missile in April 2022 in the Plesetsk region of the country, located some 800km (almost 500 miles) north of Moscow, and the launched missiles hit targets on the Kamchatka peninsula, in Russia’s far east region.

Putin to meet Erdogan amid push to revive Ukraine grain deal,The announcement of Monday’s meeting in Sochi comes amid international efforts to patch up the Black Sea Grain Initiative.,"Russian President Vladimir Putin will hold talks with his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, next week as Ankara and the United Nations seek to revive a Ukraine grain export deal that helped ease a global food crisis. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that Putin and Erdogan would meet on Monday in Russia’s Black Sea resort of Sochi. The announcement ended weeks of speculation about when and where the two leaders might meet next as international efforts continue to patch up theBlack Sea Grain Initiative, which shipped grain and other food to parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia where hunger is a growing threat. It ended when Russia unilaterally withdrew from the agreement in July. Ukraine and Russia are major global suppliers of wheat, barley, sunflower oil and other farm commodities that developing nations rely on. Turkey, together with the UN, brokered the deal in July 2022. It allowed Ukraine to resume shipping foodstuffs from three of its Black Sea ports during the war with Russia. Under the initiative, ship and cargo inspections were overseen from Turkey, and vessels sailed to and from Ukraine from there. Almost 33,000 tonnes of grain left Ukraine while the agreement was in effect. Peskov said Erdogan, who had previously played a significant role in persuading Putin to stick with the deal, would hold talks with the Kremlin chief in Sochi on Monday but gave no further details. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan met Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu in Moscow on Friday ahead of the Erdogan-Putin meeting. Shoigu said Russia was not to blame for the grain deal failure and repeated the Russian position that Moscow would return to it if all the promises made to Russia were fulfilled. “It’s not our fault today, but it’s stopped,” Shoigu said in a statement released by the Ministry of Defence. “Here we can say only one thing, that if everything that was promised to Russia is fulfilled, the deal will be extended.” “It turned out that it is more difficult to do this than to build new corridors, new ground routes,” said Shoigu, who attended the signing ceremony for the Black Sea deal in Istanbul in 2022. The Black Sea grain deal was intended to combat a global food crisis that the UN said had been worsened by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022,  which Russia calls a “special military operation”. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Thursday that he had sent Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov “a set of concrete proposals” aimed at reviving the agreement. Turkey’s foreign minister said at a briefing in Moscow on Thursday that reviving the deal was important for the world. US wheat prices rose on Friday, a day after Lavrov said Russia saw no sign that it would receive the guarantees needed to revive the grain deal. Lavrov said the West was hyping the talk of aglobal food crisisas prices remained around 2021 levels and had ignored Putin’s pledge to supply Burkina Faso, Zimbabwe, Mali, Somalia, the Central African Republic and Eritrea with up to 50,000 tonnes of grain each free of charge. To persuade Moscow to approve the original deal, a three-year accord was struck at the same time under which UN officials agreed to help Russia with its own food and fertiliser exports. But Moscow said the memorandum had not been honoured due to the treachery of the West. Lavrov said he had discussed Putin’s initiative to supply up to 1 million tonnes of Russian grain to Turkey at reduced prices for subsequent processing at Turkish plants and shipping to countries most in need. That proposal is also being discussed with Qatar. While Russian exports of food and fertiliser are not subject to Western sanctions imposed after Russia’s invasion, Moscow has said restrictions on payments, logistics and insurance have hindered its shipments. Two cargo vessels left a port near Odesa, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister said on Friday. They were the third and fourth to transit from deep-water Ukrainian ports through the Black Sea since Russia withdrew from the safe passage deal. They are sailing a new route that hugs the coast of Romania and Bulgaria.   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/1/putin-to-meet-erdogan-amid-push-to-revive-ukraine-grain-deal
‘Top priority’: British defence firm BAE sets up Ukraine arms facility,BAE has manufactured much of the equipment the UK and other governments provided to Ukraine as it fends off Russian invasion.,"British defence company BAE Systems says it set up a local entity in Ukraine and signed deals with the government to help ramp up Kyiv’s supply of weapons and equipment. The move on Thursday will enable BAE to work directly with Kyiv officials to explore potential partners for a plan to ultimately produce 105mm light guns, a kind of artillery weapon, in Ukraine and to better understand its capability requirements. As the United Kingdom’s biggest defence contractor, BAE has manufactured much of the equipment that Britain and other governmentshave provided to Ukraineas it fends off Russia’s invasion. Britain is a key defence supplier for Ukraine and in May became the first country to start supplying Kyiv with long-range cruise missiles. “The best weapons that are currently helping our warriors defend Ukraine should be produced in Ukraine,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on X, formerly Twitter, following a meeting with BAE Chief Executive Charles Woodburn. “The development of our own weapons production is a top priority.” The Kremlin on Friday said it saw BAE opening a local entity in Ukraine “negatively”, and any facilities producing weapons used against Russia would become targets. Today we’ve announced a new local legal entity and signed agreements with the Ukrainian Government to ramp up our support to Ukraine’s armed forces and to explore the supply of light guns to Ukraine.

Kyiv is eager to boost its arsenal from drones and munitions to tanks, while also trying to boost job opportunities in an economy ravaged by war. BAE, which has benefitted from increased defence spending as a result of the conflict, is already providing training and repair services to Ukraine’s armed forces. “Signing the agreements and establishing a legal entity in Ukraine builds on our existing trust and support and paves the way for us to work together to provide more direct support to the Ukrainian armed forces,” BAE’s Woodburn said in a statement. The announcement comes days after Ukraine signed a statement of intent with Sweden to strengthen cooperation in the production and operation of the CV90 family of armoured vehicles, made by a Swedish unit of BAE. Western defence companies have been weighing opportunities to make weapons in Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has asked the European Union for more arms and ammunition. Speaking at a meeting with EU foreign ministers in the Spanish city of Toledo, Kuleba mentioned artillery ammunition, armoured vehicles and tanks, and again urged Germany to supply his country with Taurus cruise missiles. Kuleba also called for an intensified fight against the circumvention of sanctions in a bid to make it more difficult for Russia to produce missiles and drones.

"Ukrainian drone hits Russia’s Kursk region, Moscow repels attack: Officials","Russia’s Kurchatov town the target of Ukrainian drone attack as air defences stop drone’s advance on Moscow, officials say.","A Ukrainian drone attack on the Russian town of Kurchatov in the Kursk region damaged an administrative and residential building, while a second drone was shot down near Moscow, local officials said. Kursk regional Governor Roman Starovoit said emergency services were assessing the damage in Kurchatov town following the early morning attack on Friday. “There are no casualties,” Starovoit wrote on the Telegram messaging app. The governor reported that two buildings were damaged by two drones, but later clarified that only one unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was involved in the raid on Kurchatov town, located just a few kilometres from the Soviet-era Kursk nuclear power station which is one of Russia’s largest. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin also reported early on Friday that Russian air defences had shot down a drone that was approaching the capital city. The drone was downed near Lyubertsy, which is located approximately 20km (12 miles) southeast of central Moscow, he wrote on Telegram. No further details were available. Moscow’s three main airports – Sheremetyevo, Domodedovo and Vnukovo – were reported to have cancelled and rescheduled flights early on Friday morning due to reports of an unidentified object flying in the capital’s airspace, according to a local online news report. Russia’s state-run TASS news agency later reported that Vnukovo airport resumed operations at 7:28am local time (04:28 GMT) following the lifting of restrictions linked to an attempted drone attack.    On Thursday, Moscow mayor Sobyanin said that wanted to expand the city’s air defences, in the face of near-daily drone attacks on the Russian capital. “This year, we have done a lot to protect Moscow from drones and attempted terrorist attacks,” Sobyanin told representatives of municipal companies, according to the Interfax news agency. New air defence systems have been erected in recent weeks, sometimes daily, Sobyanin said. “Sometimes the asphalt doesn’t even have time to cool down – and already the missiles are in action, shooting down the flying drones,” he said, according to Interfax.    Independent observers have expressed doubts about official reports from Russia that many of the suspected Ukrainian drones are detected and shot down by Moscow’s air defence. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy revealed on Thursday night that Ukrainian forces had produced a new weapon that had a target range of some 700km (435 miles). He did not provide further details other than to say efforts were being made to further increase the range of the new weapon.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/1/ukrainian-drones-hit-russias-kursk-region-moscow-repels-attack-governors

"Zelenskyy says Ukraine deployed new long-range weapon, hints at Russia raid",Ukrainian President Zelenskyy says new weapon system has range of 700km and ‘the task is to make this number bigger’.,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country has developed a weapon that can hit a target 700km (435 miles) away, in an apparent reference to an aerial attack this week on an airport in western Russia that destroyed several military aircraft. The weapon was produced by Ukraine’s Ministry of Strategic Industries but he gave no further details. “The range of our new Ukrainian weapons is now 700 kilometers. The task is to make this number bigger,” Zelenskyy wrote late on Thursday night in a post to the social media platform X, previously known as Twitter. Zelenskyy’s claim of new Ukrainian long-range weaponry came ahead of a Russian official reporting early on Friday morning that air defence units had “neutralised an unidentified object” in Russia’s western region of Pskov,the same region where a Ukrainian aerial attackreportedly damaged four Il-76 military transport planes on Wednesday. While Ukraine rarely comments directly on specific attacks inside Russia, Zelenskyy appeared to hint twice on Thursday that Ukrainian forces were behind the Pskov attack. Today was full of events. With government officials and military, we focused on the frontlines and our offensive operations. The range of our new Ukrainian weapons is now 700 kilometers. The task is to make this number bigger. Another important piece of news for the frontline…pic.twitter.com/MmfSQupY2L — Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa)August 31, 2023   “The results of our weaponry – new Ukrainian weaponry – 700km away,” he also saidin his nightly video address. “And the task is to do more.” The airport attacked in Russia’s Pskov region is located approximately 700km north of the Ukrainian border. Ukraine’s Western allies generally forbid Kyiv from using weapons they supply to attack Russian territory, but they have also said that Ukraine has a right to attack Russian military targets with its own weapons where it sees fit to do so. Washington DC-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said on Thursday that Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council Secretary Oleksiy Danilov had recently referred to a new Ukrainian-made missile that had hit a Russian air defence system in Crimea on August 23. 3/ Ukrainian President Volodymyr#Zelenskyhighlighted#Ukraine’s domestic production of long-range missiles on August 31, likely as part of a coordinated Ukrainian campaign promoting increased Ukrainian strike capabilities against Russian deep rear areas.https://t.co/PSJyTwGqFypic.twitter.com/0Qt8hr8veh — ISW (@TheStudyofWar)September 1, 2023  The head of Ukraine’s military intelligence Kyrylo Budanov had also said that Ukrainian forces now “have the ability to to strike any part of occupied Crimea”, the ISW said. On Wednesday, a four-hour wave of drones – that Moscow blamed on Ukraine – was sent against targets in six Russian regions in what some believe was the biggest drone raid on Russia since it invaded Ukraine last year. In the past month, Ukraine has stepped up drone attacks on targets deep within Russia – including on the capital Moscow – and in Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine in what appears to be the implementation of a recent promise by Zelenskyy that Ukraine would take the war back to Russia.    Attacks deep into Russia and cross-border sabotage missions are part of Kyiv’s efforts to keep domestic pressure on the Kremlin, militarily and politically, while Ukraine’s counteroffensive launched in Juneslowly wears down parts of the Russian front line,analysts say. Ukraine is aiming to “erode Russian morale and increase pressure on its commanders”, the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), a think tank, said in an assessment this week. The strategy is “to bring Russian forces to a tipping point where combat power and morale may begin to break”, the IISS said in the analysis.    After months of slowly fighting their way through heavy minefields,Ukrainian forces have reportedly reached the main Russian defensive lines in recent dayssouth of the village of Robotyne which they captured last week in Ukraine’s Western Zaporizhia region. They are now advancing between the nearby villages of Novopokropivka and Verbove, looking for a way around the anti-tank ditches and rows of concrete pyramids known as dragon’s teeth that form Russia’s main fortifications visible from space, the Reuters news agency reported. A breakthrough would provide the first test of Russia’s deeper defences, which Ukraine hopes will be more vulnerable and less heavily mined than areas its troops have traversed so far in their offensive. In a statement on Thursday, Ukraine’s Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar reported unspecified successes near Novopokropivka, without giving details. She also said Ukrainian forces were advancing near Bakhmut in the east, the only city Russia captured in its own offensive earlier this year. Heavy battles were engulfing villages south of the city, she said. Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukraine’s ground forces, also reported a “positive dynamic” near Bakhmut.

Prigozhin plane crash: What we know over a week after Wagner chief’s death,"Different theories abound as to why the jet of the Russian mercenary chief crashed, killing 10 people.","In late June, Wagner mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin took control of Russia’s southern city of Rostov-on-Don, the opening salvo of amutiny against the Kremlinthat ended in a fragile truce orchestrated by Belarus’s leader Alexander Lukashenko. The uprising was a public humiliation for Russian President Vladimir Putin, a leader believed to have a long history of taking out those he perceives as traitors. Many believed Prigozhin’s days were numbered. Two months later, a private Embraer jet travelling from Moscow to St Petersburg crashed on August 23 north of the capital,killing Prigozhinand nine other people on board, includingDmitry UtkinandValery Chekalov, four bodyguards and a crew of three. But different theories as to why the jet crashed abound, with Moscow and Washington both suggesting foul play. Here is what has been said: The Kremlin said on Wednesday that investigators were considering the possibility that the plane carrying Prigozhin was downed on purpose, the first explicit acknowledgement that he may have been assassinated. “It is obvious that different versions are being considered, including the version – you know what we are talking about – let’s say, a deliberate atrocity,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters when asked about the investigation. Asked if the International Civil Aviation Organization would investigate the crash, Peskov said that the circumstances made it different, though he cautioned that investigators had made no formal conclusions yet about what exactly took place. “Let’s wait for the results of our Russian investigation,” Peskov said. Asked about that report, Peskov said: “First of all, the investigation is under way, the Investigative Committee is engaged in this.” “In this case, there can be no talk of any international aspect,” Peskov said. In an unusual move, the Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC), which oversees aviation accident investigations in a grouping of former Soviet republics, including Russia, said it was not investigating the crash, adding that it would not be commenting on the “circumstances of the incident”. The Kremlin has rejected as an “absolute lie” the suggestion by some Western politicians and commentators – for which they have not provided evidence – that Putin ordered Prigozhin to be killed in revenge.    A preliminary US intelligence assessment concluded that an intentional explosion caused the plane crash. One of the US and Western officials who described the initial assessment said it determined that Prigozhin was “very likely” targeted and that the explosion falls in line with Putin’s “long history of trying to silence his critics”. Pentagon spokesperson General Pat Ryder said press reports that a surface-to-air missile took down the plane were inaccurate. He declined to say whether the US suspected a bomb or believed the crash was an assassination. Shortly after the crash, British security sources told the BBC that Russia’s Federal Security Service, the FSB, was “most likely to have targeted Yevgeny Prigozhin’s plane”. UK defence sources tell BBC: Prigozhin’s plane most likely brought down by Russia’s FSB domestic intel agency. Likely to strengthen position of Prigozhin’s enemies: Shoigu and Gerasimov.#Prigozhin — Frank Gardner (@FrankRGardner)August 24, 2023  The UK’s Secret Intelligence Service, the MI6’s former head, Richard Dearlove, also told the Telegraph newspaper that Prigozhin’s death was “unsurprising”. “I’m sure it’ll be presented as an accident, and there will be an element of doubt, but everyone in the West will come to the same conclusion – that this is Putin’s revenge on people who challenge his power base,” he added. Prigozhin supporters claimed on pro-Wagner channels of Telegram messaging app that the plane was deliberately downed. A post by Grey Zone, a Wagner-connected social media channel, claimed Russian anti-aircraft defences had shot down the plane. It said that residents heard “two bursts of characteristic air defence fire” before the crash. “This is confirmed by inversion traces in the sky in one of the videos,” it added.    The plane crashed near thevillage of Kuzhenkinoin Russia’s Tver region. Kuzhenkino resident Vitaly Stepenok, 72, told the Reuters news agency: “I hear an explosion or a bang. Usually, if an explosion happens on the ground, then you get an echo, but it was just a bang, and I looked up and saw white smoke.” “One wing flew off in one direction, and the fuselage went like that,” he said, gesturing with his arms to show how the plane headed down towards the ground. “And then it glided down on one wing. It didn’t nose-dive, it was gliding.” Another villager named Anatoly said: “In terms of what might have happened, I’ll just say this: It wasn’t thunder; it was a metallic bang. Let’s put it that way, I’ve heard things like that before.” Flightradar24, a Swedish internet-based service that shows real-time aircraft flight tracking information, released a report on the plane crash that showed the aircraft had struggled to maintain altitude before it plummeted to the ground. “Even though the aircraft was not transmitting position information, other data like altitude, speed, vertical rate, and autopilot settings were broadcast. It is this data that provides some insight into the final moments of the flight,” the report stated. Flightradar24 says that after levelling off at 28,000 feet (8,534 metres) at 6:10pm (15:10 GMT), the aircraft continued in level flight at consistent speed until 6:19pm (15:19 GMT), at which point the vertical rate decreased dramatically causing the aircraft to descend briefly before climbing to a maximum altitude of 30,100 feet (9,174 metres) and then dropping to about 27,500 feet (8,382 metres). Flightradar24 says the plane then climbed once more reaching 29,300 feet (8,931 metres) and levelling off once again before eventually spiralling into a fall to the ground.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/31/prigozhin-plane-crash-what-we-know-over-a-week-after-wagner-chiefs-death
Ukraine investigates corruption in medical exemptions from military duty,"Ukraine’s President Zelenskyy says bribes of between $3,000 and $15,000 paid for medical exemptions from military duty.","Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called out what he described as systematic corruption in the country’smedical exemptions from service in the armed forces, saying the system was subject to widespread bribe-taking and the flight of people overseas. Zelenskyy said that bribes of between $3,000 to $15,000 had been paid for medical exemptions from military duty. All cases of medical exemptions from service since the beginning of Russia’s war on Ukraine – where there are suspicions – will be investigated, Zelenskyy said in his eveningvideo address to the nation on Wednesday. “It is necessary to check a significant number of decisions of the military medical commissions on disability and unfitness for military service that were made after February 24,” Zelenskyy said. In some regions of Ukraine, the number of people removed from the military register due to decisions of the medical commission had “increased tenfold” since Russia’s invasion, he said. “It is absolutely clear what these decisions are. Corrupt decisions,” the president said. I held a meeting of the National Security and Defense Council. It concerned the military medical commissions.

The steps to prevent any corruption in the MMC field.…pic.twitter.com/Ne0cilUhFz — Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa)August 30, 2023  A list of Ukrainians who had travelled abroad due to “obviously dubious decisions” of the military medical commissions will be analysed separately, he added. Zelenskyy also took aim at the “concept of so-called limited fitness”, which had allowed for “manipulation” in how certain Ukrainian military units were staffed, in particular combat brigades.    “Everything related to fitness or unfitness for military service must be as clear as possible so that a person understands how he or she can help the defence, and so that the units have clarity on who will be joining them,” he said. Since Russia’s invasion in 2021, all Ukrainian men aged 18-60 who are deemed fit for military service are restricted from leaving the country – with some exceptions – and can be called up to join the war effort. Earlier this month,Zelenskyyfired all the heads of Ukraine’s regional army recruitment centres in a sweeping anticorruption move. Zelenskky said at the time that an investigation had exposed abuses by recruitment centre officials ranging from illegal enrichment to transporting men who were eligible for military duty over the country’s border despite a wartime ban on international travel for those eligible for service.    The issue of corruption in Ukraine’s military recruitment was exposed in June when a media investigation reported on the family wealth of Odesa’s regional draft commissar Yevhen Borysov. The investigation reported on millions of dollars worth of real estate and luxury vehicles allegedly owned by Borysov’s family members in Spain. According to local media reports, Borysov was charged with “unlawful enrichment”. Borysov denied all wrongdoing, saying he had nothing to do with his family’s wealth. Zelenskyy has made a crackdown on corruption in the military draft process a priority as his forces press on with a counteroffensive 18 months into Russia’s invasion. Rooting out corruption in Ukraine’s government institutions is alsoa key element in the country’s bid to join the European Union.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/31/ukraine-targets-corruption-in-medical-exemptions-from-military-service

Ukraine says 6 personnel killed in incident involving two helicopters,Six servicemen killed onboard two Mi-8 helicopters while on a mission in Russian-held territory near Bakhmut: Reports.,"Six members of the Ukrainian armed forces have been killed in an incident involving two helicopters while they were on a mission in eastern Ukraine, the military said. The six Ukrainian servicemen were killed while “carrying out missions” in a Russian-held sector of the country near the eastern city of Bakhmut, the Ukrainian military said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app on Wednesday. No details were given as to what occurred in the deadly incident which involved two of the Ukrainian military’s widely-used Mi-8 helicopters on Tuesday. Local news site Ukrainska Pravda said the deaths occurred near Kramatorsk –a large town west of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region,which has seen much fighting since the Russian invasion last year. Ukrainska Pravda reported that the two helicopters were “completely destroyed” and the bodies of the six were found in the wreckage at the site where they had crashed.

US warns N Korea against selling weapons to Russia for Ukraine war,White House says Pyongyang should ‘cease its arms negotiations’ with Moscow amid escalating tensions with Washington.,"The White House has warnedNorth Koreaagainst selling munitions to Russia for its war in Ukraine as tensions between Pyongyang and Washington continue to mount. White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said on Wednesday that the United States is concerned about potential arms deals between Russia and North Korea. “We urge the DPRK to cease its arms negotiations with Russia and abide by the public commitments that Pyongyang has made to not provide or sell arms to Russia,” Kirby said, referring to North Korea by its official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Kirby added that the US believes Russia’s Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu tried to convince Pyongyang to sell artillery ammunitions to Moscow when hevisited North Koreaand met with its leader Kim Jong Un in July. The White House spokesman declined to detail how US officials had gathered the intelligence. The US has beenwarning its competitors and adversaries– including China – against helping Russia in its military offensive in Ukraine.    Kirby’s comments on Wednesday came just weeks after Russian President Vladimir Putin and Kimexchanged lettersvowing to bolster ties between their two countries. “I am sure that we will strengthen the bilateral cooperation in all fields for the two peoples’ wellbeing and the firm stability and security of the Korean peninsula and the whole of Northeast Asia,” Putin said in a statement at that time. Last year, the US accused North Korea ofcovertly shippingartillery shells to Russia. “We remain concerned that … the DPRK continues to consider providing military support to Russia’s military forces in Ukraine,” Kirby said, citing “new information” that such talks were advancing. “High-level discussions may continue in coming months,” he said. The North Korean and Russian missions to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to requests for comment from the Reuters news agency. Both North Korea and Russia have previously denied the US’s allegations about weapons. North Korea, however, has sided with Russia over the war in Ukraine, insisting that the “hegemonic policy” of the US-led West has forced Moscow to take military action to protect its security interests. North Korea is under heavy United Nations sanctions over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, while Russia also faces a slew of US and Western sanctions over itsinvasion of Ukrainelast year. “Any kind of security cooperation or arms deal between North Korea and Russia would certainly violate a series of UN Security Council resolutions,” the US Department of State said on August 15. The latest US warning to North Korea comes as Pyongyang continues to launch intercontinentalballistic missilesin defiance of Washington. On Wednesday, the South Korean military said North Korea fired two more ballistic missiles just hours after the US flew a long-range bomber in the region. White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre condemned Wednesday’s missile launch as a threat to regional stability. North Korea hasexpressed angerat the US for holding joint naval exercises with South Korea and Japan, saying earlier this week that the drills off the Korean Peninsula increased “the danger of a nuclear war”. For its part, Washington has accused Pyongyang of violating UN resolutions and destablising the region with its missile testing.    Duringa trilateral summitnear Washington, DC this month, the US along with South Korea and Japan pledged to deepen security cooperation against North Korea, including real-time sharing of data on missile launches. Former US President Donald Trump engaged in directtalks with Kimduring his tenure, but high-level meetings between the two nations came to a halt under current US President Joe Biden. “We remain committed to a diplomatic approach to the DPRK and call on the DPRK to engage in dialogue as we have for some time now,” Jean-Pierre said on Wednesday. After the first meeting between Trump and Kim in 2018, the two countries said in a joint statement that North Korea was committed to “work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula”. But the pledge was never followed by efforts to end North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme. North Korea carried out its first nuclear weapon test in 2006 in violation of an international ban. Since then, the UN Security Council has unanimously passed numerous resolutions that imposed sanctions on the country over its nuclear programme. Last year, Russia and China vetoed aUN Security Council proposalto impose more penalties on North Korea, arguing that sanctions have not been effective in curbing the country’s nuclear programme.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/30/us-warns-north-korea-against-selling-weapons-to-russia-for-ukraine-war
Ukraine’s troops push towards Russia’s rear defences,Ukrainian forces advance south and east to the rear of Russia’s first line of defence during the 79th week of the war.,"Ukraine’s forces advanced on the southern and eastern fronts during the 79th week of the country’s war with Russia, reaching what experts believe to be the rear of Russia’s first line of defence. But they also faced a Russian advance in the northeast that created a dilemma about where to field available troops. Ukrainian forces driving towards occupied Melitopol confirmed their recapture of Robotyne, an important Russian stronghold in western Zaporizhia, which they entered on August 20. Southern forces spokesman Oleksandr Shtupunsaidon August 28 that forces were busy demining the area, securing their positions and winning more territory southeast of the settlement. Geolocatedfootageplaced them 5km (3.1 miles) southeast of Robotyne. Robotyne is important because it sits on the T0408, a highway used to resupply the Russian garrison in Tokmak, a key town 20km (12.4 miles) further south. Shtupun believed Russian forces would try to recapture Robotyne, fearing a rapid Ukrainian advance towards Tokmak. Geolocatedfootageon August 27 showed elements of the Russian 76th Guards Air Assault (VDV) Division reinforcing positions in the area. Ukraine’s Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliarsaidon August 28 that Ukrainian forces were already advancing on Novoprokopivka, the next settlement on the T0408, 4km (2.4 miles) south of Robotyne. More worrying for some Russian military reporters was Ukraine’s reported advance towards Verbove, 8km (5 miles) east of Robotyne. One Russian militaryreportercalled the situation there “very dangerous”. Another Russian reporter said Ukrainian forces here were attacking towards Russian rear defensive lines, suggesting they may have nearly broken through the first belt of Russian defences. “The series of defensive positions that Ukrainian forces are currently advancing through were comprised of dense layers of minefields and fortifications to which Russian forces committed considerable manpower, materiel, and effort to hold,” wrote the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington, DC-based think-tank.  Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs Mark Milley said that Ukraine was poised to advance through an array of anti-tank ditches, concrete anti-tank pyramids known as dragon’s teeth, anti-tank obstacles and additional minefields. “There is a complex matrix of defensive preparations that the Ukrainians are now fighting to cross, and pass,” hetoldJordan’s Almamlaka TV. But, the ISW said, the extent of these minefields was unclear, and they might be sparser than the minefields Ukraine has already crossed “to give Russian forces operating north of these positions the ability to retreat”. A Ukrainian commander who led troops into Robotyne toldReutersnews agency that the counteroffensive had broken through the toughest Russian defences and would now move faster. “We have passed the main roads that were mined. We are coming to those lines where we can go [forward]. I’m sure we’ll go faster from here,” said the commander, who had the call sign “Skala”. Milley agreed, saying Ukrainian forces “have crossed the main first line of defence”. The ISW cautioned that “there are additional series of prepared Russian defensive positions further south of the current Ukrainian advance”. Shtupunsaid on August 27 that a separate counteroffensive spearhead driving towards occupied Berdyansk had also had unspecified successes near Staromaiorske, which Ukrainian soldiers recaptured on July 27. The Russian “Vostok” Battalion’s Commander Alexander Khodakovskysaidhe was experiencing occasional shortages of manpower in the area. “When there is not enough resources, we are stretched across a long arc and are experiencing difficulties with the transfer of reserves in a large circle,” he wrote on Telegram. Ukrainian forces were also advancing in the east. Maliar said Ukrainian forces had pushed Russian forces out of Klishchiivka as they flanked the occupied city of Bakhmut to the south. Ukrainian forces here had liberated a total of 44sq km (17sq miles) she said, a square kilometre more than the week before. Russia has responded to these Ukrainian advances in the south and east by launching a new offensive in the northeast, towards the city of Kupiansk. Ukrainian Defence MinisterOleksii Reznikovconfessed that Russian forces “seem to be making some progress there”, but that Ukraine would not be blindsided into diverting forces from its counteroffensive. “It’s the enemy’s logical move to divert our attention by attacking there, so that we withdraw units from the south and east. But General Syrskii, who commands the Khortytsia troops, is simultaneously holding the defence on that front and counterattacking in the Bakhmut direction,” RBK-Ukraine quoted Reznikov as having said at a press conference. Reznikov also said the Russian move was risky, because if Ukrainian forces advanced in Bakhmut, “they will be trapped there”. But Khodakovsky said Ukrainian forces were torn between defence and counteroffence, and lacked the mass to follow through on their successful attacks, helping to explain their slow progress. “Even if it is possible to achieve tactical success in places, there is no way to develop it, and the enemy is pulled back, fearing the environment,” he wrote. Both Russia and Ukraine have continued to target each other’s weapons and logistics using drones and missiles. A Ukrainian drone swarm targeted the Russian 126th Guards Coastal Defence Brigade (Black Sea Fleet) near Perevalne, in the Crimea, said Ukraine’s military intelligence spokesperson Andriy Yusov. The Russian defence ministrysaidit downed all 42 drones, but Ukrainian residents throughout occupied Crimea said they heard many explosions, especially in Prevalne. Ukraine has used drones to target the Russian rear before, but a swarm of 42 might be its largest-scale attempt to date. Ukraine may also have successfully struck a Russian airfield on Russian soil. RBK-Ukrainesaid Ukrainian SBU military counterintelligence used drones to attack an airfield near the city of Kursk on the night of August 27, damaging four Russian Su-30 fighter jets, one MiG-29 fighter jet and radars for an S-300 missile system, and two Pantsir missile systems. Retired Australian Army Major-General Mick Ryancalledthe attacks “a demonstration of the evolving sophistication and capability of Ukraine’s conduct of strike operations” and said “Ukrainians are not only conducting attacks on an expanding list of targets but doing it at longer range”.

Russia claims Ukrainian special forces boats destroyed in Black Sea,Russian defence ministry says four boats carrying up to 50 Ukrainian special forces members were hit in aircraft attack.,"Russia said it destroyed four military boats carrying up to 50 members of the Ukrainian special forces who were operating in the Black Sea. An aircraft “destroyed four high-speed military boats” around midnight Moscow time [21:00 GMT], the Russian defence ministry wrote on the Telegram messaging app on Wednesday morning. The boats were carrying “landing groups of Ukrainian special operations forces with a total number of up to 50 people,” the ministry said, without providing details as to where in the Black Sea the incident took place. Early on Wednesday, Russian defences also repelled a “seaborne drone attack near” near Sevastopol Bay in Russian-annexed Crimea, the local Moscow-installed Governor Mikhail Razvozhayev was cited as saying by the state TASS news agency. “Anti-submarine… forces have completed their work,” Razvozhayev said, without giving details.

Ukrainian drones attack Russian airport in large-scale raids on six regions,"Raids come as Russia launches largest missile and drone attack on Ukraine capital in months, killing two people.","Russia said that Ukraine launched drones against targets in six Russian regions, including an attack on an airport in the western city of Pskov – located near the borders of Latvia and Estonia – where military transport aircraft were reported damaged amid explosions and a huge fire. In what could be the biggest drone attack on Russian territory since Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year, Russia’s defence ministry said on Wednesday morning that drones were also shot down over the regions of Orlov, Bryansk, Ryazan, Kaluga and the Moscow region surrounding the Russian capital. Meanwhile, Russia also launched a missile and drone attack against Kyiv on Wednesday morning that was described as the “most powerful strike” on the Ukrainian capital in months, leaving two people dead and one wounded, the city’s Mayor Vitali Klitschko wrote on the Telegram messaging app. Ukrainian air defences destroyed more than 20 missiles and drones involved in the attack and two security guards were killed by falling debris, according to authorities. “Kyiv had not experienced such a powerful attack since spring … In total, more than 20 enemy targets were destroyed by air defence forces,” the Kyiv city military administration wrote on Telegram. Russian state news agency TASS, quoting emergency services, said earlier on Wednesday that four Il-76 heavy transport aircraft, which have long been the workhorse of the Russian military, were damaged at an airfield in Russia’s western Pskov region, located roughly 660km (some 411 miles) north of Ukrainian border. “The defence ministry is repelling a drone attack in Pskov’s airport,” the regional Governor Mikhail Vedernikov said on the Telegram messaging app, posting a video of a large fire, with sounds of explosions and sirens in the background. Vedernikov, who was at the scene of the attack, said that “according to preliminary information, there are no victims”. The scale of the damage to the airport was being assessed, he said.

Reports on Telegram channels said anti-aircraft systems were in action around the Russian city, which is located close to European Union member countries Latvia and Estonia. Moscow’s Vnukovo airport was also closed briefly early on Wednesday, TASS reported, citing Russian aviation officials. The airport was ordered closed amid reports that Russia’s military was repelling a drone attack on Pskov airport, the news agency reported.    Meduza, one of Russia’s most widely read independent news sites, said sources reported that between 10 and 20 drones attacked Pskov airfield and that Russian troops stationed on the ground tried to repel the drone raid using small-arms fire. One of the drones reportedly hit a refuelling complex, according to the news site, causing a large fire. Russia’s 334th Transport Aviation Regiment, which operates Il-76 transport planes, is based at the Pskov airport, according to Meduza. All flights from the airport are cancelled, the Pskov Governor Vedernikov wrote on Telegram, “until the nature of the possible damage to the runway is clarified”. The extent of any damage or casualties from the other Russian regions where drones were reportedly shot down was not immediately known. Al Jazeera’s Dorsa Jabbari, reporting from Saint Petersburg in Russia, said the Russian foreign ministry has branded the drone raids on Wednesday a “terrorist act” by Kyiv. “The feeling here is that this is one of the most brazen attacks on Russian territory since the start of the so-called ‘special military operation’,” Jabbari said. Reporting from Kyiv, Al Jazeera’s Rob McBride said that authorities in Ukraine do not comment directly on attacks inside Russia, which they have described as “accidents happening on Russian territory”. “But the administration here, including Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the president, have said that Russian airbases do present legitimate targets, and it does follow a pattern now, a surge, an uptick in attacks on Russian airbases. Not only airbases in occupied Crimea but also in Russia itself,” McBride said. The Pskov region last came under attack in late May when two armed drones caused an explosion that left an oil pipeline’s administrative building damaged, the regional governor said at the time. Russia’s capital Moscow and regional areas in the country havecome under near-daily raidsby Ukrainian drones in recent weeks amid a warning by Kyiv that the war on Ukraine would “return” to Russia.

Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin buried at St Petersburg cemetery,Secrecy had surrounded the funeral arrangements for the Wagner mercenary boss who was killed in a plane crash on August 23.,"Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Wagner Group chief whodied in a plane crashlast week, has been buried at a cemetery on the outskirts of St Petersburg. The funeral took place on Tuesday, away from the glare of the media and in stark contrast to the brazen, self-publicising style with which Prigozhin had fanned his reputation far beyond Russia for ruthlessness and ambition. “The farewell to Yevgeny Viktorovich took place in a closed format. Those who wish to say goodbye may visit Porokhovskoye cemetery,” his press service said in a short post on Telegram. Pictures published on social media showed Prigozhin’s dark granite tombstone surrounded by a sea of flowers, mostly red roses, in the cemetery on the northeast edge of his hometown. Secrecy had surrounded the funeral arrangements for the Wagner mercenary boss who was killed in a plane crash on August 23, two months to the day after he staged amutiny in the biggest challengeto President Vladimir Putin’s rule since he rose to power in 1999. The head of PMC ""Wagner"" Yevgeny Prigozhin was buried in St. Petersburg. Russian channels published a photo of Prigozhin's grave, his father is buried nearby. Peskov said today that Putin would not attend Prigozhin's funeral.pic.twitter.com/CGLkIOZTjI — Sprinter (@Sprinter99800)August 29, 2023  It meant the event could not be turned into a large-scale public show of support for Prigozhin, a brutal figure who was nevertheless admired by some in Russia for throwing his fighters into the fiercest battles of the war in Ukraine and speaking openly about the shortcomings of the Russian military and its leadership. In recent days admirers had heaped flowers on makeshift shrines to Prigozhin in Moscow, St Petersburg and elsewhere. “There is sort of a cult following around Wagner,” Jack Margolin, a researcher on private military companies, told Al Jazeera. “There is quite a following of not just former fighters but people who admire the Wagner Group and what they represent for this resurgence of Russian nationalism.” The White House on Tuesday came close to declaring the Kremlin was responsible for Prigozhin’s death. “We all know that the Kremlin has a long history of killing opponents,” said White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. “It’s very clear what happened here.” Her comment was the closest US statement yet on the possibility that Putin directed the killing of Prigozhin, who launched a brief revolt against the defence ministry over its handling ofthe Ukraine war. The Kremlin has rejected as an “absolute lie” the suggestion that Putin ordered his death in revenge for the June mutiny. It said earlier on Tuesday the president would not attend the funeral. Two other top Wagner figures, four bodyguards and three crew members were also killed when Prigozhin’s Embraer Legacy 600 private jetcrashed north of Moscow. It is still unclear what caused the plane to crash, but villagers near the scene told Reuters news agency they heard a bang and then saw the jet plummet to the ground. Aftermonths of insulting Putin’s top brasswith a variety of crude expletives and prison slang over their perceived failure to fight the Ukraine war properly, Prigozhin took control of the southern city of Rostov in late June. He then marched towards Moscow before turning back 200km (125 miles) from the capital. Putin initially cast Prigozhin as a traitor whose mutiny could have tipped Russia into civil war, though he later made a deal with him to defuse the crisis. The day after the crash, Putin sent his condolences to the families of those killed and said he had known Prigozhin for a very long time, since the chaotic years of the early 1990s. “He was a man with a difficult fate, and he made serious mistakes in life,” Putin said, while describing him as a talented businessman.    Before the mutiny, Prigozhin had quipped that his nickname should have been “Putin’s butcher” rather than “Putin’s chef” – a moniker acquired after his catering company won Kremlin contracts. He always professed loyalty to Putin, though he said his defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, was so incompetent he should executed for his treachery. After Prigozhin’s death, Putin ordered Wagner fighters to sign an oath of allegiance to the Russian state – a step that Prigozhin had opposed due to his anger at the defence ministry that he said risked losing the Ukraine war. Investigators said on Sunday that genetic tests had confirmed the identities of all 10 people killed in the crash, who also included two pilots and a flight attendant. Earlier on Tuesday, Valery Chekalov, the head of Wagner logistics, was buried at another St Petersburg cemetery.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/29/wagner-chief-yevgeny-prigozhin-buried-at-st-petersburg-cemetery
Ukraine drones destroyed in latest raids on Russian territory,Russian defence ministry says three drones were shot down over the Russian regions of Tula and Belgorod.,"Russian air defences shot down three Ukrainian drones flying over the Russian regions of Tula and Belgorod, the Ministry of Defence has reported, in the latestattempted attackson targets inside Russian territory. Two drones “were destroyed” by air defences over the Tula region south of Moscow, the defence ministry said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app early on Tuesday morning. Another drone was “destroyed by air defence forces” over the Belgorod region, which borders Ukraine, at about 11pm Moscow time (20:00 GMT) on Monday, the ministry said in a separate statement. The ministry did not say whether there had been damage or casualties as a result of the drone raids. Moscow and other Russian regions have been hit by a barrage ofUkrainian drone attacksin recent weeks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy saying late last month that the war would be returning to Russia.    “Gradually, the war is returning to the territory of Russia – to its symbolic centres and military bases, and this is an inevitable, natural and absolutely fair process,” he said at the time. Ukrainian drones repeatedly raided Russian territory last week, leading to multiple temporary suspensions of flights at Moscow’s three main airports – Sheremetyevo, Domodedovo and Vnukovo.    The defence ministry also reported on Monday that two Russian jet fighters were scrambled to intercept two United States reconnaissance drones that were on a flight path over the Black Sea. According to the ministry, the two US drones, a Reaper and a Global Hawk, were “carrying out aerial reconnaissance in the region of the Crimean peninsula”, near the Black Sea. After the arrival of the Russian warplanes, the drones “changed their direction of flight and left the areas where aerial reconnaissance was being conducted”, the ministry added. On Sunday, Russia said it had scrambled a fighter plane to deter a US Air Force reconnaissance drone from crossing its borders over the Black Sea.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/29/ukraine-drones-destroyed-in-latest-raids-on-russian-territory
US accuses Russia of intimidation over former consulate worker’s spy charge,"Robert Shonov, a Russian national and ex-staffer at Washington’s consulate in Vladivostok, was charged with ‘cooperation on a confidential basis’ with US embassy staff in Moscow.","The United States has accused Russia of attempting to intimidate and harass Washington’s employees after Russian state media reported that a former US consulate worker was charged with collecting information on the war in Ukraine on behalf of Washington. Russia’s state-run TASS news agency quoted Russia’s FSB security service as saying that Robert Shonov, a Russian national, hadsupplied informationto US embassy staff in Moscow on how Russia’s conscription for the war in Ukraine was affecting political discontent inside Russia ahead of the country’s 2024 presidential election. The charge of “cooperation on a confidential basis with a foreign state” carries a maximum prison sentence of eight years in prison. “Russia’s targeting of Mr Shonov under the ‘confidential cooperation’ statute only highlights the increasingly repressive actions the Russian government is taking against its own citizens,” US State Department Spokesperson Matthew Millersaid in a statementon Monday. Miller said that Shonov provided services to the US Embassy in Moscow “in strict compliance with Russia’s laws and regulations”. The allegations of the Russian government against Robert Shonov are wholly without merit. We strongly protest the Russian security services’ attempts – furthered by Russia’s state-controlled media – to intimidate and harass our employees.https://t.co/bmuMGDYFS4 — Matthew Miller (@StateDeptSpox)August 28, 2023  “We strongly protest the Russian security services’ attempts – furthered by Russia’s state-controlled media – to intimidate and harass our employees,” Miller said in the statement, adding that Washington was aware the FSB had also summoned two diplomats working at the US embassy in Moscow in connection to the case. Shonov, who has been under arrest since May, was employed by the US Consulate General in the eastern Russian city of Vladivostok for more than 25 years until Russia in 2021 ordered the termination of the US mission’s local staff. “Shonov’s sole role at the time of his arrest was to compile press summaries from publicly-available Russian media sources,” the State Department said following his arrest in May. “The fact that he is being prosecuted under the ‘confidential cooperation’ law highlights the Russian Federation’s blatant use of increasingly repressive laws against its own citizens,” it added.    The FSB said it also planned to question two US embassy employees – identified as Jeffrey Silin and David Bernstein who worked in the political department at the diplomatic mission in Moscow – who were in contact with Shonov. Russian news agencies released undated footage on Monday distributed by the FSB showing Shonov’s detention on a snow-covered street. It also published images of Shonov testifying on camera. The FSB said Shonov had begun handing information to the US diplomats last September about the war in Ukraine and the resulting mobilisation of Russians to fight in the war. It added that Shonov had been tasked with gauging protest sentiment ahead of presidential elections scheduled for next year in Russia.

What will replace Russia’s Wagner mercenary army?,"The powerful private military company is already being torn apart by Russia’s military, intelligence services, and state-run corporations financed by Kremlin allies or oligarchs.","Kyiv, Ukraine– The Kremlin says it is at odds about the future of the Wagner Group, Russia’s largest and most notorious private military company. “I can’t tell you anything now, I don’t know. Legally, no such structure exists,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday, two days after Wagner’s head Yevgeny Prigozhin and his top brass died in a plane crash that Western officials claim was caused by an explosion. But observers tell Al Jazeera that Wagner’s battle-tested fighters are too valuable to just be disbanded and let go. What and who is left of Wagner is already being torn apart by Russia’s military, intelligence services, state-run corporations and private military companies (PMCs) financed by Kremlin allies or oligarchs – and even BelarusianPresident Alexander Lukashenkomay get his share. Since 2014, Wagner employed thousands of experienced fighters of starkly different backgrounds. Some graduated from elite military and intelligence units, some fought for Moscow in Chechen wars, and some hailed from criminal groups that mushroomed in the former Soviet Union in the 1990s. Last year, Wagner enlisted tens of thousands of inmates from Russian jails who were promised hefty paycheques and presidential pardons, but were largely used in what is known as “meat marches” on Ukrainian positions. Few survived in what bled Ukrainian forces dry and stalled Kyiv’s counteroffensive, and even fewer stayed on. Given the survivors’ battlefield prowess, the biggest question is whether the Kremlin would try to preserve Wagner under new management – or create its full-fledged replicas. Both options seem hardly feasible for now.  What made Wagner stand out was the business acumen and nefarious charisma of Prigozhin, whose out-of-the-box thinking, obscene, megalomaniac diatribes and insubordination were unprecedented in President Vladimir Putin’s Russia – and would make many James Bond movie villains pale in comparison. The 62-year-old ex-convict – once known as “Putin’s chef” and blacklisted in the West – put together a business empire that traded in Syrian hydrocarbons, African diamonds, gold, timbre and raw materials. He inked lucrative security deals with sub-Saharan autocrats, ran catering businesses and hotels in Russia and launched atroll farm that meddled in electionsfrom Madagascar to the United States, spawning media outlets and Telegram channels. Wagner was just the most visible jewel in his crown. “Wagner was much more than just a PMC,” John Lechner, aUS authorwho is writing a book about Prigozhin that summarises years of research in Africa, the Middle East, Russia and Ukraine, told Al Jazeera. “There’s really nothing quite like it that can replace it anytime soon.” Ukraine’s top military expert agrees. “Wagner is unique in its own way, and you need to credit Prigozhin with that,” Lieutenant General Ihor Romanenko, former deputy chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, told Al Jazeera. Russia’s top brass “will hardly be able to form something similar in the nearest future”, Romanenko said. Wagner’s most valuable and lethal resource – battle-tested, seasoned fighters – is up for grabs, he said. “They will pull people apart, the process is already going on. Some will be removed, some fired. Some will move to other structures, some may be interested [in staying on] because they are well-trained storm troops.”  Wagner has been cracking at the seams since Prigozhin’s aborted mutiny on June 23. He said his “justice march” on Moscow that stopped 200km (125 miles) south of the Russian capital was triggered by a months-long feud with the defence ministry that had“sabotaged” ammunition supplies. The march was also sparked by Moscow’s ultimatum that each Wagner fighter had to sign a contract to become a cog in Russia’s military machine, known for its ineffectiveness, poor decision-making and logistics that turned Putin’s Ukrainian blitzkrieg into a quagmire with no end in sight. Lukashenko brokered a truce between Prigozhin and the Kremlin, guaranteeing that Wagner fighters who did not want to sign up could relocate to Belarus. Thousands already did and settled in camps built for them in the dense Belarusian forests that once hid World War II guerrillas fighting German Nazis. “The most qualified part of them will get Belarusian citizenship and will be integrated in Belarusian law enforcement structures,” Belarusian-born, Kyiv-based analyst Igar Tyshkevich told Al Jazeera. The recruits will help Lukashenkocounter Moscow’s effortsto complete its subjugation of his ex-Soviet nation of 10 million people. Lukashenko will try to force the rest of Wagner fighters back to Russia, where the military, intelligence services and state companies are already trying to fill the vacuum left by Prigozhin’s death, Tyshkevich said. For example, Lukoil, Russia’s second-largest energy company, has long had its own security company launched by former special intelligence operations officers with the Soviet-era KGB.    In November, the Kremlin allowed Russian corporations to form their own private military companies and Lukoil’s security service, Lukom-A, has been “actively boosting its military potential” to launch its own PMC, Tyshkevich said. Similarly, security companies affiliated with Putin’s allies or Kremlin-controlled energy giants would keep in contact with what remains of Wagner to develop their own private military companies, he said. Some Wagner fighters would prefer to maintain their independence and will “turn into a standard group of mercenaries or a private military company”. Others will become part of state corporations or intelligence services and some have already signed contracts with the defence ministry, while those “pushed out” of Belarus may join them to fight in Ukraine, he added. “But there won’t be many,” Tyshkevich said. “Wagner will fragment into several structures.” “Experienced fighters went to the front line following their hearts to kick out [Ukrainian] nationalists,” an anchor with the Kremlin-controlled Channel One television network said in January, announcing a story about Fakel (Torch), another PMC. The footage showed adozen masked “ex-military officers”fighting in the southeastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk, shelling and storming Ukrainian trenches. It did not mention Fakel’s financial backers but media reports suggest Gazprom, the Kremlin-controlled natural gas producer and exporter, pays its bills – and also funds at least two more PMCs – Potok (Flow) and Plamya (Flame). Molfar, a Ukrainianopen-source intelligence group, said that as of March, 25 Russian private military companies operated in Ukraine. They had names such as Redoubt, Anti-Terror Eagle, and Yastreb (Hawk) and mostly employed ex-military officers. Two-thirds of them allegedly had ties to Russia’s defence ministry and intelligence services, and six were “probably” funded by oligarchs such as Putin’s longtime ally Gennady Timchenko and aluminium tycoon Oleg Deripaska, Molfar claimed. What unites them is the Kremlin’s push to avoid the official involvement and death of regular Russian servicemen in Ukraine. “Mercenaries are gathered to bypass inter-institutional and other frameworks and limitations that can’t possibly be followed,” Pavel Luzin, a fugitive Russian defence analyst, told Al Jazeera. Most of these PMCs are small and their fighters complain of poor supply chains and coordination with other units. But their sponsors fulfil two goals: to help the Kremlin avoidanother round of mobilisationand to show Putin their loyalty, Lechner said. Deripaska’s press service told Al Jazeera that Molfar’s claims were “grossly false” and that he “never provided any form of support, financing, or backing to any military companies or groups”. In the eyes of Russian law, private military companies are still illegal, which makes their sponsors or members subject to prosecution if they disobey Moscow the way Prigozhin did. But none have a chance to eclipse him. “There’s plenty of military talent among the other commanders but Prigozhin’s charisma, his ability to bring things together as a logistician, as a manager – that would be difficult for them to replace in one man,” Lechner said. But thewar in Ukraine– along with Russia’s ambitions in other parts of the world – will likely keep these PMCs afloat and alive. “Russian mercenaries are here to stay,” said Lechner. “It might be in a less charismatic form, but they’ve created the market for themselves and for others probably, too.”   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/28/what-will-replace-russias-wagner-mercenary-army
How useful will the F-16s be in helping Ukraine?,Ukraine is increasingly looking to replace its jets as Russia continues to dominate the skies in the two countries’ 18-month-long war.,"Ukraine’sPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyyhas intenselylobbied Western militariesfor fourth-generation aircraft like the F-16 that the latter have begun to shed. After 18 months of war, Ukraine’s air force is badly in need of replacement aircraft as losses mount and Russia’s air force increasingly controls the skies above Ukraine. Introduced in 1978, the F-16 has a great service record and variants have been regularly upgraded with better avionics, radar and weapons. The jet is capable of performing many functions including ground attacks, electronic warfare, close air support, and air dominance. It has been proven time and again to be a very capable fighter jet: Highly manoeuvrable, it can operate in all weathers, day or night. The F-16’s adaptability means it can quickly be tasked with a variety of different missions, effortlessly able to carry out a new given role. It is this flexibility that has made it a mainstay of so many of the world’s air forces. While there are many pros to the F-16, there are also significant drawbacks. Advanced Russian aircraft like the Sukhoi Su-35 have better radar and longer-range missiles. They would, in theory, be able to detect an F-16 and destroy it before the pilot even realised the Russian jet was there. Like all complex aircraft, the F-16 requires regular maintenance and cannot operate from improvised runways such as roads, something that Ukraine’s air force is finding increasingly useful for its surviving aircraft as Russia targets Ukrainian airfields, leaving many out of action. Few Ukrainian pilots are fluent enough in English to successfully pass the intense training programme needed to effectively fly the F-16. In addition, ground crews often make the difference between success and failure as well-trained crews can refuel and rearm an aircraft more quickly than their adversaries, allowing the aircraft to get back into the fight. This is a key discipline that makes a significant difference in conflict, but the crews themselves would need to train and rehearse on a variety of unfamiliar Western systems, which would take months, possibly years, to master. Russia has used its large supply of long-range missiles to good effect, striking multiple airfields far behind the front lines in an effort to destroy the Ukrainian air force jets kept there. To avoid destruction, Ukraine has built an extensive network of rudimentary runways spread across the country. At these remote landing strips, jets can be refueled and refitted with weapons.     The British Royal Air Force estimates thatUkraine has lost 68 aircraft since the war began– 22 percent of its inventory. Transfers from neighbouring countries of old Soviet aircraft have partially plugged the gap, but fighter jets have often needed major overhauls before they are able to fly again. Russia’s air force has taken advantage of its superiority in air defences and has been increasingly effective at stopping Ukrainian air attacks. For every 15 Ukrainian aircraft, there are 100Russian jets. The Ukrainian army is currently fighting its way through extensive Russian defensive barriers in a southern counteroffensive that has seen a lot of fighting for little movement. This has been made much harder by Ukraine’s forces not being able to launch air attacks and control the skies above them. Testimonies from Ukrainian soldiers on the ground indicate they are most afraid oflarge precision-guided bombs dropped by Russian aircraftwith deadly effect. An injection of several dozen versatile, capable jets would, in the long run, help Ukraine and allow it to take the initiative, launch air strikes and support group advances. The F-16s will take months to arrive and will slowly trickle in. When they do turn up, these aircraft will need extensive ground crews to keep them in the air. Yet another long global supply chain will be needed to keep Ukraine’s air force supplied with the spare parts and weapons needed for the jets to keep flying. The aircraft may not arrive in time to make a difference in the current counteroffensive as Ukraine is forced to rely on long-range missile and drone strikes to destroy targets far behind the front lines.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/28/how-useful-will-the-f-16s-be-in-helping-ukraine
"Who was Dmitry Utkin, a key Wagner mercenary who died alongside Prigozhin?",The secretive war-hardened career-officer-turned-mercenary is said to have given the Wagner group its name.,"Dmitry Utkin, a shadowy figure whose call sign “Wagner” allegedly inspired the Russian private mercenary group’s name,died alongside Yevgeny Prigozhin in a plane crashon Wednesday. Utkin, who served in the Russian military intelligence, is often cited as the founder of Wagner Group, but many analysts now say that rumour was simply a smokescreen for Prigozhin, who only recently acknowledged his leading role in the armed group. So, who really was the 53-year-old veteran on board thedoomed private jetthat fell from the sky between Moscow and St Petersburg? Here is what you need to know: Born on June 11, 1970 in Asbest, a town nestled on the slopes of the Ural Mountains and named after its local Asbestos industry, Utkin appears to have joined the military at the age of 18. He served in the Spetsnaz GRU, Russia’s military intelligence division, between 1988 and 2008, according to his online CV unearthed by the investigative website Bellingcat. As a lieutenant colonel, he served in Russia’s two wars in Chechnya between 1994-2000. The time at which he left the military remains unclear, but in 2013, he appears to have been employed by a mysterious Hong-Kong-based private military company (PMC) called the Slavonic Corps. The only known deployment of the PMC was in Syria, where they reportedly lost a battle with the fighters linked to al-Qaeda armed group. The Wagner Group first appeared in 2014 when Russia sent troops into Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula, annexing the territory and began supporting separatist rebels in the east of the country. The group itself is believed to have been named after Utkin’s call sign Wagner, a reference to Richard Wagner, the favourite composer of German Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. It remains unclear how involved Utkin was in forming the group, but it has been proven that Utkin played a key role in the war in Ukraine’s Donbas region and is even reported to have been injured in the fighting. His role in the war was later confirmed by Ukrainian signal intelligence, which intercepted phone conversations between him and GRU Colonel Oleg Ivannikov, as well as to Major-General Evgeny Nikiforov, head of Russia’s 58th Army. Between 2015 and 2022, various sources show that Utkin was active in Syria and on theAfrican continent with Wagner. A BBC investigation in 2021 linked him to documents that revealed Wagner’s involvement in theLibyan civil war.    He has also been accused of issuing the order to beat a Wagner defector to death and to film the act in Homs, Syria. In 2016, he was decorated with the Order for Courage for his services in Ukraine by Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin. In 2022, after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Utkin appears to have participated in the long and bloody battle for Bakhmut. However, some reports suggest that he remained focused on the group’s activities in Africa and Syria. Unlike Prigozhin, who appeared to relish the limelight, Utkin remained a secretive and elusive character during his time with Wagner. How involved he was in the mutinous march on Moscow in July remains unclear, but reports suggest he may have led one of Wagner’s columns.    He certainly appears to have remained loyal to Prigozhin and the group until the very end of his life. In a video posted on a Wagner-linked Telegram channel not long after the group were banished to Belarus, Utkin and Prigozhin can be seen jointly addressing a group of fighters. In it, a voice resembling Utkin’s was heard to say: “This isn’t the end; it’s just the beginning of the biggest job in the world, which will be carried out very soon,” before adding in English, “Welcome to hell”. Utkin was certainly a Nazi sympathiser. One of the few available photos of Utkin is a selfie which shows tattoos of a Nazi eagle and a Schutzstaffel (SS) symbol on his body. Bellingcat describes him as having an “obsessive fascination” with the history of the Third Reich. The Wagner Group has long been mired with accusations of Nazi sympathisers among its ranks and has been accused of spray painting swastikas and SS symbols.

Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin confirmed dead in crash,Genetic analysis confirms mercenary boss was killed after his aircraft went down in what appeared to be an explosion.,"Russian authoritiesconfirmed the deathof Wagner Group chief Yevgeny Prigozhin, putting to rest any doubts about whether the wily mercenary leader turned mutineer was on a plane that crashed killing everyone on board. Genetic testing on the 10 bodies recovered at thecrash site“conform to the manifest ” for the flight, Russian Investigative Committee spokeswoman Svetlana Petrenko said in a statement on Sunday. Russia’s civil aviation authority had said Prigozhin and some of his top lieutenants were on the list of seven passengers and three crew members. The Investigative Committee did not indicate what might have caused the business jet to plummet from the sky halfway between Moscow and St Petersburg, Prigozhin’s hometown. But the crash’s timing raised suspicions of a possible Kremlin-orchestrated hit – something Russia has vehemently denied. Peter Eltsov, associate professor at the US National Defense University, said conspiracy theories about Prigozhin still being alive say a lot about how big a figure the Wagner Group chief was in Russia. “He is becoming this iconic hero for a lot of his followers,” Eltsov told Al Jazeera. Two months ago, Prigozhin, 62, mounted a daylong mutiny against Russia’s military, leading his mercenaries from Ukraine toward Moscow. Russian President Vladimir Putin decried the act as “treason” and vowed punishment for those involved. Instead, the Kremlin quickly cut a deal with Prigozhin to end the revolt, saying he would be allowed to walk free without facing any charges and to resettle in Belarus. Questions remained about whether the former ally of Russia’s leader would face a comeuppance for the brief uprising that posed the biggest challenge to Putin’s authority during his 23-year rule. Prigozhin’s second-in-command, Dmitry Utkin, as well as Wagner logistics mastermind Valery Chekalov, also were killed in the crash. Utkin was long believed to have founded Wagner and baptised the group with his nom de guerre.    Prigozhin was locked in a bitter months-long power struggle with the defence ministry as his forces spearheaded costly battles for limited gains in eastern Ukraine. He earlier accused the Russian military of trying to “steal” victories from Wagner and slammed Moscow’s “monstrous bureaucracy” for grinding progress on the ground. And he directly blamed Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and other senior officials for his fighters’ deaths, claiming Moscow had not provided sufficient ammunition. Unlike Russia’s generals, who have been criticised for shirking the battles in Ukraine, the stocky and bald Prigozhin regularly posed for pictures alongside mercenaries allegedly on the front lines. He posted on social media images from the cockpit of an Su-24 fighter jet and challenged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to an aerial duel. Wagner soldiers played a prominent role in the fighting in eastern Ukraine, especially in the months-long siege of the city of Bakhmut, despite Prigozhin’s frequent, profanity-laced attacks on Russia’s military high command over their conduct of the war that culminated in the failed mutiny. After the mutiny, his fighters were offered three options: to follow him to Belarus, retire, or enlist in Russia’s regular army and return to Ukraine. Several thousand Wagner mercenaries opted to move to Belarus, where a camp was erected for them southeast of the capital, Minsk. Some are expected to be absorbed into Russia’s armed forces, but many will be angry over the sudden demise of the group’s founder who inspired a high degree of loyalty among his men.

Russia confirms death of Wagner chief Prigozhin after genetic tests,Russian investigators say genetic tests have confirmed that Prigozhin was among the 10 people killed in a plane crash on Wednesday.,"Russian investigators have confirmed the death ofYevgeny Prigozhin, founder of the mercenary group Wagner, in aplane crashearlier this week based on results of genetic tests. Svetlana Petrenko, spokesperson of the country’s Investigative Committee, said in a statement on Sunday that forensic testing identified all 10 bodies recovered at the site of Wednesday’s crash and the findings “conform to the manifest” of the plane. The statement did not offer any details as to what might have caused thecrash.    Russia’s civil aviation authority earlier this week said Prigozhin, along with some of his top lieutenants, were on the list of the passengers and crew members on board the plane. Prigozhin, 62, was killed two months after he mounted a mutiny against Russia’s military that President Vladimir Putin decried as “treason”. The Russian presidentsent his condolenceson Thursday to the families of those who died in the crash. “He [Prigozhin] was a talented person, a talented businessman, he worked not only in our country, and achieved results, but also abroad, particularly in Africa,” Putin said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/27/russia-confirms-death-of-wagner-chief-prigozhin-after-genetic-tests

Russian held in Finland said to be key figure in far-right Wagner affiliate,Suspect Yan Petrovsky is said to be a fighter in the Wagner-associated ‘Rusich’ – the Sabotage Assault Reconnaissance Group.,"An alleged member of an extreme right-wing militarysub-unit of the Wagner mercenary forcehas been arrested in Finland on charges of participation in a “terrorist group”, following a request from Ukraine, according to reports. A detention hearing was scheduled to take place on Friday in a district court near Helsinki, according to Finnish public broadcaster Yle. Finnish police are requesting that the 36-year-old Russian national, identified as Yan Petrovsky, be detained in preparation for his extradition. According to court documents, Petrovsky was allegedly involved in atrocitiesduring fighting in 2014 and 2015 in the Donbasregion of eastern Ukraine, Germany’s DPA news agency reported. Russian state-run news agencies RIA and TASS reported on Friday that the Russian embassy in Helsinki was aware of the detention of a Russian citizen in Finland on Ukraine’s request and was taking steps to offer consular assistance. Social media channels linked to Russia’s Wagner mercenaries said on Friday that the suspect was a key fighter with the Sabotage Assault Reconnaissance Group – “Rusich” – which is affiliated with Wagner.    According to reports cited by the Reuters news agency, Petrovsky is a founding member and leader of the Rusich unit and has been under European Union and United States sanctions since last year. He reportedly helped to found Rusich as an explicitly neo-Nazi unit during theopening stages of the conflict in the Donbas in 2014. He was initially arrested in Finland on July 20 for a visa violation and could now be extradited to Ukraine, according to the reports. It is unclear how Petrovsky was able to enter Finland while under EU sanctions. A district court in Vantaa near Helsinki was expected to extend Petrovsky’s detention in custody at the request of the Finnish National Bureau of Investigation on Friday afternoon, a court official told the Reuters news agency. The bureau sought the detention of Petrovsky, who also uses the name Voislav Torden, on suspicion of participating in a terrorist group’s activities as well as supporting terrorism, the official said. Ukraine’s prosecutor general did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

Belarusian leader Lukashenko says he warned Wagner chiefs to ‘watch out’,Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko says he told Yevgeny Prigozhin and Dmitry Utkin: ‘Lads – you watch out’.,"Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said that he warned Russia’s Wagner mercenary chiefs Yevgeny Prigozhin and Dmitry Utkin to watch out for possible threats to their lives, and insisted that Wagner fighters would remain in Belarus following the apparent deaths of their leaders in a plane crash. Lukashenko,who helped broker the dealthat saw Wagner fighters retreat peacefully to Belarus following their aborted rebellion in June, said at the time that he had persuaded Putin not to “wipe out” Prigozhin and his mercenary force. Commenting on Prigozhin’s apparent death in a plane crash in Russia this week, Lukashenko said on Friday that the Wagner boss had twice dismissed concerns raised about possible threats to his life. Lukashenko said thatduring the mutiny, he had warned Prigozhinthat he would “die” if he continued to march on Moscow, to which he said Prigozhin had answered: “‘To hell with it – I will die'”. Then, Lukashenko said, when Prigozhin and Utkin, who helped found Wagner and was also listed as a passenger on the plane that crashed, had come to see him, he had warned them both: “Lads – you watch out”.    It was not exactly clear from Lukashenko’s warnings, which were reported by Belarusian state news agency BelTA, when that conversation took place with the Wagner leaders. Lukashenko, both an old acquaintance of Prigozhin and a close ally of Russia, said he believed thatPutin had nothing to do with the plane crash. “I know Putin: He is calculating, very calm, even tardy,” Lukashenko said. “I cannot imagine that Putin did it, that Putin is to blame. It’s just too rough and unprofessional a job,” he said. The Kremlin said on Friday that Western suggestions that Prigozhin had beenkilled on its orders were an “absolute lie”, while also declining to definitively confirm the Wagner chief’s death, citing the need to wait for test results.    Lukashenko also said that Wagner fighters would remain in Belarus. “Wager lived, Wagner is living and Wagner will live in Belarus,” Lukashenko said. “As long as we need this unit, they will live and work with us,” he said. Washington, DC-based think tank, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), said that Lukashenko’s comments on Prigozhin and the deal he struck to end the Wagner rebellion in Russia in June, as well as Putin’s innocence in the Wagner chiefs’ apparent deaths, were to bolster his image with his domestic audience. “Lukashenko has routinely attempted to portray himself as a sovereign leader despite Russia’s current de facto occupation of the country [Belarus], and he likely hopes to prevent his domestic audience from viewing Putin’s almost certain assassination of Prigozhin as the Kremlin’s unilateral cancellation of agreements that he [Lukashenko] had made with Wagner,” the ISW said. “Lukashenko likely hoped to underscore the initial deal, and Wagner’s arrival in Belarus as examples of his ability to make high-level security decisions outside of the Kremlin’s dictates,” the ISW added. 3/#Lukashenko’s likely desire to maintain the appearance of being a sovereign leader appears to have outweighed any such concerns. — ISW (@TheStudyofWar)August 26, 2023 ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/26/belarusian-leader-lukashenko-says-he-warned-wagner-chiefs-to-watch-out

Russia destroys drone near Moscow in latest attack on Russian capital,Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin says air defence systems destroyed a drone in the Istra district west of Moscow.,"Russian air defence has repelleda new drone attack on Moscow, the city’s mayor said, the latest of several attempts to attack the Russian capital with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) this week. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said early on Saturday that a drone was destroyed by air defence systems over the Istra district west of Moscow. Emergency services were at the scene and there have been no initial reports of damage or casualties, Sobyanin said on the Telegram messaging app. The early morning drone raid on Saturday forced authorities to temporarily shut down all three main airports serving the capital. Russia’s military has reported that Ukrainian drones and a missile attack have repeatedly targeted Russian territory over the course of the past week, and three Moscow airports – Sheremetyevo, Domodedovo and Vnukovo – have been forced to suspend flights temporarily as a result. Flights were also disrupted at the Moscow airports on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday, according to reports. Ukraine did not immediately comment on the latest drone raid and almost never publicly claims responsibility for attacks inside Russia or on Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Russia’s Ministry of Defence reported on Friday that its forces had shot down nine Ukrainian drones and suppressed 33 others with “electronic warfare” in the largest drone attack so far by Kyiv on the Russian-annexed Crimean peninsula since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine began last year.

‘Absolute lie’: Russia denies role in Yevgeny Prigozhin plane crash,"Allegations that Moscow was behind aircraft explosion presumed to have killed Wagner Group boss are untrue, Kremlin spokesman says.","Western suggestions that the Wagner Group mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin was killed on the Russian government’s orders are an “absolute lie”, the Kremlin says. It declined on Friday to definitively confirm Prigozhin’s death in a plane crash, citing the need to wait for test results. Russian investigators have recovered 10 bodies and flight recorders from the scene of Wednesday’s crash northwest of Moscow, and investigations are under way. Prigozhin, who conducted a brief but shocking mutiny in Russia two months ago, hired fighters who arefeared in Africa and Syria and played a crucial role in the war in Ukraine. Some unidentified officials from the West quoted in the media have suggestedthe plane explosionappears to be vengeance for the Wagner mutiny in June, which posed the biggest challenge to President Vladimir Putin’s 23-year rule. But Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov flatly rejected the allegations. “Right now, of course, there are lots of speculation around this plane crash and the tragic deaths of the passengers of the plane, including Yevgeny Prigozhin,” Peskov told reporters in a conference call. “Of course in the West, those speculations are put out under a certain angle, and all of it is a complete lie.” Prigozhin waslisted among those on boardthe plane. When asked whether the Kremlin has received an official confirmation of Prigozhin’s death, Peskov referencedPutin’s remarksfrom a day earlier. “He said that right now all the necessary forensic analyses, including genetic testing, will be carried out. Once some kind of official conclusions are ready to be released, they will be released.”    Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, a close ally of Putin who mediated the deal that ended the mutiny, said he “can’t imagine” the Russian leader ordered Prigozhin’s assassination. “I know Putin. He is calculating, very calm, even slow,” Lukashenko was quoted as saying by state media. “I cannot imagine that Putin did it, that Putin is to blame. It’s too rough and unprofessional work.” Britain’s Ministry of Defence said the presumed death of Prigozhin could destabilise his Wagner Group of private military contractors. His “exceptional audacity” and “extreme brutality” permeated the organisation “and are unlikely to be matched by any successor”, it said in a statement. The private jet crashed soon after taking off from Moscow for St Petersburg, carrying Prigozhin, six other Wagner members and a crew of three, according to the Federal Air Transport Agency. US President Joe Biden, speaking to reporters on Wednesday, said he believed Putin was likely behind the crash. “I don’t know for a fact what happened, but I’m not surprised. There’s not much that happens in Russia that Putin’s not behind.” Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov took offence at that remark. “It is not for the US president, in my opinion, to talk about certain tragic events of this nature,” he said on Friday.    The passenger manifest also included Prigozhin’s second-in-command as well as Wagner’s logistics chief and at least one possible bodyguard. It was not clear why several high-ranking members of Wagner, who were normally exceedingly careful about their security, would have been on the same flight. The purpose of their trip to St Petersburg was unknown. In his first public comments on the crash, Putin said the passengers had “made a significant contribution” to the fighting in Ukraine. “We remember this. We know, and we will not forget,” he said in a televised interview with the Russian-installed leader of Ukraine’s partially occupied Donetsk region, Denis Pushilin. Putin said he had known Prigozhin since the early 1990s and described him as “a man of difficult fate” who had “made serious mistakes in life”. “And he achieved the results he needed – both for himself and, when I asked him about it, for the common cause as in these last months. He was a talented man, a talented businessman,” Putin said. Prigozhin was outspoken and critical of how Russian generals were waging the war in Ukraine, where his mercenaries were some of the fiercest fighters. For a long time, Putin appeared content to allow such infighting, but Prigozhin’s brief revolt raised the ante. Numerous opponents and critics of Putin have been killed or fallen gravely ill in apparent assassination attempts, and US and other Western officials long expected the Russian leader to go after Prigozhin despite promising to drop charges in a deal that ended the June mutiny. Ekaterina Kotrikadze, a news director and anchor at Russia’s independent Rain TV, said she believes Putin made the statement about the Wagner boss to show stability to the public but also to send a message. “The whole operation in killing Yevgeny Prigozhin is such an open statement that Putin decided to kill a problem to him. Putin could not pardon him. It was a traitorous action. That’s why he showed to everyone, ‘You should not be against me,’” Kotrikadze told Al Jazeera. Lukashenko, meanwhile, said Wagner fighters would remain based in Belarus. “Wagner lived, Wagner is living and Wagner will live in Belarus,” Lukashenko said. “The core remains here. As long as we need this unit, they will live and work with us.” ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/25/absolute-lie-kremlin-denies-role-in-yevgeny-prigozhin-plane-crash
Putin will not attend G20 summit in India next month,"The Russian president faces arrest if he travels abroad on a warrant accusing him of war crimes in Ukraine, issued by the International Criminal Court.","Russian President Vladimir Putin will not attend the G20 summit in India next month, the Kremlin has announced. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that travel is currently not on Putin’s agenda because he is concentrating on the special military operation, which is what the Kremlin calls Russia’s war against Ukraine. But another issue is keeping him at home. The International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Putin accusing him of war crimes in Ukraine, something the Kremlin strongly denies. This means he risks arrest when travelling abroad. Peskov did not mention the warrant in his comments. Putin did not fly to Indonesia for the summit of the group’s summit last year. He also skipped attending theBRICS summitin South Africa this week and instead took part via video link.    At the summit of the world’s 20 largest economies, ​​to take place on September 9 and 10, India hopes to persuade members to find amicable solutions to geopolitical issues, its G20 summit negotiator Amitabh Kant said on Friday, responding to a query on the Russia-Ukraine war. Kant said the G20 wants growth but war has created “a huge implication in terms of economics” by bringing challenges regarding food, fuel and fertiliser. “The war is not our creation,” Kant said. “Our challenge is to put developmental issues right in the forefront.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/25/putin-will-not-attend-g20-summit-in-india-next-month
"Dutch brewer Heineken completes its withdrawal from Russia, takes $325m hit","The world’s second largest brewer sold its business in Russia for just 1 euro ($1.08), months after announcing its exit.","Dutch brewer Heineken has completed its withdrawal from Russia, 18 months after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, selling its business in Russia for just 1 euro ($1.08). Heineken said on Friday it would incur a total loss of 300 million euros ($325m) for the sale to Russian manufacturing giant, the Arnest Group. Heineken had faced criticism for the slow pace of its exit in the wake of the outbreak of war, but insisted it was seeking to look after its local employees in Russia. In March last year, Heineken had said it was quitting Russia as its business there was “no longer sustainable nor viable in the current environment”, but added that it wanted to ensure an “orderly transfer” to a new owner. “While it took much longer than we had hoped, this transaction secures the livelihoods of our employees and allows us to exit the country in a responsible manner,” Heineken CEO Dolf van den Brink said in a statement.    The sale covers all of Heineken’s assets in Russia, including seven breweries. The company said that Arnest has guaranteed the employment of Heineken’s 1,800 local staff for three years. Heineken brand beer was removed from the Russian market last year. One of its other key brands, Amstel, will be phased out within six months, the company said. Last month, Heineken lowered its global earnings outlook for the full year after price hikes to counter soaring costs battered beer sales, pushing down profits in the first half. The world’s second largest brewer had warned that price increases were needed to offset high commodity and energy costs, due in large part to Russia’s war against Ukraine. The result was an 8.6 percent slump in net profit to 1.16 billion euros ($1.28bn), as beer volumes fell 5.6 percent from the same period last year. For the full year, it now expects a “stable to a mid single-digit” operating profit growth on a like for like basis, after an 8.8 percent drop in the first half to 1.9 billion euros ($2.09bn). Previously, management had forecast “mid to high single-digit” growth.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/25/dutch-brewer-heineken-completes-its-withdrawal-from-russia-takes-325m-hit
Russia says destroyed 42 Ukraine-launched drones over Crimea,"Kyiv has promised to retake the peninsula, which was annexed by Moscow in 2014.","Russia’s defence ministry has said its air defence forces destroyed a large-scale Ukrainian-launched drone attack on the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Crimea has been targeted by Kyiv since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, but has come under more intense, increased attacks in recent weeks. The Russian Ministry of Defence said early on Friday its forces shot down nine drones, while 33 others “were suppressed by electronic warfare and crashed without reaching the target”. It did not elaborate on whether there had been any damage or casualties. It added that it had also shot down a Ukraine-launched missile over the Kaluga region, which borders the Moscow region. Mikhail Razvozhayev, the Moscow-installed governor of the Crimean port city of Sevastopol, said on the Telegram messaging app that several drones were destroyed over the Khersones promontory. The cape is located on the outskirts of Sevastopol, which is home to Russia’s Black Sea fleet. It was not clear whether those drones were among the 42 reported by the defence ministry. “All forces and services are in a state of combat readiness,” Razvozhayev said. Kyiv has repeatedly said it plans to take back Crimea, and the drone assault comes two days after President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told a Kyiv conference on Crimea that the peninsula would be “de-occupied like all other parts of Ukraine that are unfortunately still under the occupier”. On Thursday, Ukraine said its forces had landed on the peninsula and raised the country’s flag during a “special operation” to mark its second wartime Independence Day. The special forces troops landed on Crimea’s western shore near the towns of Olenivka and Mayak, where they had “engaged in combat”, Ukraine’s GUR intelligence agency said. Moscow has also accused Ukraine of attacking the Russian-built bridge that connects the peninsula to Russia and is a key supply route for the Russian military. The bridge, the only crossing over the Kerch Strait, has been closed due to multiple incidents, including anexplosion in July. Russia has shown no sign of abandoning Crimea, which it has been using as a platform to launch missiles on Ukrainian targets. Moscow took control of Crimeaafter a referendum held after Russian forces seized the peninsula nine years ago that it claimed showed the people of Crimea, who mainly speak Russian, wanted to be part of Russia.

US will train Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16s from next month,Fighters will boost Ukrainian air defences as soldiers face tough battles against Russians on eastern front lines.,"The United States has said it will start training Ukrainian pilots on F-16 fighters from next month, joining other allies working to strengthen Ukraine’s air defences some 18 months since Russia’s invasion. The pilots will be brought to the US in September where they will first learn English before starting their training on how to fly the advanced fighter. Speaking in Washington, DC, on Thursday, Pentagon spokesman Pat Ryder said the training in Texas and Arizona would involve “several” pilots and “dozens” of personnel to maintain the aircraft. US President Joe Biden and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy discussed the training programme in a call on Thursday, the White House said. “President Biden reiterated the US commitment to support Ukraine’s defence against Russian aggression for as long as it takes, and to hold Russia accountable for its actions,” it said in a statement. The US announcement expands plans by European allies Denmark and the Netherlands todonate F-16 fightersto Ukraine and train its pilots. Norway has also said it will provide the planes to Ukraine with Greece joining the countries offering training. Speaking in an interview with Jordan’s Al-Mamlaka public service TV news channel, meanwhile, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley said Ukraine was likely to receive the planes “in the not-too-distant future”, saying they would strengthen Ukraine’s air defences andbolster its counteroffensiveagainst Russian forces in the country’s east. Milley noted Ukrainian troops were faced with Russian reinforcements that had many months to prepare minefields, tank ditches and dragon’s teeth tank obstacles “in a very complex set of defensive preparations that the Ukrainians are fighting through … “The Ukrainians have a significant amount of combat power remaining; this is not over yet,” he said. “Clearly it’s had partial success to date,” Milley added in the interview in Amman, adding that the speed was slower than the planners had thought. Ukrainian forces were being trained intensively in various parts of Europe on “command and control of offensive formations and combined arms manoeuvre and to break complex obstacles that will bolster its capabilities,” the four-star US Army general said. “Again, it’s bloody, it’s long and it’s slow. And we had predicted that several months ago,” he said. It is likely to be some months before Ukraine will be able to feel the benefit of the new fighter jets. Ryder said training on the F-16s was likely to last between five and eight months, depending on the pilots’ existing skills. Language training at the beginning was crucial, “given the complexities and the specialised English that’s required to fly these aircraft,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/25/us-will-train-ukrainian-pilots-to-fly-f-16s-from-next-month

What did President Putin say about the Russia plane crash,Here is a translation of Putin’s comments after he broke his silence over the crash.,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has broken his silence about the plane crash that took place outside Moscow on Wednesday, almost 24 hours after the incident. He sent his condolences to the families of those who died in the crash without confirming by name if Wagner group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin, who was listed as a passenger on the plane, had died. Here is a translation by Reuters news agency of what Putin said: “As for the aviation tragedy, first of all I want to express my most sincere condolences to the families of all the victims. “It is always a tragedy. Indeed, if employees of the Wagner company were there, and the preliminary data indicate they were, I would like to note that these people made a significant contribution to our common cause of combating the neo-Nazi regime in Ukraine, we remember this, we know it and we shall not forget. “I had known Prigozhin for a very long time, since the start of the ’90s. He was a man with a difficult fate, and he made serious mistakes in life. And he strove for the results he needed for himself, and when I asked him about it, for the common cause, as in these last months. He was a talented person, a talented businessman, he worked not only in our country, and worked with results, but also abroad, in Africa, in particular. He was involved there with oil, gas, precious metals and stones. “As far as I know, he just returned yesterday from Africa. He met some officials here. But what is quite definite – the head of the Investigative Committee reported to me this morning – is they have already begun a preliminary investigation into this event. And it will be carried out in full, and taken right to the end. There are no doubts about this. “Let’s see what the investigators say in the near future. And now, expert examinations, technical examinations and genetic ones are being carried out.

Ukraine says troops landed on Crimea in ‘special operation’,"Ukraine has repeatedly said it aims to take back Crimea, which has been under Russian control since 2014.","Ukraine’s navy and military intelligence carried out a “special operation” overnight with units landing in Crimea, officials have said. A short and brief video posted on Thursday, along with a statement by the Defence Ministry intelligence service (HUR), showed a small motorboat moving through the water at night near a coastline. The alleged landing came at a poignant moment, with Ukraine celebrating its independence from the Soviet Union on Thursday, August 24. The intelligence service said the landing point was on the western tip of the Crimean Peninsula. “Special units on watercraft landed on the shore in the area of the Olenivka and Mayak settlements,” HUR said. It added that “all goals” had been achieved and that casualties had been inflicted, but did not specify the aims of the operation. “The enemy suffered losses among personnel, [and] enemy equipment was destroyed,” HUR said, noting that the “state flag flew again in the Ukrainian Crimea”. If confirmed, the operation would mark a rare demonstration that Ukrainian forces can stage acts on the ground in Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. The reports come a day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowed to end Russia’s occupation of Crimea. During a speech at an international conference on Crimea in Kyiv, Zelenskyy said Crimea will be “de-occupied like all other parts of Ukraine that are unfortunately still under the occupier”. Last month, Moscow accused Ukraine of attacking the Russian-built Crimean bridge, which has been closed due to multiple incidents, including an explosion in July 2023. Zelenskyy said that once Crimea was back under Ukrainian control, it would be part of Ukraine’s economy and, therefore, the global economy. “Today we are taking the first such economic step. We are signing the first document with companies that are ready to enter Crimea following Ukraine,” he said. On Wednesday, Ukraine’s military also reported deliberately luring a Russian military pilot to land his Mi-8 helicopter at a Ukrainian airfield. Ukraine has launched multiple attacks on the Russian-annexed peninsula since the start of Moscow’s invasion in February 2022, and refers to the area as “temporarily occupied”. But Russia has shown no sign of abandoning Crimea, which it has used as a platform to launch missile strikes on Ukrainian targets. Moscow says a referendum held after Russian forces seized the peninsula showed Crimeans want to be part of Russia, a claim vehemently denied by Ukraine and much of the international community.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/24/ukraine-launches-special-operation-in-crimea
Moscow court extends pre-trial detention of WSJ reporter Evan Gershkovich,"Wall Street Journal newspaper condemns three-month extension, renews call for US journalist’s immediate release.","A court in Moscow has extended the pre-trial detention of Wall Street Journal reporterEvan Gershkovich, Russian news agencies reported, drawing condemnation from the US newspaper and renewed calls for Gershkovich’s release. The court in Russia’s capital on Thursday extended the 31-year-old American journalist’s detention to November 30 from August 30, the TASS state news agency said. Gershkovich, who was arrested in March on espionage charges that he has denied, was present at the hearing. He arrived in a white prison van and was led out in handcuffs, wearing jeans, sneakers and a shirt. “We are deeply disappointed he continues to be arbitrarily and wrongfully detained for doing his job as a journalist,” the Wall Street Journal said in a statement after the court’s decision. “The baseless accusations against him are categorically false, and we continue to push for his immediate release. Journalism is not a crime.”    Russian authorities arrested Gershkovich in late March in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg, accusing him of trying to obtain classified information about a Russian arms factory. His detention has unfolded amid heightened tensions between the United States and Russia over the Russian war in Ukraine and advocates have said his arrest is part of Moscow’s broader crackdown on media outlets as it pushes forward with the invasion of its neighbour. But the Russian authorities said Gershkovich was “caught red-handed and violated the laws of the Russian Federation”. The country’s Federal Security Service said the US reporter, “acting on the instructions of the American side, collected information constituting a state secret about the activities of one of the enterprises of the Russian military-industrial complex”. Gershkovich’s legal team andhis supportershave dismissed the charges as baseless. In April, the US Department of State formally designated Gershkovich as “wrongfully detained” and called on Russia to release him immediately. But on June 22, a Russian judge rejected an application for Gershkovich to be released from prison while awaiting trial. After that decision, the US ambassador to Russia, Lynne Tracy, accused Moscow of conducting “hostage diplomacy”. Tracy has metGershkovich three timessince his detention began. Following her last visit earlier this month, the ambassador said he appeared to be “in good health”. “Once again, the United States calls on the Russian Federation to immediately release Evan Gershkovich,” Tracy said through a spokesperson at that time. She also called for the release of formerUS Marine Paul Whelan, who is also detained in Russia on espionage charges that he has also denied. In Gershkovich’s case, Russia has said that any prisoner exchange could only be considered after a court verdict, and via a special channel handled by the security services. The country has agreed to high-profile swaps in the past, most recently in December 2022 whenit traded Brittney Griner, a US basketball star convicted of a drug offence in Russia, for Russian arms trafficker Viktor Bout.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/24/moscow-court-extends-pre-trial-detention-of-wsj-reporter-evan-gershkovich
Crashed Russian Embraer jet had good safety record: Company,"The private jet crashed into a village on Wednesday, reportedly holding the Wagner Group founder, Yevgeny Prigozhin.","The Embraer executive jet model that crashed in Russia, possibly with Wagner mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin on board, has recorded only one accident in more than 20 years of service, and that was not related to mechanical failure. Russian authorities said Prigozhin was listed as a passenger on a private jet that crashed on Wednesday evening, killing all those on board. Russia’s TASS news agency said the plane was a Brazilian Embraer jet. Embraer said it was aware of a plane crash in Russia involving a Legacy 600 aircraft, but it did not have further information about the case and had not been providing support services for the jet since 2019. “Embraer has complied with international sanctions imposed on Russia,” the company said. Sanctions block Western plane makers from providing parts or support for planes operated in Russia. Flightradar24 online tracker showed that the aircraft (number RA-02795) dropped off the radar at 6:11 pm local time (15:11 GMT). An unverified video on social media showed a plane resembling a private jet falling out of the sky towards the Earth. The aircraft, manufactured in 2007, fell under US Treasury sanctions in 2019 when it was listed under a prior registration, M-SAAN, according to a US government press release. It said, by October 2018, Prigozhin’s employees had arranged for the purchase of the private jet M-SAAN, which was registered under the owner Autolex Transport, a company cited in the release for materially assisting Prigozhin. The United States Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) took action against Prigozhin for attempting to influence the 2018 US elections, the September 30, 2019 release said. The identification codes of the aircraft, mentioned in OFAC’s Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) List, match those of the crashed plane with the tail number RA-02795, as listed in the Russian aircraft registry.    The same plane was spotted flying to Belarus from Russia after the failed mutiny in late June, presumably carrying Prigozhin to Minsk. The Legacy 600 entered service in 2002, according to International Aviation HQ, with almost 300 produced until production ceased in 2020. There is only one recorded accident involving a Legacy 600, according to International Aviation HQ, which occurred in 2006 when it crashed midair into a Gol Boeing 737-800 on its way from the Embraer factory in Brazil to the US. The Boeing commercial airliner was downed and all 154 passengers died. The pilot of the Embraer plane landed without any deaths or injuries on that aircraft. Two years later, a Brazilian air force report blamed two US pilots, traffic controllers and faulty communications for the midair collision. At the time, a lawyer for the pilots said individual air traffic controllers and flaws in Brazil’s air traffic control system caused the accident.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/24/crashed-russian-embraer-jet-had-good-safety-record-company
Will Russia’s Putin benefit from Prigozhin’s presumed plane crash death?,"The Wagner Group leader was listed as a passenger of a plane that crashed on Wednesday, but his death remains unconfirmed by the Kremlin.","Kyiv, Ukraine– Yevgeny Prigozhin, the foul-mouthed chief of the Wagner private army who masterminded an aborted mutiny against the Kremlin, has not been officially pronounced dead. Russian authorities have yet to confirm via a DNA test that the 62-year-old’s body was among the charred and mangled remnants of 10 people found in the debris of the private jet that crashed 350km (217 miles) northwest of Moscow late on Wednesday. Prigozhin was, however, listed as one of the plane’s passengers – along with the company’s founder and neo-Nazi sympathiser Dmitry Utkin nicknamed Wagner.  Few doubt Prigozhin’s presumed death, that took place exactly two months after the June 23 “justice march”, as he called it, of thousands of Wagner’s best fighters towards Moscow. The rebellion sowed panic in the Kremlin and reportedly forced Russian President Vladimir Putin to flee Moscow. The uprising was triggered by a months-old conflict with Russia’s Ministry of Defence that delayed or sabotaged ammunition supplies to Wagner on the front lines of southeastern Ukraine. The march stopped only 200km (124 miles) south of Moscow after Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko promised Prigozhin and all of Wagner a safe haven in his forested ex-Soviet nation bordering Ukraine. A top expert on Wagner is all but certain that Prigozhin is dead. “I’ve heard from a source in Wagner close to him that it’s likely true,” John Lechner, an investigative reporter in the United States who is writing a book about Prigozhin summarising years of research, told Al Jazeera shortly after Russian media reported the plane crash. Al Jazeera was unable to independently verify the claim. But those who doubt the demise cite Prigozhin’s penchant for disguises – and his chance to escape to the Central African Republic, Mali or other African nations where Wagner provides “security services” to local strongmen in exchange for a stake in mining and trading local natural resources. Russian police discovered a stash of fake passports with Prigozhin’s mugshots and names of other people a day after the failed coup, and framed photos of him wearing wigs, glasses and beards were found in his St Petersburg mansion and immediately ridiculed in online memes. “It’s nice and easy to fake one’s own death,” Ukrainian defence expert Maria Kucherenko, who authored a detailed report on Wagner, wrote on Facebook late Thursday. But there are no chances of really faking Prigozhin’s death in Russia, given the scrutiny of officials and forensics experts investigating the crash, said another analyst. “There could have been rumours [of fake death] had he done it in Africa, but not in Russia, where a DNA test will be quickly performed,” Nikolay Mitrokhin of Germany’s University of Bremen told Al Jazeera.  The DNA tests will be scrupulously monitored by the Kremlin given that it is the main benefactor of Prigozhin’s death, Mitrokhin said. “Judging by the sources, the plane was shot down. That’s what easy to believe. It is very beneficial for Russian authorities who can always shift the blame to an [air defence] lieutenant or major who made the mistake,” he said. According to a cellphone video purportedly showing Prigozhin’sLegacy Embraer jetmidair, it was falling, not gliding down, and apparently had only one engine running. A plume of smoke that did not resemble exhaust was seen behind the plane, and its tail and one of the wings fell far apart from the fuselage, which may indicate that the crash was caused by an explosion, according to the photos and videos from the crash site. In another amateur video showing the falling plane, witnessessay they had heard“two explosions”. Air defence forces routinely shoot at a plane twice to ensure it is hit. A source in Russia’s main aviation oversight body told the Tsargrad television channel that the plane was “blown up”. However, Flightradar 24, a Swedish aircraft tracker, said that the Brazilian-made jet went up to 8,500 metres (28,000 feet). Very few air defence weapons can hit a plane that high – and the Kremlin allegedly used two S-300 missiles, the VChK-OGPU Telegram channel with links to Russian law enforcement agencies claimed. Putin, a former KGB colonel who headed the FSB, the main KGB successor, in the late 1990s, is notoriously vindictive. Kremlin critics cite the case of Alexander Litvinenko, an FSB expert on organised crime who accused Putin of profiting from drug trafficking and money laundering. Litvinenko defected to the United Kingdom and died an agonising death in 2006 after drinking tea laced with radioactive polonium-210, an extremely rare and expensive poison. Putin called Litvinenko a “traitor”, and London said the Russian president “probably” sanctioned the assassination. “Traitors” was the epithet Putin used in his televised address on the day of Prigozhin’s mutiny. And even though the riot was called off and Wagner marched back to Russia-occupied areas in southeastern Ukraine, Putin’s reputation suffered greatly. High treason charges against Wagner chief and officers who shot down several Russian aircraft during their march were dropped a day later. Unlike other Putin allies who prefer to keep a low profile, Prigozhin was a motormouth. For months before the mutiny, he lambasted Russia’s top brass. And after it, thousands of key Wagner fighters relocated to hastily built camps in Belarusian forests. Some were spotted near the Suwalki Gap near the Polish-Lithuanian border that separates Belarus from Kaliningrad, Russia’s Baltic exclave. Prigozhin visited Russia several times and even met with Putin, while Wagner’s recruitment centres continued to operate. So, Putin may have followed the example of cinematic mafia boss Michael Corleone by serving his revenge cold, a Russian opposition activist said. “Prigozhin was relocated from the country. Within two months, they redistributed his assets, checked all contact chains, and replaced everything in the system that needed replacement. And now just got rid of [Prigozhin and his top lieutenants],” Sergey Bizyukin told Al Jazeera. “I don’t know whether [Prigozhin] had a chance to sit it all out in Belarus, but that was his only teeny-weeny chance” to survive, Bizyukin said. But since Wagner proved to be so effective, it may continue to exist and operate in Ukraine and elsewhere – even if it’s not just “bled dry, but decapitated”, according to independent military analyst David Gendelman. The plane crash reportedly wiped out Wagner’s top brass. One of the killed passengers was Valery Chkalov, a key Prigozhin ally in charge of Wagner’s logistics in Ukraine, Syria and Africa. Others were key lieutenants Yevgeny Makaryan and Sergey Propustin. But the company’s resources, including battle-tested fighters and smoothly functioning operations in Africa, are too valuable for the Kremlin to let Wagner disband, Gendelman said. “So, they will most likely keep operating under new control affiliated somehow with Russia’s leadership. And, perhaps, such control has already been organised as part of preparation to behead the organisation,” he told Al Jazeera. But Wagner’s – and Moscow’s – clout in Africa may eclipse because of the rising influence of China and other core members of the now-expanding BRICS bloc. “Russia’s sway in Africa will weaken irrespective of personalities at the helm” of Wagner, Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kushch told Al Jazeera.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/24/will-russias-putin-benefit-from-prigozhins-presumed-plane-crash-death
Russian villagers report explosion before ‘Prigozhin’ plane crash,"The Wagner boss was listed as a passenger on the private jet, but the Kremlin has not confirmed his death.","The residents of a nearby village where a plane crashed and killed all on board, possibly including theWagner mercenary chief, say they heard a bang before seeing the jet fall to the ground. On Wednesday, a private jet crashed near the village of Kuzhenkino in Russia’s Tver region on its way from Moscow to St Petersburg, killing all 10 passengers on board, including three crew members.  Kuzhenkino resident Vitaly Stepenok, 72, told the Reuters news agency: “I hear an explosion or a bang. Usually, if an explosion happens on the ground then you get an echo, but it was just a bang and I looked up and saw white smoke.” “One wing flew off in one direction and the fuselage went like that,” he said, gesturing with his arms to show how the plane headed down towards the ground. “And then it glided down on one wing. It didn’t nose-dive, it was gliding.” Another villager named Anatoly said, “In terms of what might have happened, I’ll just say this: it wasn’t thunder, it was a metallic bang – let’s put it that way. I’ve heard things like that before.”    The plane crash came two months after the mercenary group’saborted mutinyagainst the Russian military top generals, in which he publicly accused them of incompetence in the war in Ukraine. According to a passenger list, the people on board were members of the group, including founder Yevgeny Prigozhin and his second-in-command, Dmitry Utkin. While there has been no official comment from the Kremlin about the crash and the possible death of the mercenary leader, a Telegram channel linked to the Wagner Group pronounced Prigozhin dead. Forensic investigators erected a tent and lighting gear at the wreckage site as part of the plane’s blue and white tail and other fragments lay on the ground. Reporting from the crash scene, Al Jazeera’s Amine Derghami said: “We can confirm that two vehicles arrived at the crash site to transport the dead. Parts of the plane were found 2km away … but the search has been difficult.” “The Russian authorities have confirmed Prigozhin was on board the flight. The Russian aviation federation released the passenger list earlier, seven Wagner members with three aircrew. “Until now, the investigation team has not confirmed that Prigozhin’s body has been found or that he was killed in the crash.” Russian investigators said they had opened a criminal investigation into the plane crash. But some unnamed sources, cited by Reuters, told Russian media they believed one or more surface-to-air missiles had shot the plane down.

Ukrainians express fear and hope as Russia’s war rages on Independence Day,"Ukraine declared independence from the Soviet Union on August 24, 1991.","Kyiv, Ukraine –Thirty-two years have passed since Ukraine gained independence from the Soviet Union. With the country now at war with Russia, Al Jazeera spoke to several Ukrainians about what the anniversary on Thursday means to them: Yevhen Averkin, 35, a serviceman since 2014: I was very small on the first Independence Day. I was three. The Independence Day I remember the most is in 2009. I took part in a parade on the Independence Day during my military service. What’s utterly important is that our next generation grows up in peace without knowing what war is, so that they have real freedom of speech, so that our nation flourishes without corruption, without oligarchs. And we need to work on our victory. The most bitter thing for me is losing my brothers in arms. Since 2014, when the war began, I fought in the Donbas region. Then we were stationed in Henichesk [in the Kherson region near Russian-annexed Crimea]. Since last year, we were advancing in Kherson, liberated it. Then we fought in [the eastern towns of ] Bakhmut, Soledar, Kurdiumivka, Bakhmut again, Vasuikivka, and now we are in the Zaporizhia direction, moving towards [the Russian-occupied town of] Tokmak. The day before yesterday, we liberated [the village] of Rabotino. No one knows for real when we’ll have won. Soldiers don’t win wars. Politicians do. Only they know when they meet and agree and we will finally see peace. But there’s one thing I can say – we will stand until the end to liberate Ukraine within its 1991 borders. Larysa Averkina, 29, Averkin’s wife: The most bitter thing is when my child is growing up without a father, when he watches the news and says, “My dad is a hero. My father defends Ukraine.” Independence is when a person is free, when one has their values, can convey their words, express themselves without fear. When things are peaceful. When you are not afraid to go out without being afraid of what’s awaiting you outdoors, whether there is shelling today or not, whether you are alive today or not. We want to live the way we did before the war – in freedom, in peace.” Svetlana Chunikhina, vice president of the Association of Political Psychologists: I remember the [failed August 18-21, 1991, Communist] putsch in Moscow very well – to be more precise, the depressing impression it made on my parents. In my youth, I perceived politics in Ukraine as “moonlight”, as a reflection of what was happening [in Moscow], in the former metropolis. But as I began to deal with the psychology of politics professionally, the real picture of what happened on August 24, 1991, began to gradually open up to me. Ukraine’s independence was not written in the scenarios of the global historical process at the time. Its value was not  100 percent obvious either for Ukrainians or for its neighbours. No one and nothing guaranteed the independence. It was a desperate jump over the abyss to the freedom we dreamed about. I share the view of [American historian] Timothy Snyder. He speaks of Ukrainian statehood as history being made right now, live, at the cost of our lives. And now the situation is such that Ukraine’s freedom is a prologue to the freedom of the [European] continent and the world as a whole from the new dark ages of tyranny. Antonina, 80, lived in Russia until 1994: When [the 1991 Communist putsch] failed, everyone sighed with relief because all of that was incomprehensible and frightening. Then survival began. At the time, [politicians] were saying, “We’ll be on our own. We will live well.” I didn’t believe in it at the time. In 2014 [after the pro-Western Maidan revolution], I felt I was Ukrainian. Before that, I had been feeling like a Russian living in Ukraine – that it’s my country, that I hurt for it, that it’s mine, that I have to stand for it. On the first day of the war [on February 24, 2002], I sent a text [to my nieces in Russia], so that they learned about it from me, not from television, not from the [official] lies. I told them, “It’s such a pity that you don’t come out to rally in protest,” and one of them said, “Unfortunately, we can’t. It’s forbidden.” And the second niece who’s a bit older said she didn’t get any messages [about the war]. These days, they don’t believe me. Svetlana Ivanova, 65: Ukraine’s independence was the dream we always had – to be independent, to be strong, not to rely on anyone, to do the best you can for yourselves, for others. I don’t remember the very first day of independence, but I remember the feeling of that time. A child is born, and everything about it is in the future. It may grow into a strong, beautiful person, and everything depends on us, on how we raise this child. [I remember] the feeling of future happiness. I was on the Maidan [Kyiv’s Independence Square during the anti-Russian revolt of 2013-2014]. I was building barricades, and when [pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych’s troops] used water cannons against us, [other protesters] asked me, “Lady, step aside please.” I cooked for them, and during the shooting on February 19, [2014, which killed 25 people,] I rushed to help the wounded. I am not a doctor, but I helped. In those days, I saw how old ladies would bring something. Everyone brought anything they could. I was proud of being Ukrainian and that this is my motherland, my nation. [When the war began,] I had no fear – when [my neighbours] were looking for spies, when somebody called the police saying, “There’s someone suspicious sitting outside.” I live on Lesya Ukraininka Boulevard [in downtown Kyiv]. There was commotion around us, but there was no fear. I had a feeling that we’re succeeding, that we’re moving forward. But now, I have a feeling that we’re losing ground. We need the support of other nations, but at the time when we have to focus everything on the victory, there are these delays. I feel that people don’t understand that our destinies are being determined – that, I beg your pardon, our behinds are on fire, that nothing has been set in stone and that our boys get killed [on the front lines] to protect us. When the war began, we pitched in. We lived like a big commune. And now, there’s a feeling that everything is over, that they won the war. There’s no victory yet. The most difficult part is ahead of us. We’re at a crossroads. There’s no return to the past. Nadia Gordiyuk, a community activist from the town ofNew Yorkin the Donetsk region who was a volunteer at the 1991 referendum on Ukraine’s independence: I am 60 years old. I must be a typical product of Homo Sovieticus because I lived my entire life in the Donetsk region at the very centre of the Donbas, which was Russified at the time. I went to a Russian-language school in the town of New York. In 1951, Soviet authorities prudently and secretly removed the name, replacing it with the neutral and faceless Novgorodskoye. And from the school’s windows one could see the buildings of [the town of] Horlivka, which is now occupied by Russians. But the outlook formed by my secondary school changed dramatically when I  entered the Sloviansk Pedagogical Institute in 1980 in the very town of  Sloviansk, from where the Russian aggression in eastern Ukraine began [in April 2014 when Russian “volunteers” seized it]. Even then, during [Soviet leader Leonid] Brezhnev’s “prosperous times”, there where teachers of Ukrainian language and literature and even Communist history who taught their students to look at Ukrainian history not in accordance with the Communist Party textbooks and half-whispered the real history of Ukraine to us. That is why on January 21, 1990, when I was in Kyiv for professional training, I heard about the “Live Chain” rally organized by the [pro-independence] People’s Movement of Ukraine. I didn’t hesitate to join the rally, which became one of the most important steps towards the restoration of Ukraine’s statehood. [Hundreds of thousands of] people joined hands to demonstrate the unity of Ukraine on the way to independence. That’s why back in my New York, I actively participated in the organisation of the December 1, 1991, survey and referendum when many compatriots supported the Declaration of Independence with their signatures. We collected signatures independently, without asking for the consent and help of local authorities. It wasn’t politicians who decided to declare Ukraine’s independence. It was the people [who voted] at the all-Ukrainian referendum. There was only one question on that piece of paper: “Do you confirm the act of proclamation of the independence of Ukraine?” More than 90 percent of Ukrainians from various regions responded positively. I’m proud that my compatriots [from New York] were among them. For my family, Ukraine’s Independence Day is full of personal symbolism. It was on this day in 2005 when my father, who hoped for the revival and prosperity of Ukraine his entire life, passed away. For many days, he was between heaven and earth, but he passed away on this particular day. He waited [to die] on his favourite holiday, the one he’d been anticipating his entire life. For me, it’s a symbol that despite all the hardship and trouble, Ukraine would live to see its victory and prosperity.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/24/ukrainians-express-fear-and-hope-as-russias-war-rages-on-independence-day

Wagner’s boss Yevgeny Prigozhin on crashed plane: What to know,Russian mercenary chief Prigozhin was listed as a passenger on a private jet that crashed on Wednesday evening north of Moscow with no survivors.,"Russian authorities have confirmed that Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Wagner Group that led a mutiny against Russia’s army in June, was on board a plane that crashed outside Moscow. Russia’s emergency situations ministry said all 10 people on board were killed. Here is what we know so far: According to authorities, 10 people have died after a private jet crashed north of Moscow, Around 17:00 GMT, the ministry announced that a “private Embraer Legacy 600 aircraft traveling from Moscow to Saint Petersburg crashed”. It said that 10 people were on board, including three crew members. According to authorities, eight bodies have been found. Russia’s Federal Agency for Air Transport also said it launched a “specially created commission” to investigate the crash. A Telegram channel believed to be linked to Prigozhin also said that the Wagner leader was dead. The FlightRadar24 online tracker showed that the Embraer Legacy (plane number RA-02795) had dropped off the radar at 6:11pm (15:11 GMT). Soon after the plane dropped out of the sky, a second private jet linked to Prigozhin, which also appeared to be heading to St Petersburg, turned back to Moscow and later landed, flight tracking data showed. Russia’s emergency situations ministry said that the plane crashed near the village of Kuzhenkino in the Tver region.  Prigozhin, 62, soared in prominence after Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, where his fighters – including thousands of convicts he recruited from prison – led the Russian assault on the city of Bakhmut in the longest and bloodiest battle of the war. Prigozhin used social media to trumpet Wagner’s successes and wage a feud with Russia’s military establishment, accusing it of incompetence and even treason. In June,Prigozhin led a mutinyin which Wagner fighters took control of the southern city of Rostov-on-Don and shot down a number of military helicopters, killing their pilots, as they advanced towards Moscow. President Vladimir Putin called it an act of treason that would meet with a harsh response. The revolt was defused in a deal whereby the Kremlin said that in order to avert bloodshed, Prigozhin and some of his fighters would leave for Belarus and a criminal case against him for armed mutiny would be dropped. Confusion has surrounded the implementation of the deal and the future of Prigozhin. Born in St Petersburg on June 1, 1961, Prigozhin spent nine years in Soviet prisons for crimes including robbery and fraud. Released in 1990 amid the Soviet Union’s death throes, he launched a career as a caterer and restaurateur in his hometown. He is believed to have met Putin, then a top aide to St Petersburg’s mayor, at this time. Read more about him here.    Russian civil aviation authority said that Dmitry Utkin, Prigozhin’s right-hand man, was also on board and that Prigozhin and his associates had attended a meeting with officials from the Russian defence ministry. Mykhailo Podolyak, Ukrainian presidential adviser, on social media platform X reacted to the incident by saying “it was worth waiting for the fog of war to disappear”. “…It is obvious that Putin does not forgive anyone for his own bestial terror … The demonstrative elimination of Prigozhin and the Wagner command two months after the coup attempt is a signal from Putin to Russia’s elites ahead of the 2024 elections. ‘Beware! Disloyalty equals death’,” he added. About Prigozhin: It is worth waiting for the fog of war to disappear… Meanwhile, it is obvious that Putin does not forgive anyone for his own bestial terror.

Reports Russian Air Defence shot down the plane suggests Putin is sending a very loud message.” Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Raucommented on this on the state news channel TVP Info: “… We would have great trouble naming anyone who would intuitively think this was a coincidence.

Global reaction to possible death of Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin,"Russia’s ministry for emergency situations announces crash of a private plane travelling between Moscow and St Petersburg, saying Wagner chief Prigozhin was on the passenger list.","Russian mercenary chiefYevgeny Prigozhinwas listed as a passenger on a private jet that crashed north of Moscow, killing all 10 passengers, the Russian authorities said. It remains to be confirmed if the Wagner chief had actually boarded the flight. Since the rebellion byWagner forcesin June, Prigozhin has been seen as the biggest challenge to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s authority since he came to power. Here is how the world reacted to the crash and the reported death of Prigozhin: President Joe Biden says he was “not surprised” at news that Prigozhin may have died in a plane crash in Russia. “I don’t know for a fact what happened, but I’m not surprised,” Biden said, adding: “There’s not much that happens in Russia that Putin’s not behind. But I don’t know enough to know the answer.” In a statement, US National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson also said that “if confirmed, no one should be surprised”, by the apparent death. “The disastrous war in Ukraine led to a private army marching on Moscow, and now — it would seem — to this.” Paris said that there were “reasonable doubts” about the cause of the plane crash that presumably killed Prigozhin. “We don’t yet know the circumstances of this crash. We can have some reasonable doubts,” government spokesperson Olivier Veran told France 2 television. Asked about US President Joe Biden’s comments, Veran agreed that “as a general rule, that’s a truth that can be established”. Prigozhin was “the man who did Putin’s dirty work. What he has done is inseparable from the policies of Putin, who gave him responsibility to carry out abuses as the head of Wagner”, he said. “Prigozhin leaves behind him mass graves. He leaves behind him messes across a large part of the globe, I’m thinking of Africa, Ukraine and Russia itself.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told journalists with Interfax-Ukraine news agency that Ukraine was not behind the crash. “We had nothing to do with it. Everybody realises who has something to do with it”. Presidential aide Mykhaylo Podolyak wrote on social media that the crash of the plane was a signal from the Kremlin to anyone who showed disloyalty but that it was “worth waiting for the fog of war to disappear” before making concrete conclusions. “The demonstrative elimination of Prigozhin and the Wagner command two months after the coup attempt is a signal from Putin to Russia’s elites ahead of the 2024 elections. ‘Beware!

However, she later said the presumed death of Prigozhin follows a pattern of “unclarified” fatalities in Russia, adding that it was no coincidence that the focus has turned to the Kremlin for answers. “It is no accident that the world immediately looks at the Kremlin when a disgraced former confidant of Putin suddenly, literally falls from the sky two months after he attempted a mutiny,”  Baerbock said, referring to the Russian president. “We know this pattern in Putin’s Russia: deaths, dubious suicides, falls from windows, all which remain unclarified – that underlines a dictatorial power system that is built on violence,” she said at a news conference with the Kyrgyz foreign minister. Sweden’s Foreign Minister Tobias Billstrom stated that it remained “unclear” what the crash meant for Russia and the war in Ukraine. He added that Sweden and its international partners were following the incident closely.

Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin ‘on board’ jet that crashed in Russia,"Russia’s civil aviation authority publishes names of seven passengers, including Prigozhin and Wagner group commander Dmitry Utkin, who were on board.","Russian mercenary group chief Yevgeny Prigozhin was aboard the plane thatcrashed north of Moscow, killing everyone on board, according to Russia’s civil aviation agency. Russia’s federal air transport agency Rosaviatsia published the names of seven passengers — including Prigozhin and Wagner group commander Dmitry Utkin — and three crew members it said died in Wednesday’s crash. “There were 10 people on board, including three crew members. According to preliminary information, all those on board died,” Russia’s Ministry for Emergency Situations said shortly before. At about 17:00 GMT, the ministry announced that a “private Embraer Legacy aircraft travelling from Moscow to Saint Petersburg crashed near the village of Kuzhenkino in the Tver Region”, some 300 kilometres (185 miles) north of the capital. Officials have since said the ministry conducted search operations and recovered the remains of those aboard. Video has also emerged, allegedly showing the Embraer jet plummeting from the sky. Authorities are investigating what could have caused the crash, with theories ranging from technical problems to explosions onboard the jet. In the more than 20 years that the jet model has been in service, the news outlet Reuters said that only one previous crash has been recorded, attributed to mistakes by crew members.  Daniel Hawkins, a journalist in Moscow, told Al Jazeera that “reports in the Russian media, unconfirmed so far, are saying this aircraft could have been taken down by air defence systems”. “Prigozhin was among those on board or was at least listed as among those people on board. “Some journalists report they’re in touch with his press secretary who is refusing to confirm that. A second jet was also in the air that’s turned around and gone back to St Petersburg.”    The crash came two months to the day after Prigozhin led a short-lived armed rebellion against Russia’s military leadership on June 23. The incident was seen as the gravest challenge ever to President Vladimir Putin’s two-decade grip on power. The rebellion sparked after Prigozhin claimed the Russian military had launched missiles against Wagner mercenary fighters deployed on Russia’s behalf in Ukraine. Calling the Russian military leadership corrupt and incompetent, Prigozhin proceeded to lead his fighters across the border into Russia, where they occupied the city of Rostov-on-Don. He then sent military columns marching towards Moscow, in an apparent attempt to remove Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu from power. Prigozhin had complained for months of inadequate munitions and supplies for his fighters serving on the front lines of Putin’s war in Ukraine.  At the time, Putin described the revolt as “treason”. But shortly before his troops reached Moscow, Prigozhin ordered a retreat after negotiations with the Kremlin, in which Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko acted as mediator. As part of the deal reached to escape prosecution, Prigozhin and his Wagner fighters were offered sanctuary in Belarus. Rumours have swirled about possible retribution against Prigozhin since the rebellion, and on Wednesday, United States President Joe Biden expressed little shock upon hearing about his apparent demise. “I’m not surprised,” Biden told reporters. He clarified, however, that he did not know exactly what was behind the crash. “There is not much that happens in Russia that Putin is not behind, but I don’t know enough to know the answer.” US National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson echoed those sentiments in a statement. “If confirmed, no one should be surprised,” she said. “The disastrous war in Ukraine led to a private army marching on Moscow, and now — it would seem — to this.”    Experts are still being cautious about whether Prigozhin was on the plane that crashed. But some have said that regardless of the outcome, Prigozhin has been a marked man. “We don’t know all the details yet, but if it turns out that it is what it seems to be, it’s absolutely no coincidence,” said Colin Clarke of the Soufan Group, speaking to Al Jazeera from the United States city of Pittsburgh. “Ever since the mutiny in late June, in which he embarrassed [Russian President] Putin, he’s been a marked man. Many were surprised it [his killing] didn’t happen instantly, but this is something that everybody thought was inevitable.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/23/private-plane-crashes-in-russia-with-wagner-group-chief-on-board
Russia’s General Surovikin dismissed as head of aerospace forces: Reports,"Surovikin, former commander of Russian forces in Ukraine, has not been seen in public since the mutiny by Wagner mercenaries in June.","RussianGeneral Sergei Surovikin, who at one time was commander of Moscow’s war effort in Ukraine, has been dismissed as head of the country’s aerospace forces, a prominent journalist in Russia and media outlets have reported. Alexei Venediktov, the well-connected former editor-in-chief of the now-defunct Ekho Moskvy (Echo of Moscow) radio station, said on his Telegram channel on Tuesday that Surovikin had been removed, citing an official decree. Surovikin will remain in the defence ministry after his deposition, Venediktov said. The decree has not yet been made public but several nationalist Russian military blogs also reported on Surovikin’s replacement. Surovikin wascommander-in-chief of Russian unitsin Ukraine from October 2022 to January 2023. He was the commander who ordered the withdrawal of Russian troops from the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson in November 2022.    There was no official confirmation of Venediktov’s report, though the Russian-language RBC media outlet later on Tuesday also reported that Surovikin has been dismissed, citing its own sources. “Army General Sergei Surovikin has been relieved of his post in connection with the transition to another job and is at the disposal of (the Ministry of Defence),” RBC said. One of the paper’s sources said Surovikin “is currently on short-term leave”. Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported on Wednesday that Surovikin was replaced by a Russian Air Force commander. “Ex-chief of the Russian Air and Space Forces Sergei Surovikin has now been relieved of his post, while Colonel-General Viktor Afzalov, head of the Main Staff of the Air Force, is temporarily acting as commander-in-chief of the Air Force,” RIA Novosti reported, citing an unnamed source. Surovikin has not been seen in publicsince the short-lived mutiny in June by the Wagner mercenary group and its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, against Russia’s defence establishment.    Surovikin was consideredone of Prigozhin’s most important alliesin the regular Russian army and in the Wagner chief’s power struggle with Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov. During the mutiny, Surovikin appeared in a video urging Prigozhin to stand down. However, following the Wagner incident, Russian and foreign news reports said that Surovikin was being investigated for possible complicity in the revolt. The Washington, DC-based think tank The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said on Tuesday that Russian military bloggers claimed the latest news on Surovikin’s fate was neither new, nor a surprise. “Surovikin’s alleged dismissal is not new and does not change anything because Russian authorities removed Surovikin from power immediately after Prigozhin’s June 24 rebellion,” the bloggers said, according to ISW. Surovikin earned the nickname “General Armageddon” during Russia’s military intervention in Syria’s civil war. In October, he was placed in charge of Russian military operations in Ukraine but, in January, that role washanded to Gerasimovand Surovikin was made his deputy.

Russia downs 3 combat drones in latest attempted raid on Moscow,"Air traffic at Moscow’s Vnukovo, Sheremetyevo and Domodedovo airports halted for a second day in row due to drone attacks.","Russian air defences shot down two unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and electronically disabled another over central Moscow, thelatest raid on Russia’s capitalcity by combat drones that authorities have accused Ukraine of launching. Russia’s defence ministry said one drone was jammed electronically and crashed into a building in downtown Moscow early on Wednesday morning, and two more were shot down by air defence systems outside the capital. Moscow’s Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said on the Telegram messaging app that one downed drone had hit a building that was under construction in central Moscow, and another was shot down in a district to the west of the city. “Tonight, air defence shot down a drone in Mozhaisky district of Moscow region. The second UAV hit a building under construction in the City,” Sobyanin said on Telegram. Russia’s defence ministry said that the third drone was shot down in the Khimki district of Moscow. Russian state news agency TASS reported that air traffic at Moscow’s Vnukovo, Sheremetyevo and Domodedovo airports was halted, the second day in a row that operations were disrupted at the airports due to a drone attack on the capital. Operations at the airports resumed later on Wednesday morning, Russia’s state aviation authority said.    The TASS state news agency quoted emergency services as saying that a building under construction in Moscow’s business district sustained “minor damage”. Emergency services were inspecting the area in the business district, Sobyanin said on Telegram. “Several windows were smashed in two adjacent five-storey buildings,” he added. Sobyanin and the defence ministry said there were no reports of casualties. Video footages shared on Russian-language social media on Wednesday, which purported to capture the moment the drone crashed into an office block, showed a bright flash followed by a large explosion and smoke. On Tuesday morning, two drones were shot down over the Moscow region town of Krasnogorsk and the settlement of Chastsy. Two other drones were also repelled over the Bryansk region near the Ukrainian border, Moscow’s defence ministry said on Telegram. Windows were broken over several floors of a multi-story residential building in Krasnogorsk and vehicles were damaged on the ground due to debris falling from the destroyed drones, according to authorities. Drone raids on Moscow havebecome regular occurrencesin recent weeks, a development that follows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s warning in late July that the war Moscow had launched in Ukraine was coming to Russia.    A spokesman for the US State Department said on Wednesday that the United States – Kyiv’s largest military supporter – does not encourage or enable attacks by Ukrainian forces on Russian territory. Ukraine decides how it chooses to defend itself against Russia’s invasion, a State Department spokesperson said, according to the Reuters news agency.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/23/russia-downs-3-combat-drones-in-latest-attempted-raid-on-moscow

Russia’s Medvedev warns Georgian breakaway regions could be annexed,Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev accuses West of creating tensions over Georgia by discussing possible NATO membership.,"Russia’s Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy secretary of the Kremlin’s powerful Security Council, has warned that Moscow could annex Georgia’s breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, the Reuters news agency reported. Medvedev, who has cast himself as one ofMoscow’s most hawkish political voicessince Russian forces launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year, accused the West in a newspaper article published on Wednesday of creating tension over Georgia by discussing its possible membership in the NATO military alliance. “The idea of joining Russia is still popular in Abkhazia and South Ossetia,” Medvedev, a former Russian president, wrote in an article published by the Argumenty I Fakty newspaper. “It could quite possibly be implemented if there are good reasons for that,” he said in the article. While Russian relations with Georgia have improved since Tbilisi and Moscow fought a brief but bloody war in 2008 over the breakaway Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions, Medvedev said thatMoscow would not hesitate to actif concerns regarding possible NATO admission come close to being a reality. “We will not wait if our concerns become closer to reality,” Medvedev said in the article, referring to possible annexation.    Georgian officials have repeatedly said they are committed to joining the United States-led NATO military alliance, viewing it as a way to preserve the territorial integrity of their country. The military alliance states on its official website that “Georgia is one of NATO’s closest partners”. “It aspires to join the Alliance. Over time, a broad range of practical cooperation has developed between NATO and Georgia, which supports Georgia’s reform efforts and its goal of Euro-Atlantic integration,” theNATO website states. Georgia lost control over the Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Moscow recognised theindependence of the two regions in 2008following Georgia’s attempt to regain control of South Ossetia by force, which led to a Russian counterattack that saw Moscow’s forces briefly occupy Georgian territory.    Medvedev’s article was published to mark the 15th anniversary of Russia recognising the independence of the regions following the 2008 conflict. Kyiv’s aspiration to join NATO and the threat this posed to Russian security has been one of several arguments used by officials in Moscow to justify Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/23/russias-medvedev-warns-georgian-breakaway-regions-could-be-annexed
Russia says fighter jet destroys Ukraine ‘reconnaissance boat’ in Black Sea,Defence ministry in Moscow says Ukrainian vessel was attacked by Russian fighter jet near gas production facilities in the Black Sea.,"Russia’s defence ministry said a Russian warplane has destroyed a Ukrainian reconnaissance boat in the Black Sea. The ship had sailed near Russian gas production facilities when it was attacked by a Sukhoi Su-30 fighter plane, the ministry said on Tuesday. “Tonight, the crew of the Su-30cm naval aviation of the Black Sea Fleet destroyed a reconnaissance boat of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the area of Russian gas production facilities in the Black Sea,” the ministry said on Telegram. The statement did not give details on what kind of boat had been destroyed, or where exactly the incident had taken place. Russian officials have, in recent weeks, said they thwarted a string of Ukrainian marine drone attacks on its warships in the Black Sea. Attacks from both sides have escalated in the Black Sea since Russia pulled out of a deal that allowed the safe export of Ukrainian grain through the shipping hub. Earlier this month,Ukrainian sea drones attackedthe key Russian port of Novorossiysk on the Black Sea, damaging a naval ship and marking the first time a commercial Russian port has been a target in the 18-month war. The Russian Navy’s Olenegorsky Gornyak, a landing ship, suffered a serious breach in the attack, which was carried out by Ukraine’s navy and security service, Ukrainian officials said.

"Greece to train Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jet fighters, Zelenskyy says",Greece’s offer to train Ukraine’s fighter pilots comes after Denmark and the Netherlands announced they would supply F-16s to Kyiv.,"Greece will take part in the training of Ukrainian Air Force pilots to fly F-16 fighter jets, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. The offer by Greece to train fighter pilots comes afterDenmark and the Netherlandsannounced they would supply the first United States-built F-16 warplanes to the Ukrainian Air Force – a development seen astactically key to Ukraine’s defenceagainst Russia’s invasion. “Today, we have the important result for aviation coalition. Greece will participate in training of our pilots for F-16. I am grateful for this proposal,” Zelenskyy said on Monday during a joint press conference with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis in Athens. The Greek Air Force consists mostly of F-16 jets and Greek pilots are considered extremely experienced in the use of the US-built warplanes. Zelenskyy did not provide details of the pilot training programme but officials from a coalition of 11 nations had said the F-16 training for Ukraine’s pilots will take place in Denmark and Romania. Training is to begin this month and the first Ukrainian F-16 pilots are expected to complete training by early 2024. Earlier on Monday, Zelenskyy, who is concluding a European tour with earlier stops in Sweden, the Netherlands and Denmark, said the promised deliveries of F-16 jets had made him confident Ukraine could end Russia’s invasion.    Zelenskyy called thedecision to donate the warplanes, “absolutely historic, powerful and inspiring for us”, during a visit to Eindhoven airbase in the Netherlands on Sunday with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. TheDutch Air Force has 42 F-16sand Rutte said the number of fighter jets to be sent to Kyiv would be finalised after talks with Ukraine’s allies. Russia has long warned that the provision of F-16 to Kyiv would be a“colossal risk” that could escalateits war in Ukraine. According to the Washington, DC-based think tank The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), Ukraine’s Air Force Commander Mykola Oleshchuk believes that F-16s will allow Ukrainian forces to combat Russia’s main aviation threat – the SU-35 jet fighter. If Ukraine could destroy between 2 and 5 percent of Russia’s SU-35s, that would force it to “temporarily stop flying combat missions to develop a response”,the ISW reported. “Oleshchuk argued that this temporary pause would give Ukraine temporary air superiority and therefore allow Ukrainian forces to significantly accelerate counteroffensive operations,” the ISW added.    Greece has also been a strong supporter of Ukraine since Russia’s invasion, providing humanitarian aid and weapons, including infantry fighting vehicles, assault rifles, rocket launchers and ammunition. Prime Minister Mitsotakis on Monday said Greece would “be present in the titanic effort to reconstruct and rebuild” Ukraine, with “particular emphasis on Odesa”. A historically Russian ally bound by centuries of tradition and a shared Orthodox Christian faith, Greece under Mitsotakis has shifted and unequivocally condemned Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Last year, Greece expelled a dozen members of Russia’s diplomatic and consular missions and is hosting thousands of Ukrainian refugees and their families. In April, Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov visited the Greek capital for talks with his then-counterpart Nikos Panagiotopoulos. Reznikov at the time said Ukraine after the war would seek Greek assistance in de-mining the Sea of Azov and developing the country’s naval forces.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/22/greece-to-train-ukrainian-pilots-to-fly-f-16-jet-fighters-zelenskyy-says

"Wagner boss posts first video since Russia mutiny, hints he’s in Africa",Yevgeny Prigozhin says mercenary group is recruiting people and ‘will fulfil the tasks that were set’.,"Russian mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin posted his first video address since leading a short-lived mutiny in late June, appearing in a clip possibly shot in Africa that was released on Telegram channels affiliated with the Wagner Group. Prigozhin is seen standing in a desert in camouflage with a rifle in his hands. In the distance are more armed men and a pickup truck. Prigozhin’s comments and some posts in the pro-Wagner channels suggested it was filmed in Africa. “The temperature is 50+ [at least 122 degrees Fahrenheit] – everything as we like. The Wagner PMC makes Russia even greater on all continents and Africa – more free. Justice and happiness for the African people. We’re making life a nightmare for ISIS [ISIL] and al-Qaeda and other bandits,” Prigozhin said. He added Wagner continues to recruit fighters and the group “will fulfil the tasks that were set”. The video is accompanied by a telephone number for those who want to join the mercenary group. The future of Wagner and Prigozhin has been unclear since he led a brief rebellion against the Russian defence establishment two months ago. The Kremlin said he and some of his soldiers, who have fought in some of the fiercestbattles of the Ukraine war, would leave for Belarus. Since the mutiny, some Wagner fighters have moved to Belarus and started training the army there. In comments published in late July, Prigozhin also said Wagner was ready to further increase its presence in Africa.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/21/wagner-boss-posts-first-video-since-russia-mutiny-hints-hes-in-africa
UAE says not flouting ally sanctions as its economy warms to Russia,"WSJ claims the UAE is benefitting from the war in Ukraine, providing a refuge for Russian money.","The United Arab Emirates has said it is careful not to violate sanctions imposed by its Western allies on Russiaover the war in Ukraine, after a Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report claimed the country was aiding Moscow by providing an outlet for Russian money. A UAE official, however, said the country has a robust process to deal with sanctioned people and companies, and is in close contact with the United States and the European Union about the war’s implications for the global economy. The official, quoted by the outlet, added that Emirati banks monitor compliance with sanctions imposed on Russia to prevent violations of international law. “The ongoing global climate has led to financial and investment inflows to the UAE, given the country’s reputation as a stable global investment hub,” the official said. “We will continue to take these responsibilities extremely seriously, especially given the current geopolitical landscape.” The WSJ said an influx of Russians pouring into the UAE has attracted the attention of some of the Gulf country’s main banks, including Emirates NBD, Dubai’s main government-owned bank, which is recruiting Russian bankers to set up a unit dedicated to managing money from wealthy Russians. It also reported that local banks have opened thousands of accounts for Russians, although Emirati officials have said local banks avoid sanctioned individuals in order to maintain correspondent banking relations with US banks that clear dollar transactions. According to the outlet, tens of thousands of Russians have moved to the UAE, and especially Dubai, in the past year, turning the Russian-speaking community into one of the most visible in the country of roughly nine million people. This also reportedly includes some of the Russian elite, namely Igor Sechin, a confidant of Russian President Vladimir Putin who runs a state oil company, who was recently in Dubai on business despite being blacklisted by the US and much of Europe. Moreover, Western bans on Russian oil have redirected Moscow’s biggest export to the UAE, which, the outlet claimed, buys it at discounted prices and either resells it or refines it into products sold at market rates. This has led to a significant surge in the incoming flow of foreign currency after the Ukraine war, but the UAE’s dealings with Russia are generally believed not to conflict with Western sanctions, even as they may irk Washington and its allies.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/21/uae-says-not-flouting-ally-sanctions-as-its-economy-warms-to-russia

Ukraine ‘sky shield getting stronger’ as allies supply coveted F-16s,President Zelenskyy’s announcement that European allies will provide high-end fighter jets comes during a visit to their capitals.,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has welcomed a “historic” decision by the Netherlands and Denmark to provide US-made F-16 fighter jets for his country to counter Russia’s invasion. Zelenskyy sought the advanced warplanes for months to strengthen Ukraine’s Soviet-era air force as it pursues a grinding counteroffensive against Russian forces in the east. Washington announced its approval of the F-16 transfers on Friday, and training of Ukraine pilots is set to begin this month, which may allow Ukraine to begin deploying the jets in early 2024. Thedecisionis “absolutely historic, powerful and inspiring for us”, Zelenskyy said alongside Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte during a visit to the Eindhoven airbase in the Netherlands on Sunday. The Dutchair forcehas 42 F-16s and Rutte said the number provided to Kyiv would be finalised after talks with allies. Later on Sunday, Zelenskyy travelled to Denmark’s Skrydstrup airbase and was greeted by Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen. “We also know that you need more and that is why today we announced that we will donate 19 F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine,” the Danish leader said. Six of the jets will be delivered by the end of this year, eight next year, and five in 2025, Frederiksen said. “This is a very powerful support for us – training missions are already starting,” Zelenskyy told journalists. “We are doing our best to get even more results for Ukraine. In particular, today we discussed the expansion of training missions. Ukraine’s sky shield is getting stronger.”    Alexandre Vautravers, an analyst and the editor-in-chief of the Swiss Military Review, said the F-16 development “is not a game changer but allows Ukraine to stay in the game”. “Until now, we can say that Ukraine received quite a number of combat aircraft, mostly MiG-29s, so it has been able to maintain the number of aircraft it started the war with,” Vautravers told Al Jazeera. “But the Western countries have no more ex-Soviet airplanes to commit to this fight and, therefore, it will need to be Western airplanes from now on.” Zelenskyy’s visit comes after a trip to Sweden on Saturday, when he discussed joint production of CV90 combat vehicles and training of Ukraine pilots for Gripen fighter jets with Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson. The long-sought approval to supply the jets drew a warning from Moscow. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Moscow would consider the F-16s a “nuclear” threat because of their capacity to carry atomic weapons. The Netherlands and Denmark have led a months-long push to train Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16s and to ultimately deliver the jets to help counter the air superiority of Russia, whose forces invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Ukraine’s Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov on Saturday said training had begun for Ukrainian pilots, but it would take at least six months and possibly longer to also train engineers and mechanics. Frederiksen said more than 70 Ukrainian military officials arrived in Denmark for training. Ukraine says it expects several dozen pilots to be trained. Both the Netherlands and Denmark have F-16s available to donate as their armed forces are transitioning to newer F-35 fighters made by a group of countries led by Washington.

Russia’s Lavrov says West needs continual reminder of risks of nuclear war,Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov says US and NATO risk ‘a situation of direct armed confrontation of nuclear powers’.,"Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said thatpossession of nuclear weapons protects Russiafrom security threats and that Moscow continually reminded the West of the risk of a nuclear conflict. Lavrov’s comments are the latest reference by Russian officials to their country’s nuclear weapons arsenal,a rhetoric of military escalation by Moscow that has gained tempo and frequencysince Russian forces invaded Ukraine last year. Last month, formerRussian President Dmitry Medvedevsaid Moscow would have to use a nuclear weapon if Ukraine’s counteroffensive against Russian troops was a success. “The possession of nuclear arms is today the only possible response to some of the significant external threats to the security of our country,” Lavrov said in an interview for the state-owned magazine, The International Affairs, published early on Saturday on the foreign ministry website.    Lavrov said that the United States and NATO military alliance members risk ending up in “a situation of direct armed confrontation of nuclear powers”. “We believe such a development should be prevented. That’s why we have to remind about the existence of high military and political risks and send sobering signals to our opponents,” Lavrov said. NATO members and the US are Ukraine’s staunchest supporters and the largest providers of military aid in its war against Russia. US President Joe Biden has called a threat of Russia using tactical nuclear weapons “real”. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said this week that the Western military alliance has not detected any changes to Russia’s nuclear force stance, and therefore, NATO did not need to reciprocate in its nuclear posture. On Thursday,Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, one of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s closest allies, warned that he would use the nuclear weapons that Russia had deployed in his country if faced with external aggression.    “There can be only one threat – aggression against our country. If aggression against our country starts from Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, we will respond instantly with everything we have,” Lukashenko said in an interview. Washington, DC-based think tank, the Institute for the Study of War, said earlier this year that Russia’s increasing nuclear war rhetoric was part ofan “information operation”focused on discouraging Ukraine and its Western supporter. “Russian invocations of nuclear threats and nuclear doctrine are part of an information operation meant to discourage Ukraine and the West but do not represent any material Russian intent to employ nuclear weapons,” the think tank said in an assessment.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/19/russias-lavrov-says-west-needs-continual-reminder-of-risks-of-nuclear-war

The decision by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on Friday shields those who qualify for TPS from deportation and opens the door for Ukrainians to apply for work permits. TPS wasfirst issuedfor Ukrainians in March 2022, days after Russia launched an all-out invasion of their country. The extension on Friday was coupled with a TPS redesignation of Ukraine, allowing new people who were in the US as of August 16 to apply for protected status. “Russia’s ongoing militaryinvasion of Ukraineand the resulting humanitarian crisis requires that the United States continue to offer safety and protection to Ukrainians who may not be able to return to their country,” DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement. “We will continue to offer our support to Ukrainian nationals through this temporary form of humanitarian relief.” Russia’s ongoing military invasion of Ukraine and the resulting humanitarian crisis requires that the United States continue to offer safety and protection to Ukrainians who may not be able to return to their country.https://t.co/OC8gcv9CxXpic.twitter.com/iyMAZ7519U — Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas (@SecMayorkas)August 18, 2023  Friday’s directive also eases requirements for Ukrainians on student visas in the US, allowing them to work more and take fewer classes. Those seeking to extend their status must reregister with the DHS between August 21 and October 20, the department said. The department said the extension affects about 26,000 people and the redesignation makes an estimated 166,700 more people eligible for TPS. The Russian invasion displaced millions of people, and while some Ukrainians have returned after the fighting became largely confined to eastern parts of their country, many remain in neighbouring European countries andacross the world. On Friday, DHS described the war in Ukraine as “the largest conventional military action in Europe since World War II”. “Russia’s expanded military invasion has led to high numbers of civilian casualties and reports of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by Russian military forces and officials,” the department said. “This invasion has caused a humanitarian crisis, with significant numbers of individuals fleeing and damage tocivilian infrastructurethat has left many without electricity or access to medical services.”    TPS allows the US to offer protection to people who cannot return to their home countries due to armed conflict, natural disasters and other “extraordinary” conditions. The status does not offer a path to permanent residency or citizenship in the country. Currently, Washington has designated 16 countries for TPS, including Afghanistan, Yemen,Haiti,Sudan, Venezuela and Syria.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/18/biden-administration-extends-protected-status-for-ukrainians-in-us
Russia shuts down human rights group Sakharov Center,Moscow City Court said it was dissolving the organisation for illegally hosting conferences and exhibitions.,"A Russian court has ordered the closure of the Sakharov Center, a prominent human rights organisation that preserved the legacy of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Andrei Sakharov, in the latest move in a widespread crackdown on dissent. Moscow City Court said in a statement on Friday that it decided to dissolve the organisation, which launched nearly 30 years ago, for illegally hosting conferences and exhibitions. The group had hosted hundreds of debates, exhibitions and other events since its creation in 1996. In 2015, thousands of people gathered there to pay their last respects to opposition politician Boris Nemtsov, who was assassinated near the Kremlin walls. In January, Russia’s prosecutor general’s office said, the Andrei Sakharov Foundation in the United States had been added to a list of foreign and international non-governmental organisations whose activities were “recognised as undesirable” on Russian territory. Under a 2015 law, the label makes involvement a criminal offence. It received an eviction notice from the Moscow city authorities in January and was vacated from its historic premises in April. All three premises, its main building, an exhibition hall, and one to Sakharov’s former apartment, used to be provided to the Sakharov Center free of charge. Moscow’s Property Departmentsaidamendments to the controversial law on foreign agents, which took force on December 1 last year, forbid organisations and individuals labelled as foreign agents from receiving any state support. Sakharov, who died in 1989, was a key figure in developing the Soviet Union’s hydrogen bomb programme but later become renowned for his activism in promoting human rights and freedom of conscience. He was awarded a Nobel prize in 1975 but was not allowed to travel to Norway to receive it. In 1980, he was sent into internal exile, which lasted six years. Kremlin critics have said authorities are widening a historic crackdown on dissent, with most opposition figures behind bars or in exile and top rights groups shut down. In January, a court also ordered the closure of Russia’s oldest human rights organisation, the Moscow Helsinki Group. And Memorial, which established itself as a key pillar in civil society, was disbanded by Russian authorities in late 2021, just months before Putin sent troops to Ukraine. On Thursday, authorities charged Grigory Melkonyants, a leader of Golos, a prominent independent election monitoring group, with being involved with an “undesirable” organisation. Melkonyants’s lawyer, Mikhail Biryukov, said his client was scheduled to appear in Moscow’s Basmanny District Court on Friday. He faces up to six years in prison. Golos has not been labelled “undesirable”. But it was once a member of the European Network of Election Monitoring Organizations, a group that was declared “undesirable” in Russia in 2021. Golos was founded in 2000 and has since played a key role in independent monitoring of elections in Russia. Over the years, it has faced mounting pressure from the authorities. In 2013, it was designated a “foreign agent” – a label that implies additional government scrutiny and carries strong pejorative connotations. Three years later, it was shuttered as a non-governmental organisation by the Ministry of Justice. The authorities have also banned popular social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and X, formerly known as Twitter, and have targeted other online services with hefty fines. On Thursday, a Russian court imposed a three million rouble ($32,000) fine on Google for failing to delete allegedly false information about the conflict in Ukraine. The move by a magistrate’s court follows similar actions in early August against Apple and the Wikimedia Foundation that hosts Wikipedia. According to Russian news reports, the court found that the YouTube video service, which is owned by Google, was guilty of not deleting videos with incorrect information about the conflict – which Russia characterises as a “special military operation”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/18/russia-shuts-down-human-rights-group-sakharov-center
Netherlands says US has approved delivery of F-16s to Ukraine,"Washington says the F-16s, like the US Abrams tanks, will be crucial in countering Russia.","The United States has given its approval for the Netherlands to deliver F-16s to Ukraine, the Dutch defence minister said on Friday, in a major gain for Kyiv even though the fighter jets will not have an immediate impact on the almost 18-month war. “I welcome the US decision to clear the way for delivery of F-16 jets to Ukraine. It allows us to follow through on the training of Ukrainian pilots,” Dutch Defense Minister Kajsa Ollongren said in a message on the social platform X, formerly known as Twitter. “We remain in close contact with European partners to decide on the next steps.” Ukraine has long pleaded for the sophisticated fighter to give it a combat edge. It recently launched a long-anticipated counteroffensive against the Kremlin’s forces without air cover, placing its troops at the mercy of Russian aviation and artillery. Apart from delivering the warplanes, Ukraine’s allies also need to train its pilots. Washington says the F-16s, like the advanced US Abrams tanks, will be crucial in the long term as Kyiv faces down Russia.  The Netherlands is part of a Western coalition that also includes Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Sweden and the United Kingdom that in July pledged to train Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16s. Washington must give its blessing because the planes are made in the United States. Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra said in a message on X that US clearance to send F-16s to Ukraine “marks a major milestone” in Ukraine’s defence. It was not immediately clear when the first F-16s could be delivered to Ukraine. As well as the Netherlands, Denmark said in June that training Ukrainian pilots had started and the country was considering delivering jets to Kyiv, but that pilots would need six to eight months of training before a possible donation of aircraft can become a reality. In a statement to Danish media, Defence Minister Jakob Ellemann-Jensen said that the government has several times said that a donation was “a natural step after the training”. Meanwhile, Russian air defences stopped drone attacks on central Moscow and on the country’s ships in the Black Sea, officials said Friday, blaming the attempted strikes on Ukraine. Defence systemsshot downa Ukrainian drone over central Moscow early Friday and some fragments fell on an exhibition centre, the Russian Ministry of Defence said in a statement. It said the drone was shot down at about 4 am (01:00 GMT) and there were no injuries or fire caused by the fragments. However, flights were briefly suspended at all four major Moscow airports. Journalist Yulia Shapovalova, in Moscow, told Al Jazeera: “This is the third attack … in the course of just 24 hours, we’ve heard a drone was shot down by an air defence system near the village of Nikolskoye, in the border Belgorod region. “Earlier, according to …, the Russian Ministry of Defence, the Ukrainian armed forces tried to attack ships on the Russian Black Sea Fleet, with an unmanned boat.” The area is about 4km (2.5 miles) west of the Kremlin. The defence ministry called the latest incident “another terrorist attack by the Kyiv regime”. Naval forces also destroyed a Ukrainian sea drone that attempted an attack on Russian ships late on Thursday in the Black Sea, about 240km (149 miles) southwest of Sevastopol, the ministry said. The drone was taken out by fire from a patrol boat and a corvette, it said. It was not possible to verify the claims.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/18/netherlands-says-us-has-approved-delivery-of-f-16s-to-ukraine
"Ukraine combat drone damages building in central Moscow, Russia says",Moscow’s mayor says Ukrainian drone shot down by air defence and debris falls on city’s Expo Center causing damage.,"A Ukrainian military drone crashed into a Moscow city building after it was shot down by air defence systems inthe latest attack on the Russian capital by unmanned aerial vehicles. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app thatair defence systems had shot down a drone early on Friday morningand debris had fallen on buildings in the city’s Expo Center complex. The Expo Center – a large event space used for major exhibitions and conferences – is located less than 5km (3.1 miles) from the Kremlin. A video published by Russian media outlets showed thick smoke rising next to skyscrapers in the city. The Russian defence ministry said thatUkraine launched the drone attackat about 4am local time (01:00 GMT) “using an unmanned aerial vehicle against objects located in Moscow and the Moscow region”. “The UAV, after being exposed to air defence weapons, changed its flight path and fell on a nonresidential building in the Krasnopresnenskaya embankment area of Moscow,” the ministry said on Telegram.    Moscow’s mayor said emergency services were on the scene, but that early reports indicated there were no casualties. “The wreckage of the UAV fell in the area of the Expo Center, and did not cause significant damage to the building,” Sobyanin said on Telegram. State-run news agency TASS reported that one of the walls of the Expo Center’s pavilion had partially collapsed, citing emergency services. “The area of the collapse is about 30 square metres [323sq feet],” emergency services told TASS. The Expo Centre, on the Krasnopresnenskaya embankment of the Moskva River, hosts regular exhibitions and trade shows, according to its website. The venue is 100 metres (328 feet) from Moscow-City, an office block in the capital’s main business district that was struck twice within days by debris from downed drone strikes this month. TASS also reported that the airspace near Moscow’s international airport of Vnukovo was briefly closed, with departures and arrivals delayed, citing the aviation service. Moscow and its surrounding areashave come under frequent drone attacks in recent weeks, including two drone attacks that were repelled over Moscow’s financial district, with each causing minor damage to the facades of high-rise buildings. In May, drones were shot down near the Kremlin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned last month that “war” was coming to Russia, with the country’s “symbolic centres and military bases” now targets of Kyiv. Russia’s defence ministry also said that it thwarted a Ukrainian marine drone attack on its warships in the Black Sea on Thursday night.    Ukrainian forces had attempted to attack ships of the Russian Black Sea Fleet at 10:55pm local time (19:55 GMT) with an “unmanned sea boat” while the ships were operating in the southwestern part of the Black Sea 237km (147 miles) southwest of Sevastopol, the TASS news agency reported, citing the defence ministry. Sevastopol is the base of Russia’s Black Sea fleet on the Moscow-annexed Crimean peninsula. The ministry said the sea-borne drone was destroyed by the Pytlivyi frigate and the Vasily Bykov patrol ship before it could reach its target. Russian warships also repelled a Ukrainian sea drone attack on Russia’s Novorossiysk naval base on August 4, the news agency reported.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/18/ukraine-drone-attack-damages-building-in-central-moscow-russian-officials
"Putin not pushing Belarus to join Ukraine war, Lukashenko says",Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko says Russian leader has achieved ‘goals’ in Ukraine and it is now time to negotiate.,"Russian President Vladimir Putin isnot pushing Belarus into joining the war in Ukraine, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said, but he warned that Minsk would respond to external aggression including the use of Russia’s nuclear weapons deployed in his country. In an online interview published on Thursday,Lukashenko said that he believed Putinhad already achieved his goals in Ukraine, and that Kyiv and Moscow should sit down to negotiations and be ready to discuss all the issues, including the future of Crimea and other Ukrainian territories Russia claims. “Its [Russia’s] goals have already been fulfilled to date. Ukraine will never behave so aggressively towards Russia after the end of this war, as it did before the war,” Lukashenko said in the interview.    “Negotiations should begin without preconditions. This is a classic of any diplomacy. I think so. We need to sit down at the negotiating table and discuss everything. And Crimea, and Kherson, Zaporizhia, Donetsk and Luhansk. Everything there needs to be discussed,” he said. Lukashenko,one of Putin’s closest allies, whose country borders Ukraine, Russia andthree NATO countries including Poland, said the Russian leader had no reason to involve Belarus directly in the conflict. “To involve Belarus … What will that give? Nothing,” he said. “If you Ukrainians do not cross our border, we will never participate in this war. In this hot war. But we will always help Russia – they are our allies,” he said in the interview with Diana Panchenko, a pro-Russian Ukrainian journalist. There were direct contacts between Kyiv and Minsk, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had put a halt to it, Lukashenko also said. According to Lukashenko, the topics discussed included potential Belarus involvement in the war on Russia’s side, potential use of nuclear weapons and Wagner Group mercenaries, now stationed in Belarus.    “These questions accumulated. But we had these contacts, [and] we talked. We don’t mind. And there are still proposals to continue this dialogue,” he said. Lukashenko warned that he would use “everything we have” if faced with aggression from nearby NATO members. “There can be only one threat – aggression against our country. If aggression against our country starts from Poland,Lithuania, Latvia, we will respond instantly with everything we have,” he said. “Against Ukraine, if it commits aggression against us – not only nuclear weapons will be used. We have something besides nuclear weapons. And we will not warn you that if you cross the red lines, we will strike at the decision-making centres. This will be done without warning,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/18/putin-not-pushing-belarus-to-join-ukraine-war-lukashenko-says

Five key issues to look out for at first US Republican debate,Candidates will look to narrow former President Donald Trump’s lead in race for 2024 Republican presidential nomination.,"Washington, DC –The race for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination in the United States is heating up ashopefulsare hours away from the party’s first debate. The debate on Wednesday will offer the candidates a chance to directly make their case to the American public as they seek to narrow the gap with former PresidentDonald Trump, who remains far ahead of the pack. With Trumpskipping the debate, the event provides an opportunity for Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, former Vice President Mike Pence and the other candidates to present themselves as viable alternatives. The debate comes nearly six months before the Republican primary season – a series of state-level contests in which party voters choose their presidential candidate – kicks off in Iowa. The list of debate participants has not been finalised, but US media outlets have reported that eight candidates have qualified so far. Republican rules state that a candidate must have at least 1 percent support and 40,000 individual donations to qualify, and they must also sign a pledge to support the eventual Republican nominee in the general elections. Here, Al Jazeera looks at the key issues that could shape the first debate of the 2024 vote:    In a field with multiple candidates, frontrunners normally take a lot of shots from rivals looking to chip away at their lead, but Trump has largely been spared direct attacks from most of his opponents. Chris Christie, a one-time ally of the former president, has made rebuking Trump a defining element of his candidacy, but the ex-New Jersey governor is mounting a long-shot campaign at best with his support among primary voters lingering at around 3 percent. DeSantis, Trump’s closest opponent, has been reluctant to go all out against the former president. Instead, the governor has criticised Trump on specific policy issues, sometimes without naming him. Some of the other candidates also have avoided taking a clear position on Trump’smounting legal woes. For his part, Trump has not shied away from denouncing his Republican challengers, often taking to social media to hurl insults at them and remind them of their past support for him. Against that backdrop, one of the chief takeaways of the evening will be how the other candidates deal with him.    Foreign policy has been a major source of division among Republicans. The party is home to both hardline isolationists and staunch interventionists and that chasm has been on full display in recent months when it comesto US supportfor Ukraine. While candidates such asTrump and DeSantishave voiced scepticism about Washington’s assistance to Kyiv, Christie and Pence have argued that the US should do more to help Ukraine. Trump has refused to commit to continuing the aid if re-elected, and DeSantis has called the conflict a “territorial dispute”, but Christie andPencerecently visited Kyiv and met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to show their support. The US has provided Ukraine with tens of billions of dollars in military, humanitarian and budgetary assistance since the Russian invasion began in 2022, leading some Republicans to argue that the funds are better spent at home. Republican voters are also divided on the issue: A Gallup survey in June showed that 50 percent of Republican respondents said the US is doing too much to support Ukraine. The debate will provide a chance for the candidates to articulate and argue their positions on Ukraine, a consequential topic over which the US president has considerable influence. Since the US Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion last year, the issue has been a politicalAchilles heelfor Republicans. Public opinion polls and election contests have shown that most Americans oppose further restrictions on reproductive rights. Still, the Republican base continues to largely identify as opponents of abortion, which means the party’s candidates will face a challenging task of appealing to those supporters during the primaries without alienating the wider US electorate in 2024. Trump appointed three of the five conservative Supreme Court justices who in June 2022 overturnedRoe v Wade, the precedent that established abortion rights. But the former president has not confirmed whether he would back a federal ban on the procedure. DeSantis has signed one of the strictest abortion laws in the country, banning abortions in Florida after six weeks of pregnancy, while Pence has been courting Christian religious voters who oppose abortion. But differing approaches are emerging among the candidates with Trump suggesting Florida’s restrictions are “too harsh”. At the debate, the candidates will likely have to make their position known on the issue, including whether they would support restrictions at the national level. Social issues, over which the president has limited powers, have become a major feature of electoral politics in the US. In fact, DeSantis rose to national prominence by championing right-wingsocial causesin Florida and rejecting what he calls “woke” policies focused on identity and social justice. Trump recently said he does not like the term “woke”, which has become a rallying cry for conservatives against what they see as a disproportionate liberal focus on race, historical injustices, gender identity and sexuality. Still, the former president, who launched his 2016 campaign by calling undocumentedMexican immigrants“rapists”, has been regularly accused of bigotry himself. The first debate may set the tone for how much the candidates will focus on so-called “culture war” issues versus other policy topics. With evangelical Christians, who back Israel for theological reasons, growing into a decisive segment of the Republican base, staunch support for Israel has become a constant feature of Republican primaries. And the upcoming debate will have no shortage of stalwart Israel supporters. Former US Ambassador to the United NationsNikki Haley’sdiplomatic career was mostly defined by her defence of Israel at international forums. DeSantis has prided himself on penalising companies in Florida that boycott Israel and falsely stated that the Palestinian West Bankis not occupiedterritory.    While in office, Trump was often described by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as the best friend Israel has ever had in the White House. Trump moved the US embassy to Jerusalem, recognised Israel’s claims to the occupied Syrian Golan Heights, and brokered diplomatic agreements between Israeland Arab states. US President Joe Biden has largely maintained Trump’s pro-Israel line – and in some instances, moved US policyeven furtherin favour of the country – but Republican candidates will likely try to outdo him with pro-Israel statements at the debate if the subject comes up. Presidential campaigns have previously produced anti-Palestinian comments and policy proposals. For example, ahead of the 2012 elections, then-Republican candidateNewt Gingrichcalled Palestinians an “invented” people, and three years later,Ben Carson, who went on to serve in Trump’s cabinet, said a Palestinian state should not be established on “Israeli territory”. “Is that necessary, or can you sort of slip that area down into Egypt?” Carson said at the time.

"After backlash, NATO chief says only Ukraine can decide on talks to end war",Jens Stoltenberg’s chief of staff suggested earlier that Kyiv could give up land to Russia in return for NATO membership.,"The head of the NATO alliance says it is up to Ukraine to decide on when and under what conditions to begin any negotiations on ending the war with Russia after comments by a senior colleague on the subject resulted in a backlash. Speaking at a conference in the Norwegian town of Arendal, Jens Stoltenberg said: “It is the Ukrainians, and only the Ukrainians, who can decide when there are conditions in place for negotiations and who can decide at the negotiating table what is an acceptable solution.” He reiterated that NATO’s role in the war was to support Ukraine. Stoltenberg made the comments after his chief of staff, Stian Jenssen, said on Tuesday that Ukraine, in the end, may have to give up territory to Russia to end the war. According to the Norwegian newspaperVG,Jenssen said during a panel debate in Arendal: “I think that a solution could be for Ukraine to give up territory and get NATO membership in return.” Ukrainian officials slammed the suggestion. Oleg Nikolenko, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, called any talk of swapping land for membership “completely unacceptable”. Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy chairman of the Russian Security Council and a former president and prime minister, said: “To join the bloc, the Kyiv authorities will have to give up even Kyiv itself, the capital of ancient Rus.” Jenssen has said he regrets his suggestion, adding that it was part of a more extensive discussion on the possible future scenarios in Ukraine. After his chief of staff’s comments, Stoltenberg said: “His message, which is my main message and which is NATO’s main message, is, firstly, that NATO’s policy is unchanged – we support Ukraine.”    He also said that regarding Russia’s nuclear threat, the bloc had not detected any changes. “We haven’t seen any changes in their nuclear forces that trigger us to change our forces and the way those are arranged,” he said. At last month’s NATO summit, the alliance said, “Ukraine’s future is in NATO,” but it did not provide Kyiv a timeline for membership. The leaders said NATO would extend an official invitation to join only when “conditions are met” without specifying what those conditions are. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed frustration over the lack of an invitation and timeline.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/17/nato-chief-says-ukraine-decides-on-negotiations-following-backlash
Ukraine’s Kuleba promises to ‘free Africa from Russia’s grip’,Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba says Kyiv intends to conduct a diplomatic ‘counteroffensive’ against Russia’s efforts to woo Africa.,"Kyiv intends to invest significant political capital to deepen ties with African countries, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has said, in a bid to counterMoscow’s influence on the continent. “We are starting from scratch in Africa. This continent needs systematic and long-term work. It’s not something that happens overnight,” Kuleba said in an interview with Agence French Presse on Wednesday in Kyiv. The foreign minister compared Kyiv’s push to bolster ties with governments on the continent with a diplomatic “counteroffensive” against Russian efforts. “Our strategy is not to replace Russia but to free Africa from Russia’s grip,” Kuleba said, adding that Ukraine wanted to approach those diplomatic interactions with “respect and with the principle of mutual benefit.” This was in contrast to Russia’s approach, based on fighters from theWagner mercenary groupand “propaganda“. “Russia is trying very hard to keep countries in its orbit through coercion, bribery and fear,” he said.    Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, many African countries have remained publiclyneutral and abstainedfrom voting against Russia at United Nations meetings. A quartet of African leaders led by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa conducted a trip to Russia and Ukraine in June as part ofefforts to resolve the warbetween the nations. The delegation put forward a 10-point plan that included sending prisoners of war and children back to their countries of origin and unimpeded grain exports through the Black Sea, but the effort is yet to yield any results. Even before the war in Ukraine began, the Russian mercenary group Wagner had partnered with several African nations including Mali and the Central African Republic. Those relationships are yet to change, even though Wagner’s leader Yevgeny Prigozhin fell out with the authorities aftertrying to topple Russia’s senior military leadership. The Kremlin has longstanding partnerships with several countries in Africa that date to the Soviet era, but Moscow has ramped up efforts to cement ties on the continent since becoming isolated from Western countries over the Ukraine war. Russian President Vladimir Putin hosted representatives of 49 African countries, including 17 heads of state, for asummit in Saint Petersburglast month, in which they agreed to promote a multipolar world order and fight “neocolonialism”. He offered debt write-offs and grain to woo allies and claimed that, “Russia’s attention to Africa is steadily growing.” Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov toured Africa twice since January, seeking to draw it into Moscow’s camp and presenting Russia as a bulwark against Western “imperialism”. But Ukraine has also been making efforts to woo African countries, in recent years having emerged as an alternative source to the West for weapons for countries on the continent fighting armed groups. Last year, the African Unionsnubbedtwo attempts by Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to address its heads of state. Kuleba also said on Wednesday that Putin’s publicly voiced concerns about food security in Africa are baseless, given Moscow’sexit from the Black Sea grain deallast month. The accord was brokered last year by the United Nations and Turkey and allowed about 33 million tonnes of grain to leave Ukrainian ports, helping to stabilise global food prices and avert shortages. “People in Africa saw that all of Putin’s stories about how he cares about African countries are lies,” Kuleba said. He described Ukrainian farmers and people in Africa depending on bread availability as the main victims of Moscow’s decision to end safe passage for cargo ships to and from Ukraine’s ports. “Putin solves his own problems at the expense of Africans and Ukrainians,” Kuleba said.

Ukraine air force says no use of US-built F-16 fighter jets this year,Air force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat says F-16 warplanes will not be part of Ukraine’s defence during the coming ‘autumn and winter’ period.,"Ukraine haslobbied persistently to be provided with US-made F-16fighter jets, but the warplanes will not be part of Ukraine’s defence against Russian forces during the coming “autumn and winter” months, a spokesperson for the air force said. Ukrainian air force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat said late on Wednesday night that his country had “big hopes” for the deployment of F-16s as part of the country’s defences against invading Russian forces. “It’s already obvious we won’t be able to defend Ukraine with F-16 fighter jets during this autumn and winter,” Ihnat told a joint telethon broadcast by Ukrainian channels. “We had big hopes for this plane, that it will become part of air defence, able to protect us from Russia’s missiles and drones terrorism,” Ihnat said. Ukraine has repeatedly called on its Western alliesto supply its forces with F-16s, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said were crucial in the fight against Russia. Western allies were initially reluctant to provide Kyiv with advanced warplanes, fearing the provision of new fighter jets might trigger a direct confrontation between the US-backed NATO military alliance and Moscow. That sentiment changed when US President Joe Biden signalled at the Group of Seven summit in May in Japan that training programmes for Ukrainian pilots in the operation of F-16s could begin. Russia has warned that the transfer of F-16s to Ukraine would be a“colossal risk” that could escalate the war. Last month, Ukraine’s Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov saidF-16 training would begin in Romania this month.The minister also said he hoped the training would not last longer than six months and the warplane would be in action by then. Despite the announced training of pilots, neither the US nor other allies of Kyiv have yet announced a timeframe for the supply of actual F-16 planes. Separately on Wednesday night, Zelenskyy said Kyiv would “significantly” increase drone production, stressing the importance of unmanned aerial vehicles in defending his country against Russia’s invasion. I held a Staff meeting today. Everything we discussed in our combat brigades is now part of the work of the General Staff, officials, and the Staff. We are not only working with partners but also increasing Ukrainian production several times to meet the needs of our warriors.pic.twitter.com/miBShs4WnS — Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa)August 16, 2023  Recently back from visits to troops fighting on the front lines in the east of the country, Zelenskyy said troops “first ask about drones, electronic warfare, and military air defence”. “Drones are the eyes and protection on the front line. Of different ranges, for different purposes. Drones are a guarantee that people will not have to pay with their lives when drones can be used,” he said.

Lithuania closes two border crossings with Belarus amid growing tensions,Lithuania temporarily shuts two of six checkpoints located on shared 680km border with Belarus over security concerns.,"Lithuanian will temporarily close two of the country’s six border crossingswith Belarus due to what the government said were “geopolitical circumstances”, and as concerns grow in the region overthe presence of thousands of Russia’s Wagner Group mercenarieswithin Belarusian territory. Belarus, Russia’s staunchest ally, reacted promptly to the announcement on Wednesday, criticising what it called Lithuania’s “far-fetched” decision to close two of its border checkpoints. “This decision is one of the preventive measures to contain threats to national security and possible provocations at the border,” Lithuania’s Interior Minister Agne Bilotaite said. Bilotaitedid not spell out the threatsin the reasoning for closing the two rural border crossings from Friday, which were not used by commercial vehicles. Over recent few weeks, Lithuania has discouraged its citizens from travelling to Belarus, even setting up signs at the borders saying: “Do not risk your safety – do not travel to Belarus. You may fail to come back”.    Lithuania has also cited the security risk posedby the Wagner mercenary group, which has taken refuge in Belarus since their failed mutiny against Russia’s military leadership in June. Lithuania, which shares a nearly 680-kilometre (422-mile) border with Belarus, declared its independence from the Soviet Union 33 years ago. A democracy and a member of NATO and the European Union, Lithuania has been a strong supporter of Ukraine in its war against Russia and a place of refuge in recent years for many who have fled an authoritarian crackdown in neighbouring Belarus and increased repression in Russia The commander of Lithuania’s border guard agency, Rustamas Liubajevas, estimated there could be up to 4,500 Wagner fighters in Belarus, with some stationed close to the Lithuanian and Polish borders. Wagner’s presence  in Belarus has sparked alarmamong Minsk’s western and northern neighbours, including Poland and Latvia.    Poland has said it will bolster its eastern border with 4,000 troops supporting the national border agency and another 6,000 in reserve.Latvia has also increased its security presenceon its borders with Belarus. Bilotaite said that Lithuania and Polandare also discussing the possibility of completely closing their borders with Belarus. Talks on the subject will take place in Warsaw at the end of the month, she said, according to the Baltic News Service. Authorities in Belarus chided the Lithuanian decision on Wednesday. “Lithuania, by taking such decisions, purposefully and deliberately creates artificial barriers on the border to serve its political ambitions,” Belarus’s border force said on social media. It said the decision would cause traffic queues and lead to long waits at the border, calling the move an “unfriendly step” based on “far-fetched reasons”.

"Russia-Ukraine war: List of key events, day 540","As the war enters its 540th day, these are the main developments.","Here is the situation on Thursday, August 17, 2023.   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/17/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-540
"Ukraine probes Kherson defences, advances in east and south","Ukrainian reconnaissance units landed on the left bank of the Dnipro river, probing Russian defences and suggesting a new front may open.","Ukrainian forces launched a new effort to land troops on the left bank of the Dnipro river in the 77th week of the war, where floodingafter the destruction of the Kakhovka dam in Junehad made counteroffensive action impossible. Ukrainian forces also continued to make incremental territorial gains 10 weeks after launching their counteroffensive. Reports suggested that Ukraine had at least partially taken the town of Urozhaine on the Zaporizhia-Donetsk border, and advanced on Robotyne in the western Zaporizhia region. At the same time, Ukraine has withstood a majorongoing Russian offensive against the eastern town of Kupiansk, in what is seen as an apparent attempt to weaken Ukraine’s advances elsewhere. Ukraine also continued to target supply lines deep in Russian rear areas. Russia’s defence ministry claimed to have foiled a Ukrainian attack on the Kerch bridge on the night of August 11 and to have shot down 20 Ukrainian drones over Crimea.    Russian military reporters said Ukrainian reconnaissance groups were landing on the left bank of the Dnipro river west of Kozachi Laheri in the Kherson region in the days before August 11. “The village is under the control of the Russian Armed Forces. However, the presence of the Armed Forces of Ukraine west of the camps is a fact,” one reporter wrote. Russian positions were reportedly firing on the suspected locations of the Ukrainian units but were not sending ground forces. Ukrainian special forces also continued to operate near the Antonovsky bridge, the reports said, despite the fact that Russia’s defence ministry claimed to have dislodged them on July 3. Kherson is where Ukraine scored one of its largest territorial gains in September, but the area has been a largely ignored sector of the battlefield during the counteroffensive that began on June 4. That is due to the area remaining inoperable after the destruction of the Kakhovka dam on June 6, whichflooded hundreds of square kilometres on both sides of the river.    Ukraine’s general staff said Russian forces, which had been in control of the dam, destroyed its engine room in order to make it impossible for Ukrainian forces to counterattack in the area, even though this also forced Russian units to pull back from their flooded defences for a period of time. About a month later, once the flooding had subsided and the ground had dried, Ukraine reported that Russian units were returning to their positions and stepping up artillery attacks against the Ukrainian-held right bank of the river in order to deter crossings. Those artillery tactics continued last week, according to Russian reporters, but it was not clear if they had been effective. “An effective Russian mechanized counterattack could threaten this Ukrainian advance position, but it is unclear if Russian forces possess the mechanized reserves necessary to do so,” wrote the Washington-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War. If Ukraine’s creeping reclamation of the left bank succeeded in establishing a bridgehead and landing mechanised units, it could open a new front against Russian positions in the south.    Geolocated footage posted on August 12 suggested that Ukrainian forces had entered the town ofUrozhaineon the Zaporizhia-Donetsk border. Russian military reporters claimed the Vostok battalion, which was defending the area, had abandoned positions in the northern part of Urozhaine and was fighting a rear-guard action in the south. “For several days we withstood [Ukraine’s] onslaught, but somewhere there was a failure,” the battalion posted on the Telegram messaging app. “We are still fighting back, but the situation is not in our favour … it’s a matter of time.” Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister HannaMaliarconfirmed that Ukrainian forces were successful in Urozhaine and in the area of neighbouring Staromayorske, a town they recaptured onJuly 27, and were “taking hold of achieved boundaries”. “No additional forces from the reserve were involved in this sector, no new artillery battalions were deployed – the battles are being fought with the forces that are available. Let’s just say – poor forces,” wrote Alexander Khodakovsky, commander of the Vostok, wrote on Telegram. Ukrainian forces also appeared to advance in western Zaporizhia, where they approached the town of Robotyne on August 11.    Russian reporters saidChechen fighters had been redeployedto reinforce the area, something confirmed by Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov. Ukrainian forces launched a largepushtowards Robotyne on June 26, and have kept Russian forces there on the defensive for seven weeks. Russia’s reinforcement of Robotyne is unusual. Its inability to quickly move reinforcements to stressed areas of the front has been noted many times before. Russian armed forces chief Valery Gerasimov reportedly dismissed General Ivan Popov last month for complaining that his troops were overstretched and in need of rotation in western Zaporizhia. Russian forces continued an offensive towards Ukraine’s eastern city of Kupiansk, with some reports of success. Ukraine, too, claimed to have advanced three square kilometres south of Bakhmut, an area that it is trying to encircle. “Heavy battles continue in the Bakhmut direction. The enemy is trying to stop the advance of our troops and restore lost positions in the areas west of Klishchiivka, Andriivka, and Kurdyumivka,” said deputy defence minister Maliar. “In the past week, the freed territory in the Bakhmut direction has been increased by 3sq km, and the total freed area in the Bakhmut direction is 40sq km.,” Maliar wrote. Ukrainian Colonel Petro Chernyk told Ukrainian army media that the Russian offensive in Kupiansk aimed to relieve pressure on Bakhmut, where large numbers of Russian forces are committed.    “Bakhmut is in the lowlands, and all the dominant heights are under our control. So our defence forces are methodically exterminating their contingent there,” he told the ArmyInform news site. “It may come to such a scenario that a real encirclement will take place and their units will have only two options: be destroyed or surrender. If this were to happen, it would be a really serious step forward and a breakthrough in their defence and, above all, motivation,” he said. Chernyk said Russia had enough men to achieve a great numerical superiority in personnel at Kupiansk, but not the machinery. Vadym Skibitskyi, the deputy head of Ukrainian military intelligence, downplayed the Kupiansk offensive as reactive. “Operations carried out by Russia do not have a strategic military nature, they are only localised attacks,” he told the Financial Times.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/17/ukraine-probes-kherson-defences-advances-in-east-and-south
‘I was given six days to wrap up my life’: Russia expels Politico reporter,"Eva Hartog, a Dutch citizen, says she is the latest victim of Russia’s crackdown on foreign journalists.","Russia, which has cracked down on Western journalists since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine began last year, has expelled a Politico reporter, allegedly without providing a clear reason. Eva Hartog, a Dutch citizen who is also a columnist for the Dutch magazine De Groene Amsterdammer, announced the development on Wednesday. “I was informed by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs that for the first time in ten years, my visa will not be renewed. The decision was taken by the ‘competent authorities’, a term often used for the security services. Under international law, no reason or explanation was owed to me,” Hartog wrote in acolumnfor De Groene Amsterdammer. “I was given six days to wrap up my life.” Jamil Anderlini, editor of Politico Europe,said in a statementthat Hartog “has safely departed Moscow after the renewal of her visa and transfer of her press accreditation to Politico were rejected by the Russian authorities.” “We are extremely disappointed by these actions, but they do not diminish Politico’s unwavering commitment to covering the Russian government and its war in Ukraine. We hope that Eva and Politico will return to Moscow in the near future to continue our factual and nonpartisan coverage of Russian politics,” he said. Hartog was formerly the editor of The Moscow Times, a Russian news outlet which is often critical of the Kremlin and left Russia soon after the Ukraine war started. Last year, Kremlin authoritiestoughened censorship lawsand heightened a crackdown on local and foreign media. A month after invading Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law ordering the imprisonment of anyone who spreads “fake information” about the Russian military.

The Killers decried for inviting Russian fan on stage at Georgia concert,"Georgians, infuriated by Russia’s war in Ukraine and occupation of their land, say the US band’s move was naive at best.","The Killers, an alternative rock bank from the United States, has come under fire for inviting a Russian fan on stage during a performance in Georgia. On Tuesday at the Black Sea Arena in Georgia’s port city of Batumi, lead singer Brandon Flowers asked the audience: “We don’t know the etiquette of this land, but this guy’s a Russian. You OK with a Russian coming up here?” He asked the crowd to accept the fan, who played the drums for the band’s 2006 hit For Reasons Unknown, as their “brother”. People in the audience booed and some walked out. Many in Georgia view Russia with suspicion after Moscow’s troops launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February last year. Georgia gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 and has a troubled history with Russia. Its internationally recognised territories – South Ossetia and Abkhazia –  are under the Kremlin’s control. Flowers addressed the audience saying: “We all separate on the borders of our countries? Am I not your brother, being from America?” As the crowd jeered, he said he did not intend to turn the concert into an ugly event and told fans that he sees them as his “brothers and sisters”. #Russia|n drummer at The Killers concert spoke about the Russian-#Georgia|n ""friendship"", which caused public protestspic.twitter.com/bVf7TMrFFw — Mtavari TV (@MtavariChannel)August 15, 2023  “It’s the story of a good concert gone wrong in Georgia,” Nino Verdzadze, who attended the performance, told Al Jazeera. “When we started booing, the singer tried to educate us about brotherhood, saying we are all brothers and sisters. I am sorry, but as an artist, at least have the decency to know the political situation of a country you are performing in. Would you do that in Ukraine?” “And the audacity of a Russian guy to get up on stage and play in a country where he knows he is not welcomed is mind-blowing,” Verzadze said. Georgians protested inside and around the concert venue and displayed their fury on social media. “No, we are not brothers and sisters. Russia is an occupier, not a sibling,” said one post on the social media platform X, formally known as Twitter). Bands should better know not to call Georgians and Russians “brothers and sisters”, like@thekillersdid today, which resulted to the large audience booing and abandoning the concert. No, we are not brothers and sisters. Russia is an occupier, not a sibling.pic.twitter.com/Manvb8btAB — Katie Shoshiashvili (@KShoshiashvili)August 15, 2023  Since the war in Ukraine began, Georgia has witnessed an influx of Russians escaping the country. According to Georgia’s Ministry of Internal Affairs, 112,000 Russians were living in exile in the country in the Caucasus as of November. The Killers issued an apology after the concert, saying the band had “no intention to offend anyone”. “We recognise that a comment, meant to suggest that all of The Killers’ audience and fans are ‘brothers and sisters,’ could be misconstrued. We did not mean to upset anyone and we apologise,” the band said in posts on its social media platforms. pic.twitter.com/mfuAf2I8xb — The Killers (@thekillers)August 15, 2023  The Killers are on a European tour.

Latvia sends soldiers to boost security on border with Belarus,Latvia says country is facing increased ‘hybrid threats’ and blames Belarusian authorities of involvement in encouraging people to cross border.,"Latvia’s defence minister has ordered the army to help guard the country’s border with Belarus amid what was described as “hybrid threats” facing the country and as a reported 96 attempts were made bypeople to cross the borderin 24 hours. Latvian Border Guard officers have been recalled from their holidays to help with patrols, officials said on Tuesday. Latvia has “information about a possible increase in hybrid threats”, the Border Guard said in a statement on Tuesday, noting that Belarusian authorities were increasingly involved in organising the flow of people – many of whom are asylum seekers and refugees – across Latvia’s borders. Due to the threats, the Border Guard imposed a holiday ban. In addition, the border authorities requested support from the Latvian Armed Forces and police. Latvian Defence Minister Inara Murniece then ordered the army to deploy additional forces to the border, according to reports. More detailed information on the number of units deployed was not immediately available.    Latvia, which shares a border of about 172km (106 miles) with Belarus – a close ally of Russia – accuses the neighbour and its ruler, President Alexander Lukashenko, of deliberately bringing people from crisis-hit regions of the world to its border. European Union members Latvia, Lithuania and Poland have expressed increasing worry about “illegal” border crossings since hundreds of battle-hardened Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group arrived in Belarus last month at the invitation of President Lukashenko.    Lukashenko has said several times that he has been restraining Wagner fighters who want to attack Poland. Poland, which has also reported an increase in the number of mainly Middle Eastern and African people trying to cross the border in recent months, is planning to move up to10,000 additional troopsto the border with Belarus to support its border guards, Defence Minister Mariusz Blaszczak said last week. In 2021, Latvia, Poland and Lithuania faced a border crisis when thousands of people, mostly from the Middle East and Africa, sought to cross into Poland from Belarus but were pushed back.

Russian drone attack damages Ukraine Danube river port,Russian drones attacked a Ukrainian Danube river port and damaged grain silos and warehouses.,"Grain silos and warehouses were hit during successive Russian drone attackson one of the country’s Danube river ports located near the border with Romania, a Ukrainian official said. The governor of Ukraine’s Odesa region, Oleh Kiper, said on Wednesday that two waves of Russian drones had hit a river port in the south of the country. Ukraine has two main ports on the Danube – Reni and Izmail – which have become central to the country’s grain exports since Russia’s blockade of Ukraine’s Black Sea ports and Moscow’s recent withdrawal from a United Nations-backed agreement that had allowed grain stocks safe passage through the sea. “Russian terrorists attacked Odesa region twice last night with attack drones. The main target is port and grain infrastructure in the south of the region,” Kiper said on the Telegram messaging app. The governor did not specify which port was attacked. Ukraine’s presidential office said in a separate statement that there were no casualties from the attacks. Images released by the governor showed the destroyed metal walls of port storage facilities and piles of scattered grain and sunflowers. There was no immediate comment from Russia.    Social media groups monitoring the war reported hearing air defence systems firing near the Izmail and Reni ports earlier on Wednesday morning. Kiper had asked residents of the Izmail district to take shelter at about 1:30am (22:30 GMT on Tuesday) and cancelled the air raid alert one hour later. Ukraine’s Air Force said that it had destroyed 13 Russian military drones over the Odesa and Mykolaiv regions in the south of the country overnight. It was not immediately clear how many drones Russia launched to attack the Danube river ports. Ukraine’s Danube river ports accounted for approximately a quarter of all grain exports from Ukraine before Russia recently pulled out of the deal allowing safe passage for the export of Ukrainian grain via the country’s Black Sea ports. Danube river ports have since become the main export route, with grain shipments sent on barges from Ukraine across the Danube to Romania and on to its Black Sea port of Constanta for onward shipment.    A Russian attack on the Izmail port in early August sent global food prices higher. The attack by Russian drones on Ukraine’s Izmail port earlier this month was so intense that it reportedly shattered windows in Romanian villages located across the Danube,according to an Al Jazeera reporter. Russia’s defence ministry also said on Wednesday that air defence systems had destroyed three Ukrainian drones early over the country’s Kaluga region. There were no casualties and no damage in the attempted attack which took place at about 5am Moscow time (02:00 GMT), the ministry added. The Kaluga region is located southwest of Moscow.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/16/russian-drones-threaten-ukraines-key-danube-river-ports
Poland holds huge military parade as war rages in neighbouring Ukraine,Poland’s Armed Forces Day parade marked the 103rd anniversary of victory over the Soviet Union in the Battle of Warsaw.,"NATO member Poland held its biggest military parade since the Cold War in an event that marked victory over Soviet forces in 1920 and showcased the country’s state-of-the-art weaponry aswar rages in neighbouring Ukraineand defence takes centre-stage ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for October. The Armed Forces Day parade on Tuesday marked the 103rd anniversary of Poland’s victory over the Soviet Union’s Red Army in the Battle of Warsaw in 1920,  during which Polish troops defeated Bolshevik forces advancing on Europe. Russia’sfull-scale invasion of Ukrainehas made boosting the Polish armed forces a priority for the country’s ruling nationalists Law and Justice (PiS). With the country’s election campaign in full swing, the immense display of military hardware on Tuesday provided a chance for the government to promote its security credentials. “The defence of our eastern border, the border of the European Union and of NATO is today a key element of Poland’s state interest,” Poland’s President Andrzej Duda, the chief commander of the armed forces, said in his opening speech at the event.    Crowds, waving national white-and-red flags, gathered in scorching temperatures that reached 35C (95F) to see United States-made Abrams tanks, HIMARS mobile artillery systems and Patriot missile systems on parade through the streets of the capital. Also on display were F-16 fighter planes, South Korean FA-50 fighters and K9 howitzers. A US Air Force F-35 roared overhead in a sign Poland was also buying these advanced fighter planes. Polish-made equipment including Krab tracked gun howitzers and Rosomak armoured transporters were also featured. Some 2,000 troops from Poland and other NATO countries took part in the parade as well as 200 military vehicles and other equipment and almost 100 aircraft. “August 15 is not only an opportunity to pay homage to the heroes of the victorious Battle of Warsaw and to thank contemporary soldiers for defending our homeland,” Defence Minister Mariusz Blaszczak told troops and onlookers who had gathered near the Vistula River. “It is also a perfect day to show our strength, to show that we have built powerful armed forces that will effectively defend our borders without hesitation,” he said. Dziękuję, że byliście dziś z żołnierzami Wojska Polskiego!#SilnaBiałoCzerwonapic.twitter.com/VaMQ09kTAK — Mariusz Błaszczak (@mblaszczak)August 15, 2023  [Unofficial translation:Thank you for being with the soldiers of the Polish Army today!] Poland’s army hasmore than 175,000 troops, an increase from approximately 100,000 eight years ago, Duda said. He also said Poland’s defence budget this year will be a record 137 billion zlotys ($34bn) or some 4 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), the highest proportion in all of NATO. “The goal of this huge modernisation is to equip Poland’s armed forces and create such a defence system that no one ever dares attack us, that Polish soldiers will never need to fight,” Duda said, while voicing his respect for the military. Responding to criticism that Poland, a nation of some 37 million, was taking out huge loans to make the purchases, Duda said: “We cannot afford to be idle. This is why we are strengthening our armed forces here and now.” “The security of Poles is priceless,” he added. Al Jazeera’s Osama Bin Javaid, reporting from Warsaw, said that more than 100 years since the war with Soviet forces, “a shadow of war” looms once again on Poland’s borders. “And that is why the government continues to tell its people that it needs a strong, powerful army,” he said. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Poland’s conservative government has focused onstrengthening the armed forcesand spent more than $16bn on tanks, missile interceptor systems and fighter jets, many bought from the US and South Korea. Poland has a border to the east with the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad; with Lithuania, a fellow NATO member; and with Russia’s key ally Belarus as well as with Ukraine.    Military upgrades have bolstered Poland’s defence capabilities and some items replaced Soviet- and Russian-made equipment that Poland provided to Ukraine in its fight against Russia. Poland is building one of Europe’s strongest armies to beef up deterrence against potential aggressors and hasincreased the number of troopsto some 10,000 along its border with Belarus, where it has also built a wall to stop migrants arriving from that direction.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/16/poland-holds-huge-military-parade-as-war-rages-in-neighbouring-ukraine
"‘Smash the imperialists’: N Korea’s Kim, Russia’s Putin exchange letters",Leaders say the allies are ‘fully demonstrating their invincibility’ and pledge to bolster security ties as US accuses Pyongyang of supplying weapons to Moscow.,"North Korea leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin exchanged letters pledging to develop ties into what Kim called a “long-standing strategic relationship”. The letters mark the 78th anniversary of Korea’s liberation from Japan’s 1910-45 colonial rule, which is also celebrated as a national holiday in South Korea. In his letter to Putin on Tuesday, Kim said the two countries’ friendship was forged in World War II with victory over Japan and is now “fully demonstrating their invincibility and might in the struggle to smash the imperialists’ arbitrary practices and hegemony”, state news agency KCNA said. “I am firmly convinced that the friendship and solidarity … will be further developed into a long-standing strategic relationship in conformity with the demand of the new era,” Kim was quoted as saying in the letter. “The two countries will always emerge victorious, strongly supporting and cooperating with each other in the course of achieving their common goal and cause.” The United States has accused North Korea of providing weapons to Russia for its war in Ukraine, including artillery shells, shoulder-fired rockets and missiles. Pyongyang and Moscow have denied any arms transactions.    Moscow and Pyongyang – both increasingly isolated from the West and weighted with sanctions – have drawn closer since the Kremlin deployed troops to Ukraine and commenced large-scale hostilities last year. Last month, Russia’s defence minister stood shoulder to shoulder with Kim as they reviewed North Korea’s newest nuclear-capable missiles and attack drones at a military parade in the capital Pyongyang. Washington remains “deeply concerned” about North Korea aiding Russia’s war effort in Ukraine and believes Moscow is seeking to increase its cooperation with Pyongyang, US Department of State Deputy Spokesperson Vedant Patel said. “Any kind of security cooperation or arms deal between North Korea and Russia would certainly violate a series of UN Security Council resolutions,” Patel said at a regular news briefing. Putin, in his message to Kim, also pledged to bolster bilateral ties. “I am sure that we will strengthen the bilateral cooperation in all fields for the two peoples’ well-being and the firm stability and security of the Korean peninsula and the whole of Northeast Asia,”  Putin said in a statement distributed by the Kremlin. The leaders of South Korea, the US and Japan are set to discuss security cooperation over North Korea, Ukraine, and other issues at a trilateral summit on Friday at Camp David. In a separate KCNA dispatch, Pyongyang’s vice foreign minister, Kim Son Gyong, criticised the US for calling a UN Security Council meeting on North Korea’s human rights situation. The meeting, set for Thursday and requested by the US, Albania and Japan, would be the first formal public gathering of the 15-member council on the issue since 2017. But China opposed it saying it would only “intensify confrontation and antagonism”. Kim, the vice minister, said the planned meeting “openly exposed the ugly hostile face of the US filled with a sense of confrontation”, while highlighting the reality of the council that has “fallen into dysfunction under the US’s forced authority and abuse of power”.

Russia’s central bank hikes rates to 12 percent to halt rouble’s slide,The Kremlin publicly called on the central bank to tighten its monetary policy after the rouble plummeted past the 100 threshold against the US dollar.,"Russia’s central bank has hiked its key interest rate by 350 basis points to 12 percent, an emergency move to try and halt the rouble’s recent slide after a public call from the Kremlin for tighter monetary policy. The extraordinary rate meeting came on Tuesday after the rouble plummeted past the 100 threshold against the US dollar on Monday, dragged down by the effects of Western sanctions on Russia’s balance of trade and as military spending soars. The rouble pared gains after the decision to stand 0.3 percent weaker at 98.00 by 08:37 GMT, but still significantly above lows near 102 on Monday which had not been hit since the early weeks after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s economic adviser Maxim Oreshkin on Monday rebuked the central bank, blaming what he called its soft monetary policy for weakening the rouble.    Hours after Oreshkin’s words, the bank announced the emergency meeting, throwing the currency a lifeline. “Inflationary pressure is building up,” the bank said in a statement on Tuesday. “The decision is aimed at limiting price stability risks. “The pass-through of the rouble’s depreciation to prices is gaining momentum and inflation expectations are on the rise.” Central bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina has won plaudits for her handling of the economy since Russia began what it calls a “special military operation” in Ukraine, but the plunging rouble and high inflation have put her on the back foot, especially among pro-war nationalists. The Kremlin’s public criticism of her monetary policy adds further pressure as Russia heads towards a presidential election in March 2024, with consumers battling rising prices for basic goods. “While such a depreciation risks boosting inflation, it is also the signal it sends out to the Russian public about the costs of the invasion of Ukraine,” said Stuart Cole, chief macroeconomist at Equiti Capital in London. “As such, today’s decision will likely have had an element of politics behind it as well as economics.” The bank last made an emergency rate hike in late February 2022 with a rate raise to 20 percent in the immediate fallout of Russia’s despatching troops to Ukraine. The bank then steadily lowered the cost of borrowing to 7.5 percent as strong inflation pressure eased in the second half of 2022. Since its last cut in September 2022, the bank had held rates but steadily increased its hawkish rhetoric, eventually hiking by 100 basis points to 8.5 percent at its last scheduled meeting in July. The next rate decision is due on September 15. Russia saw double-digit inflation in 2022 and after a deceleration in the spring of 2023 due to that high base effect, annual inflation is now above the central bank’s 4 percent target once more and quickening. In annualised terms on a seasonally adjusted basis, current price growth over the last three months amounted to 7.6 percent on average, the bank said. The bank removed its signal that it was ready to raise rates further, said Sovcombank chief analyst Mikhail Vasilyev, interpreting that as a sign that rates have peaked. “We believe that the key rate will remain at the current 12 percent level until the end of the year,” Vasilyev said. Russia’s widening budget deficit and stark labour shortages have contributed to rising inflationary pressure this year, but the rouble’s rapid slide from about 70 against the US dollar at the start of the year to more than 100 on Monday has pushed the central bank to act. The bank, which blames the rouble’s slide on Russia’s shrinking current account surplus – down 85 percent year on year in January-July – has already tried to limit the rouble’s decline. Last week, it halted the finance ministry’s FX purchases to try to reduce volatility, a step that effectively saw Russia abandon its budget rule. Analysts widely agreed that those measures alone were too minimal in scope to significantly support the currency. “Today’s rate hike will only temporarily slow the bleeding,” said Liam Peach, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics in London. “Russia will struggle to attract capital inflows because of sanctions,” he said. “And there’s little ammunition for FX intervention – the central bank has some unfrozen renminbi assets and gold reserves, but the bar for using these is likely to be high.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/15/russias-central-bank-hikes-rates-to-12-percent-to-halt-roubles-slide
Ukraine’s western region hit by large-scale Russian air attack,"Air raid siren activated across eastern, central and western Ukraine as air force warns of Russian missile attacks.","Russia launched a large-scale air attack on Ukraine’s western region of Lviv and the northwestern region of Volyn, hitting buildings, wounding civilians and forcing evacuations, officials said. “Many missiles were shot down, but there were also hits in Lviv,” the city’s Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said on the Telegram messaging app on Tuesday morning, adding that orders were given to evacuate at least one burning apartment building. Four people required medical assistance and more than 100 residential apartments were damaged in the attack, including a kindergarten that was destroyed by falling debris from a destroyed Russian missile, the mayor said on Telegram. Earlier, the Lviv region’s governor, Maxim Kozitsky, said that “groups of Russian missiles” were headed towards the region. At least two people were also injured in a Russian air attack on the city of Lutsk, in Ukraine’s Volyn region, local authorities said on Telegram. The Volyn region, north of Lviv, also borders Poland. At least one person was also wounded as a result of a Russian attack on Ukraine’s southwestern region of Dnipropetrovsk, where an enterprise was hit and a fire broke out, Serhiy Lisak, the governor of the region said on the Telegram. Air raid alerts were issued across Ukraine for about two hours, starting at about 2am local time (23:00 GMT on Monday) on Tuesday. Local news media, The Kyiv Independent, reported earlier that the Ukrainian Air Force had warned that western regions of the country were threatened by Russian missile attacks. Explosions were also heard in the western Khmelnytskyi region of the country, according to local military administration officials, The Kyiv Independent reported. According to the Air Force, there is a threat of missile attack targeted at Ukraine's western oblasts. The air raid alert was activated nationwide. — The Kyiv Independent (@KyivIndependent)August 15, 2023  Until July, the Lviv region which is far from the front lines and which borders NATO-member Poland to its west, had been spared most Russian air attacks. But in July, seven people were killed when a missile slammed into a residential building. Ukrainian media reported that, according to preliminary information, Tuesday’s attack was the largest air assault on the Lviv region since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

China’s defence minister visits Russia and Belarus in show of support,Beijing says the visit underscores the drive by China and Russia to align foreign policies in a bid to undermine the Western-led liberal-democratic world order.,"Chinese Defence Minister Li Shangfu is visiting Russia and Belarus in a show of support as the West attempts to isolate the two allies overMoscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Li departed on Monday on the six-day trip, during which he will deliver an address at the Moscow Conference on International Security and meet defence leaders from Russia and other nations, China’s defence ministry said on its social media account, citing spokesperson Colonel Wu Qian. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is due to speak at the conference on the topic of the “Majority World countries’ search for ways to development outside Western mechanisms, including strengthening multilateral associations of a new type”, Russia’s official TASS news agency reported. Representatives from about 100 countries and eight international organisations had been invited to attend, it said. They will “discuss various aspects of security in the conditions of the establishment of a multipolar world order, ways to restore constructive international cooperation in the context of aggressive claims by Euro-Atlantic elites for world domination”, TASS said, quoting the Russian foreign ministry spokesperson. China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said Chinese and Russian leaders “have maintained strategic communication in different ways on various issues”. “The two sides had orderly high-level exchanges of views on extensive topics including bilateral cooperation and issues of joint concern,” Wang told reporters at a daily briefing. “The two countries will continue to advance the China-Russia comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership in the new era,” he said. That was an apparent reference to a joint statement issued by Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in Beijing last year just prior to Russia’s February invasion in which they declared a “no-limits friendship”. Xi, meanwhile, visited Moscow in March, sending a message to Western leaders that their efforts to isolate Moscow over the fighting in Ukraine had fallen short.    Li’s attendance at the conference further underscores the drive by China and Russia to align their foreign policies in a bid to undermine the Western-led liberal-democratic world order, despite the economic and reputational costs. That will be followed by a visit to close Russian ally Belarus, whose territory was partly used to stage last year’s invasion. While there, Li will hold meetings with Belarussian state and military leaders and visit military facilities, the ministry said. China claims to be neutral in the conflict, but has accused the United States and its allies of provoking Russia and has maintained robust economic, diplomatic and trade ties with Moscow. China has reliably backed Russia in opposing US condemnation of the Ukraine invasion in international forums, but says it will not provide arms to either side in the war.

Family killed in Russian shelling in Ukraine’s Kherson,"A couple, their 23-day-old baby and their 12-year-old son were killed in Russian attack on Shyroka Balka village in southern Ukraine.","Russian shelling has killed seven people, including a 23-day-old infant,and wounded 20others in Ukraine’s southern region of Kherson, prompting local officials to declare a day of mourning. Kyiv reclaimed part of Kherson from Russian occupation last November, but Kremlin troops have continued shelling the regional capital and areas around it from across the Dnipro River. A couple, their 23-day-old child and another man were killed in the village of Shyroka Balka, Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said on Sunday. The couple’s 12-year-old son was critically wounded and died in hospital. “The terrorists will never willingly stop killing civilians,” Klymenko wrote in a Telegram post. “The terrorists must be stopped. With force. They don’t understand anything else.” Two people, including the pastor of a church, were killed in the neighbouring village of Stanislav, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin.    Three people each in Kherson city and the town of Beryslav were wounded, according to the interior ministry, and casualties were also reported in four other settlements across the region. “Today the Kherson region shuddered from terrible news. Kherson, Veletenske, Zolota Balka, Stanislav, Komyshany, Shyroka Balka,” Prokudin wrote on Telegram, listing the settlements hit in Sunday’s attacks. Elsewhere, Ukrainian military officials said on Saturday evening that Kyiv’s forces had made progress against Russian forces in southern Ukraine, claiming some success near a key village in the Zaporizhia region. Ukraine’s General Staff said it had “partial success” around the tactically important Robotyne area in the Zaporizhia region, a key Russian stronghold that Ukraine would need to retake in order to continue pushing south towards Melitopol. “There are liberated territories. The defence forces are working,” General Oleksandr Tarnavskyi, commander of Ukraine’s southern forces, said of the southern front. Battles in recent weeks have taken place on multiple points along the more than 1,000-kilometre (620-mile) front line as Ukraine wages a counteroffensive with Western-supplied weapons and Western-trained troops against Russian forces who invaded nearly 18 months ago. Ukrainian troops have made only incremental gains since launching the counteroffensive in early June. In Russia, local officials reported on Sunday that air defence systems shot down three drones over the Belgorod region and one over the neighbouring Kursk region, both of which border Ukraine. Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian border regions are not uncommon. Drone attacks deeper inside Russian territory have been on the rise since a drone was destroyed over the Kremlin in early May. Meanwhile, a Russian warship on Sunday fired warning shots at a Palau-flagged cargo ship in the southwestern Black Sea, the first time Russia has fired on a merchant ship beyond Ukraine since exiting a landmark United Nations-brokeredgrain deallast month. According to Russia’s Defense Ministry, the Sukru Okan was heading northwards to the Ukrainian Danube River port of Izmail. “The captain of the dry-cargo ship did not respond to the request to stop for inspection for the carriage of prohibited goods. To force the ship to stop, warning fire was opened from automatic small arms from a Russian warship,” Russia’s Ministry of Defence wrote on Telegram, adding that the ship later stopped and allowed an inspection team to board. Four weeks ago, Moscow withdrew from akey export agreementthat allowed Ukraine to ship millions of tonnes of grain across the Black Sea for sale on world markets. In the wake of that withdrawal, Russia carried out repeated strikes on Ukrainian ports, including Odesa, and declared wide areas of the Black Sea unsafe for shipping.

Russia says 20 Ukrainian drones destroyed over Crimea,Russian defence ministry says 20 Ukrainian drones were shot down and electronically suppressed in early morning attack.,"Russia’s defence ministry said its forces destroyeda wave of 20 Ukrainian dronesover the Russian-annexed Crimean Peninsula. There were no casualties and no damage as a result of the attempted attack early on Saturday morning, the defence ministry said on the Telegram messaging app. Fourteen drones were destroyed by air defence systems and six were suppressed by electronic warfare, the ministry said. It was not immediately clear what was the target of the reported attacks on the peninsula. Sergei Kryuchkov, an adviser to the Russia-installed governor of Crimea, said earlier that air defence systems were engaged in repelling air attacks in different parts of the peninsula. Crimea transport authorities said on their Telegram channel that traffic on the Crimean Bridge, which links the Black Sea peninsula with the Russian region of Krasnodar, was suspended for about two hours from 01:30am local time (22:30 GMT on Friday). The reported attack on Crimea isjust the latest use by Ukraine of armed drones targeting deep inside Russiaand Russian-controlled territory, though Ukraine almost never publicly claims responsibility for such operations.    On Friday, Russian officials said thatUkrainian drones were shot down while attempting to attack Moscow– the third straight day of attempts to hit targets in the Russian capital, while Russian missiles killed an 8-year-old boy in Western Ukraine on the same day. The missile that killed the boy struck a house in Ukraine’s Ivano-Frankivsk region, about 100km (60 miles) from the Polish border, according to the office of Ukraine’s prosecutor general. The drone that was shot down near Moscow on Friday plunged onto the Karamyshevskaya Embankment, officials said, which is about 5km (3 miles) from a Moscow business district that was hit twice in previous drone incidents. Reports of drones in the area disrupted flights at two Russian airports on Friday. Flights later resumed at Vnukovo airport, one of Moscow’s busiest, and at Kaluga airport, southwest of the city. It was the third day in a row that Vnukovo airport halted flights due to drone attacks.

‘Bribery during war is treason’: Ukraine’s Zelenskyy fires army recruiters,Ukraine leader says corruption investigation exposed abuses by military officials.,"President Volodymyr Zelenskyyfired all the heads of Ukraine’s regional army recruitment centres in a sweeping anti-graft move as the war with Russia enters a critical stage. Zelenskyy announced their dismissal in Kyiv on Friday, broadening hisbattle against corruptionsince Russia invaded Ukraine 18 months ago. He said a state investigation into centres across Ukraine exposed abuses by officials ranging from illegal enrichment to transporting draft-eligible men across the border despite a wartime ban on them leaving the country. Zelenskyy also said 112 criminal cases were opened against draft board officials suspected of taking bribes and engaging in corrupt practices. He used harsh rhetoric likely to be welcomed by Ukrainians appalled by cases of wartimecorruption. “This system should be run by people who know exactly what war is and why cynicism and bribery during war is treason,” he said, adding those fired would be replaced by war veterans and soldiers wounded at the front. Zelenskyy previously fired senior officials suspected ofcorruption. That sent a signal to Western allies providing Kyiv with tens of billions of dollars in military aid that Ukraine is serious about clamping down on corruption, which has long plagued the country’s armed forces. The long-simmering issue of corruption in Ukraine’s draft system burst into the open last June when a media investigation was published about Odesa’s regional draft commissar Yevhen Borysov, igniting a scandal. The investigation reported on millions of dollars’ worth of real estate and luxury vehicles allegedly owned by Borysov’s family members in Spain. Borysov denied any wrongdoing, saying he had nothing to do with what his family bought. After the report, Ukraine’s State Bureau of Investigation and its Security Service detained dozens of draft board staff suspected of bribery and corruption.    Zelenskyy said any sacked army recruitment officers who are not being investigated should head to the front to fight for Ukraine “if they want to keep their epaulettes and prove their dignity”. “But let me emphasise: the army is not and never will be a substitute for criminal punishment. Officials who confused epaulettes with perks will definitely face trial,” he said. Zelenskyy said top General Valery Zaluzhny would be responsible for implementing Friday’s decision and new candidates for the posts would first be vetted by Ukraine’s domestic security service, the SBU. Despite recent moves againstcorruption, Ukraine still ranks 116th out of 180 countries in Transparency International’s latest Corruption Perceptions Index. A Transparency-commissioned opinion poll in June found 77 percent of Ukrainians believe corruption is among the country’s most serious problems. Zelenskyy waselected in a landslide in 2019on promises to reform the government and tackle corruption, whichplaguedthe country long before Moscow sent its troops across the border on February 24 last year.

"Nerves, apathy as Russia’s war shakes Romanian towns near Ukraine","President Iohannis has decried Russia’s recent attacks on Danube ports near Romania, but as the war drops down the news agenda, others are less concerned.","Bucharest, Romania –Last Wednesday, a Russian drone attack on Ukraine’s grain port infrastructureshookRomania, a NATO member. The force of the attack on the Izmail port, across the Danube River from the Eastern European nation, was so intense that the windows of some village homes in southeastern Romania shattered. Even though she lives far from the county of Tulcea, where the impact was felt, 28-year-old Alexandra, a paralegal from the capital Bucharest, is concerned. “We share a border with Ukraine and the conflict could expand at any moment,” she told Al Jazeera. Russia has launched several attacks on Danube ports since pulling out of the wartime Black Sea grain deal. Klaus Iohannis, the Romanian president, condemned the latest assaults as war crimes. Writing on social media, he said that Russia’s continued hammering of Ukrainian civilian infrastructure, “in the proximity of Romania”, is “unacceptable”. Alexandra’s sense of anxiety has been simmering since the war erupted in February 2022. “[I have felt] in danger, especially with all those helicopters flying everywhere. All those military operations, all the exercises, everything that Romania was doing [when the war started] felt like a red flag that something bad will happen. And I still worry.” Bogdan, a civil servant in Cluj, is worried about war rhetoric expanding into the imaginations of other countries. “Romania was also part of an empire, of several empires if we think about it. What if at this moment in time, an old empire would wake and claim that, ‘200 years ago, a part of Romania belonged to us, therefore from tomorrow, we are going to attack it’? These are outdated mentalities that are no longer related to current realities.” But not everyone is as disturbed. Shortly after the conflict began, a survey by Romania’s Center for Urban and Regional Sociology (CURS) found in April 2022 that 18 percent of Romanians were very fearful about the war while 53 percent were concerned about the cost-of-living crisis. More than a year later, in July 2023, CURS found that only 5 percent were worried about the war in Ukraine, while 67 percent listed the cost-of-living crisis and inflation as major causes of distress. Mihai Lukacs, a 42-year-old theatre director from Bucharest, said even though last week’s attacks were near the border, “it means nothing.” “I don’t feel the pressure because when it was presented in the news, it was presented like any other war that could be in Africa, in the Middle East, in Latin America. It is presented in the same way, that is, you do not make the difference in kilometres, and you do not necessarily feel that it is something close.” Lukacs, who recently directed a play about the fears of nuclear war that were awoken by Russia’s invasion, sarcastically argued that the Romanian government “did a lot” for Ukraine. “It purchased for itself submarines, aeroplanes. It paid a lot for armaments.” The “true winners” of this conflict, he said, are arms dealers. Romania’s support for Ukraine throughout the war has been consistent. The country of about 20 million people has welcomed thousands of Ukrainian refugees and sent military and humanitarian aid to Kyiv. It has also tried to help boost the transit of Ukrainian grain,despitejoining its neighbours in complaining that a glut imperilled local farmers. But as elsewhere in Europe, the conflict has often dropped down on the news agenda. “The discourse about the war in Ukraine still exists,” said Marius Ghincea, a researcher at the European University Insitute in Florence, “[but] it is no longer so prominent. “If we look at the seven o’clock newscasts, if Ukraine occupied the first part of the news, now it reaches the second part. The interest is still there, but there is also an attrition. People got used to it, it became normalised.” This “normalisation” has seen many Romanians ignore and avoid news of the war, or become altogether emotionally detached from the conflict. Alexandra said she has not “watched much about it lately”. “At first, while I was working, I had my TV on continuously listening to news from the battlefront and I was listening non-stop about Ukraine, but slowly, I got tired and followed it less,” she said. Lukacs said while Romanians struggle with inflation, the Ukraine crisis is viewed as less important. “I follow the news and there seems to be nothing new,” he said. “I can’t find any more information, there are no more burning [issues]. For now, the focus is on the budget reform … on more local topics, and problems related to serious social situations.” Looking ahead, Bogdan expected that after the war ends, Ukrainian refugees will be burdened with shock if they return “and see the destruction that was done”. Lukacs said the war will teach people about the threats of nuclear warfare, which he hopes will become “solidified in the public imagination”. But Alexandra was far from optimistic. “History repeats itself and that we have not learned anything,” she said. “In the 21st century, to have such a war and especially here on the border, it’s actually shocking.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/11/nerves-apathy-as-russias-war-shakes-romanian-towns-near-ukraine
Igor Strelkov: Moscow targets a pro-war Russian who criticised Putin,"Igor Strelkov raged against Russia’s President Vladimir Putin in the wake of the Wagner mutiny, and could now face years in jail for ‘extremism’.","Kyiv, Ukraine –Igor Strelkov, a former Russian intelligence officer whose speeches were filled with historic references, rose to fame as one of the poster boys of the “Russian Spring”. The term mirrored the “Arab Spring” uprisings of the early 2010s and was coined by Russia to describe Crimea’s annexation and Moscow-backed revolts in southeastern Ukraine in 2014. To the Kremlin’s backers, pencil-moustached Strelkov, now 52, was the perfect antidote for phantom pains about Russia’s long-gone imperial might, a reincarnated czarist-era officer whose “patriotism” justified anything he did. “I pulled the war’s trigger,” he told the nationalist Zavtra newspaper while describing how he led four dozen armed “volunteers” who crossed into Ukraine’s Donetsk region in April 2014. Strelkov boasted of ordering the torture and execution of pro-Ukrainian officials, police officers and war prisoners in Donetsk – and carried out at least one of the executions. To his supporters, his actions meant the dawn of a new page in Russia’s history. “We all remember these events, this feeling of overwhelming joy and pride for Russia,” a group that calls itself A Russian Movement to Defend Igor Strelkov said on Telegram on August 3. Nine years later, Strelkov is behind bars. But he is not imprisoned in Ukraine, where he is wanted for war crimes – nor in the Netherlands, where a court sentenced him to life in jail in 2002 for his alleged role in the downing of the Malaysian MH17 plane that killed 298 people. Strelkov, whose nom de guerre means “Shooter” and whose real last name is Girkin, was arrested in Moscow on July 23 and faces up to five years in jail for “extremism”. For thousands of Russians, similar charges translated into real prison sentences, and few doubt that Strelkov will be acquitted. Strelkov was apprehended three days after publishing an angry Telegram post in which he regretted that Russian President Vladimir Putin was a man. “I am forced to express pity that Putin is not a woman. A weak and not-so-bright woman could have talented favourites,” Strelkov wrote, referring to Russian czarinas who made their favourites key ministers or generals. Catherine the Great’s favourite Grigory Potemkin conquered Crimea in 1783 – and had fake “Potemkin villages” built in what is now southern Ukraine ahead of his crowned lover’s visit. Strelkov compared the achievements of Putin’s rule to these villages. “For 23 years, at the helm of Russia was a nobody who could fool most of Russians,” he wrote. Strelkov, however, had written similarly critical posts many times before, and analysts agree that his arrest was likely triggered by the May 26 riot of the Wagner Group private army. Going after Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin, who still has thousands of battle-tested soldiers at hand, is problematic to the Kremlin – at least for now. Meanwhile, Strelkov’s supporters will hardly take up arms to break their idol out of jail. “He was arrested because it’s easy, doesn’t cost [the Kremlin] anything. He is simply a spent force,” fugitive opposition activist Sergey Bizyukin told Al Jazeera. “He’s got no resources, no people behind him.” The arrest is also an attempt to tighten control over warmongers. Putin has for decadestoleratedovertly zealous supporters whose radical statements made him look moderate and calm. Some proposed a war on the United States; others touted concentration camps for LGBT Russians. Strelkov was part of a “hidden radical opposition that is controlled by authorities and comes up with even more monstrous scripts for the war”, Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kushch told Al Jazeera. But Strelkov crossed a line or two and will get away with a relatively small jail term, he said. Opposition leader Alexey Navalny also stood trial on “extremism” charges – but wassentencedto 19 years in jail earlier this month. Other observers warn of a new wave of purges in Russia. Since the conflict in Ukraine began in February 2022, the Kremlin has focused on persecuting anti-war activists. These days, the Kremlin is ready to squash the “right opposition” personified by Wagner’s Prigozhin, a fraction within Russia’s top brass and over-patriotic Russians who demand the war’s escalation, said Nikolay Mitrokhin of Germany’s University of Bremen. They bristle at the Kremlin and its generals for poor decision-making that led to catastrophic losses of manpower and retreats from several Ukrainian regions last year. “Girkin was one of the brightest speakers to voice such a position, plus he had a certain authority among the troops and law enforcement officers,” Mitrokhin told Al Jazeera. The Kremlin has already warned the staunchest stalwarts of a wider “total war” to curb their criticism. “The ‘total war’ supporters won’t go anywhere, but since around February their ‘systemic’ party has visibly and sharply reduced the amount of criticism of top brass,” Mitrokhin said. The irony is that Strelkov was Prigozhin’s sworn enemy. Both showered each other with obscenities after Strelkov refused to join Wagner in January. His arrest followed a complaint written by a former Wagner employee, the RBC Daily, a Russian publication, reported. Strelkov’s arrest and a campaign to silence the warmongers do not mean, however, that the Kremlin is attempting to freeze the war and negotiate a truce with Kyiv. In mid-July, Moscow suspended a “grain deal” with Kyiv that allowed Ukraine to ship wheat and other foodstuffs across the Black Sea. Russian cruise missile and drone attacks began to target Ukrainian seaports and terminals, while the Kremlin pushed for legislation toughening punishment for draft dodging. These steps manifest Putin’s determination to continue the war, and Strelkov’s arrest will prevent him from “corrupting the army with his pessimism”, Mitrokhin said. The arrest “frightened” Russian military officers, civilian officials, and turncoat Ukrainians serving the Kremlin in occupied Ukrainian territories, a Ukrainian group said. They began “taking ‘vacations’ to sit out the new ‘purges of cadres’ at home,” the National Resistance Center of Ukraine said days after Strelkov’s arrest. “Most of the Kremlin ‘curators’ [Moscow-appointed officials in occupied Ukraine] left for their homes” in Russia, it said. From reenactments to war crimes, Strelkov’s road to Donetsk began with a hobby. A historian by education and monarchist by conviction, he dabbled in reenactments of World War I battles. In the early 1990s, he joined separatists in ex-Soviet Moldova and Bosnia. He then enlisted in the Russian military, fought against separatists in Chechnya, and became an officer with the FSB, the main KGB successor once headed by Putin. Once in Ukraine, he “pioneered” the replication of war crimes committed inChechnya. “The orders by Girkin to execute POWs in 2014 were in line with informal Russian rules of engagement in Chechnya,” Ivar Dale, a senior policy adviser with the Norwegian Helsinki Committee, a rights watchdog, told Al Jazeera. “Girkin is merely the expression of a partly formalised code of Russian armed forces that violate humanitarian law,” he said. After falling out with a Kremlin-appointed official of Donetsk in late 2014, Strelkov returned to Russia. Initially supportive of Putin, he eventually switched to lambasting the Kremlin for handling the political fate of separatist “People’s Republics” of Donetsk and neighbouring Luhansk. The Kremlin and Kyiv negotiated a ceasefire and a batch of accords known as Minsk 1, 2 and 3 that envisaged the “federalisation” of Ukraine and the reintegration of separatist statelets. But Strelkov criticised the deals and predicted a full-scale war. “They will have to go to war no matter what,” he wrote in 2015 about Vladislav Surkov, the Kremlin’s chief ideologue at the time. “The war will get them out of their cozy coffins, like vampires, into God’s light.” Once the war began, he lambasted the Kremlin for not doing enough to win it. According to Dale, Strelkov should be held responsible for alleged war crimes along with Russia’s top brass and Prigozhin. “They are all responsible for terrible suffering,” he said. “They all belong in court.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/11/igor-strelkov-moscow-targets-a-pro-war-russian-who-criticised-putin

Ukraine to open ‘humanitarian corridor’ for ships stuck in Black Sea ports,Ukraine’s navy warned that military threats from Russia and sea mines remain along all shipping routes.,"Ukraine announced it will open a “humanitarian corridor” in the Black Sea to release cargo ships trapped in its ports since the outbreak of war, a new test of Russia’s de facto blockade sinceMoscow abandoned a deal last monthto let Kyiv export grain from its sea ports. At least initially, the corridor, which was announced on Thursday, would apply to vessels such as container ships that have been stuck in Ukrainian ports since the February 2022 invasion by Russian, and were not covered by the deal that opened the ports for grain shipments last year. But it could bea considerable test of Ukraine’s ability to reopen sea lanesat a time when Russia is trying to re-impose its de-facto blockade, having abandoned the grain deal last month. Shipping and insurance sources expressed concerns about safety. Local news outlet The Kyiv Independent reported thatUkraine’s navy has warned that military threats from Russia, as well as sea mines, remain along all shipping routes. “Only vessels whose owners or captains officially confirm their readiness to sail under such conditions will be allowed to pass through,” the news outlet reported on Thursday.    In a statement, the Ukrainian navy said the routes for the corridor had already been proposed by Ukraine directly to the International Maritime Organization (IMO). The routes would “primarily be used for civilian ships which have been in the Ukrainian ports of Chornomorsk, Odesa, and Pivdennyi since the beginning of the full-scale invasion by Russia on February 24, 2022”. “Vessels whose owners/captains officially confirm that they are ready to sail in the current conditions will be allowed to pass through the routes,” the navy said in the statement, adding that risks remained from mines and the military threat from Russia. “The corridor will be very transparent. We will put cameras on the ships and there will be a broadcast to show that this is purely a humanitarian mission and has no military purpose,” Oleh Chalyk, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s navy, told the Reuters news agency. There was no immediate response to requests for comment from Moscow. Shipping and insurance sources familiar with Ukraine said they were not informed about the new corridor and there were questions over its viability. It wasunlikely most ships would agree to sail at the moment, they said. “The possibility of multiple seafarer deaths [in the event of a ship being hit] has not been addressed, so this is another major question,” a shipping industry source said.    Approximately 60 commercial ships have been stuck in the Ukrainian ports since Russia’s invasion, their fates unresolved by the deal that allowed grain exports to resume in July last year. Many of the ships’ crews have been evacuated, leaving locally hired Ukrainian staff to help look after the vessels. Since abandoning the grain deal, Russia has said it will treat any ships approaching Ukrainian ports as potential military vessels, and their flag countries as combatants on the Ukrainian side. Kyiv has responded with a similar threat to ships approaching Russian or Russian-held Ukrainian ports. The United Nations has said Russia’s decision to quit the dealrisks worsening a global food crisis, hurting poor countries the worst, by keeping grain from one of the world’s biggest exporters off the market.

$24bn for Ukraine tops Biden budget request ahead of looming showdown,"Biden also requested funding for border security and disaster relief, as extreme weather continues to ravage US.","United States President Joe Biden has submitted a request for about $40bn in additional spending, with over half slated to go towards support for Ukraine. The proposal represents the first additional aid request made by the Biden administration to Congress since Republicans took control of the House of Representatives in January. In response to Russia’songoing invasionof Ukraine, the Biden administration is seeking $24bn in additional assistance for the government of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other countries facing knock-on effects from the violence. Whileaid to Ukraineenjoys strong bipartisan support, a group of Republicans on the far right have grown increasingly resistant to providing more funding. Their leverage in the House, where Republicans hold a narrow majority, could prove a stumbling block. In June, Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy told Punchbowl News that any additional Ukraine assistance requests were “not going anywhere”. Such aid would need to be allocated from the Pentagon’s discretionary spending during the annual congressional appropriations process, he said. In a letter on Thursday, White House budget director Shalanda Young urged McCarthy to swiftly follow through on the US’s “commitment to the Ukrainian peoples’ defence of their homeland and to democracy around the world”, as well as other needs.    Thursday’s request includes $13bn in emergency defence aid to Ukraine and an additional $8bn for humanitarian support through the end of the year. It comes as aUkrainian counteroffensivehas slowed: Its forces have run up against heavily mined terrain and reinforced defensive fortifications. The US has already approved four rounds of aid to Ukraine in response to Russia’s invasion, totalling about $113bn, with some of that money going towards replenishment of US military equipment that was sent to the front lines. Congress approved the latest round of aid in December, with roughly $45bn earmarked for Ukraine and NATO allies. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer applauded Biden’s latest funding request, indicating the Democrat-led chamber would back it. “The latest request from the Biden administration shows America’s continued commitment to helping Americans here at home and our friends abroad; and should send a clear signal to [Russian President] Vladimir Putin, the Chinese government, and others of America’s resolve when it comes to defending democracy around the world,” Schumer said in a statement.

Ukraine orders civilian evacuation of Kharkiv areas as Russians advance,"Ukrainian authorities order evacuation of nearly 12,000 civilians in the Kharkiv region, northeast Ukraine.","Ukrainian authorities have ordered amandatory evacuationof nearly 12,000 civilians from 37 towns and villages near the northeastern front line as Russia ramped up an assault to capture territory already once seized during the conflict. On Thursday, Ukraine urged civilians to evacuate theeastern Kharkiv region, where Russian forces reportedly are making a concerted effort to punch through the front line. The local military administration in Kharkiv’s Kupiansk district said residents must comply with the evacuation order or sign a document saying they would stay at their own risk. “Given the difficult security situation and the increasing amount of shelling by Russian terrorist forces in Kupiansk community, you have the opportunity to evacuate to a safer place,” the city administration said. “Do not neglect your safety and the safety of your loved ones,” it said. The warning came as Russia’s defence ministry announced its soldiers had “improved their position” along the front line near Kupiansk, after reporting advances earlier in the week. “In the course of offensive operations near Kupiansk, assault teams of the Western battle group improved their positions along the forward edge of the front line,” it said in a daily briefing.    Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar had said the previous day that “the intensity of combat and enemy shelling is high” in the area. Kupiansk and the surrounding areas ofUkraine’s Kharkiv regionwere recaptured by Kyiv’s forces last September, but Moscow has since pushed back in the region. The retaking of those areas strengthened Ukraine’s arguments that its troops could deliver more stinging defeats to Russia with additional armament deliveries, which its Western allies duly provided. But as Ukraine has pursued aslow-moving counteroffensivein recent weeks, Russian forces have struck back in some areas. Maliar said Russia “has formed an offensive group and is attempting to move forward” in the area in an effort to advance on Kupiansk, an important rail junction. Russia has concentrated assault troops supported by tank units, aviation and artillery in the Kupiansk area, Ukraine National Guard spokesman Ruslan Muzychuk said on national television. The Russians have formed eight so-called“Storm-Z” detachments– made up of convicts released from prison acting under military commanders – for the push, and fighting in the area was “intense”, according to Oleksandr Syrskyi, the ground forces commander of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. “Some positions are passed from hand to hand constantly,” he said. Ukrainian authorities have periodically ordered evacuations, especially of children, from areas where the fighting has intensified. Officials have previously said the evacuations are necessary to save lives and enable the Ukrainian army to better defend towns from the Russian advance.

Russia faces ‘great dilemma’ as Ukraine puts Moscow on the defensive,What happened in the 76th week of Russia’s war in Ukraine?,"Bogged down in small-scale infantry attacks and incremental advances, Ukraine sought to gain an advantage in the 76th week of the war by attacking Russian shipping at range and was accused of drone strikes targeting Moscow. Drone footage Ukraine released on August 4 showed the prow of a surface drone approaching the Olenegorsky Gornyak, a Ropucha-class Russian landing ship, before going blank at contact range. Theattackhappened just outside Novorossiysk harbour, supposedly a safe port on the eastern edge of the Black Sea, to which Russia had relocated much of its navy fleet based in Sevastopol after Ukraine sank its Black Sea flagship in May. Daylight footage showed the Olenegorsky Gornyak listing severely to port as it was towed to Novorossiysk harbour. “This poses a great dilemma for the Russians,” wrote Phillips O’Brien, professor of strategy at St Andrews University. “Do they now deploy more of their surface assets to protect tankers and the like while they transit the Black Sea – which will make those warships inviting targets? Do they try to attack the Ukrainian coast – which has already shown itself to be deadly to Russian forces?” Russia’s Ministry of Defence said it destroyed two other surface drones near Novorossiysk on the same night. Russian sources claimed a single compartment had been flooded and would be quickly repaired, but British military intelligence said the 30-40 degree list “suggests that several watertight compartments were breached”. Ukrainian military intelligence spokesperson Andriy Yusov said the damage was “very significant” and repairs would keep it out of action for a long time. Another Ukrainian surface drone struck a Russian fuel tanker the following night, damaging it severely. Russian news aggregator Baza said the drone flooded the tanker’s engine room. The Moscow Times identified it as the SIG, under sanctions for ferrying jet fuel to Russian forces in Syria. Reporters said the strike happened 27km (17 miles) south of the Kerch Bridge, which Ukraine has attacked twice before. These attacks on military and commercial shipping close to Russian mainland ports seem likely to continue. The State Hydrographic Service of Ukraine posted an open-ended notice to mariners announcing a “military threat” to a string of Russian Black Sea ports from the Kerch Strait to Sochi.    “Previous Ukrainian interdiction efforts have mainly focused on Russian military targets on land, but it seems that Ukrainian forces are now expanding their efforts to include naval targets as part of these efforts,” wrote the Washington, DC-based Institute for the Study of War, a think tank. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) likened these strikes to those that preceded a successful counteroffensive in Kharkiv and Kherson in September last year, saying Ukraine was “now striking much deeper into Russian rear areas and incorporating maritime targets”. Ukraine continued its longstanding strategy of striking Russia’s supply lines in its deep rear. For example, Ukraine used HIMARS to strike 200 Russian soldiers exposed on a Crimean beach on August 1, continuing to be vigilant for long-range possibilities of taking out Russian equipment and personnel wherever the opportunity arose Geolocated footage on August 4 showed Ukrainian drones hitting close to an oil depot in Feodosia, on the Crimean Peninsula. Russia claimed to have destroyed or intercepted all 13 Ukrainian drones. Two days later, Ukrainesucceededin severely damaging a bridge across the Henichesk Strait, connecting parts of Crimea to the mainland. And for a second time in as many weeks, Ukraine struck the nearby Chonhar Bridge, another critical supply chokepoint further south. Southern forces’ spokesperson Natalia Humenyuk said the strikes forced Russia to reroute supplies and troops through the western side of the Crimean Peninsula, making their movement more predictable and vulnerable to a strike. Russia responded with one of its largest salvoes of missiles against Ukraine in retaliation. Ukraine’s general staff said their forces shot down all 27 Shahed drones, 17 out of 20 Kalibr ship-launched cruise missiles and 13 out of 23 Kh-101/555 air-launched cruise missiles. Ukrainian air force spokesperson Yuriy Ignat said the missiles were aimed at the Starokostyantyniv airfield, where Storm Shadow cruise missiles supplied by Britain and France are reported to be stored and launched. Ignat said Ukraine has shot down some 1,200 Russian cruise missiles during the war, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said it has shot down more than 2,000 Russian drones. Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said Ukraine’s southern forces had broken through Russia’s first line of defence “in some places” and were fighting against the intermediate line. But the only specifics offered during the week suggested meagre gains. Col Mykola Urshalovych said Ukrainian forces advanced up to 650 metres (2,133 feet) into Russian defences along a 1.5km (0.93-mile) front in the Melitopol direction on August 3. The commander of Ukraine’s support forces, Brig-Gen Dmytro Gerega, said slow progress on the southern front was due to minefields, trenches, anti-tank concrete pyramids and barbed wire put up by Russian defenders. These defences were created in “strips” 10-40km (6-25 miles) long, he said, adding that Ukraine needed more de-mining equipment and additional trained personnel. Ukraine’s military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, said Russian forces had built “stationary, fully-equipped, concrete-filled defence posts” in the south, and that most progress was in the east. “Over time, the Ukrainians have been securing the advantage,” wrote Jack Watling, a defence expert at Royal United Services Institute, in a Financial Times opinion piece. “The question now is whether they can push Russian forces to breaking point.” Ukrainian forces were advancing slowly to reduce losses, Watling said, but were eroding Russian artillery by provoking it to fire, pinpointing it and destroying it. He called this a “turning point”, allowing Ukrainian troops to take Russian positions. Ukraine also pressed ahead with a diplomatic initiative to win international support and erode tolerance for Russia’s war. Ukraine has enjoyed the unstinting support of NATO, Japan, South Korea and Australia. On August 6, diplomats from 42 countries, including China and India, nominally supporters of Russia, joined a 42-nationsummit in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, to call on Russia to respect the principles of international law, including respect for Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity. The communique was a slap in the face of Vladimir Putin, who days earlier staged a summit with African leaders in St Petersburg, attempting to put momentum behind his own quest to boost Russian grain and fertiliser exports. The initiative suggested sanctions were biting into Russia’s economy. Reuters news agency reported that Russia had doubled its defence spending to $100bn this year, representing a third of the budget.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/10/ukraine-puts-russia-on-the-defensive-at-sea-strikes-logistics
"Russian occupiers rule Ukraine’s nuclear plant through force, fear: Sources","Ukrainian insiders talk to Al Jazeera about life at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, which was taken over in the early days of the war.","On the eighth day of Russia’s war in Ukraine, March 3, 2022, for the first time in history, an operating nuclear station was taken over militarily. “We couldn’t believe it,” an engineer who worked at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant told Al Jazeera. “We completely denied it, one can’t just seize a nuclear station, it’s the safest place on the planet.” On that fateful Friday, sirens that sounded like wounded animals wailed endlessly, and shells flew in the night sky. During Moscow’s efforts to seize the power station, which once produced a fifth of Ukraine’s electricity, two Russian tanks barraged the station’s walls with bloodcurdling thuds. Ukrainian security staffers yelled into a bullhorn for hours to “stop bombing a nuclear site”. A fire erupted at a station’s training centre and dark plumes of smoke blanketed the forest around the company town, Enerhodar. Horrified residents began building barricades and blocking entrances into their apartment buildings as armed fighters ran around the town of about 51,000 people. For this story, Al Jazeera interviewed two engineers and another resident who have since fled Enerhodar but regularly keep in touch with old neighbours and colleagues there. Amid the takeover, luckily, reactors and spent fuel storage were not hit and radiation levels didn’t spike because Russian “experts consulted these a******s on where they can shoot and where they can’t,” one of the engineers said, referring to pro-Russia Ukrainians. The worst he and his colleagues feared was a replay of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster. Encased in protective zirconium, uranium fuel heats the reactor and a water coolant that turns into steam, rotating turbines and generating electricity. But the casing can melt at a high temperature and start a “para-zirconium reaction” that turns each gram of water into several cubic metres of highly flammable hydrogen. “Once it has begun, you can’t stop in, it will keep heating up, will heat up itself until everything is blown to freaking pieces,” one of the engineers said. Thousands have since left Enerhodar. Al Jazeerareported on Wednesdayon the feared Chechen unit which polices the occupied Ukrainian nuclear town. The technicians that signed up to work under Russian occupiers were well rewarded, one of the engineers said, claiming those who remained received two salaries in two currencies – for doing one job for a period. The occupiers paid workers in the Russian rouble, while they still received the hryvnia from Ukraine’s state nuclear company Energoatom – until it found out about their “volunteer collaboration”, fired them, and stopped transferring wages. “They felt just like sheikhs,” one of the engineers said. “All the ladies started getting beauty injections, or doing things they could spend a lot of money on, something you could buy right now.” The words seem more apt to depict a boomtown amid a gold rush and seem light years away from the realities of the Russian-Ukrainian war – and especially the life in the potential epicentre of a nuclear disaster. In the days and weeks that followed the takeover, Moscow deployed hundreds of servicemen and Chechen national guardsmen to the station. They arrived with multiple rocket launchers, armoured vehicles, landmines and other weaponry often placed between the station’s blocks or in Soviet-era bunkers. The Russians shelled Kyiv-controlled areas with impunity knowing Ukrainian forces wouldn’t hit back. Moscow’s troops wanted to redirect the flow of electricity from Europe’s largest nuclear station to energy-starved Crimea. But their attempts failed because of damage to high-voltage lines and a Crimean electrical substation, and the complexity of synchronising the station’s output with the Russian power grid. Because of safety concerns, all of the station’s six reactors have been shut down amid the war. Most Ukrainians nationwide live in apartments with central heating systems, but as Moscowlaunchedhundreds of cruise missiles and drones this past winter on critical infrastructure, they were deprived of heat, power and water. The power deficit that led to blackouts and rationing has gradually been compensated by bolstered operations at three other nuclear power stations – and a twofold drop in Ukraine’s industrial production, Oksana Ishchuk, executive director of the Center for Global Studies Strategy XXI, a think tank in Kyiv, told Al Jazeera. In the coming winter season, when central heating will be badly needed, Ukraine will make do without the power generated by the Zaporizhzhia station, she said, but warned that “the main danger will be new Russian attacks on critical energy infrastructure facilities”. Even though the Zaporizhzhia station does not generate electricity, thousands of staffers are still needed there to monitor its infrastructure and the constant cooling of the reactors. Aided by Russian servicemen and intelligence officers, Enerhodar’s Moscow-installed “administration” tried sticks and carrots to keep 11,000 Ukrainian staffers at work. The stick involved abduction, detention and torture, according to Ukrainian officials and employees of the plant. Even so, “Ukrainians at the power station act with dignity and refuse to cooperate,” Energoatom, a state-run conglomerate in charge of Ukraine’s four nuclear power plants, said in May.    Some workers disappeared without a trace as unmarked graves began dotting the forest. Hundreds more allegedly spent days, weeks or months in overcrowded cells, sleeping in shifts. Sometimes, a detainee agreed to falsely “confess” in “directing Ukrainian artillery fire” or “spying” in return for freedom and “clemency”, one of the engineers said. “You memorise the text, then say it on camera. They release you … Then they publish [a story in pro-Kremlin media outlets] that you are so horrible, but they’re so generous.” Several, however, agreed to cooperate, because of the carrot – hefty salaries. Some justified staying by claiming they were “responsible for nuclear safety” one of the engineers said ironically, “that while they’re there, they won’t allow any lawlessness to happen, that they stayed on like heroes”. And then, there are the pro-Russian Ukrainians. The older ones feel nostalgic about their Soviet-era youth, others support the Kremlin’s narrative and hold Kyiv responsible for instigating the war. But their alleged “collaboration” goes beyond simply acceptance of Moscow’s viewpoint. “They snitch on pro-Ukrainian neighbours, report those who left [the occupied areas] so that Russians can rob their apartments or move in there,” a fugitive Enerhodar resident whose pro-Russian parents stayed behind, told Al Jazeera. Some 3,500 staffers, or about one in three, are understood to have signed contracts with the Russian state nuclear company Rosatom. Enerhodar, whose name means “a gift of energy,” used to be one of Ukraine’s most affluent towns. Residents had access to quality healthcare, enjoyed discounted trips to the seaside, attended theatre festivals and music shows, and sent their children to sports schools, including a boxing school that produced several national champions. The bravest ones even enjoyed year-round swimming in two ponds whose water cooled the reactors and never froze in winter. The ponds were home to tilapia and Asian catfish introduced for “sanitary purposes” – to eat algae and secure the cleanliness of turbines. The staffers’ incentives were not just monetary. The importance of nuclear generation rose after the 2014 separatist uprising in the Donbas that largely deprived Ukraine of access to coal for thermal stations. Two years ago, the station’s reactors were retrofitted and modernised, and churned out electricity at maximum capacity. “There was plenty of work, but we understood how important it all was,” one of the engineers said. After the Russian takeover, the town deteriorated. Residents spent hours in bread lines amid food shortages. A couple of months later, Moscow-appointed authorities began shipping substandard, pricier foodstuffs from Crimea. Local entrepreneurs also bootlegged and sold it – along with cigarettes, alcohol and medical drugs – from the boots of their cars. However, the station’s staffers who agreed to work with Rosatom had plenty of money – especially the older, retired ones who collected pensions and salaries from Kyiv and Moscow while continuing to work. Russian servicemen and separatists from Donbas allegedly drank too much, and the Moscow-installed “authorities” banned the sale of alcohol, a step that triggered the production of homemade moonshine. The new lifestyle felt like a throwback to the early 1990s when the newly independent Ukraine adapted to a market economy. Economically, the situation was even worse than the gradual separation of the rebel-controlled “People’s Republics” in the Donbas. “The turnover of goods and money is being reoriented towards Russia as there is no communication with Ukraine-controlled areas,” Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kushch told Al Jazeera. The occupation even led to small environmental disasters. Because the now shut-down reactors no longer produce warm water, the tilapia and Asian catfish in the cooling ponds died and washed ashore. Then some of the bored occupants began racing their cars on the artificial hills made of soot and other waste from Enerhodar’s thermal power station. The races cause highly toxic dust to rise and pollute the air, Enerhodar’s exiled Mayor Dmytro Orlov said in mid-July. As fighting intensifies, leaving Enerhodar for Kyiv-controlled areas has become next to impossible. Russian forces have been accused of shelling cars with civilians, blaming their deaths on Ukraine, and supplying lists of the most essential staffers to checkpoints. Al Jazeera was unable to independently verify these claims. Throughout the war, Moscow has denied targeting civilians. “The departure is maximally complicated and sometimes it’s simply impossible to leave the occupied areas, especially without money,” one of the engineers said. He managed to leave by the narrowest of margins. The man and his family drove via Russia-occupied areas, including the nearly destroyed city of Mariupol, which resembled “pure hell”. “People sit and drink coffee, the sign [on the building’s] first floor says, ‘a lounge cafeteria,’ but the rest of the building is black, and there are no more floors left,” he said describing a drive through downtown Mariupol. They entered the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don one day before theWagner mercenary companybriefly seized it on May 23. Then they drove north and west to enter the European Union after an exhausting, hours-long interrogation by Russian intelligence officers, and finally crossed back into Ukraine. Still on Energoatom’s payroll, the engineer is settling in Kyiv but is ready to leave for Enerhodar once the Russians are pushed out or retreat the way they had left several occupied areas last year. He compares his rapid-response crew to paratroopers that must move fast to retake the station and prevent a disaster. “The situation will be critical,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/10/ukrainian-insiders-on-life-in-enerhodar
"Russia says 13 Ukrainian drones downed on way to attack Sevastopol, Moscow",Drone attacks deep inside Russian territory have increased since a drone was destroyed over the Kremlin in early May.,"Russian forces took down more than a dozen Ukrainian drones flying towards the capital Moscow and the city of Sevastopol in the annexed Crimean peninsula, according to the country’s defence ministry. The attack on Moscow on Thursday is thelatest in a series of Ukrainian drone raidsdeep inside Russian territory. The defence ministry said in a statement that two drones “flying in the direction of the city of Moscow were destroyed”, while 11 others were brought down near the city of Sevastopol. Two of the Ukrainian drones were “hit by on-duty anti-aircraft defence equipment, another nine were suppressed by means of electronic warfare and crashed in the Black Sea before reaching the target”, the ministry said of the attack. There was no immediate comment from Ukraine.    Thursday’s reported drone raid comes a day after Russia said it had shot down two Ukrainian combat drones that were deployed to attack Moscow, one near a major airport to the south of the Russian capital and one to the west of the city. Ukrainian air attacks inside Russia have increased since thefirst reported drone attack against the Kremlinwas averted in early May. Civilian areas of the city were the focus of drone attacks later in May and a Moscow business district was targeted twice in three days earlier this month. The New York Times reported in May that United States intelligence agencies believe Ukrainian spies or military intelligence were behind the initial drone strike on the Kremlin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned last month that “war” was coming to Russia, with the country’s “symbolic centres and military bases” becoming targets. Russia has also launched thousands of long-range drone strikes on Ukraine throughout the war, often striking civilian targets far from the front lines. Russian drones destroyed a fuel depot in Ukraine’s western Rivne region on Thursday, regional governor Vitaliy Koval wrote on the Telegram messaging app. There were no casualties from the attack, he said.

"North Korea’s Kim Jong Un sacks top general, calls for more arms production","North Korea’s Chief of the General Staff Pak Su Il ‘dismissed’ and replaced by General Ri Yong Gil, a former defence minister.","North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has replaced his military’s top general and called for increased weapons production, expansion of military drills, and preparations for the possibility of war, the country’s state media KCNA has reported. Kim made the comments at a meeting of the Central Military Commission, which discussed plans for countermeasures to deter North Korea’s enemies, KCNA reported on Thursday without naming those enemies. South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency said on Thursday that North Korea appears“focused on flexing its military muscle”. North Korea’s top general, Chief of the General Staff Pak Su Il was also “dismissed”, KCNA reported, without elaborating. He had served in his role for about seven months. Pak was replaced by General Ri Yong Gil, who previously served as the country’s defence minister, as well as the top commander of its conventional troops. Ri had also previously served as the army chief of staff.    When Ri was replaced in 2016 his sacking and subsequent absence from official events in North Korea sparked speculation in South Korea that he had been executed. Ri reappeared a few months later when he was named to another senior post. KCNA said the agenda of Wednesday’s meeting between Kim and the Central Military Commission was “the issue of making full war preparations” including “securing more powerful strike means” to ensure “perfect military readiness for a war”. Kim called for “all the munitions industrial establishments to push ahead with the mass-production of various weapons and equipment”, the report said. “He also called for actively conducting actual war drills to efficiently operate [the] newly deployed latest weapons and equipment,” it added. According to KCNA, Kim set a target for expansion of the country’s weapons production capacity. The report did not provide details. The call for increased arms productioncomes as the United States suspects North Korea of providing weapons to Russiafor its war in Ukraine, including artillery shells, rockets and missiles. Russia and North Korea have denied those claims.    Last week, Kim visited weapons factories where he called for more missile engines, artillery and other weapons to be built. North Korea also held a large defence expo to coincide with a large military parade last month, during whichKim gave the visiting Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu a tourof the country’s newest and most advanced weaponry, including ballistic missiles and spy drones. North Korea is set to stage a militia parade on September 9 to mark the 75th anniversary of the Day of the Foundation of the Republic. The United States and South Korea are scheduled to hold their next military drills between August 21 and 24. North Korea claims such exercises are a threat to its security and are conducted in preparation for a future invasion of the north.

Conflict over clocks: China among countries where time is political,Keeping of time in Asia has often been subject more to the geopolitics of time zones than considerations of geography.,"When Nuria Shamsed* was a child, she would sit with her family in front of her grandparents’ house on the outskirts of the Western Chinese city of Kashgarin the Xinjiang regionand watch the summer sun set at about midnight. Kashgar is not located particularly far north – it is approximately at the same latitude as the Turkish capital, Ankara, where sundown is several hours earlier. But the sun goes down late in the Kashgar night because the Chinese Communist Party decided that all of China must operate in the same time zone as Beijing. This means that clocks in Kashgar are about three hours ahead of the time that the city’s geographical location actually dictates. “The midnight sunsets with my family are among the fondest memories I have from my childhood in Xinjiang,” 26-year-old Shamsed told Al Jazeera, speaking from her new home in San Diego, California, the United States. “But at the same time, the phenomenon also shows how the Chinese authorities want to control everything in Xinjiang – even our time,” she said. Time is political in China, says Yao-Yuan Yeh, who teaches Chinese history and politics at the University of St Thomas in Houston, the US, and is used to instil a sense of interconnection and control. “It is used to reinforce the official narrative of a Chinese nation united under the rule of the Communist Party,” Yeh explained. Time zones are constructs that are constantly being renegotiated, and in few places has this been more true than in China and elsewhere in Asia. For as long as 56-year-old Payzulla Zaydun can remember, time has been a point ofcontention between the Uighurs in Xinjiang and the authorities in Beijing. Xinjiang’s provincial capital, Urumqi, is geographically two hours behind Beijing, and Zaydun recounts that when he attended university in Urumqi in the 1980s and 1990s, some of his fellow Uighur students deliberately arrived two hours late for class if classes were only listed in Beijing time. “They believed that Xinjiang time should be used in Xinjiang, and there was a sense that as an Uighur there was a responsibility to uphold the local time,” Zaydun told Al Jazeera from Maryland in the US. Therefore, many local shops and businesses in Urumqi also opened and closed following a two-hour time difference in adherence to the local time over Beijing time. However, that is not the case any longer. Upholding thelocal time in Xinjiang is much more difficult today, Zaydun says. “If you openly challenge the Beijing time now, you can be prosecuted for subversion,” he says. “My elderly mother never used Beijing time before, but then a few years ago she suddenly started using Beijing time when we talked on the phone because she feared the consequences if she didn’t.”    Canadian-Uighur activist Rukiye Turdush says enforcing the use of Beijing time in Xinjiang is just one of many ways the Chinese authorities aretrying to dilute the Uighur identity, alongside means such as social control, large-scale surveillance and mass detentions. “Language, religion, culture, space and time are all elements of the Uighur national identity that the Chinese are trying to tear apart in Xinjiang,” Turdush says. Other minorities in China are also experiencing that the keeping of time is the strict preserve of China’s central authorities. “For other minorities in China’s outer regions such as the Tibetans and the Mongolians time is also controlled from Beijing,” says Yeh of the University of St Thomas. Although there are practical and economic advantages to a single time zone, the impetus for standardisation was more about a signal the Chinese Communist Party wanted to send when it came to power in 1949. “The Chinese state did not exercise full control over China before 1949, but the Communists sought to change that in order to consolidate and legitimise their power in China,” Yeh explains.    In pursuing that mission, controlling time became part of an official narrative about a China united under the party’s rule, which spurred the creation of a single time zone that temporally aligned the entire country with Beijing. Under President Xi Jinping, who came to power in 2012, there has been arenewed focus on assimilating China’s minoritiesinto the dominant Chinese culture promoted by the Communist Party. “Due to that, the authorities have taken a tougher stance against any kind of separatist notions among the minority groups, including any ideas about belonging to a separate time zone,” Yeh says. China is not the only place where time is shaped more by politics than by geography. One look at the jigsaw puzzle that constitutes the world’s distribution of time zones clearly indicates this and recent events in Ukraine are a case in point. In January, Russian authorities announced that annexed regions of Ukraine were to switch from Ukrainian time to Moscow time. In March, Greenland also moved one hour closer to Europe. Time can also be used by minorities to fight back against state power. During the 25-year-long civil war in Sri Lanka between the central government and the Tamil Tigers, the government introduced a time change that set the country’s clock back half an hour. However, the Tamil Tigers refused to recognise and implement the change in 1996 in the areas of the island under their control, meaning Sri Lanka effectively existed in two different time zones simultaneously. Just as time is used politically within the borders of nations, it is also used politically between the borders of nations. In 2015,the North Korean government announced that the country would change its time zoneby setting clocks back half an hour. The shift was defended as a belated reckoning with Japanese imperialists that had deprived Korea historically of its time – a reference to the early 20th century when the Japanese, as Korea’s then-colonial rulers, brought the country into the same time zone as the Empire of Japan. In fact, the establishment of modern timekeeping traces its roots back to the colonial era and it was the world’s colonial powers that confirmed the global time zone system during a conference in the US in 1884, according to Karl Benediktsson, who has studied the connection between politics and time zones at the University of Iceland. According to Benediktsson, it is revealing that the modern time zone system is based around the so-called Greenwich meridian, or the prime meridian, which runs through Greenwich in London. “The prime meridian could technically have been placed anywhere, but it was centred around London because Great Britain was the leading power at the time,” Benediktsson says. While the time zone system established by Britain and the other colonial powers in the 19th century remains largely the same as the system still in use today, the division of the world within time zones has changed frequently since the dismantling of Europe’s colonial empires. And the repositioning of postcolonial states on the world map has also led to some new and novel time zones. For example, when India gained independence from Britain in 1947, it abolished Mumbai time and Kolkata time and established Indian time as the country’s only official time. Nepal has aligned its own time zone with the peak of the sacred Gaurishankar Mountain, located east of Kathmandu, which places the country within a quarter-hour time zone unlike most other states that position their time keeping within a certain hourly time zone or more rarely within a half-hour time zone. The jigsaw puzzle that makes up the map of time zones across borders and around the world reflects the many political considerations and histories at play in the creation of clock time. Shifting geopolitical circumstances also means that the world’s time zone puzzle will likely continue to change into the future, according to the University of Iceland’s Benediktsson. “I usually say that time zones are social constructions,” says Benediktsson, noting that the placement of countries within certain time zones was determined by people and can therefore be changed by people over and over again. Reflecting back on her youth and observing the sun set at midnight during summer time in her native Kashgar, Nuria Shamsed believes that the enduring difference between local time and Beijing’s official time in Xinjiang demonstrates the power of people over timekeeping. Attempts to deny the observance of local time is another tool to deprive Uighurs of their identity, Shamsed says. “Time should not be a tool used by authoritarians to pursue their imperialist ambitions,” she says. “I also consider it a human rights violation when Uighurs in Xinjiang do not have a say in what time defines their lives.” *Nuria Shamsed is a pseudonym created to respect the source’s request for anonymity due to the sensitivity of the topic.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/9/conflict-over-the-clock-china-among-countries-where-time-is-political
"At least two killed in Russian attack on Zaporizhzhia city, Ukraine says",Ukrainian officials warn death toll could rise after attack on a residential area on the city in southeast Ukraine.,"At least two people have been killed and several others wounded in a Russian rocket attack on the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, which is near Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, Ukrainian officials said. A rescue operation was under way, Ukrainian President Volodymyr said on Wednesday, without providing additional information about the attack. Regional governor Yuriy Malashko initially said three people died in the attack on a residential area, but Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko later said two people died and one other person had been resuscitated. A video posted by Zelenskyy showed smoke billowing from burning and badly damaged buildings next to a church. Zaporizhzhia, an important city on the Dnipro River, lies some 44 kilometres (27 miles) from the front line.    The number of victims could rise in the attack, which damaged a residential area, Malashko said on Telegram. Earlier, Zaporizhzhia city council’s secretary, Anatoliy Kurtev, said that Russia had hit a residential area of the city. The city lies about 50km (30 miles) northeast of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which has been occupied by Russian forces since the early weeks of the war. Shelling in the plant’s surroundings has raised persistent fears of a nuclear accident. Meanwhile in Russia, an explosion on the grounds of a factory that makes optical equipment for Russia’s security forces north of Moscow killed one person, wounded 60 others and left at least eight people unaccounted for, officials said. Wednesday’s blast occurred in the Russian town of Sergiyev Posad, some 50km (30 miles) northeast of Moscow, local authorities said. Andrei Vorobyov, governor of the Moscow region, said the premises had been rented by a private firm, and that a criminal investigation had been opened into possible violations of safety procedures. He said 38 apartment blocks in the surrounding area had been damaged, along with two schools, a sports complex and a store. Russia’s TASS news agency quoted emergency services as dismissing early reports that the blast could have been caused by a drone attack, many of which have taken place in Moscow and the surrounding area in recent weeks and months, attributed by Russia to Ukraine. Footage posted on social media showed a huge column of smoke rising above the town. TASS reported that a major rescue operation involving more than 150 people was under way, citing the Emergencies Ministry as saying it had sent its lead units, “Tsentrospas” and “Leader”, to the site of the blast. Russian agencies quoted local authorities as saying a state of emergency had been declared in the area.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/9/at-least-two-killed-in-russian-attack-on-zaporizhzhia-city-ukraine-says
Russia deploys feared Chechen unit to police Ukrainian nuclear town,"Pro-Kremlin Chechen fighters accused of atrocities are trusted to work at the company town of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, Al Jazeera has learned.","All nine pumped-up men in the video sport beards, beanie hats, and khaki uniforms with no name tags. One has a walkie-talkie, another, a gun, and behind them are jeeps and silver minibuses. Most of the men are about to leave. One wants to be photographed. “Take a picture instead of filming,” he tells the invisible cameraman in Chechen. The camera turns to another man who is checking his smartphone. The cameraman says, “This comrade is staying.” The man with the phone looks like he’s in charge. He winks, smiles and responds: “I’ll be leaving later.” They look relaxed as if they are back in Chechnya, the predominantly Muslim province of 1.5 million in Russia’s North Caucasus region, where Ramzan Kadyrov, a former separatist strongman who now calls himself Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “soldier”, is their boss. The men were, however, filmed some 1,200km northwest from home, next to blocks 3,4 and 5 of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant – Europe’s largest nuclear facility – in the Russia-occupied part of southeastern Ukraine. The video was made available to Al Jazeera by a Ukrainian law enforcement agency, which identified the man with the phone as Colonel Makhmud Khusiyev, a 43-year-old former wrestler. The footage is dated January 7, but was possibly filmed earlier. The agency verified his identity by using face-recognition software to compare his high-resolution photos and videos with media reports that feature him. Khusiyev keeps a low profile. A handful ofChechen news articlesmention his participation in wrestling competitions. Khusiyev is now one of several senior officers of the Akhmat Grozny, a special forces company based in Grozny, Chechnya’s administrative capital. In the video obtained and verified by Al Jazeera, the left shoulder of Khusiyev’s uniform is adorned with the stylised image of an eagle shooting rays out of his eyes – one of thecompany’s logos. Al Jazeera also confirmed his identity, having found now-deleted dating profiles that appeared to belong to him, featuring old photos of him donning the uniform of Chechen riot police. Akhmat Grozny operates in Enerhodar, the plant’s company town whose pre-war population stood at 51,000, and has more than halved since then. According to those who live in the occupied Ukrainian nuclear city, the unit comes and goes – working in weeks-long shifts – and is responsible for policing the city and its residents, and enjoys a higher status than ethnic Russian troops. While the Chechen force has been seen near the nuclear plant, it does not appear to be involved in strategic decisions about the station. Chechen authorities do not advertise the presence of Akhmat Grozny in the area. “Official channels for the Kadyrov regime have been relatively quiet about that part of the front,” Harold Chambers, a United States-based expert on the Caucasus, told Al Jazeera. Kadyrov could view their deployment as a trump card that boosts his standing within the Kremlin hierarchy, he added. “Speaking broadly, it is not surprising that they would be assigned to such an important area, with deployments supposedly within the [station] itself, but they can doubtfully carry out whatever, specific important task they have been given,” Chambers said. Akhmat Grozny is now part of the National Guard of Russia and nominally reports to its chief, General Viktor Zolotov, Putin’s former bodyguard. But observers insist that the company, along with almost every military and police unit in Chechnya, is doggedly devoted to Kadyrov and blindly follows his orders, irrespective of their legality. “In Chechnya, this [law enforcement] structure is well-known for its crimes,” Tumso Abdurakhmanov, a fugitive Chechen video blogger and one of the most outspoken critics of Kadyrov, told Al Jazeera. In 2019, Abdurakhmanov alleged that Magomed Daudov, Kadyrov’s number two known as “Lord”, declared a vendetta on the blogger after hecriticisedAkhmad Kadyrov, Ramzan’s father. The elder Kadyrov was a separatist Muslim leader who declared a “holy war” on Russia and called on every Chechen to “kill 150 Russians each”, but later switched sides. In 2020, a Chechen man attacked Abdurakhmanov, who was living in Sweden in exile, in his apartment with a hammer. Once disarmed by Abdurakmanov, the attacker, now serving a prison sentence in the Nordic nation, confessed that he had been “sent from Grozny”. Ramzan Kadyrov, the Chechen leader, rejected allegations of involvement. A man believed to be a member of Akhmat Grozny was also allegedly involved in one of the most harrowing crimes of the continuing Russia-Ukraine war. In June 2022, a pro-Russian Telegram channel published a video purporting to show a Ukrainian serviceman, tied up and lying on the ground, being beaten and castrated with a knife. The tormentor appears to shoot the Ukrainian in the back of the head, tie the body to a car and drag it. The Insider, an independent Russian publication, along with Bellingcatclaimedthe killing took place in the Russia-occupied part of the southeastern Ukrainian region of Luhansk and that the perpetrator was one of the few Akhmat Grozny members who are not ethnic Chechens. The alleged perpetrator denied a role. Al Jazeera was unable to independently verify the video. The Akhmat Grozny unit dates back to the second Russian-Chechen war that began in 1999. It was formed by menloyal to Akhmad Kadyrov. Initially named Terek after a river that flows through Chechnya, the company enlisted many ex-rebels who were often coerced to switch sides via torture and intimidation of their families. In 2004, the force was renamed after Akhmad Kadyrov following his 2004 death in a bomb blast. For the first time in history, an operating nuclear power station has been taken over militarily. Russian forces seized the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant – that once produced up to 20 percent of Ukraine’s electricity – in early March 2022, days after Moscow’s troops launched a full-scale war on Ukraine. The station sits on the bank of the now-desiccatedNova Kakhovka damonly 200km north of energy-starved Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula Moscow annexed in 2014. Amid the war, all six of its reactors have been put into a cold shutdown to curb the risk of an explosion. Locals mockingly call the Chechen company “Ahmad Tea,” after a British brand that was popular in the former Soviet Union. Its servicemen patrol and police the company town, according to two engineers who fled Enerhodar in late May. They recognised two of them from the video obtained by Al Jazeera, but did not know their names. They said the Chechens, who constitute about one-fifth of occupying forces in Enerhodar, do not mingle professionally or socially with other Russian soldiers. The Chechens are far better dressed, equipped and armed, and look especially impeccable in comparison with Russia-backed separatists from Donetsk and Luhansk who resemble “a herd of bums,” one of the engineers told Al Jazeera. “Chechens are always by themselves, they’re the elite, a higher caste of sorts,” one of the engineers said. “Enerhodar is a resort for them.” Apart from ethnic Slavs, the ranks of Russian servicemen often include other minorities – Buddhist Kalmyks and Buryats, and Muslim Central Asians, among others. They are reportedly stationed outside Enerhodar but live in far worse conditions – administrative buildings, tents or trenches. In Enerhodar, Chechens hold sway. “Not a single [Russian soldier] saw a single Chechen in the trench next to him. Why aren’t they angry?” one of the engineers said. The privileged position of Akmat Grozny servicemen echoes Kadyrov’s high status within the Kremlin’s pecking order – and his reputation. The gruff-talking, bull-necked martial arts enthusiast has ruled Chechnya since 2007. As a result, “all the human rights you can imagine are being violated, laws are not being enacted, and if some things run according to the Russian legislation it’s just because Kadyrov said so,” Lev Ponomaryov, head of the For Human Rights, one of Russia’s oldest rights monitors, told Al Jazeera. Kadyrov has occasionally threatened Russian state officials, and at least a dozen of his political rivals and critics, including two women, have been gunned down in Chechnya, Moscow, Austria and Dubai since 2006. He denies responsibility for their killings. In mid-July, Kadyrov’s nephew, Yakub Zakriev, who already serves as Chechnya’s deputy prime minister, became the head of the Russian branch of Danone, a French multinational food company forced out of Russia. The branch had 7,500 staffers working in 13 locations, and Putin ordered the state to “take temporary control” of it. The Chechens are constantly present on the streets and roads of Enerhodar, the engineers said. They endlessly cruise the town in “Patriots,” Russian-made four-wheel drives that have become their trademark cars. “Enerhodar will hate these cars for the next 20 years because every minute and a half, wherever you are, one of these Patriots shows up,” one of the engineers said. On patrol, they check IDs and scrutinise people’s smartphones – allegedly scrolling down banking transactions to check for donations to Ukrainian armed forces, one of the engineers said. They knock on the doors of every apartment searching for arms and asking residents about their absent neighbours. If a house seems empty, they seal its doors. The first question they ask is whether residents changed theircitizenship. Pressure to get red Russian passports intensified after Kremlin-organised “referendums” in four fully or partly occupied Ukrainian regions in September “made” them part of Russia. The votes have not been recognised by Kyiv or internationally. “If one has a Russian passport, everything is fine, good job, thanks, bye. If the passport is Ukrainian – everything has to be turned upside down” in the apartment, one of the engineers said. The Chechens also ask about the residents’ relatives in the Ukrainian armed forces or on the Kyiv-controlled side. They stop and inspect cars, but tire easily and rush to gyms to work out for hours, the engineers said. A rare television report by the Russia 24 television network confirmed Akhmat Grozny’s role in Enerhodar – and showed how the servicemen try toprotect their identities. The report posted online in February claimed they “prevented several terrorist attacks” allegedly plotted by pro-Ukrainian activists, and showed the Chechens manning the streets, checking car boots and breaking open the door of a garage whose owner had left Enerhodar. “[Locals] used to fear us. Now they don’t, they come up to us, communicate, know that we came to guard them, their town,” a gun-toting, camouflage-clad Akhmat Grozny serviceman identified as “Bullet” said in Russian. But the Chechens do not appear to be involved ininterrogations and torturein “basements”, as makeshift detention centres are known in Russia-occupied areas. “This work with torture and interrogations is mostly done by FSB [intelligence officers from Russia], Russian national guardsmen who look Slavic, and partially our local polizei,” one of the engineers said, using a disparaging German term to refer to turncoat police officers from Ukraine. Hundreds of Ukrainian civilians in Russia-occupied areas have been abducted, jailed for weeks or months, and tortured,accordingto survivors, officials and rights groups. Some have been killed or gone missing. Ukraine and Russia often trade blame for imperilling the safety of the nuclear plant, with the rival sides accusing one another of nearby shelling and preparing to stage attacks. The International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, has long called for a demilitarised zone and greater access to the station. In regular updates, it says safety procedures are not being followed. In July, visiting IAEA experts found anti-personnel mines on the site’s periphery and said they heard “occasional detonations; some at a distance away from the plant, and some apparently closer”. Apart from their brand new uniforms, guns and other gear, Akhmat Grozny troops do not appear to be heavily armed in Enerhodar with equipment like armoured vehicles, tanks or artillery. “They don’t have heavy equipment as such,” one of the engineers said. They don’t seem to be part of the Russian military that makes decisions about Enerhodar and the station – which often ignores safety measures, said the engineer. “This is a key problem for the nuclear stations because the military sees it like Azovstal,” the giant steel factory in the southern city of Mariupol that withstood almost three months of Russian attacks, he said. “To them, each block is just a big concrete construction one can hide behind,” he said. The military installs fences, machine guns and other equipment at the station, completely ignoring safety instructions, he said. “The security system – technological, fireproof, radiation control – had been built for decades, and all of it is gone,” he said. Many employees, especially the ones with expertise in handling the reactors, have fled, and the station is understaffed. If one of the reactors or spent fuel storage facilities is damaged, a radioactive plume could spread over Ukraine – and some European countries. “If something serious such as [cluster munitions launched from the] Uragan [launcher] hits it, or explosives are planted, there could be an analogue of a ‘dirty’ radioactive bomb,” one of the engineers said. Members of the Akhmat Grozny joined the hundreds of Chechen servicemen and police officers who invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Before the war, the company shot what seems to be a promotional video that has not been released, but was obtained by Al Jazeera from the Ukrainian law enforcement agency. In the footage, which Al Jazeera was unable to independently verify, dozens of servicemen are seen toting guns and wearing flak jackets adorned with the “To Kyiv” sign. The video is filled with cutaways of portraits of Ramzan and Akhmat Kadyrov, and Putin. There is also religious symbolism – closeups of a mosque, an “Assalamu Alaikum” from one of the officers and the chanting of “Allahu akbar!” by the entire company. In May 2022, Ukrainian intelligence published a list of 2,425 “kadyrovtsy”, or pro-Kremlin Сhechens who “volunteered” to fight for Russia in Ukraine. Fourteen had been listed as “terrorists” in Russia before joining Kadyrov’s forces, Verstka, an independent Ukrainian magazine, discovered. One of them was Isa Dukayev,described byVerstkaas the “personal executioner” of Shamil Basayev, once a Chechen rebel known for instigating the 2004 Beslan school siege by armed fighters, in which 186 children died. As the Ukraine conflict erupted in late February last year, during their failed march on Kyiv, dozens of Chechen servicemen – not necessarily part of Akhmat Grozny – were seen chanting Sufi hymns while riding atop three dozen armoured vehicles. “I heard them. And I was killing them,” serviceman Bogdan Yavorsky told Al Jazeera last August. On February 27, 2022, he and two dozen other Ukrainians ambushed the vehicles in Bucha, a town north of Kyiv whose name is now firmly associated with Russia’s alleged war crimes. The Ukrainians immobilised the column by showering it with Molotov cocktails – and called in fighter jets that bombed it. After a series of similar incidents and heavy losses, Kadyrov reportedly ordered his men, includingAkhmat Grozny fighters, from the front lines. They, however, shot dozens of videos which were widely viewed as staged. One showed how they “stormed”a military basethat had, in fact, been abandoned by Ukrainian forces. Ukrainians disparagingly call pro-Kremlin Chechens “a TikTok army.” The term contrasts with the image Chechens gained while fighting for independence from Russia – both in the mid-1990s and in the first half of the 19th century – when czarist armies spent decades subduing the North Caucasus. “It’s a bitter irony that the reputation Chechens have of being particularly capable and fearsome fighters was gained during the years when the region fought for independence from Russia, as well as during the great Caucasian War of the 1800s,” Ivar Dale, a senior policy adviser with the Norwegian Helsinki Committee, a rights watchdog, told Al Jazeera. “Today, however, the Chechen military has been subdued and are commanded by the powers that their forefathers once tried to withstand,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/9/russia-chechen-unit-ukraine
Deal struck to send second-hand Leopard 1 tanks from Belgium to Ukraine,Tanks sold off as obsolete are now in demand as Ukraine’s Western supporters seek to provide more weapons to fight Russia.,"Dozens of second-hand Leopard 1 tanks that once belonged to Belgium have been bought by another European country for Ukrainian forces fighting Russia’s invasion, according to the arms trader who conducted the deal. TheGerman-made Leopardswere at the centre of a public spat earlier this year after Belgian Defence Minister Ludivine Dedonder said the government had explored buying back obsolete tanks to send to Ukraine but had been quoted unreasonable prices. The clash highlighted a predicament faced by Western governments trying to find weapons for Ukraine after more than a year of intense warfare – arms they discarded as obsolete are now in high demand and often owned by private companies. Freddy Versluys, CEO of defence company OIP Land Systems, said on Tuesday that he bought the old tanks from the Belgian government more than five years ago. He told Reuters he had now sold all 50 tanks to another European government, which he could not name due to a confidentiality clause. He said he also could not disclose the price he was paid for the Leopards. Several of Kyiv’s Western allies agreed earlier this year to send modern Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine as well as older Leopard 1 models. Germany’s Handelsblatt newspaper reported on Tuesday evening that arms maker Rheinmetall had acquired the Leopard 1 tanks and would prepare most of them for export to Ukraine. The company declined to comment. “The fact that they leave our company proves that we asked for a fair market price and someone was more than happy to take them,” Versluys said in a post on LinkedIn, accompanied by a picture of tanks next to a bottle of Ukrainian vodka. He said the tanks were now being transported to a factory for a substantial overhaul. Some of the tanks would be used for spare parts while others would be repaired, he said. He estimated it could be four to six months before they are on the battlefield in Ukraine. Handelsblatt said the 50 tanks would be refurbished at Rheinmetall factories in Germany and that 30 overhauled models would be made ready for export. It did not name any government as being behind the deal.    TheGerman defence ministryhad no immediate comment. The Leopard 1 was made by the German firm Krauss-Maffei, starting in the 1960s. It is lighter than the Leopard 2 and has a different type of main gun. The models sold by Versluys were last upgraded in the 1990s. A spokesperson for the Belgian defence ministry declined to comment on the sale of the tanks.

Russia shoots down two armed drones headed for Moscow,Moscow’s mayor says two ‘combat drones’ shot down in the Domodedovo and Minsk Highway areas while en route to Moscow.,"Russian air defences have shot down two armed drones headed for Moscow, the city’s mayor said, the latest in asurge of drone attackson Russia’s capital city. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said early on Wednesday that one drone was downed in the Domodedovo area on the southern outskirts of the city, while the second was shot down in the Minsk highway area, west of the capital. “Two combat drones’ attempt to fly into the city was recorded. Both were shot down by air defence,” Sobyanin said on the Telegram messaging channel, without naming an attacker. “At the moment, there is no information about victims of the fall of the wreckage,” he said, adding that emergency services were on the ground.    The Russian state-run TASS news agency also reported the attempted drone attack on Wednesday, citing the country’s defence ministry as saying that Ukrainian drones were destroyed in an attempt to attack Moscow. The drone raid was at least the third attempted attack on Moscow within a week. Ukrainiandrones were downedon Sunday in the Podolsky district on the capital’s outskirts and on Monday near the Kaluga region, according to Russian officials. Russia’s defence ministry said last week that it had shot down seven drones – also near Kaluga, which is fewer than 200km (124 miles) southwest of Moscow. Moscow has recently become an attack target of drones launched from Ukraine. On July 30, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that “war” was coming to Russia, with the country’s “symbolic centres and military bases” becoming targets.

"At least 8 killed in Russian missile attack in Pokrovsk, eastern Ukraine","Rescue workers among those killed in Russian attacks on residential structures in Pokrovsk, Ukraine says.","At least eight people have been killed and 31 others wounded after two Russian missiles hit residential buildings in the eastern Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region, Ukrainian officials said. Videos and pictures released by Ukrainian authorities on Monday showed people sorting through the rubble including at a badly damaged five-storey apartment building. An ambulance was on the scene treating the wounded. Donetsk regional Governor Pavlo Kyrylenko reported that eight people were killed in the attacks, including five civilians, two rescue workers and one member of the military, according to the Reuters news agency. Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said earlier that four civilians died in the first attack and an emergency official was killed during the second attack. Search-and-rescue operations were ongoing, Klymenko said. Ten members of the Ukrainian security services were among the 31 wounded, most of whom were civilians, officials said. The strikes damaged a hotel, residential buildings and other civilian structures, Kyrylenko said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in an online statement, accused Russia of trying to leave nothing but “broken and scorched stones” in eastern Ukraine. His remarks accompanied footage of a damaged, five-storey residential building with one floor partially destroyed. Pokrovsk had a pre-war population of about 60,000 people.    The deadly attack came just a day after officials from about 40 countries gathered in Saudi Arabia to work on a peace settlement for the war in Ukraine. Russia’s foreign ministry on Monday denounced the two-day talks in Jeddah as not having “the slightest added value” because Moscow – unlike Kyiv – had not been invited. A foreign ministry statement repeated previous assurances that Moscow is open to a diplomatic solution, on its terms, that would end the 17-month-old war and that it is ready to respond to serious proposals. The Kremlin’s demands include Kyiv recognising Russia’s annexation of four Ukrainian regions, which Russian forces at this point only partially control, and Crimea, which Moscow seized in 2014. But Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy, ruled out Moscow’s previous demands, which would give Russia time to dig in deeper in the parts of Ukraine it has occupied. He said on X, formerly known as Twitter, that Russian forces must fully withdraw from the occupied areas and there would be no compromise by Kyiv on that. Meanwhile, the Security Service of Ukraine announced on Monday that it had detained analleged Russian informantwho gathered intelligence about Zelenskyy’s trip to the southern Mykolaiv region last month. It claimed the woman “was collecting data for an air attack during Zelenskyy’s visit”.  The woman attempted to establish Zelenskyy’s route, times and visits in the region. She was detained when she tried to pass the information to the Russians, the statement said, without providing evidence. Zelenskyy has been a prime target for the Kremlin since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, when he refused to leave Kyiv as Moscow’s forces approached. He has since played a key role in rallying public morale, including via a nightly video address, and has become a recognisable face across the world as he presses allies and others to help Ukraine. Also on Monday, Russian shelling struck a nine-storey residential building in the city of Kherson, killing one person and wounding four others, according to regional Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. He said Kherson had endured a “tough night” as the Russians “covered the central part of the city with fire”. A 57-year-old woman was also killed and four people wounded in the Russian shelling of a village in the northeastern Kharkiv province, Governor Oleh Syniehubov said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/7/several-killed-in-russian-missile-attack-in-pokrovsk-eastern-ukraine
Ukraine replaces Soviet hammer and sickle with trident on Kyiv monument,"Since Russia’s war on Ukraine began, the country has accelerated moves to reclaim the nation’s identity from past ties.","The towering Mother Ukraine statue in Kyiv – one of the nation’s most recognisable landmarks – lost its hammer-and-sickle symbol on Sunday as officials replaced the Soviet-era emblem with the country’s trident coat of arms. The move is part of a wider shift to reclaim Ukraine’s cultural identity from the Communist past amid Russia’s ongoing invasion. Erected in 1981 as part of a larger complex housing the national World War II museum, the 61-metre (200-foot) Mother Ukraine monument stands on the right bank of the Dnipro River in Kyiv, facing eastward toward Moscow. Created in the image of a fearless female warrior, the statue holds up a sword and a shield. But now, instead of the hammer-and-sickle emblem, the shield features the Ukrainian tryzub, the trident that was adopted as the coat of arms of independent Ukraine on February 19, 1992. Workers began removing the old emblem in late July, but poor weather and ongoing air raids delayed the work. The completed sculpture will be officially unveiled on August 24 – Ukraine’s independence day. The revamp also coincides with a new name for the statue, which was previously known as the Motherland Monument when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union. The change is just one part of a long effort in Ukraine to erase the vestiges of Soviet and Russian influence from its public spaces – often by removing monuments and renaming streets to honour Ukrainian artists, poets and soldiers instead of Russian cultural figures. Most Soviet and Communist Party symbols were outlawed in Ukraine in 2015, but this did not include World War II monuments such as the Mother Ukraine statue. Some 85 percent of Ukrainians backed the removal of the hammer and sickle from the landmark, according to data from the country’s culture ministry released last year. For many in Ukraine, the Soviet past is synonymous with Russian imperialism, the oppression of the Ukrainian language, and the Holodomor, a man-made famine under Joseph Stalin that killed millions of Ukrainians and has been recognised as an act of genocide by both the European Parliament and the United States. The movement away from Soviet symbols has accelerated since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, where assertions of national identity have become an important show of unity as the country struggles under the horror of war. In a statement about the emblem’s removal, the website of Ukraine’s national World War II museum described the Soviet coat of arms as a symbol of a totalitarian regime that “destroyed millions of people”. “Together with the coat of arms, we’ve disposed the markers of our belonging to the ‘post-Soviet space’. We are not ‘post-‘, but sovereign, independent and free Ukraine.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/7/ukraine-replaces-soviet-hammer-and-sickle-with-trident-on-kyiv-monument

Russia unleashes strikes against Ukraine; Kyiv targets Crimea bridge,Moscow and Kyiv step up retaliatory attacks as Ukraine seeks to dislodge Russian forces in the country’s south and east.,"Russia says it shot down a drone heading for Moscow in the third such attack in a week, while officials in both Russia and Ukraine have confirmed Ukraine targeted two bridges linking Crimea to the mainland. Both countries have stepped up strikes on each other’s troops, weaponry and infrastructure as Kyiv seeks to dislodge Russian forces who have dug in across southern and eastern Ukraine since theirinvasion of the country last year. The Moscow-appointed head of Crimea said the Chonhar bridge to the peninsula, which was annexed from Ukraine by Moscow in 2014, had been damaged by a missile strike. Another of the three road links between Crimea and Russian-occupied parts of mainland Ukraine, near the town of Henichesk, was shelled and a civilian driver wounded. Traffic was halted on a third bridge linking Russia to Crimea after both sides said a Ukrainian naval drone full of explosivesstruck a Russian fuel tankerovernight Friday, the second such attack in 24 hours.    In Russia, Moscow’s Vnukovo airport suspended flights on Sunday, citing unspecified “reasons outside its control”. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said a drone had been shot down south of the capital. At least 10 Russian missiles appear to have gotten through Ukraine’s air defences in an overnight attack, which Ukraine’s air force said involved 70 air assault weapons, including cruise and hypersonic missiles as well as Iranian-made drones. Local media said a worker at a grain silo had been wounded and a rescuer died during a search operation. The attacks followed what Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said was a bomb attack on a blood transfusion centre in the town of Kupiansk, 16km (10 miles) from the front in the eastern Kharkiv region. “There are dead and wounded,” he said on his Telegram channel, describing the strike as a “war crime”. He did not say how many casualties there were or whether they were military or civilian. Despite waves of Russian air strikes, Zelenskyy said in his video address on Sunday that advanced air defence systems, including the US-built Patriot and Germany’s IRIS-T, were proving “highly effective” and had “already yielded significant results”. Zelenskyy said Ukraine shot down “a significant part” of Russia’s attacks over the past week, including 65 missiles of various kinds, and 178 assault drones,including 87 Shahed-136s.    Russia denies deliberatelytargeting civiliansor military hospitals in its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which has killed tens of thousands of people, uprooted millions, and destroyed cities. Russia’s defence ministry said it conducted successful strikes on Ukrainian air bases in the western Rivne and Khmelnytskyi regions and southern Zaporizhia region, without giving details. The deputy governor of the Khmelnytskyi region, Serhiy Tiurin, said a military airfield in Starokostiantyniv was among the targets. He said most of the missiles were shot down, but explosions damaged several houses, a cultural institution and the bus station and a fire had broken out at a grain silo. Ukraine is two months into agruelling counteroffensiveto try to push out Russian forces occupying almost one-fifth of its territory. Senior officials from some 40 countries – including the United States, China and India –held talks about the conflict in Saudi Arabiaon Saturday and Sunday, but the meeting wound up with no concrete action beyond a commitment to further consultations, according to a Saudi statement. The meeting was part of a diplomatic push by Ukraine to build support beyond its core Western backers. Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said they were productive discussions but did not give details. Russia did not attend. Its Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said the meeting reflected the West’s “doomed efforts” to mobilise developing nations behind Zelenskyy. Russian and international officials say there is no prospect of direct peace talks between Ukraine and Russia at present with the war raging.

"Three killed in air raids and shelling as Russia, Ukraine intensify attacks",Moscow’s and Kyiv’s forces escalate attacks as delegates from 40 countries meet in Saudi Arabia to discuss peace in Ukraine.,"At least three people have been killed during a night of intense air raids and shelling as Russian and Ukrainian forces escalated their attacks following astrike by Kyiv on a Russian tankerin the Black Sea. The attacks late on Saturday came as senior officials from 40 countries – including China, India and the United States – held talks in Saudi Arabia on how to end the war in Ukraine. A final declaration is not expected from the two-day meeting. Ukrainian officials blamed Russia for the attack on a blood centre in the eastern town of Kupiansk late on Saturday, while Moscow-installed officials accused Kyiv of a deadly shelling attack on the Russian-controlled Donetsk region. Two people were killed and four more were wounded in the attack on Kupiansk in the Kharkiv region, said the head of the local regional military administration, Oleh Syniehubov. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russian forces used a “guided aerial bomb” and described the attack as a “war crime”. A woman in her eighties was also killed by Ukrainian shelling in Russian-held Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, the city’s Moscow-appointed mayor Alexei Kulemzin said. The attack also set a university building in the area ablaze, according to the Moscow-installed governor of Donetsk. Russia’s emergency situations ministry said that the blaze caused the building’s roof to collapse, but that there were no casualties.    The attacks were the latest in a day that had seen Moscow’s forces hit a Ukrainian aeronautics facility and Kyiv’s forces damage a Russian tanker in the Black Sea. The aeronautics facility belonged to Motor Sich, a maker of plane and helicopter engines as well as other components. The site is located near the city of Khmelnytskyi in western Ukraine, about 300km (186 miles) southwest of Kyiv. Russia said its forces had struck military airbases in the Khmelnytskyi and Rivne regions and that “all targets were hit”. The damaged Russian tanker was a “civilian” vessel, according to officials in Moscow, who denounced Kyiv’s “terrorist attack” and pledged retaliation. Ukrainian officials, however, told the AFP news agency that the SIG tanker was transporting fuel to Russian forces fighting in their country. The attack briefly halted traffic on the Kerch Bridge which connects the Crimean Peninsula to Russia, as well as ferry transport. It was the second such raid in 24 hours. Ukraine had struck the Russian port of Novorossiysk earlier on Friday. In Saudi Arabia’s Jeddah, atwo-day summiton finding a peaceful settlement to the war kicked off without Russia’s participation, though the Kremlin has said it will keep an eye on the discussions. The meeting is part of Ukraine’s diplomatic push to build support beyond its core Western backers by reaching out to Global South countries that have been reluctant to take sides in a war that has hit the global economy. Zelenskyy, who hopes to agree on the principles for a global leaders summit he is seeking on the issue later in the year, said it would be important to hold bilateral talks on the sidelines of the Jeddah meeting. Speaking on Saturday, he acknowledged there were differences among the countries attending but said the rules-based international order must be restored. “It is very important because, in such matters as food security, the fate of millions of people in Africa, Asia and other parts of the world directly depends on how fast the world will be in implementing the Peace Formula,” he said. “I am grateful to Saudi Arabia for this platform for negotiations.” A European Union official told the Reuters news agency there would be no joint statement after the meeting, but said the Saudis would present a plan for further talks. These include setting up working groups to discuss issues such as global food security, nuclear safety and prisoner releases. The official described the talks as positive and said there was “agreement that respect of territorial integrity and [the] sovereignty of Ukraine needs to be at the heart of any peace settlement”. China, which did not attend a previous round of talks in Copenhagen, sent Special Envoy for Eurasian Affairs Li Hui to the meeting, while India sent National Security Adviser Shri Ajit Doval. China and India have kept close economic ties with Russia since the conflict began and have rejected calls to condemn Moscow for the war. Both countries have also ramped up imports of Russian oil. Of the other countries in the BRICS group with Russia, China and India, South Africa sent President Cyril Ramaphosa’s security adviser Sydney Mufamadi, while Brazil’s top foreign policy adviser, Celso Amorim, also joined by video link.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/6/blood-bank-university-hit-as-russia-ukraine-intensify-attacks
Saudi Arabia kicks off Ukraine talks that exclude Russia,Some 40 countries will attend a meeting in Jeddah to discuss a set of common principles to end the war in Ukraine.,"Saudi Arabia has kicked off a weekendsummit in Jeddah, in which senior officials from some 40 countries – but not Russia – will aim to draft key principles on how to end Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday welcomed the wide range of countries represented in the talks that began on Saturday, including developing countries hit hard by thesurge in food pricestriggered by the war. “This is very important because, on issues such as food security, the fate of millions of people in Africa, Asia and other parts of the world directly depends on how fast the world moves to implement the peace formula,” he said. Russia last month halted its participation in aUnited Nations-brokered grain dealthat enabled the shipment of Ukrainian produce through the Black Sea to parts of the world struggling with hunger. Zelenskyy said he hoped the initiative will lead to a “peace summit” of world leaders this autumn to endorse the principles, which he believed should be based on Kyiv’s 10-point formula for a settlement. Ukraine’s formula includes respect for its territorial integrity and the withdrawal of Russian troops from territories that Moscow claims to haveannexed. The forum excludes Russia, which has rejected Ukraine’s peace formula. The Kremlin said it will “keep an eye” on the meeting. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said earlier this week that Russia would “need to understand what goals are set and what will be discussed”. “Any attempt to promote a peaceful settlement deserves a positive evaluation,” he said.    Al Jazeera’s Step Vaessen, reporting from Kyiv, said the summit was important for Ukraine as it presented an opportunity to reach out to nations that have remained neutral, including India and Brazil. Especially significant was the attendance of China, a staunch Russian ally. “What Ukraine really hopes is that China will endorse Zelenskyy’s peace plan,” Vaessen added. China, which says it is a neutral party in the conflict but has been criticised by Western capitals for refusing to condemn the invasion of Ukraine, announced on Friday it would participate in the Jeddah talks by sending Special Envoy for Eurasian Affairs Li Hui. “We have many disagreements and we have heard different positions, but it is important that our principles are shared,” he said. Wang Wenbin, a spokesperson at the Chinese ministry, said in a statement that: “China is willing to work with the international community to continue to play a constructive role in promoting a political solution to the crisis in Ukraine.” Beijing and Moscow have repeatedly spoken of their strong relations since presidents Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin announced a“no limits” partnershipin February 2022, when Putin visited Beijing. However, China’s embassy in Russia on Friday criticised the treatment of five Chinese citizens who were refused entry into Russia, calling the incident inconsistent with the overall friendly relations between the two countries. Saudi Arabia said the weekend talks underscored Riyadh’s “readiness to exert its good offices to contribute to reaching a solution that will result in permanent peace,” the official Saudi Press Agency (SPA) said. Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest crude exporter which works closely with Russia on oil policy, has touted its ties to both Moscow and Kyiv and positioned itself as a possible mediator in the war. The SPA report said the kingdom anticipated the meeting would reinforce “dialogue and cooperation … to ensure a solution for the crisis through political and diplomatic means”. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom’s de facto ruler, was isolated following the2018 slaying of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi columnist for The Washington Post, at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. But the energy crisis produced by the Ukraine war elevated Saudi Arabia’s global importance, helping to facilitate his rehabilitation. Saudi Arabia has backed UN Security Council resolutions denouncing Russia’s invasion as well as its unilateral annexation of territory in eastern Ukraine. The meeting follows Ukraine-organised talks in Copenhagen in June that were designed to be informal and did not yield an official statement. In May, the kingdom hosted Zelenskyy at anArab League summit in Jeddah, where the Ukrainian president accused some Arab leaders of turning “a blind eye” to the horrors of Russia’s invasion.

Russian tanker damaged in new water drone attack,Russia’s TASS news agency says the chemical tanker SIG received a hole in the engine room near the waterline in the attack.,"A Russian tanker was damaged in a Ukrainian drone attack in the Black Sea, the second such strike in 24 hours, in the latest sign of Kyiv’s growing focus on naval warfare. Russia’s chemical tanker SIG received a hole in the engine room near the waterline, Russia’s marine agency said on Saturday. Tugboats were deployed to assist the tanker, which is under United States sanctions for assisting Russian forces in Syria, after the attack rendered it incapable of operating on its own, Russia’s TASS news agency reported. “They will deal with it now on whether to take it under tow or not,” it quoted Russia’s rescue agency as saying. “It is standing at anchor for the moment. The machine room suffered some damage, not too badly.” No casualties were reported. Russia said it would punish Ukraine for using a sea drone to attack a civilian tanker near the Kerch Strait in what it said was a “terrorist act” that threatened the lives of the crew and risked “a large-scale environmental disaster”. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Moscow would retaliate. “The Kyiv regime, meeting no condemnation from Western countries and international organisations, is actively applying new terrorist methods, this time in the waters of the Black Sea,” Zakharova said in a statement. “There can be no justification for such barbaric actions, they will not go unanswered and their authors and perpetrators will inevitably be punished.” Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev earlier on Saturday suggested Moscow would launch more strikes against Ukrainian ports in response to Kyiv’s attacks on Russian ships in the Black Sea, and threatened to hand Ukraine “an ecological catastrophe”.    Traffic on the bridge connecting the Russian-controlled Crimean peninsula with the Russian mainland stopped for several hours before resuming early on Saturday, Russia’s traffic information centre said. Russia-installed officials said explosions heard in the area were not the result of any direct attack on the strategically important bridge, which was targeted in separate attacks in July and October last year. The latest drone attack comes after Ukrainian officials said on Friday their drones hadseverely damaged the Russian warship Olenegorsky Gornyak. Moscow said it repelled an attempted attack on Novorossiysk naval base, which marked the first assault on a commercial Russian port since the war began in February last year. Analysts say Kyiv, which lost most of its navy after Moscow annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014, wants to demonstrate its ability to hit Russian naval forces far from home after being dominated on the sea front for most of the war. Ukraine’s navy is far outgunned by Russia’s naval forces, but has scored a number of significant victories through the use of unconventional weapons and tactics, including the sinking of the flagship guided missile cruiser Moskva in April 2022.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/5/russian-tanker-damaged-in-ukrainian-drone-attack-state-media-says

US urges nations to tell Russia to stop using grain as ‘blackmail’,"Blinken accuses Russia of assault on global food system, says hunger must not be ‘weaponised’ after Moscow quits grain deal.","US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has challenged all countries to tell Russia to stop using the Black Sea and Ukraine’s grain as “blackmail” and stop treating the world’s hungry and vulnerable people as leverage in its “unconscionable war”. America’s top diplomat lashed out at Russia at a United Nations Security Council meeting on Thursday for ignoring the world’s appeals andpulling outof the year-old deal that allowed Ukraine to ship more than 32 tonnes of grain from Black Sea ports to needy countries. “Hunger must not be weaponised,” he told the 15-member council. “And what has Russia’s response been to the world’s distress and outrage? Bombing Ukrainian granaries, mining port entrances, threatening to attack any vessel in the Black Sea,” Blinken said.    The grain agreement had allowed Ukrainian grain exports via the sea during the conflict between the two countries. Moscow refused to extend the deal, leading to a spike in grain prices that hit poorer countries hard. “Every member of this council, every member of the United Nations should tell Moscow enough, enough using the Black Sea as blackmail,” said Blinken. If there was a revival of the deal, the US would continue to do “whatever is necessary” to ensure Russia can freely export food if there was a revival of the deal, Blinken told reporters. The agreement, signed in July 2022 with Turkey acting as UN-backed facilitator between Ukraine and Russia, aimed to alleviate the risk of famine in the world by guaranteeing markets access to Ukrainian grain despite the war. Moscow is demanding guarantees on another agreement concerning its own exports, in particular of fertiliser components. Russia’s deputy UN Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy said Western sanctions were impacting Russian food and fertiliser exports. “Until the illegitimate obstacles artificially created by the West affecting Russian economic operators’ ability to supply agricultural products are eliminated, it will hardly be possible to restore the normal functioning of supply chains and address other global food security issues,” he told the debate. Russian drones on Wednesday damaged infrastructure at a Ukrainian port on the Danube, as Moscow targeted facilities vital for grain shipments from Ukraine following the collapse of the deal. Blinken said grain prices had increased by more than eight percent around the world since Russia’s withdrawal.

Ukraine keeps up Russia pressure as drone raids intensify psychological war,New series of suspected Ukrainian drone attacks inside Russia this week deepen a sense of insecurity that has been slowly building up since Kremlin assault in May.,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned this week that war is coming to Russia afterkamikaze drone attackstargeted skyscrapers in Moscow’s financial district, as his country’s forces continued to score small-scale territorial successes against Russian troops in Ukraine’s east and south. Here is a round-up of the main battlefield events during the75th week of the war. On July 30, a suspected Ukrainian long-range drone hit a Moscow high-rise building that houses the Ministry of Digital Development, the Economy Ministry and the Ministry of Industrial Development, responsible for military industry. Two days later, another pair of drones was shot down outside Moscow, but a third made it through to the city where it was intercepted by electronic jammers and crashed into a skyscraper, damaging the facade. The attacks came just days after a previous drone raid on the centre of the Russian capital. While there were no reported casualties, the latest attacks sustained a psychological impact of insecurity that Ukraine has been slowly building up since May 3, when it first attacked the Kremlin with a drone. Although Ukraine did not directly claim responsibility, Zelenskyysaidin his nightly video address, “The war is gradually returning to the territory of Russia – to its symbolic centres and military bases, and this is an inevitable, natural and absolutely fair process.”    A New York Times analysis of photographs posted by Ukrainian online users showed that Ukraine was using three new types of domestically developed drones. The first type named Bober, meaning beaver, has a double set of wings and a rear propeller. The second one, the UJ22 Airborne, looks like an aeroplane and has a forward propeller. The name of the third design that looked like a flying wing with a forward propeller was not known. Ukraine has promised not to use Western-supplied weapons on Russian soil. The effect of domestic production has been to increase attacks inside Russia. A Times video analysis of such drone attacks showed that Ukraine launched twice as many kamikaze drones into Russia between May and July as it did in all of 2022. Ukraine reportedly plans to invest $1bn in drone warfare this year, 10 times what it spent last year. “The only advantage the Russians have is mass … Massed infantry and massed artillery,” Frederick B Hodges, a former NATO supreme allied commander Europe, told the newspaper. The attacks inside Russia, he said, “create prioritisation problems for the Russian high command”, by creating uncertainty about where Ukraine would strike next. The drone attacks came after Russian President Vladimir Putin said anAfrican initiativecould be a basis for peace but claimed that Ukrainian attacks made a cessation of hostilities “virtually impossible”. His remarks came afterhosting African leaders in St Petersburgfor the second Russia-Africa summit. The plan, whose details have not been made public, reportedly includes a series of possible steps to defuse the war, including a Russian troop pullback, removal of Russian tactical nuclear weapons from neighbouring Belarus and the suspension of an International Criminal Courtarrest warrant against Putin. Meanwhile in Ukraine’s east, a total of 170 battles took place in the previous week, according to comments made on July 31 by Hanna Maliar, the Ukrainian deputy defence minister. In Bakhmut alone, where Ukraine’s forces are conducting a flanking manoeuvre north and south of the city, Ukrainian forces had reclaimed two square kilometers (0.8sq miles) of land, Maliar said. That brought the total land recaptured there during Ukraine’s counteroffensive, now in its ninth week, to 37sq km (14sq miles).  Ukrainian forces made marginal advances on Klishchiivka, one of their targets on the southern side of Bakhmut, on July 27. A few days later, they were well inside the settlement’s western outskirts. They also advanced on July 28 to the outskirts of Kurdyumivka, a few kilometres to the south of Klishchiivka. Eastern forces spokesman Serhiy Cherevaty described Ukraine’s tactics on the southern flank of Bahmut as “small but confident steps – [preserving] our personnel as much as possible”. “We are gradually moving forward on the southern flank in the Bakhmut area,” added Maliar. “The enemy is trying with all his might to stop us.” On July 27, Zelenskyy posted footage showing Ukrainian troops announcing they had captured Staromayorske, a village with a pre-war population of fewer than a thousand people on the Zaporizhia-Donetsk border. Ukraine’s forces in the region are driving towards the Russian-occupied port city of Berdyansk, on the Sea of Azov. The Russian defence ministry did not comment about the situation on Staromayorske, but some Russian reporters acknowledged its capture. Ukraine’s general staff said Russian losses there were so heavy that the 247th Guards Air Assault Regiment disobeyed orders to enter the battle. Geolocated footage also showed Ukrainian forces advancing towards the nearby town of Pryyutne on July 29.    Ukrainian forces are active on at least five major southern fronts, and Maliar said on July 31 that altogether they had reclaimed 12.6sq km (4.86sq miles) during the previous week, bringing total gains there to 205sq km (79sq miles) since the start of the counteroffensive. In western Zaporizhia, Ukraine made territorial gains after launching a surprise mechanised assault on July 26 south of Orikhiv. Geolocated footage on the day showed its forces had advanced towards Robotyne, but Putin attempted to recast the initiative as a failure, saying Ukraine had lost 39 armoured vehicles. Russian reporters tried to support the president’s narrative, using footage showing a Russian tank purportedly defeating an entire Ukrainian company, but the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) identified this as footage from two months earlier. “Russian sources have previously recirculated old footage to support claims that Ukrainian forces are suffering significant armoured vehicle losses,” said the ISW. The Robotyne offensive seems to have misled some Western observers. Anonymous US officials dialled back comments they had made to the New York Times on July 26, in which they had said that the main Ukrainian counteroffensive was under way, and that “most of the units trained and equipped by the West for that purpose had been committed”. The newspaper estimated that Ukraine had trained 63,000 reservists for its counteroffensive, a figure quoted by other experts as well. An official told the newspaper, “It remains to be seen what they’ll truly commit, when they’ll commit it and where.”    Explaining the stagnation of the front line, journalist Samuel G Friedman wrote on Substack, “After the early June setback, the Ukrainians went back to relying, as so often the case in this war, on actions more at platoon and company level, with small groups of soldiers rushing from one tree line to another, or creeping forward to clear a way through a minefield … Russian forces have adapted in a similar way, if only to prevent Ukrainians consolidating even limited gains … This explains the ebb and flow of the front lines of recent weeks as small settlements regularly change hands.” He added: “What is important is that Ukraine keeps the initiative, and does not exhaust itself so much that the Russians get a chance to regroup and counterattack. Outside cheerleaders and anxious supporters should not force the pace.” In addition to wearing down Russian front-line troops with relentless assaults, Ukraine also continued to cut off their ammunition supply lines. On July 29, it struck the Chonhar bridge in Zaporizhia, a supply chokepoint. That overland route had become an important backup after Ukraine damaged the Kerch Bridge across the Black Sea to Crimea in July. The Kerch Bridge will be under repair until November. Vladimir Saldo, head of the Russian-installed administration in occupied Kherson province, said Ukrainian forces had launched a dozen Storm Shadow missiles at the Chonhar bridge, but also repeated the Russian defence ministry’s claim to have intercepted them all. Southern forces spokesperson Natalia Humenyuk said the attack on the Chonhar Bridge had forced the Russian side to use alternative resupply routes for their troops, including roads through Zaporizhia and increased numbers of ships across the Kerch Strait. “There is still high activity of enemy tactical aircraft in the southeast direction. This indicates that the enemy is gathering intelligence and may be preparing for powerful attacks,” she added.

Wagner mercenaries seek to destabilise NATO’s eastern flank: Polish PM,Poland’s prime minister raises alert for possible provocations by the Russian private armed force present in Belarus.,"Fighters from Russia’s privateWagnermercenary force are being moved close toNATO’s eastern flankto destabilise the military alliance, according to Poland’s prime minister. Wagner soldiers have begun training with the Belarus national army, prompting Poland to start moving more than 1,000 troops closer to the border. On Tuesday, it accused Belarus of violating its air space with military helicopters. “We need to be aware that the number of provocations will rise,” Mateusz Morawiecki said on Thursday after meeting Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda in eastern Poland. “The Wagner group is extremely dangerous and they are being moved to the eastern flank to destabilise it.” The politicians met in the Suwalki Gap, a sparsely populated but strategically important area of Polish territory between Belarus and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad that joins the Baltic states to other NATO members. Nauseda said the number of Wagner fighters in Belarus could be higher than 4,000. “We must not only talk about measures at the national level but also … what should be done if this situation becomes even more complicated, including the closure of the border with Belarus,” Nauseda said. “This should be done in a coordinated manner between Poland, Lithuania and Latvia.”    Laurynas Kasciunas, chairman of the Seimas National Security and Defence Committee, told reporters that Wagner mercenaries in Belarus with their current combat power do not pose a conventional military threat. Whether they pose a great threat in the future, he said, “will depend on further scenarios, how they are armed and their orders”. In Poland, some critics of the government believe that it is overstating the threat in order to present itself as tough on security before parliamentary elections later this year. Polish opposition leader Donald Tusk accused the ruling party of using Wagner to stoke fear before the elections, something the party has denied. The United States ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said earlier this week that the US views the Wagner Group – whose forces have fought in Ukraine and also operated inAfrica– as a threat. “We have seen their malign efforts on the continent of Africa. So we certainly worry that this group, at the behest of the Russian government – because they do not work independently of the Russian government – is a threat to all of us,” Thomas-Greenfield told reporters on Monday. “And we have to ensure that the message is clear that any attacks by the Wagner Group will be seen as an attack by the Russian government.” Belarus allowed Russian President Vladimir Putin to use its territory as a launch pad for the Ukraine invasion but has not committed its own troops to the war.

Another 20 years for jailed Russian critic Navalny? What you should know,"Navalny, a constant thorn in Putin’s side, could be handed yet another lengthy sentence on Friday on a slew of extremism charges.","A Russian court is set to deliver its verdict in the trial of jailed opposition leader Alexey Navalny, who is facing a slew of new extremism charges which could keep him imprisoned for decades. The decision will be announced on Friday at a closed-door trial and comes after prosecutors requested a 20-year prison sentence for Navalny last month. In hisclosing statements, 47-year-old Navalny condemned Russia’s war in Ukraine. “[Russia is] floundering in a pool of either mud or blood, with broken bones, with a poor and robbed population, and around it lie tens of thousands of people killed in the most stupid and senseless war of the 21st century,” he said. On the eve of the verdict, he said he expects a “Stalinist” sentence of about 18 years. Navalny, a former lawyer, rose to prominence more than 10 years ago by exposing large-scale corruption in his country. He returned to Russia in 2021 from Germany, where he was treated for what tests showed was an attempt to poison him with a nerve agent in Siberia. The Putin critic has been accused of fraud – stealing donations to fund an outlawed presidential bid – and charges including extremism. He is already serving an 11 and a half-year prison sentence in a maximum security penal colony in Melekhovo, 250km (150 miles) east of Moscow. Russia has banned Navalny’s campaign organisation as part of a crackdown on dissent that started well before the conflict in Ukraine. Earlier this year, two heads of his regional offices, Lilia Chanysheva and Vadim Ostanin, were sentenced to seven and a half and nine years respectively on extremism charges – which Navalny slammed as an “absurd” tactic to “further silence him”. Russian prosecutors provided him with 3,828 pages describing all the crimes he is alleged to have committed while in prison, he said. “Although it’s clear from the size of the tomes that I am a sophisticated and persistent criminal, it’s impossible to find out what exactly I am accused of,” he said. Throughout his political career and activism, he has dismissed all of the charges against him. While human rights groups and Western governments view Navalny as a political prisoner, the Kremlin has repeatedly denied trying to kill him and often declines to comment on his imprisonment, saying it is a “case for the courts”. Russian President Vladimir Putin does not utter the name of his nemesis and has in the past referred to him as “this gentleman” and the “Berlin patient”. In 2021, in an interview with NBC, he called Navalny “this person” and when pressed to mention his name, said “I don’t care”. In April, Russian investigators linked Navalny to the death of the popular military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky, who was killed by a bomb in a Saint Petersburg cafe. Navalny’s allies have denied any connection. The jailed anti-corruption crusader remains imprisoned in a tiny one-person cell, also called a “punishment cell”, in the penal colony. He will continue to spend his last days before the verdict in this cell. His associates and supporters have accused prison authorities of failing to provide him with proper medical assistance and voiced concern about his failing health. But even from prison, Navalny continues communicating with his supporters. He has built a huge social media following by producing videos providing evidence of systemic corruption among Russian elites, and communicates about his life in prison with the help of his team. “Someday I’m gonna do a top list of my best moments in prison,” he joked in a statement on social media last month.

NATO allies beef up security due to Wagner troops’ presence in Belarus,"Poland, Lithuania and Latvia have grown increasingly worried since the Russian mercenaries arrived in Belarus.","NATO allies located along the alliance’s eastern front are growing increasingly worried about the presence of Russia-linkedWagner Group mercenariesin Belarus, where some have been deployed since a short-lived mutiny in Russia in June. Poland, Lithuania and Latvia – members of NATO and the European Union which border Belarus – had already been on alert since large numbers of migrants and refugees began arriving at their borders from Belarus two years ago. They have accused Belarus’s President Alexander Lukashenko, an ally of Russia, of opening the migration route in an act of “hybrid warfare” aimed at creating instability in the West. Now concerns have grown further since the Wagner troops began arriving in Belarus after their short-lived mutiny in Russia. Poland’s Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on the weekend that about 100 Wagner fighters in Belarus had approached the border with Poland, specifically a strategically sensitive area known as the Suwalki Gap. “Now the situation becomes even more dangerous,” Morawiecki told reporters. “This is certainly a step towards a further hybrid attack on Polish territory.” An incident on Tuesday added further to the concerns, with two Belarusian helicopters entering Polish air space at low altitude while carrying out exercises.    Poland’s defence ministry reported that incident to NATO, which said on Wednesday that it is monitoring the situation. “NATO is closely tracking the situation along its eastern borders, including yesterday’s incident where two Belarusian military helicopters briefly crossed into Polish airspace at low altitude,” a NATO official said on customary condition of anonymity. “We are in close contact with the Polish authorities on this matter, and we will continue to do what is necessary to ensure all alliance territory remains secure,” the official added. Poland, Lithuania and Latvia say they have been deploying more troops and equipment to their borders. Guntis Pujats, head of Latvia’s State Border Guard, told Latvian media on Wednesday that security risks in the immediate vicinity of the Belarus border have been high since Minsk started using migrants as a tool of “hybrid warfare”, and that the risks have grown with the arrival of the Wagner Group. He said border guards have started training a special task force in response.    Lithuania’s President Gitanas Nauseda said this week that it would be tempting for the Wagner Group to use its presence near the Lithuanian border “for various provocations”. “So I think the threat is serious,” Nauseda said during a visit on Monday to a site on the border with Belarus where seven Lithuanian officers were murdered by Soviet paratroopers 32 years ago. Others have suggested that one should not overestimate the capabilities of the armed group. Laurynas Kasciunas, chairman of the Seimas National Security and Defence Committee, told reporters that Wagner mercenaries in Belarus with their current combat power do not pose a conventional military threat. Whether they pose a great threat in the future, he said, “will depend on further scenarios, how they are armed and their orders”. In Poland, some critics of the government believe that it is overstating the threat in order to present itself as tough on security before parliamentary elections this fall.    Polish opposition leader Donald Tusk accused the ruling party of using Wagner to stoke fear before the elections, something the party has denied. Some Poles also faulted the authorities for refusing to initially acknowledge that the Belarusian helicopters had entered Poland’s airspace on Tuesday. At first, the military insisted that the Belarusian aircraft had not entered Poland. But after local residents posted photos on social media of aircraft with Belarusian insignia several kilometres from the border inside Poland, the defence ministry put out a statement saying it was true. The US ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said earlier this week that the United States views the Wagner Group – whose forces have fought in Ukraine and also operated in Africa – as a threat. “We have seen their malign efforts on the continent of Africa. So we certainly worry that this group, at the behest of the Russian government – because they do not work independently of the Russian government – is a threat to all of us,” Thomas-Greenfield told reporters on Monday. “And we have to ensure that the message is clear that any attacks by the Wagner Group will be seen as an attack by the Russian government.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/2/nato-allies-beef-up-security-due-to-wagner-troops-presence-in-belarus
"Russia targets Odesa port, angering Ukraine and nearby Romania","Several tonnes of grain are damaged following the drone attack on Izmail, which is part of Ukraine’s Danube infrastructure.","Ukraine’s coastal region of Odesa was rattled by Russian drones which hit grain storage facilities in the south of the region, according to authorities in Kyiv. The grain port of Izmail, an inland port across the Danube River from NATO-member Romania, was the main target of Moscow’s drone attack. About 40,000 tonnes of grain destined for African nations, China and Israel were damaged, officials said, “As a result of the attack, fires broke out at the facilities of the port and industrial infrastructure of the region, and an elevator was damaged,” Odesa region Governor Oleh Kiper said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app. Russia's continued attacks against the Ukrainian🇺🇦 civilian infrastructure on#Danube, in the proximity of Romania🇷🇴, are unacceptable. These are war crimes and they further affect UA's capacity to transfer their food products towards those in need in the world. — Klaus Iohannis (@KlausIohannis)August 2, 2023  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of waging an attack on “global food security”. “Unfortunately, there are damages,” Zelenskyy said on Telegram. “The most significant ones are in the south of the country. Russian terrorists have once again attacked ports, grain, global food security,” he added. Romanian President Klaus Iohannis called Russia’s repeated attacks on Ukraine’s Danube infrastructure near Romania “unacceptable” war crimes. Russian drones targeted Ukraine’s Danube ports last month, destroying a grain warehouse, according to authorities in Kyiv. Kyiv has accused Moscow of stepping up attacks on Ukrainian grain infrastructure by hitting 26 port facilities, five civilian vessels and 180,000 tonnes of grain in nine days of attacks, since quitting theBlack Sea grain deal. Moscow hassaidit will treat ships in the Black Sea heading to Ukrainian seaports, “as potential military targets”. Turkey and the UN brokered the wartime grain deal between Kyiv and Moscow last year, to ensure that Ukrainian ships could safely export agricultural products to the rest of the world from Black Sea ports. Moscow backed out of the agreement last month. The Kremlin has said recent attacks are in retaliation for a Ukrainian attack on a bridge to Crimea, but officials in Kyiv aw them as Russia signalling its intention to reimpose a blockade in the Black Sea. The United Nations has warned that Moscow’s termination of the Black Sea grain deal could trigger a potential food crisis in some of the poorest countries in the world. In a call with Russia’s President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday, Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he will continue in efforts to reinstate the deal which he described as “a bridge of peace” and urged Moscow to de-escalate the war. The Kremlin said Putin reiterated Russia’s conditions for rejoining the grain deal, which included improving the terms for its food and fertiliser exports.

‘Evocative of genocide’: Ukrainians held by Russians allege torture,"A team of legal experts says half of those detained in Kherson were subject to sexual violence, beatings and other abuse.","Nearly half of a group of Ukrainians detained by Russian occupiers in Kherson and interviewed by a team of international experts have reported widespread torture, including sexual violence. The Mobile Justice Team, which was established by the human rights law firm Global Rights Compliance, said on Wednesday that of 320 cases examined in the southern Ukrainian province, many detainees recounted suffocation, waterboarding, severe beatings and threats of rape. Evidence pointed to one Russian soldier subjecting at least 17 people to genital mutilation, the report said. At least one person was allegedly forced to witness the rape of another detainee by a foreign object covered in a condom. Those held included current and former Ukrainian military personnel, activists, teachers, medical workers, law enforcement officers and community leaders. “More than 35 torture chambers” have been identified in parts of Kherson once occupied by Russia, the report said, adding that the process of identifying those behind the crimes was “well under way”. The abuse suggests that Russian President Vladimir Putin plans to extinguish Ukrainian identity, said Wayne Jordash, managing partner and co-founder of Global Rights Compliance. The range of crimes committed are “evocative of genocide”, he added. “The pattern that we are observing is consistent with a cynical and calculated plan to humiliate and terrorise millions of Ukrainian citizens in order to subjugate them to the diktat of the Kremlin.” Some of those held said they were also forced to learn the Russian national anthem and pro-Moscow slogans. The Mobile Justice Team was set up in October to support Ukraine in identifying and prosecuting conflict-related sexual violence. It includes leading foreign and Ukrainian prosecutors, investigators, lawyers and analysts. Anna Mykytenko, a senior legal adviser focused on Ukraine at Global Rights Compliance, said: “What we are witnessing in Kherson is just the tip of the iceberg in Putin’s barbaric plan to obliterate an entire population.” “Justice will be served for Ukrainian survivors as we continue our mission to identify and hold perpetrators accountable. Impunity is not an option.” Kherson was one of the first regions to be captured by Russian soldiers when it launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February last year. Ukrainian troops liberated large parts of it in November, after which investigations began. Rape and sexual violence as a tactic during conflict has been recognised as “a war crime, a crime against humanity, or a constitutive act with respect to genocide”, by the United Nations. In an opening statement at an International Criminal Court training event in March, Ukrainian Prosecutor General Andrii Kostyn said that “for victims and witnesses, the psychological assistance is no less important than the legal aid.” “Empathy is something that can and should be developed by all participants in criminal proceedings,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/2/evocative-of-genocide-ukrainians-held-by-russians-allege-torture

"Russia responsible for Niger coup, says top Ukrainian official","The Russian Wagner Group’s boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has hailed the coup as a move towards independence from the West.","A Ukrainian official has accused Moscow of orchestrating thecoup in Niger, referring to alleged involvement as a “standard Russian tactic”. Last Wednesday, President Mohamed Bazoum and his democratically elected government were removed by military leaders in the seventh military coup the country has seen in less than three years. On Tuesday, Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, said Russia was behind the shocking takeover. On the social media outlet X (formally known as Twitter), Podolyak wrote, “It is now absolutely clear that Russia is behind the so-called ‘military coup’ in Niger. It is a standard Russian tactic: to divert attention, seize the moment and expand the conflict.” “Russia has a global scenario for provoking instability to undermine the global security order,” he said. “Its time to draw the right conclusion: only the removal of [Russian President] Putin’s clan and sending Russia to the political rebirth can guarantee the inviolability of rules and stability to the world.” The Kremlin said on Monday that the situation in Niger was “cause for serious concern” after the coup that was condemned by much of the world but welcomed by Wagner mercenary boss Yevgeny Prigozhin, who has extensive interests in Africa. In a call with reporters, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia called for all sides in Niger to show restraint, and for the fastest possible return to legal order. Russia’s Wagner Group has not claimed responsibility for the coup but Prigozhin has hailed the military takeover. Prigozhin’s fighters have played a significant role in many African states, to the dismay of the West, and most recently arrived in the Central African Republic (CAR) ahead of a constitutional referendum. In a recent audio message on the Wagner Group’s Telegram, Prigozhin said what happened in Niger “is nothing other than the struggle of the people of Niger with their colonisers. With colonisers who are trying to foist their rules of life on them and their conditions and keep them in the state that Africa was in hundreds of years ago.” He added: “Today, this is effectively gaining their independence. The rest will without doubt depend on the citizens of Niger and how effective governance will be, but the main thing is this: they have got rid of the colonisers.”   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/1/russia-responsible-for-niger-coup-says-top-ukrainian-official
"Russia intercepts new wave of drones over Moscow, office tower hit",Moscow mayor says the office building damaged was the same one hit in an attack on Sunday.,"Russian forces have again downed several drones over the city of Moscow, according to officials, with one of the intercepted aircraft damaging the same office tower that was hit in anattack over the weekend. The Russian defence ministry, in a message on Telegram on Tuesday, said its anti-aircraft units had “thwarted a terrorist attack by the Kyiv regime” and downed two drones in the suburbs west of the city centre. But another drone, having been “hit by radio-electronic equipment and, having run out of control, crashed on the territory of the complex of non-residential buildings” in Moscow City, the ministry said, referring to a business district in the capital. Earlier, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said the building hit on Tuesday was the same one struck in a drone attack on Sunday. “One flew into the same tower at the Moskva City complex hit previously. The facade has been damaged on the 21st floor. Glazing was destroyed over 150 square metres,” he said. “There is no information on casualties,” he added. The attack on Tuesday is the latest in a series of recent drone assaults – including on the Kremlin and Russian towns near the border with Ukraine – that Moscow has blamed on Kyiv. The Russian defence ministry said on Sunday it had intercepted three Ukrainian drones over the capital in an attack that damaged two buildings and briefly suspended operations at the Vnukovo International Airport. The Kremlin said that assault was “an act of desperation” by Kyiv due to setbacks on the battlefield in Ukraine. Ukrainian officials did not acknowledge the attacks but President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in the aftermath that the conflict was now coming to Russia. “Gradually, the war is returning to the territory of Russia – to its symbolic centres and military bases, and this is an inevitable, natural and absolutely fair process,” he said. “Ukraine is getting stronger,” he added. Ukraine began its long-awaited counteroffensive in June but has made modest advances in the face of stiff resistance from Russian forces on the front line.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/1/russian-forces-down-new-wave-drones-over-moscow-office-tower-hit

China imposes drone export curbs amid US tech tensions,Beijing says it wants to safeguard ‘national security and interests’ amid escalating tension with Washington.,"China has announced export controls on some drones and drone-related equipment, saying it wants to safeguard “national security and interests” amid escalating tension with the United States over access to technology. The restrictions on equipment announced on Monday, including some drone engines, lasers, communication equipment and anti-drone systems, would take effect on September 1, the commerce ministry said. The controls would also affect some consumer drones, and no civilian drones could be exported for military purposes, a ministry spokesperson said in a statement. “China’s modest expansion of the scope of its drone control this time is an important measure to demonstrate our stance as a responsible major country, to implement global security initiatives, and maintain world peace,” the spokesperson said. Authorities had notified relevant countries and regions, the spokesperson said. China has a big drone manufacturing industry and exports to several markets including the US. US lawmakers have said more than 50 percent of drones sold in the US are made by China-based company DJI, and they are the most popular drone used by public safety agencies. DJI said on Monday it always strictly complied with and enforced laws and regulations of the countries or regions in which it operates, including China’s export control regulatory requirements. “We have never designed and manufactured products and equipment for military use, nor have we ever marketed or sold our products for use in military conflicts or wars in any country,” the drone maker added. A German retailer in March 2022 accused DJI of leaking data on Ukrainian military positions to Russia, which the company rejected as “utterly false”. China’s commerce ministry said in April this year that Western media were spreading “unfounded accusations” that it was exporting drones to the battlefield in Ukraine, adding the reports were an attempt to “smear” Chinese firms and it would continue to strengthen export controls on drones. The drone export curbs come after China announced export controls of some metals widely used in chipmaking last month, following moves by Washington to restrict China’s access to key technologies, such aschipmakingequipment. Beijing on Friday defended itsdealingswith Russia as “normal economic and trade cooperation” after a US intelligence report released last week said Beijing possibly provided equipment used in Ukraine that might have military applications.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/31/china-imposes-drone-export-curbs-amid-us-tech-tensions
"Russia’s Wagner likely to need new recruits in future, says Prigozhin","After being pictured in St Petersburg having led a mutiny, the mercenary boss says Russia may need an emboldened force.","Russia’s Wagner Group is currently not recruiting fighters but is likely to do so in future, according to a message published on Monday which appears to be from the mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin. The future of Wagner and Prigozhin has been unclear since he led a brief mutiny against the Russian defence establishment in late June and the Kremlin said he and some of his fighters – who have fought in some of the fiercest battles of the Ukraine war – would leave for Belarus. Despite that, Prigozhin attended a meeting with President Vladimir Putin five days after the mutiny and was photographed last week in St Petersburg, where Putin was hosting African leaders. “Today we are defining our next tasks, whose outline is becoming clearer and clearer. Undoubtedly, these are tasks that will be carried out in the name of the greatness of Russia,” a voice sounding like Prigozhin’s said in the message. It was published on Grey Zone, a Telegram channel affiliated with Wagner. After the June mutiny, the Kremlin said Wagner fighters who had not taken part would transfer to the regular army, signing contracts with the Defence Ministry. Apparently alluding to this, Prigozhin said in the voice message that “unfortunately” some of his fighters had moved to other “power structures”, but he said they were looking to return. “As long as we don’t experience a shortage in personnel, we don’t plan to carry out a new recruitment,” Prigozhin said. “However, we will be extremely grateful to you if you keep in touch with us, and as soon as the motherland needs to create a new group that will be able to protect the interests of our country, we will certainly start recruiting.” Since the mutiny, some Wagner fighters have moved to Belarus and started training its army. In comments published last week, Prigozhin also said Wagner was ready to further increase its presence in Africa. Its role there, especially in support of governments in Mali and the Central African Republic, is a source of concern for Western governments. The United States has accused it of committing widespread atrocities and imposed sanctions on it as a criminal organisation. Prigozhin says it works in line with the laws of the countries where it operates. Last week he welcomed a military coup in the West African state of Niger and made what appeared to be a pitch for his fighters to bring order there.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/31/russias-wagner-likely-to-need-new-recruits-in-future-says-prigozhin
"Saudi Arabia to host Ukraine peace talks, top official says","Ukrainian official says Saudi Arabia gathering will discuss Kyiv’s 10-point peace formula, which calls for departure of all Russian troops.","Saudi Arabia is preparing to host a summit to discussUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s planfor peace in his country amid the ongoing Russian invasion, according to a senior official in Kyiv. Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, said on Sunday that officials from several countries would take part in the Saudi Arabian summit but did not say when or in which city the meeting will be held. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the summit citing “diplomats involved in the discussion”, said the talks would take place on August 5 and 6, in the city of Jeddah, with some 30 countries attending. The Journal said Ukrainian and Western officials hope the efforts could culminate in a peace summit later this year where global leaders would sign up to shared principles for resolving the war. Yermak, writing on Telegram, said discussions will take place on the Ukrainian Peace Formula, which “contains 10 fundamental points, the implementation of which will not only ensure peace for Ukraine, but also create mechanisms to counter future conflicts in the world”. Previously, Ukraine has described the 10-point peace formula as including the restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity, the withdrawal of Russian troops, the release of all prisoners, a tribunal for those responsible for the aggression and security guarantees for Ukraine. “We are deeply convinced that the Ukrainian peace plan should be taken as a basis, because the war is taking place on our land,” Yermak said. His statement described the 10 points as being “discussed individually and in groups with representatives of more than 50 countries on an almost weekly basis”.    He added that the meeting in Saudi Arabia follows on from a gathering of senior officials in the Danish capital, Copenhagen, in late June. Countries that attended the initial meeting included Brazil, India, Turkey and South Africa. For the Jeddah summit, the 30 invitees include Chile, Egypt, the European Union, Indonesia, Mexico, Poland, the United Kingdom, the United States and Zambia, according to the Journal. Russia has not been invited, according to the Associated Press news agency. Citing an unnamed official, the AP said a high-level official from US President Joe Biden’s administration is also expected to attend the event. There was no immediate comment from Saudi Arabia. The planned summit there follows a visit by Zelenskyy to an Arab League summit in Jeddah in May to press those nations to back Kyiv. Arab nations have largely remained neutral since Russia launched the full-scale war on Ukraine in February 2022, in part over their military and economic ties to Moscow. Saudi Arabia also has maintained a close relationship with Russia as part of the OPEC+ group. But hosting such talks helps raise the profile of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has sought to reach a detente with Iran and push for peace in the kingdom’s years-long war in Yemen. For Ukraine, the talks coincide with its efforts to beef up its security posture. Yermak also said on Sunday that Ukraine will begin talks with the US next week on a bilateral agreement on security guarantees. He said the talks stem from a declaration by leaders of the Group of 7 nations earlier this month laying the groundwork for each nation to negotiate agreements to help Ukraine bolster its military. Yermak said Ukraine is looking for “specific and long-term commitments that will ensure Ukraine’s ability to win now and deter Russian aggression in the future”. US officials had not confirmed the negotiations. Other peace plans have meanwhile been floated amid the war. Russian President Vladimir Putin finished meetings in Saint Petersburg over the weekend withAfrican leaders about their own proposed plan. China and Pope Francis have also been working separately on their own.

"Ukrainian drone attack on Moscow wounds one, shuts airport","Russian officials and media say ‘attempted terrorist attack’ on the capital city wounded one person, damaged two buildings and briefly suspended traffic at the Vnukovo airport.","Russian forces have intercepted three Ukrainian drones over Moscow, in an attack that wounded one person, damaged two office blocks and briefly forced the closure of an airport in the city. The Russian defence ministry blamed the assault early on Sunday on Kyiv, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy – without commenting on the drone attacks – warned that “war was coming to the territory of Russia”. In a message on Telegram, the defence ministry said: “The Kyiv regime’s attempted terrorist attack with unmanned aerial vehicles on objects in the city of Moscow was thwarted”. It said one of the drones was shot down, while two, “suppressed by electronic warfare”, crashed into a building complex in Moscow’s business district. Photos from the site of the crash showed the facade of a skyscraper damaged on one floor. The capital’s Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said the attack “insignificantly damaged” the outsides of two buildings in the Moscow City district. A security guard was wounded, Russia’s state news agency TASS reported, citing emergency officials. No flights went into or out of the Vnukovo airport on the southern outskirts of the city for about an hour, according to TASS, and the air space over Moscow and the outlying regions was temporarily closed for any aircraft. Those restrictions have since been lifted. Authorities also briefly closed a street for traffic near the site of the crash in the Moscow City area.    President Vladimir Putin, who was in his hometown of Saint Petersburg at the time of the attempted attacks for meetings with African leaders and a naval celebration, was briefed, his spokesman said. Separately, the Russian defence ministry said it had also successfully thwarted an overnight attack on the Ukrainian Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, by 25 Ukrainian drones that Moscow said it had either shot down or forced to crash. Nobody had been hurt and no damage was caused in the Crimea, it added. Ukrainian officials did not acknowledge the attacks but Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address: “Gradually, the war is returning to the territory of Russia – to its symbolic centres and military bases, and this is an inevitable, natural and absolutely fair process.” “Ukraine is getting stronger,” he added. A Ukrainian air force spokesman also did not claim responsibility but said the Russian people were seeing the consequences of Russia’s war in Ukraine. “All of the people who think the war ‘doesn’t concern them’ – it’s already touching them,” spokesperson Yurii Ihnat told journalists. “There’s already a certain mood in Russia: that something is flying in, and loudly,” he said. “There’s no discussion of peace or calm in the Russian interior any more. They got what they wanted.” The attack was thefourth such attemptat a strike on Moscow this month and the third this week, heightening concerns about the capital’s vulnerability to attacks as Russia’s war in Ukraine drags into its 18th month. It also comes several weeks into a Ukrainian counteroffensive to take back territory of the country captured by Russia since Moscow launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022. Russia’s foreign ministry has said such attacks “would not be possible without the help provided to the Kyiv regime by the United States and its NATO allies”. On the other side of the border, Ukrainian authorities said at least two civilians were killed and five others wounded in a Russian missile attack on the northeastern city of Sumy. “On the evening of July 29, an enemy missile hit an educational institution. Law enforcement officers are working at the scene, recording the effects,” the national police forces said on Telegram. According to public broadcaster Suspilne, the building was destroyed in an explosion at about 8:00pm local time (17:00 GMT).",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/30/russia-thwarts-ukrainian-drone-attack-on-moscow
Putin says African proposal could be basis for peace in Ukraine,"The proposal floats a series of possible steps to defuse the conflict, including a Russian troop pullback from Ukraine.","Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that aninitiative presented by African leaderscould be a basis for peace in Moscow’s war on Ukraine but claimed that attacks from Kyiv made a cessation of hostilities “virtually impossible”. The Russian leader made the comments in Moscow on Saturday aftermeeting leaders from Africa in Saint Petersburgand hearing their calls for Russia to move ahead with their plan. The proposal, according to the Reuters news agency, floats a series of possible steps to defuse the conflict, including a Russian troop pullback, removal of Russian tactical nuclear weapons from Belarus, suspension of an International Criminal Court (ICC)arrest warrant against Putinand sanctions relief. Details of the proposal have not been publicised. “There are things that are virtually impossible to implement, like a ceasefire – but Ukraine is advancing, they’re on a strategic offensive, how do we hold our fire when they’re advancing on us?” Putin told reporters. “This can only be a bilateral initiative. But the [African] initiative in my opinion can become the foundation of certain processes towards a peaceful resolution, just like China’s initiative, there’s no competition or contradiction here,” he said. Kyiv, too, has previously poured cold water on the African plan.    The Chinese proposal, unveiled earlier this year, is a 12-point position paper that calls for a de-escalation and eventual ceasefire in Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, has rejected the idea of a ceasefire now, which would leave Russia in control of nearly a fifth of his country and give its forces time to regroup after 17 grinding months of war. He has also said that peace talks would require Moscow to withdraw its forces from occupied Ukrainian territory, something Russia has said is not negotiable. Commenting on the subject of peace talks, Putin said, “We did not reject them”, but that “in order for this process to begin, there needs to be agreement on both sides”. The Russian president also appeared to downplay notattending an economic summitin South Africa’s Johannesburg next month amid the controversy over the ICC arrest warrant, issued over war crimes relating to the abduction of children from Ukraine. Asked about his reasons for not going, Putin told Russian journalists that he was “in contact with all colleagues” from the bloc of developing economies known as BRICS, and said he did not “think my presence at the BRICS summit is more important that my presence here, in Russia, right now”. He added that he will take part via video link and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will travel to the August 22-24 gathering, which will bring together leaders from Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. South Africa is a signatory to the Rome treaty that formed the ICC and is therefore obligated to arrest the Russian leader if he sets foot on South African territory. South Africa hadgiven strong hintsthat it would not arrest Putin if he attended but had also been lobbying for him not to come to avoid the problem. Although Moscow dismissed the warrant, Putin has not travelled to a country that is a signatory to the ICC treaty since his indictment. Analysts have said that the public debate about whether the Russian leader would travel to South Africa was in itself an unwelcome development for the Kremlin.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/30/putin-says-african-proposal-could-be-basis-for-peace-in-ukraine

"Putin promises grains, debt write-off as Russia seeks Africa allies","Putin pledges to supply Africa with grain, promotes joint fight against ‘neocolonialism’ during Russia-Africa summit.","Russian President Vladimir Putin says his country and the African leaders attending asummitin St Petersburg have agreed to promote a multipolar world order and fight “neocolonialism” as he offered debt write-offs and grain to woo allies. “Russia’s attention to Africa is steadily growing,” Putin said on Friday at the end of the two-day summit. The meeting was seen as a test of Moscow’s support in Africa, where Russia retains backing despite international isolation sparked by its war in Ukraine. On Thursday, the Russian leader promised free grain to six African nations and assured them that Moscow wastrying to avert a global food crisisnearly a week after withdrawing from an agreement that allowed Ukraine, one of the world’s largest grain producers, to export its farm products across the Black Sea. The Russian leader also mentioned the “joint determination to counter neocolonialism, the practice of applying illegitimate sanctions and attempts to undermine traditional moral values”. Representatives of 49 countries, including 17 heads of state, attended the summit in the Russian city. Participants signed a joint declaration that called for “the establishment of a more just, balanced and stable multipolar world order, firmly opposing all types of international confrontation in the African continent”. Al Jazeera’s Ali Hashem, reporting from St Petersburg, said the declaration is Russia’s “new initiative towards Africa”. “There is a Russian plan for Africa,” he said, adding that there are “very ambitious initiatives” from Putin. “Russia wants to gain Africa allies. This is why it’s initiating more and more towards Africa – to the extent that President Putin wants to … revive the Soviet era investments in Africa,” he said. According to Hashem, Russia plans on building plants and factories and increasing diplomatic missions on the continent. Putin is also promising to maintain grain supplies to Africa after hewithdrewfrom the Black Sea grain deal. He is blaming the West for higher food prices and inflation and said the global economic system is going through significant change. Africa is the “new centre of power. Its political and economic role is growing exponentially. … Everyone will have to take this reality into account,” he said. For several years, the Kremlin has openly engaged in diplomatic and economic offensives on the continent and offered security services in the form of the Wagner mercenary army to African governments fending off armed group. But in recent months, Russia has had to speed up its quest for alternatives to European partners. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has toured Africa twice since January, seeking to draw it into Moscow’s camp and presenting Russia as a bulwark against Western “imperialism” and “neocolonialism”. African leaders pressed Putin to move ahead with their peace plan to end the Ukraine conflict. While not directly critical of Russia, their interventions on the second day of a summit were more concerted and forceful than those that African countries have voiced previously. They served as reminders of the depth of African concern at the consequences of the war, especially rising food prices. “This war must end, and it can only end on the basis of justice and reason,” African Union Commission Chairman Moussa Faki Mahamat told Putin and African leaders at the summit. “The disruptions of energy and grain supplies must end immediately. The grain deal must be extended for the benefit of all the peoples of the world, Africans in particular.” Republic of the Congo President Denis Sassou Nguesso said the African initiative “deserves the closest attention” as he called “urgently” for peace. Senegalese President Macky Sall sought “a de-escalation to help create calm” while South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said he hoped that “constructive engagement and negotiation” could help end the conflict.    The summit took place in the wake of the Russian withdrawal from the grain deal. The suspension of the deal, which had helped stabilise global food prices and avert shortages, increased fears of a global food crisis. Putin reiterated that Russia would “continue to supply African friends with grain crops both on a contractual basis and free of charge”. Putin added the leaders had agreed to improve cooperation on aid, energy and trade, including by “consistently switching to national currencies for commercial transactions”. The Russian leader also pledged to wipe out the debts of Africa. Many of the leaders had warm words for Moscow’s record of support for their countries in their 20th-century liberation struggles, and the final declaration promised Russia would help them seek compensation for the damage done by colonial rule and secure the restoration of plundered cultural treasures. The leaders of Mali and the Central African Republic, whose governments have relied heavily on the services of Russia’s Wagner group, both expressed gratitude to Putin. President Faustin Archange Touadera said CAR’s relations with Russia had helped save its democracy and avoid a civil war. He thanked Russia “for helping us to oppose foreign hegemony”.

"Moscow says Ukraine fired missiles at Russian city, wounding 20",Moscow accuses Kyiv of firing missiles and wounding 20 people as Russia pounds a key front line in southern Ukraine.,"Russian forces poundeda key village that Ukraine claimed to have recapturedin its grinding counteroffensive in the country’s southeast, while Moscow accused Kyiv of firing missiles at southern Russia and wounding 20 people. On Friday, Russia said it shot down two Ukrainian missiles over its southern Rostov region bordering Ukraine, with at least a dozen people wounded by debris falling on the city of Taganrog. The ministry said the first S-200 missile was aimed at “residential infrastructure” of Taganrog, a city of approximately 250,000 people. Shortly after, it said it downed a second S-200 missile near the city of Azov, with debris falling in an unpopulated area. Vasily Golubev, governor of Russia’s Rostov region, which includes Taganrog and is close to Ukraine, said a cafe had been hit along with a museum and that the windows of a residential building had been blown out. Videos from the scene, circulating online, showed a low-rise building partly reduced to rubble. Regions bordering Ukrainehave seen regular drone attacks and shelling since Moscow launched its military campaign in February last year, but have hardly ever been targeted by missiles. Ukrainian officials rarely confirm being behind the attacks, which have includeddrone attacks on the Kremlinthat unsettled Russians. The attacks have hit Russian ammunition and fuel depots,as well as bridgesthe Russian military uses to supply its forces, and military recruitment stations. The attacks have also included killings of Russian-appointed officials on occupied Ukrainian territory. A member of Ukraine’s parliament late on Friday said that a multi-storey residential building in the central city of Dnipro was hit by a Russian missile. Al Jazeera could not independently verify the attack.    Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, meanwhile, marked Ukraine’s Statehood Day by reaffirming the country’s sovereignty – a rebuke to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who used his claim that Ukraine did not exist as a nation to justify his invasion. “Now, like more than a thousand years ago, our civilisational choice is unity with the world,” Zelenskyy said in a speech on a square outside St Michael’s Monastery in Kyiv. “To be a power in world history. To have the right to its national history – of its people, its land, its state. And of our children – all future generations of the Ukrainian people. We will definitely win!” He also honoured servicemen and handed out first passports to young citizens as part of ceremonies. The holiday coincides with commemorations of the adoption of Christianity on lands that later became Ukraine, Russia and Belarus. Meanwhile, Ukrainian and Russian forces battled for a key village in southeastern Ukraine, with Moscow’s forces pounding it with artillery, amidKyiv’s grinding counteroffensive. A Western official said on Thursday that Ukraine had launched a major push in the southeast. Putin acknowledged that fighting has intensified there, but insisted Kyiv’s push has failed. Zelenskyy posted a video on Thursday night in which Ukrainian soldiers said they had taken Staromaiorske in the Donetsk region. Russian military bloggers said artillery fire at the Ukrainian troops had effectively razed the village and reported more barrages Friday. Capturing the village, which in 2014 had a population of 682, would give Ukraine a platform to push deeper into Russian-held territory, the bloggers noted. The area has been a focus of Ukraine’s counteroffensive since June, and its troops have previously captured several other villages there as they slowly work their way across extensive Russian minefields.

"Russia making efforts to avert food crisis, Putin tells African nations",Russian president offers free grain to six African countries days after withdrawing from Ukraine grain export deal.,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has offered free grain to six African countries, telling African leaders at a conference in St Petersburg that Moscow is making efforts to avert a global food crisis days after withdrawing from the Ukraine grain export deal. “Our country will continue supporting needy states and regions, in particular with its humanitarian deliveries. We seek to actively participate in building a fairer system of distribution of resources. We are taking maximum efforts to avert a global food crisis,” Putin said addressing the conference attended by nearly 50 African leaders and officials. “I have already said that our country can replace Ukrainian grain, both on a commercial basis and as grant aid to the neediest African countries, more so since we expect another record harvest this year,” he said. Russia last week refused to extend the United Nations- and Turkey-brokered deal under which Ukrainian grain exports were shipped across the Black Sea to global markets, including Africa, easing pressure on food prices. The two-day summit is being scrutinised as a test of his support in Africa, where Putin retains backing despite international isolation sparked by his invasion of Ukraine last year. The Kremlin has accused Western countries of trying to prevent African states from participating in the summit, the second of its kind. Putin said Russia intends to ship up to 50,000 tonnes of grain aid to Burkina Faso, Zimbabwe, Mali, Somalia, Eritrea and the Central African Republic in the next three to four months. Gyude Moore, senior policy fellow at the Centre for Global Development, told Al Jazeera that the grain donation is “too small in terms of the need” to secure food supplies. “With India now banning the export of rice, and Russia enforcing this blockade, it creates a very difficult situation for African governments because the continent has been disproportionately affected by the Russian invasion of Ukraine,” Moore said. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters at UN headquarters in New York that taking millions of tonnes of Ukrainian grain out of the global market will lead to higher prices, and these increased prices “will be paid by everybody, everywhere and namely by developing countries and by the vulnerable people in middle-income and even developed countries.” Guterres said the UN is in contact with Turkey, Ukraine, Russia and other countries to try to re-establish the deal, which saw Ukraine export more than 32,000 tonnes of grain, allowing global food prices to drop significantly. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Thursday that Russia’s promise to donate grain to African nations did not compensate for pulling out of the deal. “A handful of donations to some countries cannot replace the millions and millions of tonnes of grain exports that help stabilize food prices around the world,” Jean-Pierre said. Both Russia and Ukraine are major grain suppliers. They agreed a year ago on the deal that reopened three Ukrainian Black Sea ports for food exports. Russia declined to renew the agreement last week, complaining that its own exports were being held up.  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken pressed African leaders attending the summit to demand answers about the grain disruptions that have propelled poorer nations towards crisis. “They know exactly who’s to blame for this current situation,” Blinken said of the leaders. “My expectation would be that Russia will hear this clearly from our African partners,” he said during a visit to New Zealand. Seventeen African leaders, including South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, were expected at the Russia-Africa summit taking place until Friday. Africa’s 54 nations make up the largest voting bloc at the UN and have been more divided than any other region on General Assembly resolutions criticising Russia’s actions in Ukraine. On Friday, Putin is set to discuss Ukraine during a working lunch with a group of African heads of state, according to the Kremlin.    Putin held talks on Wednesday with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and praised their joint energy projects. Putin also chaired a working breakfast with heads of African regional organisations and bilateral talks including with Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa. Putin gave Mnangagwa a helicopter and wished him success in upcoming elections, which analysts expect to be tense.    Russia’s Wagner mercenary group has been a major player in the security sphere in Africa, but its failed mutiny against Russia’s military leadership last month has cast doubt on the future of the group’s operations on the continent. The summit in St Petersburg comes a month ahead of a summit of leaders of the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) due to take place in Johannesburg. South Africa has said that Putin, who is the subject of an international arrest warrant for his actions in Ukraine, will not be attending in person. Meanwhile on Thursday, Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said the Ukrainian army recaptured the village of Staromaiorske from Russian forces on the southern front. “Staromaiorske in the Donetsk region has been liberated. Our defenders are currently carrying out clearing operations” of Russian troops, she said on Telegram. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy posted a video on Telegram showing a group of soldiers with a Ukrainian flag, saying they had “liberated the village of Staromaoirske”. “Our south. Our guys. Glory to Ukraine,” Zelenskyy wrote. The expulsion of Russian forces from the village would mark one of the first such victories on the southern front since Ukraine started its counteroffensive in June, aiming to push out Russian troops from Ukrainian territory they have occupied.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/27/russia-making-efforts-to-avert-food-crisis-putin-tells-african-nations
North Korea’s Kim shows off banned missiles to Russia’s Shoigu,North Korea says it fully supports Russia’s ‘battle for justice’ as it shows off nuclear-capable missiles to Moscow’s defence chief.,"Russia’s defence minister accompanied North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to a defence exhibition that featured the North’s banned ballistic missiles as the neighbours pledged to boost ties, North Korean state media reported on Thursday. The Russian minister,Sergey Shoigu, and a Chinesedelegationled by a Communist Party Politburo member arrived in North Korea this week for the 70th anniversary of the end of the Korean War, celebrated in North Korea as “Victory Day”. The nuclear-capable missiles were banned under UN Security Council resolutions adopted with Russian and Chinese support. But this week, they provided a striking backdrop for a show of solidarity by three countries united by their rivalry with the US and a revival of what some analysts see as their Cold War-era coalition. Shoigu’s visit was the first by a Russian defence minister to North Korea since the 1991 break-up of the Soviet Union. For North Korea, the arrival of the Russian and Chinese delegations marks its first major opening up to the world since the COVID-19 pandemic. Shoigu gave Kim a letter from Russian President Vladimir Putin, North Korean media reported. “[Kim] expressed his views on the issues of mutual concern in the struggle to safeguard the sovereignty, development and interests of the two countries from the high-handed and arbitrary practices of the imperialists and to realise international justice and peace,” North Korean media said. KCNA did not refer to the war in Ukraine but North Korea’s defence minister, Kang Sun Nam, was reported as saying Pyongyang fully supported Russia’s “battle for justice” and protection of its sovereignty. State media photographs showed Kim and his guests at a display of some of the North’s ballistic missiles in multi-axle transporter launchers. Another image showed what analysts said appeared to be a new drone. “We’ve come a long way from when North Korea would avoid showing off its nuclear capabilities when senior foreign dignitaries from Russia and China were in town,” said Ankit Panda of the U.S.-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, calling the tour “remarkable”. “The personal tour for Shoigu – and Shoigu’s willingness to be photographed with Kim in the course of this tour – is evidence that Moscow is complacent with North Korea’s ongoing nuclear modernisation,” he said. Kim also met Chinese Communist Party Politburo member Li Hongzhong for talks and was handed a letter from Chinese President Xi Jinping, North Korean media reported. The visit by Li’s delegation showed Xi’s commitment to the North Korea-China friendship, Kim was quoted as saying by the North’s KCNA state news agency. State media photographs showed Kim at a large flashy performance flanked by Shoigu and Li, with a backdrop that included a slogan used by the Chinese army during the Korean War pledging to “resist US aggressors”. Later on Thursday, North Korea held a widely anticipated nighttime military parade in an event expected to showcase the country’s latest weapons, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency reported. Pyongyang’s state media had not reported on the parade as of Thursday night. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Russia’s overtures to North Korea have come as the Kremlin struggles to procure arms. “It’s been no secret … Mr Putin is reaching out to other countries for help and support in fighting his war in Ukraine. And that includes, we know, some outreach to [North Korea],” he said. North Korea has backed the Kremlin over the Ukraine war and has shipped weapons including infantry rockets and missiles in support of Moscow, the White House has said. North Korea and Russia have denied conducting arms transactions. The Russian visit has raised the prospect of more open support for North Korea, especially with Russia isolated by the West over its invasion of Ukraine, analysts said. One analyst said Shoigu’s inspection of the North Korean missiles suggested Russian acceptance of Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons programme. “It may signify that the current geopolitical circumstances are starting to erode Russia’s longstanding interest in preserving the global non-proliferation regime,” said Artyom Lukin, a professor at Russia’s Far Eastern Federal University in Vladivostok. The simultaneous visits by high-ranking officials is another sign of a revival of the Russian-Chinese-North Korean coalition that originally existed in the late 1940s and 1950s, though now likely to be led from Beijing rather than Moscow, he added. South Korea’s foreign ministry noted it had been Russia’s official position to oppose North Korea’s nuclear programme and said it hoped the visit by Shoigu’s delegation would help the North return to dialogue.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/27/north-koreas-kim-shows-off-banned-missiles-to-russias-shoigu
Putin on a charm offensive as Russia-Africa Summit kicks off,"Leaders from across Africa attending high-level talks in St Petersburg, with food security and Ukraine war high on the agenda.","Vladimir Putin is on a charm offensive. On Thursday, the Russian president will roll out the red carpet for African leaders as he seeks to shore up Moscow’s position in a continent that’s becoming increasingly important to his country’s geopolitical ambitions. Alongside thewar in Ukraine, food security will be high on the agenda of the second Russia-Africa Summit in St Petersburg, especially after Russia’sdecisionlast week to withdraw from an international grain deal left many in Africaunnerved. The agreement was brokered by the United Nations and Turkey last year to allow the safe passage of agricultural goods through Ukraine’s ports in the Black Sea despite the war with Russia. While the vast majority of the nearly 33 million tonnes exported since then did not reach the world’s poorest countries, the deal helped reverse spiralling food prices by more than 20 percent, according to the UN. Russia justified its decision by saying the conditions for the extension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative had been ignored. In the days that followed, it unleashed a series of strikes on port infrastructure and grain depots in the south of Ukraine. Korir Sing’Oei, Kenya’s principal secretary for foreign affairs, called Putin’s decision “a stab on the back”, but African leaders have by and large refrained from commenting. In an editorial published on Monday, Putin blamed the West for failing to deliver grain to the world’s poorest and assured African nations that Russia can replace Ukrainian grain “free of charge” as the country is expecting “a record harvest” this year.  “Moscow has always dreamed of an alternative financial and commercial system that is disconnected from the West – something that is now even more urgent given sanctions on Russia,” said Alex Vines, lead of the African Programme at Chatham House, referring to the sweeping measures imposed by Western countries following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year. “And Africa becomes important in this as Russia looks for new partnerships,” Vines added. Russian officials have said that Putin, at the summit, will address the issue of food and fertilisers, as well as hold bilateral discussions with African leaders. But, at this event, only 17 African heads of state or government will be present compared to 43 that attended the 2019 summit, leading Russia to blame “interference” from the West. A number of cultural, humanitarian and technological deals are expected to be signed at the summit, with participants also due to adopt a resolution. “The main attention will be paid to the prospects for the further development of relations between Africa and Russia with an emphasis on our assistance to the national sovereign development of Africans, ensuring fair access to food, fertilisers, modern technologies and energy resources,” Kremlin foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov said this week. The two-day event takes place just weeks after amutinyby the Wagner Group raised questions about the future of the Russian mercenary force. In recent years, Wagner had been seen as a key component in Russia’s efforts to expand its influence in Africa. However, Wagner’s abortive rebellion against the top military brass in Moscow amid disagreements over the war effort in Ukraine has caused a deep rift between the group and the Russian state. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin have since madeseparate statementsboth suggesting the group will continue to operate in parts of Africa, but it was not clear under whose control. Wagner troops are known to have been active in a number of countries, including the Central African Republic, Libya, Mali and Sudan. The heads of state of all these countries, except war-hit Sudan, have confirmed their presence at the summit.    In St Petersburg, the African leaders are also expected to be more assertive in their diplomatic efforts to find a resolution to the war in Ukraine – a conflict largely perceived in the continent as an internal European matter which has, however, greater ramifications including on countries in Africa. Last month, representatives of six African countriesvisitedboth Russia and Ukraine in an effort to mediate in the war, but their proposals were largely dismissed by both sides. Still, analysts say African leaders, who represent the biggest bloc at the UN General Council, have travelled to St Petersburg aware of theirincreased geostrategic stockin the face of growing competition between Russia and the United States on a number of fronts. “African stakeholders are increasingly bullish about what they have to offer to the world and can pick for a growing range of suitors,” said Ronak Gopaldas, director at Signal Risk, an African risk advisory firm. Their goal will be to diversify theireconomic and political relationshipsfor maximum strategic benefit, while also looking for tangible results beyond cosmetic pledges, he added. “African states are attempting to be kingmakers, rather than be caught in another proxy war,” Gopaldas noted.  A number of the panels at the St Petersburg summit focus on what Moscow describes as a Russia-African shared struggle against “forms of new colonialism imposed by the West” – a narrative that has been central to the Kremlin’s strategy in rallying support in the continent behind its war effort in Ukraine. Lavrov has notably travelled eight times in Africa since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February last year. But Moscow’s growing geostrategic aspirations have not translated into investments in Africa. At the first Russia-Africa Summit in 2019, Russia pledged to double trade with African countries to $40bn in five years, yet the trade volume between the twohas stalledat around $18bn with Africa importing nearly eight times more compared to what Russia buys from the continent last year. Furthermore, Russia accounts for just one percent of foreign direct investment that goes to Africa, data from fDi Intelligenceshows. “Moscow doesn’t have much to offer,” said Joseph Siegle, head of the African Center for Strategic Studies. “Russia’s goal is symbolic; it wants to show that in the minds of many African leaders it remains a central global power, not a pariah.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/27/putin-on-a-charm-offensive-as-africa-russia-summit-kicks-in

Biden administration moves to assist ICC in Russia investigation,"US has previously been sceptical of cooperation with the ICC, worrying it could investigate alleged abuses by US forces.","The United States will support the International Criminal Court’s (ICC) investigation into allegedabuses by Russian forcesin Ukraine, two senior US senators have confirmed, marking a major about-face in Washington’s stance towards the international tribunal. Dick Durbin, the Democratic chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Lindsey Graham, the Republican ranking member of the panel, lauded the decision by PresidentJoe Biden’sadministration on Wednesday. “After pressing the administration for months, we are pleased that the administration is finally supporting the ICC’s investigation,” Durbin and Graham said in astatement. “We will continue to work in the Senate to ensure those responsible for atrocities are held accountable, including by working to close the gap in US law for crimes against humanity.”    The move reverses a longstanding trend of the US refusing to cooperate with the ICC, partly due to concerns that the court could use its authority to investigate alleged crimes by US forces orallied countries. The Trump administration had previouslyimposed sanctionson ICC officials who were investigating alleged US violations in Afghanistan and abuses by Israeli authorities against Palestinians. The US remains one of a handful of countries that are not party to the Rome Statute, which first establishedthe courtin 1998. Following international criticism during the early years of its so-called “War on Terror”, the US went so far as to pass a law in 2002 authorising military action against The Hague to rescue any citizen of the US or an allied nation who might be held by the ICC. That history has left the US exposed to criticisms that it makes appeals to international law selectively, shielding itself and its allies from accountability. Earlier on Wednesday, the US state department reiterated its opposition to an ICC investigation in Israel and Palestine when asked about increasedsettler attacksagainst Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. “We have not viewed the ICC as the appropriate mechanism for some of these deliberations,” department spokesperson Vedant Patel told reporters. The US has also rejected the push to seek accountability at the ICC for the killing of Al Jazeera journalistShireen Abu Akleh, who was fatally shot by Israeli forces last year. The ICC issued an arrest warrant for Russian PresidentVladimir Putinin March over allegations that his country’s forces have taken children out of Ukraine and transported them to Russia, an act that would constitute a war crime.    Since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine last March, human rights groups and media organisations have detailed a litany ofalleged abuses, from the execution of civilians and indiscriminate bombing of civilian infrastructure to torture and sexual violence. Republican and Democratic legislators haveaccused the Pentagonof setting back efforts to hold Russia accountable after it blocked previous efforts to share intelligence with the ICC. Asked why the Pentagon was refusing to share evidence of such crimes with the ICC, Secretary of DefenseLloyd Austinsaid he supported efforts to hold Russia accountable but would “always prioritise the protection of US military personnel”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/26/biden-administration-moves-to-assist-icc-in-russia-investigation
Russian cybersecurity chief jailed for 14 years for treason,Ilya Sachkov who helped found one of Russia’s most prominent cybersecurity firms was accused of passing information to foreign spies.,"A Russian court has jailed for 14 years a top cybersecurity executive for treason in a case which centred on allegations he had passed classified information to foreign spies. Following a closed-door trial, the AFP news agency quoted Judge Alexander Rybak as saying on Wednesday, “The court found Ilya Sachkov guilty under Article 275 of Russia’s Criminal Code and sentenced him to 14 years in prison with the sentence to be served in a strict regime penal colony.” Last week, prosecutors requested that Sachkov be sentenced to 18 years in jail. Few details have been made public since treason cases in Russia are typically classified. Sachkov, who denied wrongdoing, helped found Group-IB in 2003, once one of Russia’s most prominent cybersecurity firms. Earlier this year, it cut ties with its original market and now has its headquarters in Singapore. While he is no longer associated with the company, he owns a share in its former Russian business and was arrested in September 2021 by Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB). The tech businessman is the latest among many people, including scientists, soldiers, officials and a former journalist, to face the charge in recent years. A year before his arrest, Sachkov ruffled feathers after he stood up at an event attended by Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin. In a televised speech, Sachkov accused authorities of allowing a prominent Russian criminal hacker to go about his business unimpeded, criticised the appointment of someone he said was a former spy to a body covering the export of advanced technologies, and accused Russian President Vladimir Putin’s cybersecurity envoy of making toxic statements. But following his conviction, Sachkov’s former colleagues, who bought Group-IB’s Russian business and renamed it FACCT, said in a statement that his legal team would appeal his conviction and ask Putin to intervene. In a statement, the company wrote, “While he remains wrongfully imprisoned, we will continue to stand up against injustice and operate our business with the same mission in mind – to fight against cybercrime.” At the time of his arrest, the firm was focused on investigating high-tech crimes and online fraud, including in Russia, with a global client base that included banks, energy companies, telecoms firms and Interpol.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/26/russian-cybersecurity-chief-jailed-for-14-years-on-treason
Russia’s Bolshoi Theatre performs in China amid Western sanctions,"Artistic director says his ballet company will ‘no doubt’ return to touring in the West, where the state-owned theatre is sanctioned due to Russia’s war in Ukraine.","Russia’s state-owned Bolshoi Theatre has begun performances in China in the ballet company’s first international tour since the COVID-19 pandemic, and its artistic director says he has “no doubt” his troupe will eventually return to touring in the West, where it is sanctioned. On the eve of Tuesday’s performance at Beijing’s National Centre for the Performing Arts, Artistic Director Makhar Vaziev insisted the troupe was “not suffering” from being unable to perform in the West due to a cultural boycott on Moscow for its war in Ukraine. “I have no doubt that one day everything will go back to how it should be because culture is a wave that is very hard to suppress,” Vaziev said in an interview with the Reuters news agency. “Many governments have banned cultural figures from Russia, … but we are still talking to the same people we talked to in the past.” On visiting China, Vaziev told Reuters last week: “I don’t think it’s a secret that China is one of a few countries that support and continue to cooperate with us.” Founded in 1776 by Empress Catherine the Great, the Bolshoi will perform some of its best-known ballet works in China, including a three-day performance of the 19th century ballet Don Quixote. According to the company’s public relations representative, the troupe receives 70 percent of its funding from the Russian government. So far, no performers have publicly condemned Russia’s war in Ukraine, but several Russian and foreign lead dancers, including the former principal dancer Olga Smirnova, have quit the company in opposition to the war. The Bolshoi hopes its performances in Beijing will herald a return to the global stage after it once toured the world during the most tense days of the Cold War. The dancing troupe has only two further confirmed international stops: in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, in November and in Oman in January. A day before Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year, London’s Royal Opera House called off the Bolshoi’s planned post-pandemic return for a residency scheduled for that summer. Cancellations from other Western countries followed, and collaboration with Western venues and choreographers disappeared. Elizaveta Kokoreva, a principal dancer who joined the famous ballet troupe at the beginning of the pandemic, told Reuters: “I would really like to visit other countries, see the world, and get to know different venues, theatres, teachers and choreographers.” “But it is what it is right now,” she said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/26/russias-bolshoi-theatre-performs-in-china-amid-western-sanctions

UK warns Russia may begin targeting civilian ships in Black Sea,UK ambassador to the UN says the ‘Russian military may expand their targeting of Ukrainian grain facilities further.’,"The United Kingdom has warned that it has information indicating Russia’s military may start to target civilian shipping in the Black Sea, as the European Union pledged to help Ukraine export almost all its farm produce via rail and road. Global wheat prices have spiked 15 percent in the week since Russia quit adealthat allowed the safe Black Sea export of Ukraine grain for a year and began targeting Ukrainian ports and grain infrastructure on the Black Sea and Danube River. “Our information indicates that the Russian military may expand their targeting of Ukrainian grain facilities further, to include attacks against civilian shipping in the Black Sea,” the UK’s United Nations Ambassador Barbara Woodward said on Tuesday. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak shared the information with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a phone call on Tuesday, Woodward told reporters. Britain also had information that “Russia has laid additional sea mines in the approaches to Ukrainian ports”, she said.    “We agree with the US assessment that this is a coordinated effort to justify and lay blame on Ukraine for any attacks against civilian ships in the Black Sea,” Woodward said. The White House gave similar warnings last week about possible Russian attacks on civilian ships and sea mines. The Black Sea grain deal was brokered by the UN and Turkey a year ago to combat a global food crisis worsened by Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Both Ukraine and Russia are leading grain exporters. Russia withdrew last week, saying that demands to improve its own food and fertiliser exports had not been met and complaining that not enough Ukrainian grain had reached poor countries under the deal. The UN has argued that the pact benefited poorer countries by lowering global prices 23 percent since March 2022. Russian President Vladimir Putin is due to host African leaders in St Petersburg on Thursday and Friday and has promised free Russian grain “to replace Ukrainian grain”. The UN said the most vulnerable will pay the highest price for Moscow’s decision to terminate the Black Sea agreement. Kremlin foreign policy adviser Yury Ushakov told Russian media on Tuesday that 17 African leaders would speak at the summit. The EU said on Tuesday that it was ready to export almost all of Ukraine’s farm produce via road and rail “solidarity lanes” through neighbouring EU countries and help cover transportation costs. “We are ready to export almost everything. This is about four million tonnes per month of oilseeds and grains and we achieved this volume in November last year,” EU Agriculture Commissioner Janusz Wojciechowski said. Wojciechowski said that the EU was looking to come up with a joint plan to cover the additional transport costs. Expanding grain transit through the EU is sensitive for Poland and some countries bordering Ukraine, wherefarmers have come under pressurefrom increased Ukrainian imports. In May, the EU allowed five countries close to Ukraine – Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia – to ban domestic sales of Ukrainian wheat, maize and oilseeds until September 15, while allowing transit through them for onward export. The EU will review the ban after several countries pushed for an extension beyond September 15.    Polish Agriculture Minister Robert Telus told reporters on Tuesday that he wanted a flexible ban, explaining as an example that Poland wanted to prohibit raspberries, but would allow sunflower seeds. “There is no way that after September 15 Ukraine grain will enter Poland,” Telus said. “We have quite a lot of grain, prices of grain already today are low … it would completely destabilise our market.” EU member Lithuania has asked the European Commission to develop a route for Ukrainian grain through five ports in the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the Reuters news agency reported, citing a letter. The five ports have a combined grain export capacity of 25 million tonnes, the letter said. The railways of Ukraine and the Baltic states are built on a Russian-type gauge, which is incompatible with the railway gauge used in Poland, the only practical route between the countries. In Washington, US Agency for International Development Administrator Samantha Power told reporters that the United States would look at putting more money toward silos and other storage so Ukraine’s grain harvests “don’t rot while they wait to reach global markets”. Power said the US would focus in part on helping farmers get access to finance. “Their profit margins are just getting smaller and smaller,” she said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/25/uk-warns-russia-may-begin-targeting-civilian-ships-in-black-sea
A traumatised father battles Russia on Ukraine’s front line,"The losses in eastern Ukraine are felt by soldiers and civilians alike. For many, nothing remains of their homes but memories.","Through fields and down off-road tracks, amid the constant sounds of artillery guns being fired, is Ukraine’s eastern front line. Along a tree line used as cover, vehicles are hidden – camouflaged with branches and shrubbery. Andrii Onistrat is a commander of a drone unit there. He has a confident swagger about him and is comfortable in front of a camera. Before the war, he was a successful businessman and had his own television show. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine turned him into a soldier. “The Russians are over there,” he says, standing in the thick trees, casually pointing at a tree line across the fields. Behind that tree line is the town of Pavlivka. It is dangerously close to Russian positions, about 1.5m to 2km (0.9 to 1.2 miles) away from them. If Andrii’s team is spotted, Russian forces will target the area with mortars and artillery. Two soldiers are waiting for Andrii. They set up a satellite and prepare a small drone. They watch on tablets as it flies over a thin strip of trees. There is a small gap that exposes some dugouts. That is the Ukrainian team’s target. The drone returns, and they send it back out but this time with a grenade attached to it. Andrii gives the order, and they drop the grenade. Smoke rises from the impact, and Andrii’s team calls it a success. They say they kill 10 to 12 Russian soldiers a day. His team knows if they can use a drone to spot positions, they can also be spotted. Andrii says he has sometimes targeted Russians just to injure them and then waited for another team to evacuate the injured and then targeted them. “I don’t care,” he says. “I’ll kill as many of them as I can.” Andrii’s son Ostap was killed on the battlefield last month. He was 21. When we ask Andrii about him, he takes a long pause and stares at the ground. “I don’t understand how it could have happened. I realise he wanted me to see him as a hero. It was very important for him. I didn’t realise it was so important for him when he was alive. But I realise now. He was looking for ways to show me,” he says. “I was a strict father, and I rarely praised him, but at the same time, I was very demanding and I always pointed out his mistakes and it put pressure on my son. He wanted to be the best guy for me, and he became the best,” Andrii adds. Another pause. “He died right here, right here. I come back and look for him. I found a piece of him here,” he says. Andrii snaps out of his trance-like state and heads back towards his team. Away from the thick trees and across the fields, eventually we find ourselves on a road. At this point, we’re just following Andrii’s speeding car. There are no other vehicles on this stretch of road. Small craters line the route where it’s been hit by mortars. Then, several shells land right next to us as we drive, narrowly missing us. The shock wave of the impact is startling. We’ve been spotted. The Russians have eyes on this road, and we urge the driver to step on it and not slow down. We look behind and can see the dust and smoke rising from the field where the shells landed. Village after village along the road has been destroyed. All of them bear the scars of battle, but victories and losses look the same here. The result for these places is always destruction. In Blahodatne, the bodies of Russian soldiers lay unclaimed. The stench of decomposing corpses fills the air. Twisted, broken, missing body parts, the pain of death etched on their faces. The shelling is continuous and staying outside is risky. In a bunker, we see soldiers and civilians living side by side. The soldiers are their lifeline and bring in supplies. The soldiers seem surprised to see us and a little annoyed. “Who are these people?! Why the hell did you bring journalists here?!” they ask Andrii. He responds rudely, throwing in a few expletives for good measure. It seems this is not his battalion. Andrii doesn’t care. He has brought us this close to the front line. Military press officers don’t bring you here. Only 10 people remain in this village, unable or unwilling to leave despite the dangers. Nina Sumakova is among those who’ve stayed. She’s in her 70s and still manages a smile despite living this subterranean life. “When the Russians entered, there were a lot of them. It was very scary. But when our guys liberated us. Then it became calmer,” Nina tells us. “All our family homes have been destroyed, but we will rebuild. We will do it gradually – when our boys advance and these shells won’t fall on our heads.” The Ukrainian advance has not gone to plan. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy admits it has been slower than initially hoped. Last year, the country’s counteroffensive did achieve big successes when Ukraine’s forces pushed back Russia’s troops in the regions of Kharkiv in the northeast and Kherson in the south. This time, the Russians are better prepared, dug in and looking to advance themselves. The soldiers on the front line know this. When you speak with them, their morale is high, but they are sceptical of the daily figures released by the government about the number of Russian soldiers killed, vehicles destroyed and missiles intercepted. Both sides are engaged in a propaganda war. The Ukrainians know that if the true reality of the war is presented to the general public, it could create panic, all the defiance they show now could waver, and morale on the front line could be affected. Ukraine does not release figures of how many soldiers it has lost or how many are injured. Yet we visited a field hospital near the eastern city of Bakhmut and were told medics have been busy. It seems a lot of the casualties during this counteroffensive have been a result of landmines. A soldier with his foot blown off is brought in and another with shrapnel wounds to his face. Medics work to stabilise them before they are moved to a proper hospital. Those who fight on the front line are being put under more and more pressure. Young men have not had a break since the start of this war in February last year. Desensitised by the brutality of it, a tank crew shows us their drone footage. Most teams have drones. They filmed what appeared to be an injured Russian soldier. They dropped a grenade that landed on his neck and blew his head off. They laugh and smile at the footage. Routinely, we meet young soldiers who say they just want to kill Russians. Ukraine controls media access. Military press officers grant permission to visit battalions and certain areas. We see drone footage of an artillery crew trying to hit a tank. It missed. “We won’t give you this footage, only footage of when we actually hit,” the commander says. Every little bit of information, pictures and video is used to try to win the propaganda war and demoralise Russian forces. It usually plays out on social media. Bumper, a mechanic and tank driver, recalls a battle in which his commander was burned alive in his tank. “It was like raining shells and mines on us. The field was full of craters and mines,” he tells us. We later find out that Bumper’s interview from our report has turned up on a Russian Telegram channel. Kremlin loyalists use it as proof Russian forces are inflicting damage on Ukraine, and they laugh at the loss of Bumper’s commander. Bumper listens to Russian music on his phone as he repairs a Soviet era T-72 tank that’s older than his father. Others sing along with some of the words. The irony is that the government adopted a law banning Russian music and printed materials in Ukraine on TV, radio and in public places. Russian is spoken in parts of Ukraine, especially in the east and south, and soldiers can be heard speaking Russian rather than Ukrainian. But speaking the language doesn’t mean those Ukrainians support Moscow. There are, however, parts of Ukrainian society that are supportive of Russia, especially in the east of the country. Sometimes, the support is subtle and manifests itself in statements like: “We don’t know who fired this missile at us,” as we heard in a small town in Donbas. “The Ukrainians fired first,” said one old man in Siversk, meaning the Russians were only retaliating. He said this while most buildings around him had been damaged or destroyed and most people had fled the fighting. Confronting support for Russia is a challenge Ukraine will face no matter what the outcome of this war is. Ukrainian generals talk about retaking the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014. However realistic that may or may not be, there’s no word on how they will address how the majority of people on the peninsula support Russia, or at least they did before the war. In western parts of Ukraine, they’re seemingly detached from the war. The curfew times are later. Cafes and restaurants are open. Life goes on as normal. Couples walk in parks. Children play in playgrounds. Bands play in the streets. They are interrupted only by the occasional air raid sirens and the threat of missile strikes. In the east, they live and breathe this war. In Siversk, they spend their nights in basements. There’s no electricity or water. They are dependent on aid. Yet they stay. Even here, they say they don’t want to go anywhere else. They feel they are treated differently by other Ukrainians. The farther east you go, the more suspicious they are of journalists. “You come here, and then they hit us,” we’re told by a woman as she walks past us. Zoya is one of the few left in Siversk. She doesn’t want to leave even though all the windows of her building have been broken by the shock waves of attacks. She makes her coffee in the morning using a small gas canister and stove. “My recipe is a secret. I use a mixture of spices. Smell it. Doesn’t it smell lovely?” she asks before taking a sip. Many who remain in these towns and villages are sometimes accused by other Ukrainians of being pro-Russian. At least that’s how the people we spoke to felt. Pro-Russian separatists have been fighting in the Donbas region since 2014. Zoya says nothing about the years of war, only about how people from the Donbas are treated. “When people go to other parts of Ukraine that don’t see the war, they say: ‘You are from Donbas? This all happened because of you! Go back to Donbas. Why don’t you flee elsewhere?’ Where should we flee? Some hostels? I live in my own flat. My own,” she says proudly. About 18 percent of Ukraine’s territory is still controlled by Russia. Ukraine says it is making gains near the city of Bakhmut with Russia mounting its own push near Kupiansk. For many, the destruction has already happened, and their homes, towns and villages are nothing but memories and places on a map that either side can claim.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/25/reporters-notebook-a-traumatised-father-on-ukraines-front-line
Sirens in Kyiv as Ukrainian forces down Russian drones,Officials say Russia launched Iranian-made Shahed drones in its sixth attack this month on the Ukrainian capital.,"Russia has launched its sixth air attack on Ukraine’s capital this month, but all incoming drones were shot down and early reports indicated no damage or casualties, according to officials. The reported attack on Kyiv on Tuesday morning came a day after Russia warned of “tough retaliatory measures” followinga drone attack on its capital, Moscow,some 500km (300 miles) from Ukraine. Russia attacked Kyiv with Iranian-made Shahed drones, and based on preliminary information all the drones were downed by Ukraine’s air defence systems, Serhiy Popko, head of Kyiv’s military administration, said on the Telegram messaging app. “The air alert lasted for 3 hours … All air targets were detected and destroyed on the approach to Kyiv,” he said. “According to the information at this moment, there were no victims or destruction in the capital.” The Kyiv regional military administration had earlier issued an alert for drone attacks and warned residents to stay in shelters. The air force also issued an alert for drone strikes on the southern Odesa and Mykolaiv regions, which share part of Ukraine’s Black Sea coast. The regions are home to port infrastructure that Moscow has battered regularly with attack drones and missiles since exiting a deal facilitating the safe shipment of grain from Ukraine last week.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/25/sirens-blare-in-kyiv-as-ukrainian-forces-down-russian-drones

"US sanctions Mali’s defence minister, officials over Wagner ties",US State Department accuses three Malian officials of facilitating the Russian mercenary group’s rise in the African country.,"Washington, DC –The United States has imposed sanctions against Mali’s defence minister and two military officials, accusing the trio of helping to facilitate the Russian mercenary group Wagner’s rise in the West African nation. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced on Monday that the sanctions targeted Malian Defence Minister Colonel Sadio Camara, Air Force Chief of Staff Colonel Alou Boi Diarra and Deputy Chief of Staff Lieutenant Colonel Adama Bagayoko. Blinken accused the trio of working to “facilitate and expand Wagner’s presence in Mali since December 2021”, adding that civilian fatalities had surged by 278 percent since the Russian mercenaries deployed to the country. “Many of those deaths were the result of operations conducted by the Malian Armed Forces alongside members of theWagner Group,” Blinken said. In a separate statement, US Treasury Department official Brian Nelson also said the Malian officials had been “instrumental in facilitating the Wagner Group’s entrenchment in Mali over the past two years”. “These officials have made their people vulnerable to the Wagner Group’s destabilizing activities and human rights abuses while paving the way for the exploitation of their country’s sovereign resources to the benefit of the Wagner Group’s operations in Ukraine,” Nelson said.    For years, the US and its allies have targeted the Wagner Group and those who support it with sanctions. Last week, the United Kingdom, for example,sanctioned 13 individualswith links to the Wagner Group in the Central African Republic, Mali and Sudan. That pressure increased in the wake of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in which Wagner mercenaries have played a large role. In January, Washingtondesignated Wagneras a “transnational criminal organisation”. More recently, in May, the US also sanctioned Ivan Aleksandrovich Maslov, who the Treasury Department identified as Wagner’s “principal administrator” in Mali. US officials have long accused the firm founded by Russian citizen Yevgeny Prigozhin of advancing Russian interests through security agreements and disinformation campaigns across Africa. It remains unclear what effect arecentPrigozhin-led uprisingin Russia will have on Wagner’s operations in Africa. Malian officials increasingly turned to Wagner following a military-led coup in May 2021, which saw military officer Assimi Goita seize power. We're imposing sanctions on three Malian officials who have coordinated with the Wagner Group to facilitate and expand Wagner’s presence in Mali. Civilian fatalities have surged more than threefold since Wagner forces deployed to Mali in December 2021. — Secretary Antony Blinken (@SecBlinken)July 24, 2023  The pivot coincided with increased calls for French troops, who had first deployed to northern Mali in 2013 in response to a separatist movement, to leave the country. France’s military completed its withdrawal in August of last year. Mali’s transitional government did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Reuters news agency on Monday’s US sanctions. In addition to its sanctions push, Washington has accused Wagner of helping toengineer the departureof the 13,000-person-strong United Nations peacekeeping mission in Mali, known as MINUSMA. In June, per the request of Bamako, the UN Security Council voted to end the decade-long mission, which had increasingly become the subject of tensions but was seen as essential to preventing an all-out security vacuum in Mali’s sprawling central region bordering Niger and Burkina Faso. MINUSMA is expected to completely cease operations by the end of the year. The tri-border area has seen increasing violence in recent years as ISIL (ISIS) and al-Qaeda-linked groups have jockeyed for influence and rights groups have accused Wagner of being linked to recent abuses. In January, UN experts called for an investigation into “gross human rights abuses and possible war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Mali by government forces” and Wagner mercenaries since 2021.    The reported abuses included the killing of more than 500 people, “the vast majority summarily executed”, by government forces and “foreign military personnel” in the village of Moura in the central Mopti region in March 2022, according to a May report from the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. Messages obtained by The Guardian newspaper had previously linked the operation to Wagner, though Malian officials rejected the report as “fictitious”. On Monday, Human Rights Watchaccused government forcesand fighters believed to belong to the Wagner Group of summarily executing or forcibly disappearing “several dozen civilians in Mali’s central region since December 2022”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/24/us-sanctions-malis-defence-minister-officials-over-wagner-ties

Russia says it foiled a Ukrainian drone attack on Moscow,Russian defence ministry says its forces intercepted and destroyed two Ukrainian drones over Moscow.,"Russia’s air defence forces have “suppressed” a Ukrainian drone attack on Moscow, the Russian defence ministry has announced, accusing Kyiv of launching a “terrorist act” against the country’s capital. The attack early on Monday came a day after Ukraine vowed to “retaliate” for a Russian missile attack on the Black Sea port of Odesa. “A Kyiv regime attempt to carry out a terrorist act using two drones on objects on the territory of the city of Moscow was stopped,” the Russian defence ministry said. “Two Ukrainian drones were suppressed and crashed. There are no casualties.” There was no comment from Ukraine. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said the drone strikes occurred at around 4:00am local time (01:00 GMT). The Russian TASS news agency said that one of the drones fell on Komsomolsky Prospekt, which is close to Russia’s defence ministry, while another hit a business centre on Likhacheva Street near one of Moscow’s main ring roads. The Reuters news agency reported two loud explosions before the reported attacks. The RIA Novosti news agency posted a video of the business centre, with some damage visible to the top of the tall building. The road around it was closed.    Moscow lies around 500km (310 miles) from the Ukrainian border but have been hit by several drone attacks this year, with one even hitting the Kremlin in May. Earlier this month, Russia said it had downed five Ukrainian drones that disrupted the functioning of Moscow’s Vnukovo international airport. Meanwhile in Ukraine, Russian forces have pounded the the port city of Odesa since Moscow quit a deal allowing Ukrainian grain to be exported through the Black Sea last week. The latest strike on the city on Sunday killed two people and severely damaged a historic cathedral. Clergymen rescued icons from rubble inside the badly damaged Transfiguration Cathedral, which was demolished under Stalin in 1936 and rebuilt in the 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The Ukrainian government condemned the cathedral strike as a “war crime”, saying it had been “destroyed twice: by Stalin and Putin”. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pledged retaliation: “They will definitely feel this,” he said. “We cannot allow people around the world to get used to terrorist attacks,” Zelenskyy added in his evening speech late on Sunday. “The target of all these missiles is not just cities, villages or people. Their target is humanity and the foundations of our entire European culture.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/24/russia-says-it-foiled-a-ukrainian-drone-attack-on-moscow
"Hosting Lukashenko, Putin says Ukraine’s counteroffensive failed",The meeting was the first to be held between the two leaders since Minsk helped end a revolt by Russian Wagner fighters.,"Russia’s President Vladimir Putin saidUkraine’s counteroffensiveto take back land captured by his country “has failed” as he hosted his close ally, Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, for talks in Putin’s native city of St Petersburg. The meeting on Sunday was the first to be held between the two leaders since Minsk helped enda revolt by mercenariesfrom Russia’s Wagner Group of fighters. Belarus now hosts Wagner fighters on its territory, after Lukashenko brokered a deal that convinced Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin to end a march on Moscow and exile himself to Belarus. “There is no counteroffensive,” Russian news agencies quoted Lukashenko as saying. Putin interrupted: “It exists, but it has failed.” Ukraine began itslong-anticipated counteroffensivelast month, but has so far made only small gains against well-entrenched Russian forces who control more than a sixth of its territory after nearly 17 months of war.    A Telegram channel linked to Lukashenko quoted him as saying in a jocular tone that fighters of Russia’s Wagner Groupwho are now training Belarus’s armywere keen to push across the border into NATO member Poland. There was no indication that Lukashenko was seriously entertaining that idea. “They are asking to go West, ask me for permission … to go on a trip to Warsaw, to Rzeszow,” Lukashenko said, referring to Wagner fighters, to Putin, who smiled. “But of course, I am keeping them in central Belarus, like we agreed”. “We are controlling what is happening [with Wagner],” he said, thanking Putin for vowing to defend Belarus should it be attacked. The comments came two days after Putin said western Poland was a “gift” from Stalin at the end of World War II, when victorious allies decided on the contours of post-war Europe. Warsaw summoned the Russian ambassador over the remarks. On Thursday, the Belarusian defence ministry said Wagner fighters had started to train Belarusian special forces at a military range just a few miles from the Polish border. Accordingly, Poland is moving extra troops towards the border with Belarus. In response, Putin warned Poland on Friday that any aggression against Belarus would beconsidered an attack on Russia. He said Moscow would use all means it has to react to any hostility towards Minsk.   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/23/hosting-lukashenko-putin-says-ukraines-counteroffensive-failed
"Russian missile attack on Odesa kills one, damages cathedral","Ukrainian officials say air attack wounded 22 people, including several children, and severely damaged Odesa’s largest cathedral.","A Russian missile attack on the Ukrainian port city of Odesa has killed at least one person, wounded 22 and badly damaged an Orthodox cathedral, according to officials. Oleg Kiper, the governor of Odesa, said on the Telegram messaging app that those wounded in Sunday’s air attack included several children. “Odesa, another night attack of the monsters,” he said. “Fourteen people were hospitalised in the city’s hospitals, three of them were children,” he said. The assault also destroyed six houses and apartment buildings, he added. Russia has been pounding Odesa and other Ukrainian food export facilities nearly daily over the past week after it withdrew from a United Nations-brokered sea corridor agreement that allowed for the safe shipment of Ukrainian grain. Ukraine’s air force said on Telegram on Sunday that Russia launched high-precision Onyx missiles and sea-to-shore Kalibr cruise missiles on Odesa. The city’s military administration said air defence systems destroyed a “significant part” of the missiles, which they said included Iskander ballistic missiles. It added that the Spaso-Preobrazhenskyi Cathedral of the Moscow-linked Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) was severely damaged. “The Kasperovska icon of the Mother of God, who is the patroness of Odesa, was retrieved from under the rubble,” the administration said on its Telegram channel. The Spaso-Preobrazhenskyi Cathedral, or the Transfiguration Cathedral, is Odesa’s largest Orthodox church building. It was consecrated in 1809. Photos and videos published by Odesa officials and the police showed parts of the building destroyed and rubble inside, with several icons lined up on the ground. In one video, a distressed man is seen walking inside the dark cathedral, repeating, “The church is no longer … Lord, have mercy.” Al Jazeera could not immediately verify the videos or reports of the damage. The UOC is Ukraine’s second-largest church, though most Ukrainian Orthodox believers belong to a separate branch of the faith formed four years ago by uniting branches independent of Russian authority. Ukraine has accused the UOC of maintaining links to the pro-invasion Russian Orthodox Church, which used to be its parent church but with which the UOC says it broke ties in May last year. There was no immediate comment from Russia. Russia had described its recent attacks as revenge for a Ukrainian strike on a Russian-built bridge to Crimea – the Ukrainian Black Sea peninsula that Russia seized in 2014. It has accused Ukraine of using the sea corridor to launch “terrorist attacks”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/23/russian-missile-attack-on-odesa-kills-one-damages-cathedral

Russia accuses Kyiv of using cluster bombs as journalist killed,"Russia’s foreign ministry said the killing of Rostislav Zhuravlev is ‘a heinous, premeditated crime’ committed by the West and Kyiv.","A Russian journalist has been killed near the front line in Ukraine’s southeasternZaporizhia region, Russia’s defence ministry said, as Moscow accused Kyiv of usingcluster munitions supplied by the United Statesthis month in the attack. Rostislav Zhuravlev, a war correspondent for Russia’s RIA news agency, was killed and three other Russian journalists were wounded in a Ukrainian artillery attack on Saturday, the Russian defence ministry said, adding they were evacuated from the battlefield but Zhuravlev died during the journey. “As a result of a strike by the Ukrainian army using cluster munitions, four journalists were wounded in various levels of severity,” the Russian army said in a statement. It said the other correspondents have wounds of “medium severity”. Journalist Daniel Hawkins, speaking from Moscow, said that there has been a “furious reaction” from Moscow regarding the incident. “Russia’s deputy ambassador to the United Nations, Dmitry Polyansky, said that this attack has crossed all moral red lines,” Hawkins said, adding that Konstantin Kosachev, the vice deputy speaker of the Russian Federation Council, said that Ukraine and Washington bore equal responsibility for the attack. The Russian foreign ministry said Zhuravlev’s death is “a heinous, premeditated crime” committed by Western powers and Kyiv. “Everything indicates that the attack on the group of journalists was not carried out by chance,” the Russian foreign ministry said.    Maria Zakharova, the foreign ministry spokeswoman, denounced what she called “criminal terror” by Ukraine and said, without providing evidence, that the attack appeared deliberate. “Those responsible for the brutal reprisal against a Russian journalist will inevitably suffer well-deserved punishment,” she said. She also said the responsibility for the killing also lies with those who supplied Ukraine with cluster munitions. According to the ministry, “The journalists were gathering material for a report on the bombing by the Kyiv regime militants of settlements in the Zaporizhzhia region using cluster munitions banned in many countries around the world”. The RIA agency also reported Zhuravlev’s death, saying he was killed near the front-line village of Piatykhatky. No comment was immediately available from Ukraine on the incident.    The defence ministry said Ukraine had used cluster munitions in the incident, but did not provide evidence for this and Reuters was not able to verify it independently. Separately, the governor of Russia’sBelgorod regionsaid that Ukraine fired cluster munitions at a village near the Ukrainian border on Friday, but that there were no casualties or damage. “In Belgorod district, 21 artillery shells and three cluster munitions from a multiple-launch rocket system were fired at the village of Zhuravlevka,” Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said. Ukraine received cluster bombs from the United States this month, but it has pledged to use them only to dislodge concentrations of enemy soldiers. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said this week that Ukrainian forces were using them appropriately and effectively against Russian formations. Such weapons contain dozens of small bomblets that rain shrapnel over a wide area, but are banned in many countries due to the potential danger they pose to civilians. Ukraine has repeatedly said their use will be limited to the battlefield. The United Nations has said Russia itself has repeatedly used cluster munitions during the war. Meanwhile, a Ukrainian drone attack on Crimea blew up an ammunition depot, sparking evacuations on the Moscow-annexed peninsula and halting rail traffic. The Ukrainian military confirmed it had launched the drone attack, claiming through its press service that it had destroyed an oil depot and Russian arms warehouses in the Krasnohvardiiske area, although without specifying what weapons were used. The Moscow-installed head of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, said an “enemy” drone had detonated an ammunition depot and ordered the evacuation of people living within five kilometres(3.1 miles) of the zone. “As a result of an attack by an enemy drone on the Krasnogvardeisky district, an ammunition depot detonated,” Aksyonov said on Telegram, referring to an area that lies inland at the centre of Crimea. Rail traffic was briefly pro-Russian authorities later said that traffic was restored but “limited”. Crimea,annexed by Russiain 2014, has been targeted by Kyiv throughout Moscow’s 17-month-long Ukraine offensive but has come under more intense, increased attacks in recent weeks. The attack came less than a week after a Ukrainian predawn attack on the Kerch bridge – which links the peninsula to Russia – killed two Russians and prompted Moscow to exit a landmark grain export deal. The 19km (12-mile) road and rail bridge is a vital logistics link for Russian forces, and is also heavily used by Russian tourists who flock to Crimea in summer. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Friday that the bridge was a legitimate target because it was a military supply route for Russia. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian president said on Saturday that he discussed the “unblocking” of the Black Sea grain corridor with NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg. Russiaended the international grain agreementlast week, which had allowed Ukraine to sell some 33 million tonnes of grain and food abroad since last summer, despite the continuing Russian invasion of Ukraine. “We shared assessments of the current situation in the Black Sea and the risks it poses for global food security,” Zelenskyy said on Twitter after a phone call with Stoltenberg. “We also identified with Mr Stoltenberg the priority and future steps necessary for unblocking and sustainable operation of the Black Sea grain corridor.” Moscow said its end of the deal was not being upheld, such as implementing a parallel agreement in order to ease rules for its own food and fertiliser exports.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/22/russian-journalist-killed-three-wounded-near-ukraine-frontline

Belgorod region, bordering Ukraine, has been repeatedly targeted by what Russia says is indiscriminate shelling by Ukraine’s armed forces. In May and June, the regionwas rocked by violenceafter fighters from a pro-Ukrainian armed group crossed the border and started battling with Russian security forces. Ukraine does not claim responsibility for attacks inside Russian territory and denied it was involved in the cross-border raids. Meanwhile on Saturday in Crimea, an ammunition depot caught fire after a Ukrainian drone attack on the Black Sea peninsula, the region’s Moscow-appointed governor has claimed, adding that road traffic on the bridge linking Crimea to Russia had been suspended. “As a result of an enemy drone on the Krasnogvardeisky district, there was a detonation at an ammunition depot,” official Sergei Aksyonov said on Telegram. “A decision was taken to evacuate people (living) within five kilometres (3.1 miles)” of the zone, he said. No deaths or injuries have been reported so far, Moscow-appointed governor Aksyonov said. He added that orders had been given to evacuate nearby villages. Crimea,annexed by Moscow in 2014, has been targeted throughout Russia’s Ukraine offensive but has come under increasing attack in recent weeks. Videos showing a large fire are being shared online and in some videos, explosions can be heard. There were initial reports of an attack on a fuel depot. Rail traffic resumed after having been suspended earlier, Aksyonov announced on Telegram. Russia accuses Ukraine of carrying out the attacks on the bridge. However, while officials in Kyiv have welcomed them, they have refused to take responsibility. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Friday that the bridge was a legitimate target because it was a military supply route for Russia. “This is the route used to feed the war with ammunition and this is being done on a daily basis,” he said. On Monday, the road was put out of service after an attack that killed two people. The bridge had only recently returned to full operation after being damaged in a bomb blast last October.

"Any Polish aggression on Belarus is attack on Russia, Putin says",Russian president says his country will retaliate against any attack on its ally with all means at its disposal as Poland denies having any territorial ambitions in Belarus.,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has accused Poland ofhaving territorial ambitions in the former Soviet Unionand said any aggression against its neighbour and ally Belarus would be considered an attack on Russia itself. In televised remarks on Friday, Putin warned that Moscow would use any means at its disposal to protect Belarus, which forms a loose Union State with Russia, against possible attacks. Putin said there were reports of plans for a Polish-Lithuanian unit to be used for operations in western Ukraine – parts of which in the past belonged to Poland – and ultimately to occupy territory there. “But as far asBelarusis concerned, it is part of the Union State. Unleashing aggression against Belarus will mean aggression against the Russian Federation,” Putin said at a meeting of the Kremlin’s Security Council. “We will respond to this with all the means at our disposal.” “It is well known that they also dream of theBelarusian lands,” he said, also without providing any evidence. Poland, a NATO member and one of Ukraine’s staunchest allies in its fight against Russia’s invasion, denied any territorial ambitions in Ukraine or Belarus. “The pathetic bore from the Kremlin is once again repeating lies about Poland and also trying to falsify the truth about the war against Ukraine,” Poland’s deputy minister coordinator of special services, Stanislaw Zaryn, told the state-owned PAP news agency. “Vladimir Putin is also using historical revisionism again to spread false accusations against Poland.” In his remarks, Putin argued Poland’s western territories were a “gift” from former Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. “It was thanks to the Soviet Union, thanks to steps taken by Stalin, that Poland got substantial territories in the West – German land. This is a fact,” Putin said. “Western Polish territories are Stalin’s gift to Poland. Have our friends in Warsaw forgotten about it? We’ll give them a reminder.” Putin’s comments are a message that “Poland has to be grateful to the Soviet Union, to Russia, and instead they are becoming more of an enemy to Russia,” said Nina Khrushcheva, professor of international affairs at the New School and great-granddaughter of former Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. “Also this is a message to the Ukrainians: ‘Please remember that for many years Ukraine and Poland were not great friends, and so now you’re being duped.’ So this is a multilayered propaganda message on the Kremlin’s part,” she told Al Jazeera from Moscow.    Poland has reinforced its defences at the border withBelarus, where fighters from the Wagner mercenary force moved after an aborted mutiny in Russia last month. Warsaw’s Security Committee decided on Wednesday to move military units to eastern Poland afterWagner fighters arrived in Belarus, PAP quoted its secretary as saying on Friday. On Wednesday, Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin was shown in a video welcoming his fighters to Belarus, telling them they would take no further part for now in the war in Ukraine but ordering them to gather strength for Wagner’s operations in Africa while they trained the Belarusian army. Prigozhin’s short-lived insurrection four weeks ago ended with an agreement that Wagner fighters – many recruited from prison – could move to Belarus if they wished. On Thursday, Minsk said Wagner mercenaries had started to train Belarusian special forces at a military range close to the Polish border. Poland responded by deploying troops near its eastern border. “These are hardened war criminals, so of course, any Polish government would be concerned,” Radoslaw Sikorski, Poland’s former defence minister, told Al Jazeera. “The first duty of any government is to protect its external and international border and the people on our side.” Poland has provided Kyiv with arms and welcomed refugees since Russia’s invasion in February 2022. It has, however, shown no interest in sending troops to Ukraine. Putin accused its leaders of trying to “directly intervene in the conflict” to occupy Ukrainian land. Belarus –which borders Ukraine, the European Union and NATO members Poland and Lithuania – served as a launch pad for Russia’s Ukraine invasion. “With Belarus and the Wagner Group being there and Poland bringing troops to the border with Belarus and Poland also saying it would potentially like to carry a NATO nuclear arsenal to some degree – that’s why I think Poland has become a piece of rhetoric in the Kremlin,” Khrushcheva said.

Russia detains ex-separatist commander Igor Girkin,"The Russian nationalist, who criticised the way Russia is running its war in Ukraine, was taken from his home in Moscow.","Russian investigators have detained prominent Russian nationalist Igor Girkin, who had publicly accused President Vladimir Putin and the army’s top brass of not prosecuting the war in Ukraine harshly or effectively enough. Friday’s move, reported by his wife, his lawyer and the RBC news outlet, suggested the authorities have wearied of his criticism of what they call Russia’s “special military operation”. The arrest followed an abortive mutiny last month led by another outspoken critic, Yevgeny Prigozhin, boss of the Wagner mercenary force, who is still free, but has sharply curtailed his own verbal attacks. Girkin, also known as Igor Strelkov, helped Russia annex Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and then organise pro-Russian militias who took control of part of eastern Ukraine from Kyiv. The 52-year-old former military commander of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, was also handed a life sentence in absentia by a Dutch court in 2022 for his alleged role in the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine in 2014, with the loss of 298 passengers and crew. The former Federal Security Service (FSB) officer had been regarded by many as untouchable due to his background and ties to the authorities, but had become more outspoken in recent months. Girkin announced in May that he and others had set up the “Club of Angry Patriots”, to enter politics to save Russia from what he said was the danger of turmoil due to military failures in Ukraine. Asked at the time if he was naive to think he could launch a political movement without the assent of the Kremlin, he said, “I hope you would not call me a naive person.” In one of his most outspoken tirades on July 18, in a post on his official Telegram channel, read by about 800,000 people, Girkin peppered Putin with personal insults and urged him to transfer power “to someone truly capable and responsible”. “The country will not survive another six years of this cowardly mediocrity in power,” he wrote. In a message posted on Girkin’s official Telegram account, his wife, Miroslava Reginskaya, said, “Today, at about 11:30 am [08:30 GMT], representatives of the Investigative Committee came to our house. I was not at home. Soon, according to the concierge, they took my husband out by his arms and in an unknown direction.” She said friends had told her Girkin had been charged with extremism. “I do not know anything about my husband’s whereabouts, he has not contacted me,” she said. “He has been detained by law enforcement,” lawyer Alexander Molokhov told the AFP news agency. Molokhov said he had not seen any documents relating to Girkin’s detention yet and was now working to secure access to his client. There was no immediate comment from the authorities.    RBC, citing two unnamed law enforcement sources, said Girkin’s Moscow home was being searched and that he had been detained over a complaint against him made by a former Wagner employee. Tatiana Stanovaya, founder of the R.Politik analysis firm, said the men who run Russia’s law enforcement and power ministries had long wanted to arrest Girkin. “Strelkov [Girkin] had overstepped all conceivable boundaries a long time ago,” she said. “This is a direct outcome of Prigozhin’s mutiny: The army’s command now wields greater political leverage to quash its opponents in the public sphere.” Stanovaya said Girkin’s detention was a signal that any of the bitterest critics of Moscow’s approach to the war could face prosecution. Russia is set to hold a presidential election next year. Criticism of Russia’s assault on Ukraine has been outlawed, and all key liberal opposition figures are either behind bars or in exile.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/21/russia-detains-ex-separatist-commander-igor-girkin
US says Ukraine’s use of cluster bombs against Russia ‘effective’,White House national security spokesman says controversial US-provided bombs used against Russian military positions.,"Controversial cluster munitionssupplied by the United States are being used “effectively” by Ukrainian forces in their counteroffensive against Russia’s invasion, a senior Washington defence official said. “We have gotten some initial feedback from the Ukrainians, and they’re using them quite effectively,” White House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters on Thursday. “They are using them appropriately, they are using them effectively,” Kirby said, adding that additional details could be obtained from Ukraine.    Kirby also said the US-provided cluster bombs– which are banned by more than 120 countries – were having an impact on Russian defensive formations and the manoeuvring of Russia’s forces. Citing an anonymous Ukrainian source, the Washington Post newspaper reported on Thursday that Kyiv’s forces are using cluster munitions against “well-fortified Russian positions that have slowed Ukraine’s summer offensive”. According to the Washington Post, Russian front line positions in the east and south of Ukraine, which have successfully slowed Ukraine’s counteroffensive, have been “densely mined with antitank and antipersonnel mines and trip wires in areas” between 4.8km and 16km deep (three to 10 miles).    Cluster munitions are being used to “break up” Russian trenches, a Ukrainian military official told the newspaper. Washington, DC-based think tank, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), said on Thursday that Ukraine’s presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak had “reiterated that the Ukrainian counteroffensive will be slow and difficult but will prevent Russian forces from retaking the battlefield initiative”. #Ukraine's#counteroffensiveagainst#Russia's invasion has enormous ramifications for the future of global security. Follow and support#ISWas we explain the strategic implications of the#UkraineWar.https://t.co/zKMBVh2Ty3pic.twitter.com/4cEL4sw8eI — ISW (@TheStudyofWar)July 21, 2023  The US and Ukraine have received broad criticism for the provision and use of cluster munitions on the battlefield and which have been banned by many countries because of the long-term risks posed to civilians. Human Rights Watch said earlier this month that Russia had “extensively used cluster munitions, causing many civilian deaths and serious injuries”, while Ukrainian rocket attacks using cluster munitions on the then-Russian-occupiedcity of Izyumin 2022 had killed at least eight civilians and wounded 15 more. The rights group said that both Kyiv and Moscow should stop using such “indiscriminate weapons” that had killed civilians. Cluster weapons typically release large numbers of smaller bomblets that can kill indiscriminately over a wide area, and those that fail to explode pose a danger for decades after. Following confirmation that the US was providing the banned weapons to Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin said his forces would also use cluster munitions – though military experts believe the Kremlin has already deployed such munitions in its war against Ukraine.    Ukraine has pledged to use the cluster bombs only to dislodge concentrations of Russian enemy soldiers, but each side has accused the other of already using cluster bombs in the conflict. Reuters news agency reported on Thursday that on the front line near Kupiansk, a railway hub Ukraine recaptured last month in the east of the country’s Kharvik region, a Ukrainian artillery unit commander said his forces had received newly issued cluster munitions, and could start firing them soon: “Maybe today or tomorrow.” While the use of cluster bombs does not violate international law, using them against civilians can be a violation, and a convention banning their use as been joined by more than 120 countries. Signatory countries have agreed not to use, produce, transfer or stockpile the weapons, and to destroy those in their inventories. The US, Russia and Ukraine have not signed that agreement.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/21/us-says-ukraines-use-of-cluster-bombs-against-russia-effective

EU draws up plans for $22bn Ukraine weapons fund,"Fund to provide Ukraine with weapons and military aid over four years, new EU proposal says.","The European Union is drawing up plans for a 20-billion-euro ($22bn) fund to provide Ukraine withweapons, ammunition and military aidas it fights Russia’s invasion, officials have said. Josep Borrell, the bloc’s foreign policy chief, outlined the four-year proposal to EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels on Thursday. Following the meeting, Borrell said the EU would “transform existing support into a long-term commitment” to Ukraine’s security and resilience. “We propose the creation of a dedicated section on the European peace facility to provide up to five billion euros a year for the next four years for the defence needs of Ukraine,” he said. “This is the evaluation of the needs and the costs of our long-term security commitments to Ukraine,” Borrell told reporters.    The proposal cameamid an international driveto give Ukraine long-term security assurances, as announced by members of the G7 group on the sidelines of last week’s NATO summit in Lithuania’s capital, Vilnius. At that summit, NATO leaderssaidUkraine should be able to join the military alliance in the future but stopped short of offering it an immediate invitation – an outcome that was not what Ukrainian officials had hoped for. “Ukraine’s future is in NATO,” they said in a declaration but offered no timeline for the process. Mindful of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s disappointment over his hopes for a membership timetable, Western officials stressed that there would be a broader package of support proposals designed to give Ukraine a military edge over Russian forces.    EU foreign ministers were shown the fund plan at Thursday’s foreign affairs council, but a more detailed debate will take place on August 31 at their meeting in the Spanish city of Toledo. Some member states, notably Hungary, may oppose the idea, and final political approval is not expected until European leaders meet at EU summits in October or even December. The European Peace Facility (EPF), created in 2021, is meant to finance actions that prevent conflicts, build peace and strengthen international security. It was initially worth $6.3bn, but has since grown to $13.4bn. The facility is used to reimburse EU countries for at least part of the cost of weapons,ammunitionand other military aid that they give to nations outside the bloc. Hungary is still holding up the disbursement of $556m in current EPF funds for Ukraine aid, demanding that Hungarian bank OTP first be removed from a Ukrainian blacklist. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said Budapest would take the same stance with the new proposal. “Neither for the 500 million blocked so far, nor for the 20 billion now proposed, are we willing to engage in any kind of negotiations as long as OTP is on this list,” he told reporters.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/20/eu-draws-up-plans-for-22bn-ukraine-weapons-fund
Russian prosecutors seek 20 more years in prison for Navalny,"Putin’s most prominent opponent faces new charges, which he says are fabricated to keep him out of political life.","Russia’s state prosecutors have requested a 20-year prison sentence for jailed opposition leaderAlexey Navalnyon charges including “extremism”, according to state news agency TASS. The verdict will be announced on August 4, TASS cited a lawyer as saying. Navalny condemned Russia’s war in Ukraine during Thursday’s closed-door court hearing, according to a statement released by his aides. “[Russia is] floundering in a pool of either mud or blood, with broken bones, with a poor and robbed population, and around it lie tens of thousands of people killed in the most stupid and senseless war of the 21st century,” he said. Navalny isalready servingan 11.5-year prison sentence over fraud and other charges, in a maximum security penal colony in Melekhovo, 250 kilometres (150 miles) east of Moscow. President Vladimir Putin’s most prominent and vocal opponent faces agrab-bag of new charges, which he says are similarly fabricated to keep him out of political life. Court records showed they related to six different articles of the Russian criminal code, including inciting and financing extremist activity and creating an extremist organisation. The latest request by prosecutors against the Kremlin’s biggest rival could see47-year-old Navalnyremain behind bars for at least 20 more years.    Navalny, who exposed official corruption and organised significant anti-Kremlin protests, was arrested in January 2021 upon returning to Moscow after recuperating in Germany from nerve agent poisoning that he blamed on the Kremlin. He said that prosecutors had provided him with 3,828 pages describing all the crimes he is alleged to have committed while in prison. “Although it’s clear from the size of the tomes that I am a sophisticated and persistent criminal, it’s impossible to find out what exactly I am accused of,” Navalny said. While imprisoned, the anti-corruption crusader has spent months in a tiny one-person cell, also called a “punishment cell”, for purported disciplinary violations, such as an alleged failure to properly button his prison robe, properly introduce himself to a guard or to wash his face at a specified time. Navalny has complained of health problems since being jailed and experienced significant weight loss due to amystery illness. His associates and supporters have accused prison authorities of failing to provide him with proper medical assistance and voiced concern about his failing health. Russia has outlawed Navalny’s campaign organisation as part of a crackdown on dissent that started well before the conflict in Ukraine and has intensified in the nearly 17 months since it started. Navalny has repeatedly denounced Putin’s war in Ukraine, describing it as a “tragedy” and saying Moscow’s defeat was “inevitable”. The Kremlin has denied persecuting Navalny and said his case is a matter for the courts. The opposition leader – a lawyer by training – has taken prison officials to court to retain access to what he sees as basic prisoner rights. Navalny built a huge social media following by producing videos providing evidence of systemic corruption among Russian elites. He still communicates on social media through his team.

Wheat at 3-week high as Ukraine port attacks cause supply fear,"Countries seeking supply alternatives as Russian attack on Ukraine’s Odesa port threatens grain supplies, featuring a 1.6 percent spike in wheat futures.","Chicago wheat futures rose 1.6 percent to hit a three-week high, supported by growing expectations that an attack on Ukrainian ports after Russia’s withdrawal from a Black Sea export deal will have a longer-term effect on global supplies. Russianstrikes on Ukrainian portareas continued on Thursday, destroying critical export infrastructure and tens of thousands of tonnes of grain, local authorities said, after Moscow warned that ships heading to Ukraine’s Black Sea ports could be considered military targets. Russia shut Ukraine’s ports after its invasion of the country early last year but allowed them to reopen a year ago underthe grain deal, with Turkey and the United Nations supervising inspections of vessels with Russian participation.    The most-active wheat contract on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) added 1.6 percent to $7.39 a bushel, as of 05:16 GMT on Thursday after climbing more than 8 percent on Wednesday. The market hit its highest since June 26. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday accused Western countries of perverting the expired Black Sea grain deal for their own ends, but said Moscow would immediatelyreturn to the agreementif all its conditions were met.    Asian millers, which have bought more than 1 million metric tonnes of Black Sea wheat for shipment in coming months, will seek alternatives as attacks on Ukrainian ports after the collapse of a safe passage deal spark longer-term supply risks, traders and analysts said. “Traders and mills will be looking for alternative sources of supply,” said one Singapore-based trader at an international trading company, adding that they will be potentially looking at sources in Europe and other countries on the Black Sea. Supply constraintsfrom the key Black Sea region add further uncertainty amid the prospect of dry El Nino weather threatening crops across Asia, exacerbating worries over food inflation. “The market was hopeful that navies of other countries might escort shipment of goods in and out of Ukraine regardless of Russia not renewing the grain corridor,” said Rabobank senior grains analyst Dennis Voznesenski. Millers in the Middle East, Africa and Asia, which are heavily reliant on Black Sea supplies, have bought millions of metric tonnes of wheat and corn from the region, which is entering its peak export season with freshly harvested crops reaching the market.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/20/wheat-at-3-week-high-as-ukraine-port-attacks-cause-supply-fear

"Ukrainian push stalls, Russia’s command baulks, food crisis looms",Russia has ended the Black Sea grain deal in retaliation for Ukraine attempting to make a military breakthrough.,"An impasse has appeared to descend on the Russia-Ukraine war which is now in its 73rd week. Ukraine’s counteroffensive has made small gains and Russia launched a new offensive. Kyiv may have attempted to break that deadlock by disrupting Moscow’s arms supplies across the Kerch bridge, which is the only connection between Russia and the Crimean peninsula. Russian authorities accused Ukraine of using two naval surface drones toblow up the bridgeon July 17. A massive explosion left a section of road deck hanging askew over the Black Sea, in what Russia decided to treat as a “terrorist” incident.  Gunfire preceded the explosion. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mikhail Khusnullin reported to President Vladimir Putin that there was no damage to the supports holding up the road deck, and that the damage was fully reparable by November. Independent media reported that the only remaining route from Crimea to Russia, via southern Ukraine’s occupied region of Zaporizhia, was clogged with military and civilian traffic. In May last year, Ukraine’s military intelligence confirmed Kyiv was behind another explosion in November that sank a section of the bridge’s road deck and damaged a parallel railway line. In retaliation, Russia said it was withdrawing from an agreement allowing the shipment of Ukrainian grain out of the Black Sea, brokered last July by the United Nations and Turkey. To enforce this, Russia launched an overnight missile attack on Odesa and Chernomorsk, two of the three ports authorised to export grain under the deal, destroying silos and loading equipment. Ukraine’s agriculture ministry said the raids destroyed 60,000 tonnes of grain in Chernomorsk. Russia’s defence ministry claimed that thousands of tonnes of fuel oil had been destroyed as well. “According to experts, it will take at least a year to fully restore the objects that were damaged,” said Ukraine’s agriculture ministry, predicting a global food crisis similar to that in the first five months of the war. “If we cannot export food, the population of the poorest countries will be on the verge of survival,” said Ukrainian Agriculture Minister Mykola Solskyi. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen condemned Russia’s actions, saying that the “EU is working to ensure food security for the world’s vulnerable” by using rail and barge transport.    More than six weeks into a Ukrainian counteroffensive, neither side seemed to be making significant territorial gains. Eastern forces spokesman Serhiy Cherevaty said progress in Bakhmut, on the eastern front, was deliberately slow because Ukrainian forces had to contend with extensive minefields. “We conduct detailed and step-by-step planning on how to pass minefields and obstacles,” he said in a television interview. Southern forces commander Brigadier General Oleksandr Tarnavskyi told CNN that “complex and dense minefields” also plagued the southern front. An unnamed Ukrainian official told theWashington PostKyiv had received less than 15 percent of the mine-clearing equipment it had asked for. Al Jazeera has previously reported on satellite photography showingkilometres-deep lines of defenceRussia had prepared. On the southern front, Ukraine claimed to have advanced more than 1.7km towards Melitopol on July 14, and Ukraine’s general staff said their forces were still on the offensive two days later, advancing a kilometre towards Berdyansk. Ukraine has portrayed the two port cities as its main objectives on this front. On the eastern front, Ukraine continued a flanking operation north and south of Bakhmut, hoping to encircle Russian troops in the city, but faced stiff resistance. Ukrainian troops appeared to be pinned down in the northern manoeuvre on July 16. However, two days later, deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said they had again advanced to capture almost all the dominant heights above the city. After months of going head-to-head with Ukraine in Bakhmut, Russia succeeded in launching a new offensive in the east. On July 14, it began an advance towards Kupiansk in the Kharkiv region, trying to push Ukrainian forces to the west bank of the Oskil river – a position Russia had held until September. “We are on the defensive,” Hanna Maliar wrote on Telegram. Ukraine’s general staff said its forces were holding their lines of defence. On July 18, Maliar said Ukrainian troops had retaken the initiative and suggested a logic for Russia’s Kupiansk offensive. “This is happening in response to our offensive in Bakhmut … in order to stretch our forces so that we cannot concentrate on the area where we are attacking,” Maliar said in a telethon. Russia’s defence ministry claimed that Russian forces had advanced up to 2km along the front and up to 1.5km in depth in Kupiansk. The New York Times reporteda change in Ukrainian tacticsthat partly explained the counteroffensive’s slow progress. Ukrainian forces were focused on wearing down Russian defenders with artillery and long-range missiles instead of large-scale assaults, in an effort to conserve manpower and equipment, it reported. The change came after Russia reportedly destroyed afifth of Ukraine’s Western military kitin the opening two weeks of the counteroffensive, and led to the loss of just 10 percent of the kit in the weeks since. Despite its stout defence, Russia appeared to suffer from insubordination from top commanders. A colleague of Major General Ivan Popov’s made his address to his troops public after he was dismissed from the command of the 58th CAA. Popov had complained about shortcomings on the front facing a Ukrainian counteroffensive south of Orikhiv, in western Zaporizhia, directly to Russia’s Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov. Russian military reporters said he complained that his troops needed to be rotated because they had been serving on the front lines since October. But Popov revealed other weaknesses as well, in a translation of his remarks by independent news outlet Meduza. “I didn’t sugarcoat it. I pinpointed the main tragedy of today’s warfare: the lack of counterbattery fire, the lack of artillery reconnaissance stations, and the mass death and mutilation of all our brothers by enemy artillery,” Popov was reported as having said, suggesting that Ukraine’s counteroffensive was taking a serious toll on Russian troops. A series of senior commander dismissals led to speculation among Russian sources on July 15 that the Russian defence ministry may be preparing to arrest Airborne Forces (VDV) Commander Colonel General Mikhail Teplinsky. Russian military reporters posted an audio excerpt the following day, purporting to be elements of the 7th VDV Division threatening to withdraw from their positions in occupied Kherson if the Russian defence establishment arrested Teplinsky. The dismissal of Popov and speculation over Teplinsky came after the Wagner mercenary group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin mutinied against the defence ministry command last month. “Popov’s… Teplinsky’s and… Prigozhin’s challenges to [Chief of Staff Valery] Gerasimov’s and [defence minister Sergei] Shoigu’s authority have established a precedent for insubordination that can hollow out support for the Russian military command among senior officers,” said the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/20/ukrainian-push-stalls-russias-command-baulks-food-crisis-looms

The warning, issued in a statement on Thursday by Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence, said this takes effect at midnight on Friday (21:00 GMT Thursday). In its message, the Ukraine ministry also recalled the fate of the Russian cruiser Moskva, which was sunk by missiles more than a year ago. The Ukrainian navy has already used naval drones several times against the Russian Black Sea fleet and presumably also against the bridge to the Crimea peninsula. Earlier, Russia had also threatened ships calling at Ukrainian ports, withdrawing their previous security guarantees. Russia said ships travelling to Ukraine’s Black Sea portswill be considered potential military targets, asKyiv said it would set up a temporary shipping route to continue grain exportsfollowing Moscow’s withdrawal from a deal that permitted food shipments from Ukraine’s ports. Russia’s defence ministry said on Wednesday that it would deem all ships travelling to Ukraine to be potentially carrying military cargo on behalf of Kyiv and “the flag countries of such ships will be considered parties to the Ukrainian conflict”. In a statement on the Telegram messaging app, the defence ministry said it would implement its new stance towards ships in the Black Sea starting at midnight Moscow time (21:00 GMT Wednesday). The defence ministry did not say what actions it might take towards ships travelling to Ukraine. Russia also declared southeastern and northwestern parts of the Black Sea’s international waters to be temporarily unsafe for navigation, the ministry said, without giving details about the parts of the sea which would be affected.    Ukraine said on Wednesday it was establishing a temporary shipping route via Romania, one of the neighbouring Black Sea countries. “Its goal is to facilitate the unblocking of international shipping in the northwestern part of the Black Sea,” Vasyl Shkurakov, Ukraine’s acting minister for communities, territories and infrastructure development, said in a letter to the United Nations shipping agency, the International Maritime Organization. Reporting for Al Jazeera from Moscow, Yulia Shapovalova said that Russia’s defence ministry issued a statement addressing all international ships travelling towards Ukrainian ports and stating that “at midnight, July the 20th, all ships sailing in the Black Sea and approaching Ukrainian ports will be considered carriers of military cargo involved in the Ukrainian conflict on the Kyiv side.” The announcement from Moscow on Wednesday came as a senior White House official said that Russia was considering attacking civilian ships on the Black Sea and then putting the blame on Ukrainian forces. “Our information indicates that Russia laid additional sea mines in the approaches to Ukrainian ports,” White House National Security Council spokesman Adam Hodge said in a statement, the Associated Press news agency reported. “We believe that this is a coordinated effort to justify any attacks against civilian ships in the Black Sea and lay blame on Ukraine for these attacks,” Hodge said. Russia was using food as a “weapon of war”, US state department spokesman Matthew Miller also said on Wednesday, noting that Moscow had made threats against ships in international waters on two consecutive days and attackedthe Ukrainian port city of Odesa for two nights in a row.    “I think it ought to be quite clear to everyone in the world right now that Russia is using food as a weapon of war,” Miller told reporters. “Not just against the Ukrainian people, but against all the people in the world, especially the most underdeveloped countries who depend on grain from the region,” he said. UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said the Russian warning to shipping “underscores that we’re trying to work and continue to work in what is effectively a warzone”. The beginning of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine last year saw Ukraine’s Black Sea ports blockaded by warships until the Black Sea grain deal, brokered by the UN and Turkey,re-opened Ukraine’s ports and the exports of Ukrainian grain to global markets. The Kremlin said it was exiting the deal on Monday, after months of complaining that a related agreement allowing for the export of Russian food and fertilisers had not been honoured. Moscow had also accused Ukraine of using the Black Sea grain corridor for “combat purposes”. Russia’s withdrawal from the agreement has been internationally condemned, as it revived fears of rising grain and food prices. Poorer countries in Africa in particular are dependent on Ukrainian grain. Russian President Vladimir Putin said once again on Wednesday that Moscow would not return to the one-year-old deal unless certain demands were met.    Those include assurances that Russian fertilisers and food exports could reach the global market. The US and the European Union deny that their sanctions are prohibiting the export of the commodities. Earlier on Wednesday,Russia launched a massive missile and drone attack on the Ukrainian port city of Odesafor the second night in a row. Odesa was the main point of departure for Ukrainian agricultural exports under the now-defunct grain agreement. Port facilities with a grain terminal and a cooking oil terminal were hit, the Ukrainian military said, as well as storage tanks and ship-loading facilities. In the Odesa city area, storage buildings were destroyed, it said. “We haven’t seen such a big attack since the beginning of the large-scale [Russian] invasion.” Odesa Mayor Hennadiy Trukhanov wrote on Facebook on Wednesday.    Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the attacks on Odesa had destroyed approximately 60,000 tonnes of grain, and Moscow was attacking the port deliberately after withdrawing from the grain export deal. Today's 🇷🇺 terrorists' attack on Odesa proves that their target is not only 🇺🇦, and not only the lives of our people. About a million tons of food is stored in the ports that were attacked today. This is the volume that should have been delivered to consumer countries in Africa…pic.twitter.com/7jbz9TaqKg — Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa)July 19, 2023  “Russian terrorists are absolutely deliberately targeting the grain agreement infrastructure, and every Russian missile is a blow not only to Ukraine but to everyone in the world who aspires to a normal and safe life,” he wrote on Telegram. Zelenskyy later used his nightly address to the nation on Wednesday to appeal for Western partners to help Ukraine bolster its air defences in order to counter attacks like the one Odesa experienced.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/20/russia-warns-ships-traveling-to-ukraine-considered-part-of-war
Prigozhin in video tells Wagner troops to prepare ‘for Africa’,Mutinous mercenary boss appears in video welcoming fighters in Belarus and telling them they will not participate in Ukraine war for now.,"A new video appears to show the head of Russia’s mercenary Wagner Group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, welcoming his fighters to Belarus, telling them they would take no further part in the Ukraine war for now but to prepare for “a new journey toAfrica“. The footage, published by Prigozhin’s press service on Telegram on Wednesday, is the first video evidence of his whereabouts since Wagner’sfailed mutinylast month against Russia’s top military brass. “Welcome lads … Welcome to Belarusian soil,” Prigozhin said. “We fought honourably,” he added. “You have done a great deal for Russia. What is going on at the front is a disgrace that we do not need to get involved in.”    On June 23-24, Prigozhin’s heavily armed troops took control of the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don and its military command centre steering Russia’s campaign in Ukraine. They then drove an armed convoy within 200km (125 miles) of the capital, Moscow, on what Prigozhin said was a “march for justice” aimed at removing corrupt and incompetent Russian commanders. Russian President Vladimir Putin initially pledged to crush the mutiny, but hours later a deal struck by his ally Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko averted an armed confrontation. Under the deal, Prigozhin and his fighters were expected to move operations to Belarus. But earlier this month, Lukashenko said Prigozhin had visited the country then returned to Russia. After it was confirmed last week that Prigozhin had met Putin days after the failed mutiny, Belarus announced that Wagner fighters would be training its soldiers at a military range southeast of the capital, Minsk. In the video, the authenticity of which was not immediately verified, Prigozhin told his men to behave well towards the Belarusian locals and collect their strength for Africa, where the mercenary group has played anincreasingly central rolein several long-running internal conflicts. “And perhaps we will return to the SMO [special military operation in Ukraine] at some point when we are sure that we will not be forced to shame ourselves,” Prigozhin said. Since 2018, Wagner has been operating in a number of African countries, including the Central African Republic (CAR), Libya and Mali. On Monday, the CAR’s presidency said dozens of Wagner fighters had arrived to help secure a constitutional referendum on July 30. The video, which was shot after night had fallen, also showed Prigozhin receiving a Wagner black flag, decorated with the motto “Blood, Honour, Motherland, Courage”, from their camp in southern Russia. Dmitry Utkin – a former special forces officer in Russia’s GRU military intelligence, who helped found the Wagner Group – also spoke to the men. “This is not the end. This is just the beginning of the biggest work in the world that will be carried out very soon,” Utkin said before switching to English. “And welcome to hell!” ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/19/prigozhin-in-video-tells-wagner-troops-to-prepare-for-africa
‘Join hands with us’: Britain’s MI6 chief urges Russians to spy,"Richard Moore’s invitation follows a similar call by the CIA two months ago, and is certain to provoke anger at the Kremlin.","The head of Britain’s MI6 intelligence service has asked Russians angry with the invasion of Ukraine to “join hands” with the United Kingdom to help end the bloodshed, an invitation that is sure to stir fury at the Kremlin. “I invite them to do what others have done this past 18 months and join hands with us. Our door is always open … Their secrets will be safe with us and together we will work to bring the bloodshed to an end,” Richard Moore told Politico on Wednesday, at the British embassy in Prague. A similar invitation was made two months ago by Washington, when the CIAreleased a videourging Russians to get in touch. “Contact us. Perhaps the people around you don’t want to hear the truth. We want to,” the agency said in the clip. Offers to spy hold huge risks. President Vladimir Putin has previously warned Russians against spying, a crime that carries a 20-year sentence. During the Politico interview in front of an audience at the embassy, he also said British spies are using artificial intelligence (AI) to curb the supply of weapons to Russia during its war with Ukraine. His staff are “combining their skills with AI and bulk data to identify and disrupt the flow of weapons to Russia”, said Moore, who has previously warned the West of falling behind its rivals in the AI race. “Together with our allies, [we intend] to win the race to master the ethical and safe use of AI,” he said. He warned that there was “absolutely no doubt” adversaries would try to develop artificial intelligence in a way which was reckless and dangerous, and that it would be his agency’s job to deal with that. “It will be a significant part of our role going forward into the future, to try and … detect, uncover, and then disrupt people who would like to develop AI in directions which are dangerous.” In his second speech since becoming chief of the Secret Intelligence Service in 2020, Moore said Ukraine’s counteroffensive was proving “a hard grind” but was optimistic since there appeared to be little prospect of Russia regaining momentum in Ukraine. Moore said Putin’s administration was consumed by “venality, infighting and callous incompetence”, and that the Russian leader was “clearly under pressure”. TheWagner Group mutinyhas only “exposed the inexorable decay of the unstable autocracy over which Putin presides,” he added.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/19/spies-using-ai-kyivs-counteroffensive-hard-uk-spy-chief

Russia launches ‘hellish’ second-night attack on Ukraine’s Odesa,Ukraine air defence systems in the Odesa region and the capital Kyiv reported to have repelled Russian drone and missile attacks.,"Russia has launched a second night of air attacks onUkraine’s port city of Odesaas well as raids on the capital Kyiv, Ukrainian officials said, while there were also reports of attacks in the Russian-annexed Crimean peninsula. Odesa regional Governor Oleh Kiper said on social media early on Wednesday that air defence systems were engaged in repelling what was described as a “massive” Russian air attack and urged residents to stay in shelters. The attack was “very powerful, truly massive,” Serhiy Bratchuk, spokesperson for the Odesa military administration, said in a voice message on his Telegram channel on Wednesday. “It was a hellish night,” he said, adding that details on damage and casualties would be released later. A video posted on social media purporting to show the aftermath of a Russian air attack on Odesa showed a multi-storey apartment building with several windows blown out and shards of glass on the street. Air defence systems were also engaged in repelling a Russian air attack on Kyiv, the capital’s military administration said on the Telegram messaging app. A witness reported hearing blasts and smoke rising near Kyiv, according to the Reuters news agency. Ukrainian online news reported Kyiv city military administration head Serhii Popko saying that all Russian drones that had attacked the capital were shot down. “A difficult night of air attacks for all of Ukraine… Odesa especially. But the enemy did not forget about Kyiv either,” Popko was quoted as saying on Telegram. The Russian attack with Iranian-made Shahed drones had come “to no avail”, he was quoted as saying, adding that no casualties or damage to infrastructure had yet been reported.  The attacks on Odesa, one of Ukraine’s main ports for exporting grain, followed a pledge of retaliation by Russia after ablast on a bridgelinking Russia to the Crimean Peninsula on Monday, which Moscow blamed on Ukraine.    Shortly after the Crimean Bridge was hit on Monday, Moscowwithdrew from an agreementallowing the export of grain from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports, a move the United Nations said risked creating hunger around the world. Bratchuk, the spokesperson for the Odesa military administration, said earlier on Wednesday morning that Russia’s attacks on the port city were designed to frighten the world and those who want to see the export of vital grain supplies from Ukraine continue. “[They] are trying to scare the whole world, especially those who want to work for the grain corridor … Ukraine, Turkey and the United Nations,” Bratchuk said. “But I think that all normal, rational people will look and say: Odesa was not afraid, is not afraid and will not be afraid – we will work,” he said.     The RBC-Ukraine news agency reported that there was also an attack on Crimea, with explosions sounding at the Krynychky military training grounds. The Moscow-installed governor of Crimea said on Wednesday that a fire broke out at the military training grounds in the Kirovske district on the Crimean Peninsula. A fire there had forced the closure of the nearby Tavrida Highway, Sergei Aksyonov said on Telegram. Online news in Ukraine also said early on Wednesday morning that residents of Sevastopol, the capital of Russian-annexed Crimea, reported hearing explosions in the port city where Russia’s Black Sea Fleet is based. Online footage also purported to show missiles being launched from Sevastopol. There were no further details or independent confirmation of events in Sevastopol. Pro-Kremlin military bloggers said the attacks on Odesa were “massive” and Moscow was using a combination of missiles and drones on the city and other regions. On Tuesday, Russia’s defence ministry said it had hit military targets in two Ukrainian port cities overnight as “a mass revenge strike” in response to the attack on the Crimean Bridge.

"After ending deal, Russia warns against Black Sea grain shipments","Russia pulled out of the wartime grain deal with Ukraine on Monday. Now, it is cautioning against any shipments without its ‘security guarantees’.","A day afterpulling outof the wartime grain deal and renewing global fears over food security, the Kremlin has warned that shipping grain out of Ukrainian Black Sea ports could be risky in the absence of Russian security guarantees, claiming Ukraine uses the waters for military activities. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov issued the warning on Tuesday, amid suggestions that Turkey could step in to protect Ukrainian grain shipments. TheBlack Sea grain dealbrokered by the United Nations and Turkey was signed by Russia and Ukraine last July to ensure that Ukrainian ships could transport grain from its Black Sea ports of Yuzhny, Odesa and Chornomorsk to the Bosporus, without being attacked. With it came a separate agreement to facilitate shipments of Russian food and fertiliser, but Moscow has long complained that parts of the deal relating to these exports have not been implemented. As Russia withdrew on Monday, officials said their repetitive demands to boost Russian grain and fertiliser exports through the pact had not been met. In a statement on Telegram, Russia’s foreign ministry said Moscow’s termination of the deal also means the “withdrawal of navigation safety guarantees, curtailment of the maritime humanitarian corridor, and restoration of the regime of a temporarily dangerous area in the northwestern Black Sea”. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a statement, “Even without the Russian Federation, everything must be done so that we can use this Black Sea corridor.” “We are not afraid. We were approached by companies that own ships. They said that they are ready, if Ukraine and Turkey are ready to continue, then everyone is ready to continue supplying grain,” Zelenskyy added. The Ukrainian leader has been in talks with the UN chief Antonio Guterres to discuss restoring grain supply through the Black Sea routes. World leaders have condemned Moscow for backing out of the deal, saying the move threatens global food security and will lead to a hike in prices. “Hundreds of millions of people face hunger and consumers are confronting a global cost-of-living crisis,” Guterres said in a statement. But Peskov rejected such criticisms and highlighted that Moscow would supply grain to poor countries in need.

Ukraine’s Zelenskky says Russia blackmails world with food access,Zelenskyy said the export of grain from Ukraine’s seaports should continue despite Russia’s withdrawal from the deal.,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that no one has the right to destroy the food security of any nation and the world has an opportunity to show Russia that it does not allow blackmail. Describing the need to be protected from “Russian madness” followingMoscow’s withdrawalfrom the Black Sea grain deal on Monday, Zelenskyy said the export of grain from Ukraine’s seaports should continue – with or without Russia’s participation. Ukraine’s exportsprovided food securityfor 400 million people, Zelenskyy said, and Russia cannot be allowed to hold such a vital supply ransom to its whims. “If a bunch of people somewhere in the Kremlin think that they supposedly have the right to decide whether food will be on the table in different countries: Egypt or Sudan, Yemen or Bangladesh, China or India, Türkiye or Indonesia… then the world has an opportunity to show that blackmail is not allowed to anyone,” Zelenskyysaidin his nightly address. I spoke with@UNSecretary-General@antonioguterres. The topic is obvious – this is another Russian attempt to weaponize hunger and destabilize the global food market. The terrorist state has endangered the lives of 400 million people in various countries that depend on Ukrainian… — Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa)July 17, 2023  “Everyone has a right to stability…  Africa has the right to stability. Asia has the right to stability. Europe has every right to stability. And therefore, we must all care about security – about protection from Russian madness,” he said. “The Black Sea Grain Initiative can and should keep operating – if without Russia, then without Russia,” Zelenskyy added. Ukraine, along with the United Nations and Turkey, which brokered the original deal with Russia, can jointly continue “the operation of the food corridor and the inspection of vessels”, the Ukrainian leader said. “The only thing that is needed now is its careful implementation – and decisive pressure from the world on the terrorist state,” he added.    There waswidespread condemnationand outcry over Russia’s decision on Monday to end its participation in the deal, which allowed the export of Ukrainian grain from the country’s Black Sea ports. The agreement had helped ensure the price stability of vital global commodities such as wheat. The year-old agreement, which officially expired at 21:00 GMT on Monday, was “a lifeline for global food security and a beacon of hope in a troubled world”, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in New York. Guterres said he was “deeply disappointed” that a letter he sent to Russian President Vladimir Putin last week with proposals to save the agreement went unheeded. Today’s decision by Russia to terminate the implementation of the Black Sea Initiative will strike a blow to people in need everywhere. But it will not stop our efforts to advance global food security & price stability. There is too much at stake in a hungry & hurting world.pic.twitter.com/8dlmRusv16 — António Guterres (@antonioguterres)July 17, 2023  “Ultimately, participation in these agreements is a choice,” Guterres said. “But struggling people everywhere and developing countries don’t have a choice. Hundreds of millions of people face hunger and consumers are confronting a global cost-of-living crisis,” he said.    Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday that Russia was suspending its participation and would only return once conditions relating to Russian produce are met. Moscow says it wants obstacles to exports of Russia’s food and fertiliser lifted in exchange for further cooperation in the Black Sea grain deal. The Kremlin, in particular, is seeking relief from Western sanctions on payments, logistics and shipping insurance. But the United States and European countriesdismissed Moscow’s complaintsas without merit, saying their sanctions do not target Russian grain and fertilisers. The US will continue to work with other countries to ensure the movement of grain out of Ukraine, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said.    The US is not considering using military assets to help protect grain shipments, Kirby added. Al Jazeera’s diplomatic editor James Bays, reporting from UN headquarters in New York, said that during a meeting with the UN secretary general, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba raised the suggestion proposed by Zelenskyy that the deal continues, “operated by Ukraine, Turkiye and the UN without the participation of Russia”. “Senior UN officials though are very doubtful about that,” Bays said. “They say that no shipping company or insurance company would want to risk their vessel coming under Russian attack,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/18/ukraines-zelenskky-says-russia-blackmails-world-with-food-access

"Russia launches wave of air attacks on southern, eastern Ukraine","Ukraine’s air force said the Odesa, Mykolaiv, Donetsk, Kherson, Zaporizhia and Dnipropetrovsk regions are under attack threat.","Russia has launched air attacks on targets in southern and eastern Ukraine using drones and possibly ballistic missiles, Ukraine’s air force said. The southern port of Odesa and the Mykolaiv, Donetsk, Kherson, Zaporizhia and Dnipropetrovsk regions were all under threat of Russian drone attacks, the air force said on the Telegram messaging app in the early hours of Tuesday morning. A fire broke out in the port of Mykolaiv late on Monday, the mayor said. The port city provides Ukraine with access to the Black Sea. “It’s quite serious,” Mykolaiv’s Mayor Oleksandr Senkevich said on the Telegram messaging app, adding that more detail on the fire will be released later in the morning. Video footage circulating on social media purported to show Iranian-made Shahed drones attacking targets in the Mykolaiv region. There was no independent confirmation of the attack or the authenticity of the footage. Oleh Kiper, the head of the Odesa region’s military administration, said air defence systems there were engaged in repelling several waves of Russian drone attacks. “Several waves of attacks are likely,” Kiper said on Telegram.    Russia may also be using ballistic weaponry to attack the regions of Poltava, Cherkasy, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv and Kirovohrad, the air force added. Air raid alerts sounded in many Ukrainian regions for hours on Tuesday morning, before being called off at about 04:30am local time (01:30 GMT). Serhiy Bratchuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s Odesa military administration, said on Telegram that details of the attack there would be released later. “Thank you all for your endurance,” he said. The attack on the Odesa region in southern Ukraine, which is home to maritime terminals, comes hours after Russiarefused to extenda deal allowing the safe export of Ukrainian grain from Black Sea ports.    Russia’s full-scale invasion last year saw Ukraine’s Black Sea ports blocked by Russian warships until an agreement, reached in July 2022, allowed for the passage of critical grain exports from Ukraine. Russia refused to extend the grain deal on Monday, arguing that elements of the agreement allowing for the export of Russian food and fertilisers had not been honoured. Moscow’s withdrawal from the deal also followed after an attack on a Russian-built bridge linking Ukraine’s annexed Crimean peninsula to Russia’s Krasnodar region earlier on Monday. According to Russia, unmanned remote-controlled boats had detonated explosives at the structure on Monday morning, killing a husband and wife and seriously injuring their daughter who were reportedly in a car on the bridge at the time of the blast. Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened military retaliation for the attack on the bridge.    “Naturally, Russia’s response will follow. The defence ministry is working on relevant proposals,” Putin said at a meeting of the Russian leadership in Moscow on Monday evening, as reported by the TASS state news agency. “What happened is yet another terrorist act of the Kyiv regime,” he said. Russia said on Tuesday that its air defences and electronic countermeasure systems had brought down 28 Ukrainian drones over Crimea in the early hours of the morning, the state-run RIA news agency cited the Russian defence ministry as saying.

"As Russia exits grain deal, which countries will be affected?",Almost 33 million metric tonnes of grain were exported since the Black Sea Grain Initiative was brokered a year ago.,"Russia has said itwill not extendan international deal to allow the safe shipment of Ukrainian grain through its ports in the Black Sea. The accord, which is set to expire on Monday evening, has been credited with helping curb food prices around the world in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year. The two countries are two of the world’s largest agricultural producers. Almost 33 million metric tonnes of grain were exported since the Black Sea Grain Initiative was brokered by the United Nations and Turkey a year ago. The Kremlin said on Monday that Russia would “return” to the deal “immediately” if its demands to improve its own grain and fertiliser exports are met. The Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 sent the world into a global food crisis amid soaring inflation. Prior to the war, in 2021, Russia and Ukraine were the world’s first and fifth largest exporters of wheat respectively, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity.  In July 2022, the UN and Turkey arranged a deal that would see Ukraine export grain through the Black Sea. The agreement would allow ships to travel safely from the Ukrainian ports of Yuzhny, Odesa and Chornomorsk to the Bosporuswithout being attacked. With it came a separate agreement to facilitate shipments of Russian food and fertiliser. Russia has long complained that parts of the deal relating to these exports have not been implemented. On October 31, Russia temporarily pulled out of the agreement, citing drone attacks on its Black Sea fleet in Sevastopol. Shortly afterwards, Moscow rejoined the pact for a further 120 days on November 2. In March 2023, it agreed to extend its participation in the deal for another 60 days, a commitment it renewed in May. Since the deal was struck, UN data show that about 32.9 million metric tonnes of grain have left the Black Sea. The majority of grain has been corn and wheat. They accounted for 16.9 million tonnes and 8.91 million tonnes, respectively.  Ukraine is often referred to as the breadbasket of Europe, with more than 55 percent of its land being arable. Post-invasion, it was theeighth-largest producerof corn and theninth-largestproducer of wheat in the 2022-2023 period. Other food commodities exported over the same period included sunflower meal (1,857,917 tonnes), sunflower oil (1,650,092 tonnes), barley (1,268,298 tonnes) and rapeseed (1,000,859 tonnes). According to the UN, 45 countries across three continents have received food commodities under the deal. The average size of shipments leaving the Black Sea is about 32,450 tonnes. The highest tonnage to date has been exported to China (7.96 million tonnes, or almost 25 percent of the total); followed by Spain (5.98 million tonnes); Turkey (3.24 million); Italy (2.1 million); the Netherlands (1.96 million); and Egypt (1.55 million). The UN says the deal has helped reverse spiking food prices by more than 20 percent, but Russia says food supplies transported via the grain corridor are not reaching the world’s poorest countries. Nearly 44 percent of the exports have been shipped to what the UN calls high-income countries.  According to the World Food Programme (WFP), pre-war Ukraineproducedenough food to feed 400 million people per year. In 2021, almost two-thirds of the UN food agency’s overall grain procurement came from Ukraine. The UN says the deal allowed the WFP to transport more than 725,000 tonnes of wheat to help people in need in countries hit by wars and extreme weather events. Ethiopia received more than a third of that (262,759 tonnes), with more than 20 percent going to Yemen (151,000) and 18 percent to Afghanistan (130,869).  In 2022, in monetary terms, Ukraine provided thethird-highestamount of the total food procured for the WFP and the most metric tonnes, at 643,189. Nana Ndeda, humanitarian policy and advocacy lead at Save the Children, said the deal had enabled the stabilisation of global markets and the lowering of food prices in many parts of the world. “What is likely to happen now is that those food prices will go up again,” she told Al Jazeera from Kenya’s capital, Nairobi. “With that, countries will no longer be able to supply food to children and their families will no longer be able to access food and we’ll see an increase in malnutrition and food insecurity.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/17/as-russia-exits-grain-deal-which-countries-will-be-affected
"Crimea bridge attack: What happened, why is the bridge important?","The bridge suffered damage after one of its sections was blown up, killing two people and wounding a child.","Traffic on the single bridge that links Russia to Moscow-annexed Crimea and serves as a key supply route for the Kremlin’s forces in the war with Ukraine came to a standstill on Monday afterone of its sections was blown up, killing a couple and wounding their daughter. The RBC Ukraine news agency reported that explosions were heard on the bridge, with Russian military bloggers reporting two strikes. The bridge is a crucial supply route for Russian forces in Ukraine. Here is what we know about the bridge and the incident. The bridgesuffered damage, according to Russian authorities, after one of its sections was blown up, killing two people and wounding a child. Russia’s National Antiterrorism Committee said the strike on the 19km (12-mile) Kerch Bridge was carried out by two Ukrainian sea drones. Grey Zone, a heavily followed Telegram channel affiliated with the Wagner mercenary group, reported that there were two strikes on the bridge at 3:04am (00:04 GMT) and 3:20am (00:20 GMT) on Monday. A video posted by Crimea 24 online news channel showed a section of the bridge tilted and hanging down, but there was no indication any portion had fallen into the water. Russian authorities said the attack did not affect the piers but damaged the decking in a section of one of the two road links. Rail traffic resumed later on Monday morning after being halted for about six hours.  That remains unclear. Russian officials blamed the attack on Ukraine, but Kyiv did not openly admit it. Natalia Humeniuk, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian military’s Southern Command, said the explosions could be a Russian provocation. But RBC Ukraine and another Ukrainian news outlet Ukrainska Pravda said the attack was planned jointly by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and the Ukrainian navy, and involved sea drones. In what appeared to be an indirect acknowledgement of Ukraine’s involvement, SBU spokesperson Artem Degtyarenko said details of what happened would be revealed after Ukraine has won the war. The bridge is crucial for the supply of fuel, food and other products to Crimea, where the port of Sevastopol is the historic home base of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet. The peninsula has enough supplies of fuel, food and factory goods, acting Industrial Politics Minister Yelena Elekchyan said. The bridge also became a major supply route for Russian forces after Moscow invaded Ukraine last year, sending forces from Crimea to seize most of southern Ukraine’s Kherson region and some of the adjoining Zaporizhia province.    In October last year,the bridge was damagedin a powerful blast, with Russian officials saying the explosion was caused by a truck that blew up while crossing the bridge. Three people were killed. Putin branded that blast a “terrorist attack” orchestrated by Ukrainian security services and ordered a wave of retaliatory strikes on Ukrainian cities, including the capital, Kyiv. Months later, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy claimed only indirectly that his country was responsible for the attack, listing the bridge as one of his army’s “successes” in 2022. The 19km (12-mile) bridge over the Kerch Strait is the only direct link between the transport network of Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014. The bridge was a flagship project for Putin, who opened it himself for road traffic with great fanfare by driving a truck across in 2018. It consists of a separate roadway and railway, both supported by concrete stilts, which give way to a wider span held by steel arches at the point where ships pass between the Black Sea and the smaller Azov Sea. The structure was built at a reported cost of $3.6bn by a firm belonging to Arkady Rotenberg, a close ally and former judo partner of Putin.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/17/crimea-bridge-attack-what-happened-why-is-the-bridge-important
Russia-Ukraine Black Sea grain deal: All you need to know,"Russia has declined to extend the Black Sea grain deal, stalling the export of Ukrainian grain to the rest of the world.","The Black Sea Grain Initiative – a deal brokered between Russia and Ukraine by the United Nations and Turkey – has allowed 32.9 million metric tonnes of food to be exported from war-torn Ukraine since August. More than half of that grain went to developing countries, including those getting relief from the World Food Programme (WFP), according to the Joint Coordination Centre in Istanbul. But the wartime accord, which had been extended several times, will be terminated on Tuesday, Russiaannouncedon Monday. Here’s a look at the deal and what it means for the world: The accord –signedby Russia’s Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Ukraine’s Infrastructure Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov in July last year at Istanbul’s lavish Dolmabahce Palace – created a safe corridor for Ukraine’s grain exports from three Ukrainian ports – Odesa, Yuzhny and Chornomorsk. Under the agreement, a coalition of Turkish, Ukrainian and UN staff monitored the loading of grain into vessels in Ukrainian ports before navigating a preplanned route through the Black Sea, which is heavily mined by Ukrainian and Russian forces. Ukrainian pilot vessels guided commercial vessels transporting the grain in order to navigate the mined areas around the coastline using a map of safe channels provided by the Ukrainian side. The vessels then crossed the Black Sea towards Turkey’s Bosphorus Strait while being closely monitored by a joint coordination centre in Istanbul, containing representatives from the UN, Ukraine, Russia and Turkey. Ships entering Ukraine were inspected under the supervision of the same joint coordination centre to ensure they were not carrying weapons. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24 led to a de facto blockade of the Black Sea, resulting in Ukraine’s exports dropping to one-sixth of their prewar level. Kyiv and Moscow are among the largest exporters of grain in the world, and the blockade has caused grain prices to rise dramatically. The deal aimed to help avert famine by injecting more wheat, sunflower oil, fertiliser and other products into world markets, including for humanitarian needs. The current deal has helped to bring down prices and ease a global food crisis. Prices for wheat, the main ingredient in bread, have fallen about 17 percent so far this year while corn is down about 26 percent. Ukrainian grain has played a direct role in easing a global food crisis with 725,200 tonnes, or 2.2 percent of the supplies, shipped through the corridor used by the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) as aid to countries such as Ethiopia, Somalia and Yemen. The International Rescue Committee calls the grain deal a “lifeline for the 79 countries and 349 million people on the front line of food insecurity”. However, as of Monday, almost 8 million tonnes of goods have been shipped to China, nearly 25 percent of the 32.9 million tonnes exported,according to the UN, while almost 44 percent of exports were shipped to high income countries. Russia had been saying for months that conditions for the deal’s extension had not been fulfilled. Russia’s President Vladimir Putin said last week that he wanted an end to sanctions on the Russian Agricultural Bank. Other demands include the resumption of supplies of agricultural machinery and parts, lifting restrictions on insurance and reinsurance, the resumption of the Togliatti-Odesa ammonia pipeline and the unblocking of assets and the accounts of Russian companies involved in food and fertiliser exports. “The Black Sea agreements ceased to be valid today,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters. “Unfortunately, the part of these Black Sea agreements concerning Russia has not been implemented so far, so [their] effect is terminated,” he added. Ukraine’s ports were blocked until the agreement was reached in July last year and it is unclear whether it would be possible to ship grain since Russia withdrew. Additional war risk insurance premiums, which are charged when entering the Black Sea area, are expected to go up and shipowners could prove reluctant to allow their vessels to enter a war zone without Russia’s agreement. War risk insurance policies need to be renewed every seven days for ships, costing thousands of dollars. Ukraine has been exporting substantial volumes of grain through eastern European Union countries since the conflict began. There have, however, been many logistical challenges, including different rail gauges. Another issue is that the flow of Ukrainian grain through the eastern EU has caused unrest among farmers in the region who say it has undercut local supplies and been purchased by mills, leaving them without a market for their crops. As a result, the EU has allowed five countries – Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia – to ban domestic sales of Ukrainian wheat, corn, rapeseed and sunflower seeds, while allowing transit for export elsewhere. As it stands, this will be phased out by mid-September. Larger harvests are also expected in the eastern EU this summer and key ports, such as Constanta in Romania, are expected to struggle to handle the volume of grain they are likely to receive, leading to congestion and shipping delays.

Russia halts participation in Ukraine grain deal,Kremlin says its conditions for extending deal brokered by the UN and Turkey had not been fulfilled.,"The Kremlin says Russia has halted itsparticipation in a dealthat allowed war-torn Ukraine to ship grain through the Black Sea to parts of the world struggling with hunger, dealing a blow toglobal food securityafter Moscow’s invasion last year sent prices soaring. Hours earlier, an explosion knocked out Russia’s bridge to Crimea in what Moscow called an attack by Ukrainian sea drones, killing two people. The road bridge is a major artery for Russian troops fighting in Ukraine. Moscow said there was no link between the attack and its decision to suspend the grain deal over what it called a failure to meet its demands to implement a parallel agreement easing rules for its own food and fertiliser exports. The United Nations and Turkey brokered the landmark accord with Ukraine and Russia in July last year, which came with a separate agreement to facilitate shipments of Russian food and fertiliser that Moscow insists has not been applied. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday, hours before the Black Sea Grain Initiative was set to expire, that Russia would “return” to the deal “immediately” if its demands about its exports were met. “The Black Sea agreements ceased to be valid today,” Peskov told reporters on Monday afternoon. “Unfortunately, the part of these Black Sea agreements concerning Russia has not been implemented so far, so its effect is terminated,” he said. More than 32 million metric tonnes of corn, wheat and other grains have been exported by Ukraine under the arrangement, with the last ship leaving Ukraine on Sunday.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country was prepared to continue grain exports. “Even without the Russian Federation, everything must be done so that we can use this Black Sea corridor. We are not afraid. We have been approached by companies that own ships. They said that they are ready” to continue shipments, Zelenskyy said in comments distributed on social media by his spokesman Serhii Nykyforov. Denys Marchuk, deputy head of the Ukrainian Agrarian Council, the main agribusiness organisation in Ukraine, said alternative routes such as river ports were more expensive to use in terms of transportation costs. However, he expected a solution. “As an option, why don’t we assess the possibility of the continuation of the grain deal without Russia? We had experience of this already in November 2022,” he added. The halting of the grain deal came just hours after Russia said Ukraine hadattacked a bridgelinking it to the annexed Crimean Peninsula. Russian authorities said a civilian couple was killed and their daughter wounded. Russian President Vladimir Putin condemned a “senseless crime” in televised remarks, promising a “response” and calling for tighter security at the bridge. Peskov said the decision not to renew the deal was unrelated to the overnight attack, which he called a “terrorist act” and blamed on Ukraine.    Russia has agreed three times in the past year to extend the Black Sea deal, but also briefly suspended its participation at the end of October in response to a drone attack on its fleet in Crimea. It has also complained that not enough grain has reached poor countries but the UN says the arrangement has benefitted those states by helping lower food prices by more than 20 percent globally. As of Monday, almost 8 million tonnes of goods have been shipped to China, nearly 25 percent of the 32.9 million tonnes exported,according to the UN, while almost 44 percent of exports were shipped to high-income countries. Nana Ndeda, a humanitarian policy and advocacy lead at Save the Children, told Al Jazeera the deal had enabled the stabilisation of global markets and the lowering of food prices in many parts of the world. “What is likely to happen now is that those food prices will go up again,” she told Al Jazeera from Kenya’s capital, Nairobi. “With that, countries will no longer be able to supply food to children and their families will no longer be able to access food and we’ll see an increase in malnutrition and food insecurity.” Ukraine and Russia are two of the world’s biggest agricultural producers and major players in the wheat, barley, maize, rapeseed, rapeseed oil, sunflower seed and sunflower oil markets. Russia is also dominant in the fertiliser market. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February last year sent food commodity prices surging to record highs, contributing to a global food crisis also tied to other conflicts, the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, droughts and other climate factors. High costs for grain needed for food staples in countries in the Middle East and Africa exacerbated economic challenges and helped push millions more people into poverty or food shortage. The deal agreed to last year, providing assurances that ships will not be attacked entering and leaving Ukrainian ports as well as the separate agreement facilitating the movement of Russian food and fertiliser, provided a boost to global food security.    While the exports of Russian food and fertiliser are not subject to Western sanctions due to its invasion of Ukraine, Moscow says restrictions on payments, logistics and insurance have become a barrier to shipments. A key Russian demand has been for the Russian Agricultural Bank (Rosselkhozbank) to be reconnected to the SWIFT international payments system. The bank was cut off from SWIFT by the European Union in June 2022 over the invasion of Ukraine. Pavel Felgenhauer, a Moscow-based defence and military analyst, said many in Russia had been calling for months for the deal’s cancellation. “Russia was saying that it might terminate the grain deal for some time but each time, there were negotiations between Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the deal was continued,” he told Al Jazeera. Felgenhauer said he expected Erdogan to put pressure on Putin, adding that the deal would be discussed at a summit between the two leaders that is likely to take place next month. “It’s been several times that Erdogan had managed to change Putin’s position on serious matters,” Felgenhauer said. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Monday he regretted Russia’s decision to exit the deal, adding the move would “strike a blow to people in need everywhere”. “Hundreds of millions of people face hunger and consumers are confronting a global cost-of-living crisis. They will pay the price,” Guterres told reporters in New York. In Washington, the White House said Russia’s suspension of the pact “will worsen food security and harm millions”.    United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken called it unconscionable. Meanwhile, the US ambassador to the UN accused Russia of holding “humanity hostage” and said its exit from the deal was an “act of cruelty”. “While Russia plays political games, real people will suffer,” Linda Thomas-Greenfield told reporters at the UN headquarters in New York. The United Kingdom also denounced Russia’s decision. “By unilaterally forcing the collapse of the BSGI (Black Sea Grain Initiative), Russia has used food as a weapon and is preventing grain reaching those who need it most,” a spokesperson for the UK foreign ministry said in a statement. “The UK condemns Russia’s blatant attempt to harm the most vulnerable as part of its illegal war. Russia must renew the BSGI and commit to its full implementation.” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called Russia’s decision a “cynical move”, adding that the EU would continue to work towards ensuring food security for poor countries. China’s UN ambassador, Zhang Jun, expressed hope that all parties involved could find a way forward, specifically mentioning that Russia had concerns. “We still hope that, you know, by accommodating the concerns of all parties … then we can find a package solution,” Zhang told reporters.

"Black Sea grain deal in peril as UN, Turkey await Russia response",UN and Turkish officials in Istanbul awaiting response from Russia as last cargo ship carrying Ukrainian grain leaves Odesa.,"A United Nations and Turkey-brokered pact that allowed the export of Ukrainian grain via the Black Sea is set to expire on Monday if Russia does not agree to extend it. The last cargo ship cleared by the pact’s signatories left Ukraine on Sunday and was headed across the Black Sea from the port of Odesa towards Turkey, according to the Marine Traffic website. There was no word from talks in Istanbul, where Turkish and UN officials were trying to persuade Moscow to agree to another extension of the deal. The Russian TASS news agency quoted UN sources as saying they were still hopeful that the agreement would be extended before its expiration at midnight Istanbul time (21:00 GMT). “We are still waiting on Moscow, anything is possible,” the source told TASS. First signed in July 2022, theBlack Sea Grain Initiativewas negotiated toease a global food crisisworsened by Russia’s invasion of its neighbour. Russia and Ukraine are among the world’s top grain exporters and their conflict as well as a Russian blockade of Ukrainian Black Sea ports sent food prices soaring across the globe.    The Black Sea Initiative has allowed Ukraine to export nearly 33 million metric tonnes of corn, wheat and other grains. Russian officials, however, say there are no grounds for extending the pact, claiming their demands to improve Russia’s own grain and fertiliser exports have not been met. Moscow has also complained that not enough grain has reached poor countries. But the UN has argued that the arrangement has benefitted those states by helping lower food prices by more than 20 percent globally. The global body has said its World Food Programme (WFP) has procured 80 percent of its wheat so far in 2023 from Ukraine – up from 50 percent in 2021 and 2022. The WFP has shipped about 725,000 metric tonnes of Ukrainian wheat to Afghanistan, Sudan, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and Yemen to fight hunger. The organisation said the deal so far has supplied grain to 45 countries in three continents – 46 percent to Asia, 40 percent to Western Europe, 12 percent to Africa and 1 percent to Eastern Europe. Russia hasagreed three times in the past yearto extend the Black Sea deal, but also briefly suspended its participation at the end of October in response to a drone attack on its fleet in Crimea. To convince Russia to agree to the Black Sea Initiative, a three-year deal was also struck in July 2022 under which UN officials agreed to help Russia get its food and fertiliser exports to foreign markets. While Russian exports of food and fertiliser are not subject to Western sanctions imposed after the invasion of Ukraine, Moscow has said restrictions on payments, logistics and insurance have amounted to a barrier to shipments. A key Russian demand has been for the Russian Agricultural Bank (Rosselkhozbank) to be reconnected to the SWIFT international payments system. The bank was cut off from SWIFT by the European Union in June 2022 over Russia’s invasion. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres made a final effort on Tuesday to convince Russian President Vladimir Putin to extend the Black Sea deal for several months in exchange for the EU connecting a subsidiary of Rosselkhozbank to SWIFT for grain and fertiliser transactions, the Reuters news agency said. Guterres is still waiting for a response from Putin, according to a UN spokesperson. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Thursday that Moscow had already begun talking to Turkey about a plan to ensure that its wheat – possibly processed by Turkey – reaches countries in need regardless of the Black Sea deal’s fate.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/17/black-sea-grain-deal-in-peril-as-un-turkey-await-russia-response
"Two killed, child wounded in ’emergency’ on Russian Crimea bridge",Officials report ’emergency’ on bridge linking Crimea to Russian mainland and urge residents not to travel via the overpass.,"Two people have been killed and a child wounded in an “emergency situation” on a Russian-built bridge linking the annexed Crimean Peninsula to Russia’s Krasnodar region, according to officials. The announcement on Monday came hours after Moscow-installed officials said traffic along the bridge had been halted and media in Ukraine reported explosions along the overpass. Images from the scene showed no traffic crossing the 19-km (12-mile) road and rail bridge, while footage on social media showed twisted metal barriers, debris and a damaged car. Dash cam footage showed drivers braking sharply shortly after the incident. The extent of the damage was not immediately clear. Vyacheslav Gladkov, governor of the southern Russian region of Belgorod, said the casualties on the bridge included a couple and their daughter. “We all saw with you on a video on the Internet a damaged car with Belgorod numbers. What information is available at the moment: a girl was injured,” Gladkov said on the Telegram messaging app. “The hardest thing is that her parents died, dad and mum.” The girl was being treated in intensive care, he added.    Sergei Aksyonov, a Russia-installed governor, said the emergency occurred on the 145th pillar of the bridge. “Law enforcement agencies and all relevant services are working…  measures are being taken to handle the situation,” he said, without providing additional details. The Russian TASS news agency said train traffic on the bridge may be changed because of the “emergency situation” there, while the RIA state news agency said that police officers were warning drivers that the ferry service in the area was not working either. The RBC-Ukraine news agency meanwhile said explosions had been heard on the bridge, while Russia’s Grey Zone, a Telegram channel affiliated with the Wagner mercenary group, also reported that there were two attacks on the bridge at 03.04am (00:04 GMT) and 03.20am (00:20 GMT). Al Jazeera was not able to independently verify the reports. Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, but the peninsula is internationally recognised as part of Ukrainian territory. The bridge linking Crimea to Krasnodar serves as a vital link for transporting supplies to Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine. George Barros, an analyst at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, said if the bridge was seriously damaged it would significantly impact Russian supply lines. “Russia will only have one ground supply line – the coastal highway on the Sea of Azov – to sustain (or evacuate) its tens of thousands of troops in occupied Kherson & Crimea if UKR manages to degrade/destroy the bridge,” Barros said on Twitter.    The bridge wasdamaged by an explosion last Octoberin an attack the Kremlin said had been orchestrated by Ukrainian security forces. Ukraine admitted only indirectly to the attack months later. After the October attack, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the bridge repaired and even drove a Mercedes across it. The bridge, Europe’s longest, was completed in 2018 and Putin has long lauded the project, boasting at one point that Russian Tsars and Soviet leaders had dreamed of building it but never did. Both the governors of Crimea and the Krasnodar region said on Monday that they set up operational headquarters in their regions to address the emergency situation on the bridge. The Russian-backed administration of the peninsula said Crimea is provided with all necessary stock but urged residents not to travel via the bridge. A spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern military command, Natalia Humeniuk, said the incident on the Crimea Bridge could be an act of provocation on Moscow’s side. “The creation of such provocations, which the occupying authorities of Crimea report immediately very loudly, is a typical way of solving problems by authorities of Crimea and the aggressor country,” Humeniuk told the national broadcaster Rada.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/17/traffic-on-russias-crimea-bridge-stopped-amid-reports-of-blasts

East Ukraine fighting ‘intensifies’ as Putin dismisses offensive,Kyiv says fighting in eastern Ukraine ‘intensified’ as Moscow warns it has a ‘sufficient stockpile’ of cluster bombs.,"Ukraine says fighting has “intensified” in the east of the country as Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed Kyiv’s counteroffensive as a failure. A top Ukrainian defence official said on Sunday that Russian forces and Ukrainian troops were clashing in at least three areas on the eastern front. Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said on Telegram that Russian forces have been attacking in the direction of Kupiansk in the Kharkiv region for two successive days. “We are on the defensive,” Maliar wrote. “There are fierce battles. The positions of both sides change dynamically several times a day.” Maliar also said the two armies were pummelling one another around the ruined city of Bakhmut but that Ukrainian forces were “gradually moving forward” along its southern flank. She said Kyiv’s troops were also fending off Russian attacks near Avdiivka and Marinka in the Donetsk region. Al Jazeera’s Assed Baig, reporting from Kostyantynivka, about 20km (12.4 miles) from Bakhmut, said Maliar’s description of fierce fighting and changing positions was “sobering”. “That’s quite honest from the Ukrainian deputy defence minister because what we normally hear is about the Ukrainian advances, but what we are hearing from the Ukrainians is that the Russians are pushing back,” Baig said.    In an excerpt of an interview published on Sunday, Putin said the Ukrainian military has made no progress in its counteroffensive, which aims to retake occupied territory and seize the initiative in Russia’s full-scale invasion, which is in its 17th month. “All enemy attempts to break through our defences … they have not succeeded since the offensive began. The enemy is not successful,” Putin said in a clip published by state broadcaster Rossiya TV’s reporter Pavel Zarubin. Ukraine last month began its highly anticipated counteroffensive after stockpiling Western weapons and building up its offensive forces. It has, however, admitted difficult battles and called on the United States and other allies to provide long-range weapons and artillery. Putin also said Russia had a “sufficient stockpile” ofcluster bombsand that Moscow reserved the right to use them if such munitions were used against Russian forces in Ukraine. In his first comments on the delivery ofcluster munitions to Ukraine from the US, Putin said that Russia has not used cluster bombs in its war in Ukraine so far. “Until now, we have not done this, we have not used it and we have not had such a need,” he said. However, in April 2022, Russia was accused of using cluster munitions in theKramatorsk railway station attack, which killed 63 civilians, nine of them children.    Putin has yet to announce whether Moscow will renew thegrain dealthat allowed the resumption of Ukrainian exports through the Black Sea, temporarily halted when the invasion began in February 2022. Set to expire late on Monday, the deal was brokered by the United Nations and Turkey and signed byRussia and Ukraine in July 2022to establish a protected sea corridor via which Ukrainian agricultural goods could reach global markets. Russia, however, says obstacles to its own exports remain, and has threatened to pull out of the Black Sea Grain Initiative. On Saturday, the Kremlin said Russia still had concerns about the deal. “Vladimir Putin stressed that the obligations … to remove obstacles to the export of Russian food and fertilisers still remain unfulfilled,” a Kremlin statement said. “The main goal of the deal, namely the supply of grain to countries in need, including on the African continent, has not been implemented,” it said. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres supports removing hurdles to Russia exporting its fertilisers and sent Putin a letter on the subject on Tuesday. By ensuring the security of maritime cargo traffic in the Black Sea – along with inspections to counter arms shipments – the deal has allowed the export of nearly 33 million tonnes of grain since it entered into force on August 1, 2022. Most shipments were comprised of wheat and maize. The accord helped bring down prices that had shot higher following Russia’s invasion and avoid hunger in countries heavily dependent on imports.

Russia says it foiled assassination attempts on top media figures,A Moscow court issued criminal charges against seven people in connection with alleged plot to kill two prominent journalists.,"A Moscow court has issued criminal charges against seven people in connection with a plot “motivated by national hatred” to kill two prominent Russian journalists, Russia’s state-owned TASS news agency has reported. The court on Saturday ordered the detention of five minors born in 2005 and 2006, and two men it said were part of an organised group. According to TASS, Russia’s intelligence agency foiled assassination attempts onMargarita Simonyan, the chief editor ofstate media outlet RT, andKsenia Sobchak, a well-known journalist and TV host. The agency said the neo-Nazi group called “Paragraph-88” carried out reconnaissance near the homes and workplaces of the journalists. The FSB published footage showing several suspects being detained, as well as allegedly seized weapons and books on Nazism. Interfax news agency quoted the FSB as saying that the detainees had admitted preparing attacks on the two women on behalf of Ukraine and had been promised a reward of $16,620 (1.5 million roubles) for each one.    Simonyan, a vocal supporter of Russia’s war in Ukraine and one of state television’s most recognisable faces, posted a message on Telegram about the alleged plot, urging the security services to “Keep on working, brothers!” Sobchak, an influencer often critical of the Kremlin, ran against Russian President Vladimir Putin in the 2018 presidential election. She is the daughter of former Saint Petersburg mayor Anatoly Sobchak, who was Putin’s mentor. Her popular YouTube channel is often critical of the authorities, and she has left Russia several times since the war on Ukraine began. “If this is all true, then thanks to all the services involved for their work,” Sobchak said on Telegram. “If not, and if the point was simply to put me in the same sentence as Simonyan, then this is just plain mean,” she added. Two prominent pro-war Russian figures,journalist Darya Duginaand military bloggerVladlen Tatarsky, have been killed in bomb attacks inside Russia in the past year. Russia blamed their killings on Ukraine, while Kyiv denied that and portrayed them as evidence of Russian infighting. In May, a prominent Russian nationalist writer,Zakhar Prilepin, was wounded in a car bombing that killed his driver. Investigators said a suspect had been detained and had admitted acting on behalf of Ukraine.

South Korea’s Yoon promises $150m aid after Zelenskyy talks,President Yoon pledges to ‘expand the scale’ of his country’s humanitarian and non-lethal military aid to Ukraine.,"South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol has made a surprise visit to Ukraine, offering a show of support for the country in its war against Russia. Yoon’s office said on Saturday that he travelled to Ukraine with his wife, Kim Keon-hee, following trips to Lithuania for a NATO summit and to Poland. It is his first visit sinceRussia invaded Ukrainealmost 17 months ago. After the two leaders met, Zelenskyy thanked Seoul for its “firm support of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity” and the “significant political, security, economic and humanitarian aid” it has supplied since the start of Russia’s war. “Today, during this first visit of the president of the Republic of Korea to Ukraine in the history of our relations, we talked about everything that is important for people to lead a normal and safe life,” Zelenskyy said, adding, “Thank you for the meaningful talks. Thank you for your strong support.” Yoon pledged on Saturday to “expand the scale” of his country’s non-lethal military assistance to Ukraine, adding that humanitarian aid would be increased to $150m in 2023 from $100m last year. He also said that he and Zelenskyy agreed on cooperating on post-war reconstruction efforts in Ukraine. Additionally, South Korea will also launch a scholarship fund named after Yoon and Zelenskyy to expand support for Ukrainian students in South Korea. Earlier, Yoon toured Bucha and Irpin, two small cities near Kyiv where mass graves and bodies of civilians were found in the streets after Russian troops retreated from the capital region last year. He laid flowers at a monument to the country’s war dead. “The president first toured the Bucha city massacre site near the capital Kyiv and the city of Irpin, where missile attacks were concentrated on civilian residential areas,” Yoon’s senior adviser for press affairs, Kim Eun-hye, said in a statement.     In his recent written responses to questions from The Associated Press, Yoon said that the security of the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific regions is closely intertwined, saying: “In particular, the war in Ukraine has reminded us all that a security crisis in one particular region can have a global impact.” “Ukraine now reminds me of South Korea of the past,” Yoon said, hailing the international assistance that allowed his country to “pull off a miraculous victory” over the North and eventually rise to become one of the world’s major economies. A United States ally and rising arms exporter, South Korea has faced renewed pressure to provide weapons to Ukraine, which Yoon’s administration has resisted in favour of humanitarian and financial aid, wary of Russia’s influence over North Korea. Yoon had said this week that his administration was preparing to send de-mining equipment and ambulances, following a request from Ukraine, and will join NATO’s trust fund for Ukraine. Zelenskyy asked Yoon toboost military supportwhen they first met in May. South Korea’s defence ministry has said it was discussing exporting ammunition to the US. However, in May South Korea dismissed a US media report that its artillery rounds were heading to Ukraine via the US, saying its position on not providing lethal aid to Kyiv was unchanged. “We view Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a challenge to the international community’s freedom, human rights and the rule of law,” Yoon said upon meeting Polish President Andrzej Duda on Thursday, adding that South Korea could be a good partner in rebuilding Ukraine. South Korea’s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport said on Friday it planned to support the reconstruction of Ukraine’s infrastructure, such as transport, energy and industry.

Zelenskyy comments on Friday came as Ukrainian officials again acknowledged that the much-anticipated operation by Ukraine to push Russian forces back was progressing at a far slower pace than some had anticipated, though new reports of battlefield advances by Ukraine have emerged. “We must all understand very clearly – as clearly as possible – that the Russian forces on our southern and eastern lands are investing everything they can to stop our warriors,” Zelenskyy said in his daily evening address to the country. “Every thousand metres we advance, every success of each of our combat brigades deserves gratitude,” he said. Zelenskyy also said that he had receivedan “important report” on the security situation in neighbouring Belarus, which he was closely monitoring, though there were “no large-scale threats” currently. “Our full focus is on the front line,” he said.    The Ukrainian president’s comment on Belarus came as news emergedthat Russia’s Wagner mercenary grouphad reached an agreement to train Belarusian troops. The Belarusian defence ministry said in a statement on Friday that an agreement has been reached with Wagner to develop a roadmap “for the near future for training and transfer of experience between units of different branches of the armed forces”. The defence ministry also released a video showing Wagner fighters instructing Belarusian soldiers at a training ground near the town of Asipovichy, about 90km (56 miles) southeast of the capital, Minsk. The ministry did not specify how Wagner fighters were involved in the military training in Belarus, where the mutinous mercenary force was promised sanctuaryafter calling off its rebellion against the Russian military leadershiplast month. Belarus has emerged as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s closest ally in his war on Ukraine. The head of the Ukrainian president’s office Andriy Yermak was the latest official to acknowledge on Friday that thefighting had been difficult for Ukrainian forces, and the offensive was “advancing not so quickly”. Western allies, who have supplied billions of dollars in weapons to Kyiv, were not putting pressure on it to advance faster, said Yermak, who is seen as Zelenskyy’s right-hand man.    “There is no pressure, just a question: How can we help you further?” he said. Ukraine’s General Oleksandr Tarnavskyi, commander of Ukrainian forces in the south, said after meeting with Zelenskyy on Friday that his troops were “systematically moving the enemy out of their positions”. Enemy losses over the past 24 hours were equivalent to at least 200, he wrote on Telegram. Russia’s defence ministry, in its daily report on Friday, said its forces had repelled 16 Ukrainian attacks on the eastern front, including near the long-contested town of Maryinka and in the strategic village of Klishchiivka,on Bakhmut’s southern fringe. Military analyst Serhiy Hrabskyi told Ukrainian NV radio that in the south of the country, “the situation is very difficult in advancing towards Berdyansk” – referring to a port on the Sea of Azov. “The enemy is offering resistance to stop our advance southward,” he said. Ukraine’s weeks-old counteroffensive has reportedly focused on capturing villages in the southeast of the country in a drive towards the Sea of Azov and areas near the eastern city of Bakhmut, which was taken by Russian forces in May after months of bloody battles led primarily by Wagner fighters. Ukrainian forces hope to cut off a land bridge Russian forces have established with the annexed Crimean peninsula.

"Alleged Russia agent pleads not guilty to smuggling US tech, arms",Vadim Konoshchenok accused of multiple crimes for smuggling of US-made semiconductors and ammunition to Russia.,"An alleged Russian intelligence officer has pleaded not guilty in the United Statesto charges of violating sanctions, US export controls and money laundering for smugglingUS-origin electronics and ammunition to Russia to help its war against Ukraine. Russian citizen Vadim Konoshchenok,who was extradited on Thursday from Estonia to the US, entered the plea at a hearing in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, on Friday. US Magistrate Judge Ramon Reyes ordered Konoshchenok to be detained pending trial after prosecutors called him a flight risk. Sabrina Shroff, a US-based lawyer for Konoshchenok, declined to comment, and the Russian embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment. Konoshchenok, 48, was detained by Estonian authorities in October 2022 while trying to cross into Russia carrying 35 types of semiconductors and electronic components, some of which were subject to US export controls. He was also accused of smuggling US-made ammunition commonly used for sniper rifles, according to charges filed against him. “Konoshchenok has also been repeatedly stopped by Estonian border officials attempting to smuggle hundreds of thousands of American-made and export-controlled rounds into Russia, including 6.5 mm, 7 mm, .338 and .308 magnum rounds, which are commonly used by snipers, as well as military-grade .223 rounds,” the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New Yorksaid in a statement. “To date, over half a tonne [450kg] of military-grade ammunition linked to Konoshchenok has been recovered or interdicted before being smuggled into Russia,” the statement added.    Konoshchenok was allegedly a central figure in a seven-person smuggling ring, which included five Russians and two Americans who operated “under the direction of Russian intelligence services” to obtain US electronics and other goods restricted by US export controls. He faces up to 30 years in prison for conspiracy, violation of export controls, smuggling and money laundering. The US justice department’s Andrew Adams said Konoshchenok “allegedly provided cutting edge, American-developed technologies and ammunition to Russia for use in their illegal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine”. According to prosecutors, the suspect told his co-conspirators in electronic communications that he charged a 10 percent fee for dealing in controlled items. “Can’t do less. Sanctions,” he wrote, according to prosecutors. Konoshchenok’s extradition to the US comes as Washington seeks to negotiatethe return of US citizens held by Moscow. They include Paul Whelan, a corporate security official convicted in a Russian court of espionage, and Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who is facing charges of espionage. The US denies either was involved in spying, but has been in negotiations to see if they could be swapped for Russians that it holds. Last December, Washington traded jailed Russian arms smuggler Viktor Bout for US basketball star Brittney Griner, who was jailed in Russia months earlier on drug charges.    In April 2022, Russia released Trevor Reed, a former Marine imprisoned two years earlier for assaulting Russian police officers. At the same time, the US freed a Russian pilot jailed for drug trafficking. The US also holds Alexander Vinnik, a Russian money launderer extradited from Greece last year, and Vladimir Dunaev, a malware and ransomware hacker extradited from South Korea in 2021. And Washington is seeking the extradition from Brazil of Sergey Cherkasov, an alleged Russian spy who attended graduate school in Washington under deep cover. Konoshchenok’s prosecution comes as US authorities seek to ramp up enforcement of export controls and sanctions designed to hamper Moscow’s war in Ukraine. His next scheduled court appearance is July 31.    ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/15/alleged-russia-agent-pleads-not-guilty-to-smuggling-us-tech-arms

Wagner trains soldiers in Belarus after foiled mutiny in Russia,The Belarusian defence ministry says the Russian mercenary group is working with its troops near the town of Asipovichy.,"Belarus says it has reached an agreement with Russia’s Wagner mercenary group to train its soldiers after Wagner’s leader and fighters staged abrief mutinylast month against the Kremlin’s military leadership. The Belarusian defence ministry said in a statement on Friday that it had developed a roadmap with the Wagner Group’s management “for the near future for training and transfer of experience between units of different branches of the armed forces”. Before its mutiny, Wagner had played a key role in Russia’s war in Ukraine, which is grinding through its 17th month. The ministry did not say how many Wagner fighters were in Belarus or specify if more would follow but added it would continue to keep the public informed “about the upcoming work”. It also released a video showing Wagner fighters instructing Belarusian soldiers at a military range near the town of Asipovichy, about 90km (56 miles) southeast of the capital, Minsk. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko helped broker a deal to end Wagner’s short-lived rebellion on June 23-24 when the group took control of the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don and marched towards Moscow, shooting down a number of Russian military helicopters and killing their pilots. Under the deal, Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin stood down his mercenaries in exchange for Russia dropping mutiny charges. Prigozhin has not been seen in public since leaving Rostov on June 24.    The Kremlinhas confirmedbut has given few details about a meeting in Moscow between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Prigozhin and other Wagner commanders five days after the mutiny. In an interview published on Thursday evening, Putin said he had offered a way forward for Wagner fighters. “They could all gather in one place and continue to serve,” Putin was quoted as saying by Kommersant . “Nothing would have changed for them. They would have been led by the same person, who was their real commander all this time.” Putin said many Wagner troops nodded in approval at the proposal, but Prigozhin, who was sitting in front and did not see their reactions, quickly rejected it, responding, “The boys won’t agree with such a decision.” Wagner, which recruited extensively from Russian prisons, had operated in the shadows for years. It came into the spotlight during fighting in Ukraine despite the fact that private military companies are illegal in Russia. Putin, who previously denied any links between the Russian government and Wagner, acknowledged after the mutiny that Prigozhin’s company has received billions of dollars from the state. He noted that investigators would probe whether any of the funds had been stolen, a warning to Prigozhin that he could face financial charges.

"Wagner mercenaries offered chance to serve in Russia, Putin says",Putin claims Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin rejected offer of fighters serving in Russia after mutiny.,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he offered Wagner mercenariesthe opportunity to continue serving together in Russia after their mutiny last month against Moscow’s military leadership. Interviewed by the Russian daily Kommersant on Thursday, Putin said his offer was one of several he made at a meeting with approximately three dozen Wagner fighters and their founder Yevgeny Prigozhin, five days after Wagner forces staged a short-lived revolt last month. Under Putin’s offer, the mercenary force could remain serving under their current commander, who the newspaper identified only by his call sign of “Grey Hair”. Kommersant saidPutin spoke of meeting 35 Wagner fighters and Prigozhin in the Kremlinand offering them options for the future, including remaining under their commander of 16 months. “All of them could have gathered in one place and continued their service,” Kommersant quoted Putin as saying. “And nothing would have changed. They would have been led by the same person who had been their real commander all that time.”    As Putin is the army’s commander-in-chief, he seemed to be implying that the mercenary force would remain within the Russian military, although he did not say that explicitly. “Many of them nodded when I said this,” Kommersant quoted Putin as saying. However, Prigozhin disagreed, it reported. “Prigozhin … said after listening: ‘No, the boys won’t agree with such a decision,'” Kommersant quoted Putin as saying. Putin also indirectly admitted to Kommersant that the Russian leadership had been relying on a private military organisation that operated beyond the scope of Russian law. He told the newspaper there was no possibility of Wagner remaining in its current form. “Wagner does not exist,” Putin told Kommersant. “There is no law on private military organisations. It just doesn’t exist.”    Wagner fighters played a key role in the Russian army’s advance into eastern Ukraine and were the driving force in the capture of the city of Bakhmut in May, after months of battles. ButPrigozhin constantly accused Russia’s military chiefs of failing to back his menand of even cutting his allocation of artillery shells and other munitions at key times in the battle for Bakhmut. After months of verbal attacks on the military hierarchy, Wagner fighters crossed from Ukraine into Russia and took control of the southern city of Rostov-on-Don on June 24 as other units made a dash towards Moscow. Butthe Wagner mutiny ended as abruptly as it started, when Prigozhin, only 24 hours into the mutiny, announced that his forces had halted their advance after being offered a deal under which they could resettle in Belarus, and criminal charges against them would not be pursued.    Prigozhin’s whereabouts are not currently knownand, by last week, his forces had yet to take up the offer of decamping to Belarus. On Wednesday, Russia’s defence ministry said Wagner was completing its handover of heavy weapons to Russia’s regular armed forces while the Pentagon said the mercenary force was not participating in military operations in Ukraine in any significant way. “At this stage, we do not see Wagner forces participating in any significant capacity in support of combat operations in Ukraine,” Pentagon spokesperson Air Force Brigadier General Patrick Ryder said on Thursday.    The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a think tank based in Washington, DC, said on Thursday that geolocated video footage appeared to show Wagner forces travelling in a convoy on Russia’s M4 motorway in the Voronezh region in what appeared to be a redeployment likely from field camps in the rear of Russian-occupied Ukraine. A Russian military blogger claimed that the footage featured the convoy being escorted by Russian police and included buses with Belarusian licence plates, “possibly indicating the convoy’s destination”, the ISW said.

Putin says Western tanks ‘priority target’ for Russia in Ukraine,Russian president also warns that Western weapons supplied to Kyiv only prolonged war and would not change its outcome.,"Foreign-made tanks area “priority target” for Russian forces in Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said, and the supply of Western weaponry to Kyiv will not change the course of the war. Putin, in comments to state television on Thursday, also reaffirmed his stance thatUkraine’s membership in NATO would threaten Russia’s securitywhile the provision of Western arms had only escalated global tensions further and prolonged the conflict. When asked about France’s decision to supply Ukraine with long-range cruise missiles, which can travel 250km (155 miles), Putin said: “Yes, they cause damage, but nothing critical happens in the war zone with their use.” The Russian leader added that foreign-made tanks were“a priority target for our guys”. Putin’s comments came as US President Joe Biden said on Thursday that Russia had already lost the war in Ukraine and expressed hope that the ongoing, though slow-moving, counteroffensive by Ukrainian forces would push Moscow to the negotiation table. “Putin’s already lost the war. Putin has a real problem,” Biden told a press conference with Finnish President Sauli Niinisto in Helsinki. “There is no possibility of him winning the war in Ukraine,” he said.    Biden also used his visit to Finland, NATO’s newest member,to pledge that Ukraine would one day join the alliance, despite NATO leaders failing to give Kyiv a membership timeline at a summit of the Western military alliance this week in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius. NATO leaders had dashed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s hopes for a clear path to joining NATO, saying that Ukraine would join when “conditions are met”. Biden was more upbeat about Ukraine’s NATO membership on Thursday. “It’s not about whether or not they should or shouldn’t join. It’s about when they can join, and they will join NATO,” Biden said of Ukraine. Putin’s comments ontargeting Western tanks and warning on growing military assistance to Kyivwere his first public response to the remarks made at the NATO summit. He also reiterated Moscow’s strong opposition to Ukraine ever joining the defence bloc, saying this would threaten Russia’s own strategic interests. “This will not increase the security of Ukraine itself. And in general, it will make the world much more vulnerable,” Putin said.    Any country has the right to improve its security, Putin added, but not at another country’s expense. Washington, DC-based think tank, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), said that a generally muted response from Russia to developments at the NATO summit this week demonstrated the “degree to which the 2022 Russian invasion has set back the goals for which the Kremlin claims it launched the war” on Ukraine. Namely, the “aim of preventing NATO expansion and, indeed, rolling back earlier rounds of NATO expansion and pushing NATO back from Russia’s borders,” the ISW said. “Many Russian sources are reporting on the NATO summit in a dispassionate and muted manner that is not commensurate with the wider defeat that the summit actually represents for Russia’s pre-war aims,” the ISW think tank said earlier this week. In another sign of Moscow’s anger at NATO’s deepening backing for Kyiv, Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said he would regard F-16 fighter jets sent to Ukraine as a “nuclear” threat because of their capacity to carry atomic bombs. “Russia cannot ignore the ability of these aircraft to carry nuclear weapons. No amount of assurances will help here,” Lavrov was quoted as saying by the Russian foreign ministry. Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy secretary of Russia’s Security Council,also warned this week that assistance for Ukraine from NATO membersbrought the threat of a third global conflict closer. Ukrainian pilots will begin training onF-16 fighter jetsin Romania next month, officials said on the sidelines of the NATO summit, though Kyiv’s military allies have yet to agree on the supply of US-made warplanes to Ukraine.

"Turkey’s been busy at NATO: Sweden’s bid, F-16s and war mediation","At the NATO summit, Erdogan talked ratifying Sweden’s membership bid, an F-16 jet deal with the US, and Turkey’s role in the Ukraine war.","Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been busy at a NATO summit in Lithuania, surprising observers after reversing course andapproving Sweden’s long-awaited bidto join the military bloc. At a press conference late on Wednesday following the summit in the capital of Vilnius, Erdogan touched on several issues for Turkey, including ratifying Sweden’s NATO bid, its F-16jet defence dealwith the United States, and the balancing act it continues to play between Russia and Ukraine. Turkey is forging new paths in Europe, alsoresuming talks with Greece, the two announced on the same day, after more than a year of tensions between the historic foes. Erodgan’s NATO play is ahead of his visit to the Gulf countries next week, a trip the leader is taking in part to drum up foreign funding to boost Turkey’s strained economy after his re-election in May. The Turkish leader said that he will forward the ratification of Sweden’s NATO bid to parliament when it reopens from October, with Stockholm to provide a road map of the steps it will take before the ratification is sent. Ankara’s approval came as Sweden pledged support for updating Turkey’s customs agreement with the European Union and its desire to have visa-free travel throughout the EU for its citizens. Erdogan also expects that Stockholm will take steps against members of a group its considers terrorists, the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). “When it reopens, I believe our parliament speaker will bring this forward among international agreements. The primary place of approval is the parliament, then it will come to me for approval,” Erdogan said. In addition, the leader will hold talks with a nationalist parliamentary ally of his Justice and Development (AK) Party, the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), which expressed dismay at the news of approving Sweden’s bid.    Hours after Ankara said it would allow Stockholm into the bloc, the US said it will proceed with the transfer of F-16 fighter jets to Turkey, thelikely trade-offfor Ankara’s green light. At Wednesday’s news conference, Erdogan said he was “more hopeful than ever” for the purchase of the jets, while US President Joe Biden also on Wednesday expressed confidence that the deal will go ahead. Turkey has long sought to buy the warplanes in a bid to update its existing fleet, alongside modernisation kits. Erdogan also commented on therelease of former commandersof Ukraine’s garrison in Mariupol, which it helped facilitate, saying Russia’s initial negative reaction had changed. “First, there were some statements from Russia but afterwards when they learned about some circumstances, the situation entered a positive track,” Erdogan said at the press conference. Russia reacted with scorn over Turkey’s role in brokering the release of the five commanders, saying it violated the terms of a prisoner exchange deal engineered last year. Erdogan also said at the conference that Turkey could act as a mediator between Moscow and Kyiv to end the invasion of Ukraine that began in February last year. However, Russian President Vladimir Putin currently has no plans to speak with Ankara’s leader, according to Russia’s TASS news agency, which cited the Kremlin spokesman. On Saturday, commenting on another country’s bid to join the defence pact, Erdogan saidUkraine “deserved” NATO membership.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/13/turkeys-busy-nato-swedens-bid-f-16-jets-war-mediation
Russian general in Ukraine removed for strategy criticism: Report,"Major-General Ivan Popov, commander of Russia’s 58th Combined Arms Army, criticised strategy on Ukraine, reports say.","Moscow’s military leadership has reportedly dismissed Major-General Ivan Popov, commander-in-chief of Russia’s 58th Combined Arms Army stationed in southern Ukraine, over his concerns for troops fighting without rest andcriticism of Russian battlefield strategy. Popov addressed soldiers in a voice message that was circulated on the Telegram messaging app on Wednesday, saying he had been relieved of his post for criticising Russia’s military inefficiencies in Ukraine. “I drew attention to the greatest tragedy of modern war – the lack of artillery reconnaissance and counterstrikes and the multiple deaths and injuries caused by enemy artillery,” Popov said, according to the message circulated on the Telegram channel of Duma legislator Andrei Gurulyov. Popov, whose unit was fighting in the southern Ukrainian region of Zaporizhia, was harshly critical of his superiors. “The soldiers of the Ukrainian armed forces could not break through our front, but from behind the commander-in-chief dealt us a treacherous blow by decapitating the army at the most critical and tense moment,” Popov said in his message. Russian media outlet RBC reported that Popov said he had to choose between staying silent or speaking out about conditions on the battlefield. “I have always been honest, from the first day I arrived in our army. Therefore, I honestly tell you: a difficult situation arose with the senior authorities, when it was necessary either to remain silent and cowardly and say what they wanted to hear, or to call a spade a spade. And in the name of you, in the name of all our military friends who died, I had no right to lie, so I outlined all the problematic issues that exist today in the army,” RBC quoted Popov as saying, according to a translation. Among the issues raised by Popov were Russia’s ineffective targeting of Ukraine’s heavy weaponry and the “mass death and injury of our brothers from enemy artillery”, according to RBC. Earlier on Wednesday, other Telegram channels had reported thatRussia’s Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimovhad called Popov an “alarmist” and replaced him.    There was no immediate comment from Russia’s defence ministry regarding Popov’s fate, the Reuters news agency reported. Washington DC-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said this week Popov’s removal was reportedly linked to his complaints over Moscow’s failure to rotate and rest Russian troops from the front lines in Ukraine. According to the ISW, Popov had told Chief of Staff Gerasimov that his troops had been in battle for extended periods of time and had suffered significant casualties and were in need of rotation away from the front. “Gerasimov reportedly accused Popov of alarmism and blackmailing the Russian military command,” the ISW said, citing Russian online sources. Popov was reportedly removed from his position and sent to “forward positions” in Ukraine after threatening to complain to Russian President Vladimir Putin. “These reports, if true, may support ISW’s previous assessments that Russian forces lack operational reserves that would allow them to carry out rotations of personnel defending against Ukrainian counteroffensives and that Russian defensive lines may be brittle,” the think tank said. Popov’s dismissal and criticism of the Russian military leadershipecho the anger expressed by Yevgeny Prigozhin, chief of Russia’s Wagner mercenary forces, who had for months berated top commanders in Moscow for poor military planning before launching a short-lived uprising by his mercenaries in June to remove senior Russian defence officials.    Prigozhin called off his 24-hour mutiny as Wagner units closed in on Moscow and he secured a deal to leave Russia with his fighters for bases to be established in neighbouring Belarus. Russia’s defence ministry said on WednesdayWagner forces had handed over a large amount of heavy weaponry provided to them for operations in Ukraine. The return of weaponry appeared to be part of the agreement between Moscow and Prigozhin following the mutiny. Wagner has returned T-90 and T-80 tanks, multiple rocket launchers, numerous artillery systems, as well as 2,500 tonnes of ammunition of various types and 20,000 firearms, the ministry said. The whereabouts of Prigozhin remain unknown, and it is unclear whether his fighters will take up the offer of exile in Belarus, where camps ready for their arrival remained empty last week.

Russian spy chief says he spoke to CIA boss on Ukraine,Sergey Naryshkin says the call on ‘what to do with Ukraine’ took place soon after failed Wagner mutiny in June.,"Russia’s foreign intelligence chief Sergey Naryshkin has said that he and CIA counterpart William Burns discussed “what to do with Ukraine” in a phone call late last month, according to a report by the state-run TASS news agency. The New York Times and Wall Street Journal reported on June 30 that Burns had called Naryshkin to assure the Kremlin that the United States had no role in the brief mutiny a week earlier by Russian mercenary bossYevgeny Prigozhinand his Wagner group of fighters. Naryshkin confirmed that Burns had raised “the events of June 24”, when the mercenaries took control of a southern Russian city and advanced towards Moscow before reaching adeal with the Kremlinto end the revolt. But he said that for most of the call, lasting about an hour, “we considered and discussed what to do with Ukraine”. The CIA declined to comment on his remarks. Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 and has said that other countries should not negotiate its future on its behalf. The United States has repeatedly backed this principle, described as “nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine”. Burns and Naryshkin have maintained a line of communication since the start of the Ukraine war at a time when other direct contacts between Moscow and Washington are at a minimum, and relations are at their lowest point since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Naryshkin told TASS that negotiations on the war would become possible at some point. The news agency did not specify whether this was part of his conversation with Burns. “It’s natural that negotiations will be possible sooner or later, because any conflict, including armed conflict, ends by negotiations, but the conditions for these still need to ripen,” TASS quoted him as saying. Asked about the report, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak told the Reuters news agency: “Today, someone like Naryshkin has no leverage over how this war will end.” Podolyak said Russia was losing the war and there could be no negotiations with people like Naryshkin. “This Russian elite perceives events completely inadequately, so there is nothing to talk about with them.” Ukraine, which launched a long-expected counteroffensive last month, has said it will not enter talks at this point as this could effectively freeze the situation on the battlefield, where Russia has seized more than a sixth of its territory.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/13/russian-spy-chief-says-he-spoke-to-cia-boss-on-ukraine
Russia warns of response as NATO returns to Cold War ‘schemes’,NATO summit outcome to be analysed for threats posed to Russia’s security and ‘all means’ available in response.,"Russia has said the latest NATO summit demonstrates that theWestern military alliance has returnedto “Cold War schemes”, and Moscow is ready to respond to such threats by “all means” necessary. Russia’s comments came as United States President Joe Biden said at the end of the NATO summit on Wednesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin had a “craven lust for land and power” and hadbadly misjudged the resolve of the military blocto support Ukraine. “When Putin, and his craven lust for land and power, unleashed his brutal war on Ukraine, he was betting NATO would break apart … But he thought wrong,” Biden said at the end of the two-day summit in Lithuania’s capital Vilnius. “NATO is stronger, more energised and yes, more united than ever in its history. Indeed, more vital to our shared future,” he said. The Russian foreign ministry said in a statement late on Wednesday that the outcome of the NATO meeting would be “carefully analysed” for the threats posed to Russia’s security. “Taking into account the challenges and threats to Russia’s security and interests that have been identified, we will respond in a timely and appropriate manner, using all means and methods at our disposal,” the ministry said in the statement. Western powers were determined to divide “the world into democracies and autocracies”, the ministry said, adding that “the crosshairs of this policy of searching for enemies is aimed at Russia”.    The ministry also said thatNATO was continually lowering the thresholdfor the use of force while escalating political and military tensions by supplying Ukraine with more powerful and sophisticated weaponry. “Taking the course of escalation, they issued a new batch of promises to supply the Kyiv regime with more and more modern and long-range weapons in order to prolong the conflict as long as possible – to exhaustion,” the ministry said. Russia would respond by strengthening “the country’s military organisation and defence system”. The NATO summit, which opened with news that Turkey would approve Sweden’s membership of the military alliance after months of objections, ended on Wednesday with the US and its allies giving Ukraine new security assurances for its defence against Russia.    Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who attended the summit, was offered long-term security promises, but he wasnot given a concrete timeline for NATO membership, which he had lobbied for strenuously. NATO’s courting of Ukraine will likely further anger Putin who has partly portrayed his invasion of Ukraine as a response to NATO’s eastward expansion and to prevent the possibility of Ukraine joining the Western military alliance and the stationing of NATO forces at Russia’s borders. Washington, DC-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said on Wednesday the NATO summit “demonstrated the degree to which the 2022 Russian invasion has set back the goals for which the Kremlin claims it launched the war” on Ukraine. “The aim of preventing NATO expansion and, indeed, rolling back earlier rounds of NATO expansion and pushing NATO back from Russia’s borders was one of the Kremlin’s stated demands before the invasion. The Kremlin has repeated this aim continually throughout the war,” the ISW said.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrovbecame on Wednesday the second senior Russian figurein as many days to warn of a military escalation owing to Western support for Ukraine. Lavrov said the West was creating a nuclear threat to Russia by planning to supply Ukraine with US-made F-16 fighter jets. “The USA and its NATO satellites are creating the risk of a direct military confrontation with Russia and this can have catastrophic consequences,” Lavrov said in an interview with the Russian online newspaper Lenta.ru.    F-16 fighter jets can potentially carry nuclear weapons, Lavrov said. “The very fact of the appearance of such systems in the Ukrainian armed forces we will consider as a nuclear threat from the West,” he said. Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy secretary of Russia’s Security Council, warned on Tuesday that assistance for Ukraine from NATO members brought the threat of a third global conflict closer. The training of Ukrainian pilots in the operation ofF-16 fighter jetsis to begin in Romania in August, officials said on the sidelines of the NATO summit.

Russian defence ministry says Wagner handing over weapons,"Move comes two weeks after private army group launched an unprecedented, but ultimately short-lived, mutiny.","The Wagner mercenary group is completing the handover of its military hardware and weapons to the regular armed forces, according to Russia’s Ministry of Defence, two weeks after a short-lived mutiny that saw its columns advance on Moscow. The ministry announced on Wednesday it had received more than 2,000 pieces of military hardware, including tanks, mobile rocket launchers and anti-aircraft systems. It said it had been given “more than 2,500 tonnes of various types of ammunition and about 20,000 small arms”. Much of the equipment, it said, had not been used in combat before. The disarming of Wagner reflects efforts by the Russian authorities to defuse the threat posed by the private army and its founder Yevgeny Prigozhin, although uncertainty remains about his fate. Under the terms of the deal that ended the rebellion he was supposed to go into exile in Belarus, but Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said last week that Wagner soldiers remained in their camps and Prigozhin was in Russia. The Kremlin said on Monday that Prigozhin and 34 of his top officers met President Vladimir Putin on June 29, five days after the rebellion. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wagner’s commanders pledged loyalty to Putin and that they were ready “to continue to fight for the Motherland”. Putin has said that Wagner troops were required either to sign contracts with the defence ministry, move to Belarus or retire from service. The defence ministry, which released photos of the equipment in undisclosed locations, said the Wagner weapons had been transferred to rear positions where the equipment can be maintained or repaired. The armed group, which played a key role in the Ukraine offensive, sought to topple Russia’s military leadership during the rebellion, which was over in less than 24 hours. At the time, Putin condemned the revolt as an act of treason and threatened severe punishment for those who took part, but the criminal case against Prigozhin was dropped hours later as part of the deal. At the same time, the Wagner chief apparently could still face prosecution for financial wrongdoing or other charges. The rebellion represented the biggest threat to Putin in his more than two decades in power, even though Prigozhin, long seen as close to Putin, insisted the uprising was not aimed at the president but at Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and chief of the military’s General Staff, General Valery Gerasimov. Both men remain at their posts. At the same time, uncertainty surrounds the fate of General Sergei Surovikin, the deputy commander of  Russian forces fighting in Ukraine, who reportedly had ties to Prigozhin. Andrei Kartapolov, a retired general who heads the defence affairs committee in the lower house of the Russian parliament, said on Wednesday that Surovikin was “resting” and “not currently available”, but declined to elaborate.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/13/russian-defence-ministry-says-wagner-handing-over-weapons
"Russia-Ukraine war: List of key events, day 505","As the conflict enters its 505th day, these are the main developments.","Here is the situation on Thursday, July 13, 2023.      ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/13/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-505
One killed in third night of Russian drone attacks on Kyiv,One reported dead and four injured in latest attack on Ukrainian capital by Russian drones.,"At least one person was killed and four wounded as Ukrainian air defence units fought off aRussian drone attack for the third consecutive nightin and around Kyiv. Ukraine’s air force spokesperson Yuriy Ignat said 20 Russian attack drones and two cruise missiles were shot down over Kyiv and elsewhere in the country in the early hours of Thursday morning. “We have a successful air defence operation,” Ignat said. “Twenty Shaheds were destroyed – all those flying were downed. Two Kalibr cruise missiles were also destroyed.” Emergency services responded to calls in the capital city’s Solomyanskyi, Shevchenkivskyi, Podilskyi and Darnytskyi districts following “explosions”, Kyiv’s Mayor Vitali Klitschko said earlier on Thursday. “In Podilskyi district, during the firefighting in an apartment building, a body of one dead person was discovered,” Klitschko posted on the Telegram messaging app. Kyiv’s military administration said falling debris from destroyed Russian drones had struck the Solomyanskyi district in the centre of the Ukrainian capital and at least two people were injured. A picture posted on the official Telegram channel of the Kyiv military administration showed a room in a high-rise building with part of its wall blown out. Klitschko also said material from downed Russian drones had damaged a residential building in the Darnytskyi district and caused a balcony fire in the Shevchenkivskyi district. Serhiy Popko, the head of Kyiv’s military administration, described the assault as a “mass attack” by Iranian-made Shahed drones that had approached from multiple directions. Two people were wounded in Darnytskyi district “as a result of falling debris”, Popko wrote on Telegram. “This night, Russian terrorists again resorted to a mass attack. The enemy attacked the Kyiv region with drones and missiles. The air alert lasted more than 3 hours,” Ruslan Kravchenko, the governor of the Kyiv region, said on Telegram. Explosions were also reported in other regions of the country, including Khmelnytskyi in the west, Mykolaiv in the south and Zaporizhia in the southeast of the country. In Mykolaiv, a Kalibr missile and several drones were shot down but a school and about 10 private houses were damaged by falling debris, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s office said. There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties in other regions. Earlier, Ukraine’s air defences reported shooting down 11 of at least 15 Iranian-made Shahed drones launched by Russia against Kyiv and other targets in the early hours of Wednesday. Russia also conducted air raids on Kyiv and other locations early on Tuesday, launching a wave of 28 Shahed drones, of which Ukraine said it destroyed 26. The three days of night-time air assaults by Russia coincide with a NATO summit in Lithuania attended by world leaders and Ukraine’s Zelenskyy. Though the Ukrainian leader did not secure a timetable for his country’s membership in NATO, Zelenskyy said the outcome of the summit would provide “a foundation of security” for Ukraine for the first time since independence.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/13/third-night-of-russian-drone-raids-on-kyiv-debris-hits-districts
NATO didn’t ‘create incentive’ for Putin to stop Ukraine war,"As the NATO summit in Lithuania wraps up, analysts say its declaration has fallen short and dashed Kyiv’s hopes.","When Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda outlined his expectations ahead of this year’s NATO summit, hesaidhe wanted the event to be remembered as the “summit of decisions – not just declarations”. After two days of intense discussions and bilateral negotiations in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, leaders of the world’s largest military alliance made some big decisions, ranging from backing Sweden’s NATO membership to pledging security guarantees for war-torn Ukraine. But when it came to the question of Ukraine’s NATO membership, they decided it was not the right moment for an invite. “We will be in a position to extend an invitation to Ukraine to join the Alliance when Allies agree and conditions are met,”NATO leaders said in a declaration. “We reaffirm the commitment we made at the 2008 Summit in Bucharest that Ukraine will become a member of NATO, and today we recognise that Ukraine’s path to full Euro-Atlantic integration has moved beyond the need for the Membership Action Plan.” According to Bruno Lete, security and defence expert at the German Marshall Fund of the United States (GMF) in Brussels, while the declaration expresses strong and continued support for Ukraine, “NATO remains vague about the issue.” “NATO is clearly deepening its relations with Kyiv, but regarding membership, the Vilnius Declaration gives little more reason for enthusiasm than the 2008 Bucharest Declaration did,” he told Al Jazeera. “It positions NATO in such a way where in the future the alliance can choose to give Ukraine membership, or if necessary use Ukraine’s membership as a bargaining chip vis-à-vis Russia,” he said, noting that this would leave Kyiv disappointed. While there has been broad consensus among NATO members about supporting Ukraine militarily at the NATO summit, the issue of setting a timeline for Kyiv’s membership remains divisive. Some nations, including the US and Germany, have been wary that allowing Kyiv into the military alliance amid a war would also drag NATO into the battlefield with Russia — an outcome they want to avoid. Meanwhile, eastern European nations and Poland, which have been among Ukraine’s most vocal supporters, continued to push for Kyiv’s membership.  Before he arrived at the summit on Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said NATO’s stance on Kyiv’s membership was “absurd” in a rare public show of anger towards the alliance. But after meeting with NATO leaders in Lithuania, the Ukrainian leader softened his tone andsaid in a tweetthat Ukraine understood it “cannot become a member of NATO while the war is ongoing. But then it will be our common strength when Ukraine joins the Alliance.” In a press briefing in Vilnius alongside NATO’s Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, Zelenskyy said that “getting an invitation” at the summit would still have been “ideal” and acted as “a technical signal” in the face of Russian aggression. Meanwhile, NATO chief Stoltenberg continued to reaffirm to Zelenskyy that the country would become a member of the alliance in the future and told the Ukrainian president that he was looking forward to the day they “meet as allies”. Stoltenberg also highlighted that it was important for Ukraine to receive strong security guarantees as it continues to fight against the Russian invasion. After the summit, NATO members and the Group of Seven (G7) bloc of nations pledged to send new defence packages and missiles to Ukraine, which they said were part of long-term security assistance. Zelenskyy hailed the new defence packages and said “The Ukrainian delegation is bringing home a security victory for Ukraine.” He also welcomed the opening of the NATO-Ukraine Council and said it would give Ukraine the “necessary institutional certainty” on Kyiv’s NATO membership pathway. According to Stoltenberg, the council would act like a consultation mechanism between NATO members and Ukraine, whereby if Kyiv feels threatened, specific issues could be instantly discussed and decided by the council, bringing Ukraine closer to the alliance. “This council will be a place where allies in Ukraine will jointly advance Ukraine’s Euro-Atlantic aspirations for membership in NATO,” said Harry Nedelcu, geopolitics director at Rasmussen Global and leader of its Ukraine Advisory Service, told Al Jazeera. “But what would have been really a step forward, would be if this NATO-Ukraine Council was the body which could actually clearly set out the steps and assess the conditions that Ukraine would have to fulfil to become a member,” “Basically all these questions are being left for another day and are being kicked down the road for the NATO summit in Washington next year,” Nedelcu said. “The security guarantees for Ukraine are an interim solution to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia. But if this NATO summit was supposed to send a strong message to Russia’s [President Vladimir] Putin that the alliance is here to support Ukraine for as long as it takes, the glass is still half empty with no clear timeline for Kyiv’s membership. “This does not create an incentive for Putin to stop the war,” Nedelcu said. Inan interview with Al Jazeera on Tuesday, Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova suggested that NATO was not extending an invite to Ukraine since some NATO nations like Poland considered western Ukraine part of its territory and intended to invade the region. She provided no evidence for the claim, which has been promoted without evidence by other Russian officials in the past. She also said NATO was already at war with Russia because of its support for Ukraine militarily. Lete rejected the claim and said NATO had not joined the war. “Russia is falsely claiming it is fighting a war against all of NATO to justify to its own citizens the disastrous military campaign in Ukraine,” Lete said. “Clearly, NATO has not violated Russian territory, nor has any ally fired a single shot at Russia. It’s therefore false to argue that the alliance is engaging in war,” he added. After NATO and the G7 announced new defence packages for Ukraine, the Kremlin also warned that more security guarantees to Ukraine would be “dangerous” and infringe on Russia’s security. Meanwhile, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters it was an ideal time for Moscow to maintain good relations with Beijing and said that “a visit to China” was on the Russian president’s agenda. China has not condemned Russia’s actions in Ukraine, and it also downplayed the recent, short-lived Wagner Group rebellion. At their meeting in Lithuania, NATO leaderssaid, “The deepening strategic partnership between the People’s Republic of China and Russia and their mutually reinforcing attempts to undercut the rules-based international order run counter to our values and interests.” They also called on China to condemn Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine and abstain from supporting Russia’s war effort in any way. China’s European Affairs Director-General Wang Lutong said in a tweet that NATO’s accusations about China were “false”. “They are purely driven by the Cold War mentality and ideological bias,” he said. In addition to bolstering support for Ukraine, NATO members also fortified the alliance’s Baltic borders by giving Sweden the green light to join NATO. Turkey and Hungary, which held up Sweden’s NATO accession for more than a year,agreedto let Sweden join. Stoltenberg hailed the agreement on Sweden’s accession as “a historic step”. But for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, backing Sweden’s NATO membership has appeared transactional. Erdoğan had repeatedly said that he would approve Sweden’s NATO membership only if Stockholm dealt with Ankara’s “security concerns”, which included demands to expel members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which Turkey has declared a “terrorist” organisation, and members of the Syrian Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD). But on the eve of the military alliance’s summit, the Turkish president added another condition for Sweden’s NATO membership, saying he would approve Sweden’s accession if the European Union relaunched the long-stalled talks of Ankara’s EU membership. After holding bilateral talks with Turkey in Lithuania on the eve of the NATO summit, European Council President Charles Michel said the 27-member bloc would cooperate with Ankara to discuss its EU membership. Sweden also said it would support Turkey’s EU membership. “As a master of brinkmanship, Erdoğan dropped his veto when he assessed that the risks associated with continuing the veto had begun to outweigh the potential additional benefits,” Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, director of GMF’s office in Ankara, Turkey, told Al Jazeera. Meanwhile, Turkey also expressed support for Ukraine’s NATO membership in the long run. Unluhisarcikli said that these actions “won’t go unnoticed by Russia”. “Turkey always had a pro-Kyiv, but not anti-Russia approach. But Erdoğan’s measured approach to the Wagner mutiny in Russia, returning Azov Battalion commanders to Ukraine, and reasserting support to Ukraine’s NATO membership against Sweden’s accession to NATO within three weeks will not go unnoticed by Russia,” he said. “Because of these developments, Moscow may come to see Turkey as a less reliable facilitator and mediator,” Unluhisarcikli noted. “On the other hand, Russia does not have too many other alternatives to its relationship with Turkey.”   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/12/nato-didnt-create-incentive-for-putin-to-stop-ukraine-war
Analysis: Ukraine rolls back 6 months of Russian gains in 5 weeks,Assessment of Ukraine’s counteroffensive suggests it has retaken 253sq km (98sq miles) of its territory since June.,"Ukraine’s counteroffensive slowed down visibly in the 72nd week of the war because of entrenched Russian defences as NATO allies pledged more heavy weaponry for the fight. That assessment was given by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyyin an interview, but even as he spoke, the United States was helping to move Ukraine past that obstacle, pledging to give it cluster bombs designed for use against heavily fortified defensive positions. Other NATO allies meeting in Vilnius, Lithuania, on Tuesday and Wednesday also announced significant new weapons pledges. Despite their battlefield difficulties, Ukrainian forces have continued to advance. Ukraine’s general staff said its forces seized 4sq km (1.8sq miles) over the previous week aroundthe eastern city of Bakhmut. That would bring to 162sq km (63sq miles) the territory Ukraine claims to have recaptured since its counteroffensive began on June 4. But the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) think tank made its own independent assessment of recaptured territory and said the figure was closer to 253sq km (98sq miles). “Russian forces have captured a total of 282 square kilometers in the entire theater since January 1. In five weeks, Ukrainian forces have liberated nearly the same amount of territory that Russian forces captured in over six months,” the ISWsaid. A Ukrainian military intelligence unit commander said Bakhmut – almost completely occupied by Russian forces in early May after the war’s longest and bloodiest battle – was slowly but steadily falling back into Ukrainian hands. “We are starting to enter those territories that we did not control from the very beginning [of the war],” Mykola Volokhov, commander of the intelligence unit Terra, said, referring to territory Russia seized in 2014. The Bakhmut territorial gains appear to be especially significant. Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said Ukrainian forces managed to capture key heights over Bakhmut, putting their artillery in range of Russian positions in the city itself. “Our defenders have been keeping the entrances, exits and movement of the enemy through the city under fire control for several days,” she wrote on Telegram. This advance may be related to a reported rout of Russian forces in Klishchiivka, 5km (2.2 miles) southwest of Bakhmut.Geolocated footagesuggested Ukrainian forces had advanced to Klishchivka’s western outskirts on Thursday, and this was later confirmed by a Russian military reporter. Ukrainian forces have been inching closer to the town as they push forward north and south of Bakhmut in an enveloping action. Ukrainian-Canadian Journalist Alex Roslin said Russian units retreated in a disorderly fashion at Klishchiivka on Friday, were suffering from poor morale and were overwhelmed by Ukrainian bombardment. “A powerful Ukrainian assault forced Russia’s 83rd Airborne Assault Brigade to retreat on foot without an evacuation plan, only to be given ‘illegally issued orders’ to go right back to the front, the Russian troops complained in a video appeal,” Roslinwrote. “Russian draftees in another unit at Klishchiivka – the 142nd Regiment – also refused to fight after suffering heavy losses under Ukrainian fire while being sent into combat without ammunition, their relatives said in an appeal. Some of the refuseniks were reportedly being held in a pit.” Russian morale has been an issue elsewhere on the front as well. Two Russian sources said RussianChief of Staff Valery Gerasimovdismissed Major General Ivan Popov, commander of the 58th Combined Arms Army (CAA), after the latter complained a rotation of his men facing a Ukrainian counteroffensive south of Orikhiv in the western Zaporizia region was long overdue. The 58th CAA has reportedly been on the front lines since October. The reports appeared to confirm a suspected lack of strategic Russian war reserves.    That in turn could be related to the apparent leniency with which Wagner Group mercenaries are being treated after a mutiny on June 24. Under an agreement Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko brokered,Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhinwould escape treason charges and enjoy amnesty in Belarus. But on Thursday, Lukashenko said Prigozhin was no longer on Belarusian soil but in St Petersburg or Moscow. Four days later, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Prigozhin and 34 of his commanders had met for three hours with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow five days after the mutiny. “[Putin] gave an assessment of the company’s actions at the front … and also gave his assessment of the events of June 24, listened to the explanations of the commanders and offered them further options for employment,” Peskov said. “They emphasized that they are staunch supporters and soldiers of the head of state and the supreme commander in chief,” he said. The speed with which Putin forgave Wagner suggested to many observers that the president needed the mercenaries as effective fighters more than he needed to make examples of them. A Russian military reporter quoted Wagner commander Anton “Lotos” Yelizarov as saying in an interview that Moscow authorities would not prosecute Wagner personnel. Putin offered Wagner troops a choice between signing contracts with the Russian military or going to camps being built for them in Belarus. Lukashenko said thosecamps remained empty, and there were no signs Wagner fighters were signing up with the Russian military, suggesting the mercenaries remained unmolested in their bases in Russia.  On the southern front, the Ukrainian general staff said its troops have advanced 8.6km (4 miles) during the five weeks of the counteroffensive. Two main prongs of the attack in the region were aiming to liberate the ports of Berdyansk and Melitopol in Zaporizhia. Russian defences in this area were especially strong, Zelenskyy said in his interview, adding that he had been in favour of an earlier counteroffensive that did not give Russian forces time to dig in. Ahead of this week’s NATO summit, US President Joe Biden’s administration announced it had decided to supplyUkraine with cluster munitions. These are controversial because each shell releases hundreds of bomblets that cover a wide area. That makes them ideal in trench warfare, but because some bomblets fail to explode, they leave hazards for civilians. Carnegie Endowment Senior Fellow Michael Kofman said the cluster bombs – known as a dual-purpose improved conventional munitions (DPICMs) – would greatly enhance Ukraine’s counteroffensive by helping to dislodge Russian defenders from trenches while bridging an artillery shortage. “While [Ukraine] retains the bulk of its combat power, artillery use rate is likely higher than anticipated, especially as the past weeks have seen a largely attritional approach,” Kofmanwrote. “Consequently, Ukraine’s hardest limit is probably not manpower, or equipment, but artillery ammunition. This is foremost about the numbers. Providing DPICM gives access to a sizable stockpile of artillery ammo that can alleviate the time pressure on Ukraine operations.” Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov said he welcomed the decision, based on Ukrainian assurances to use the weapons only on occupied Ukrainian soil. Kyiv also promised not to deploy them in Russian territory or urban centres and said it would meticulously record the locations, share them with allies and bomb-sweep them after the war. Ukraine’s allies promised more weapons at the Vilnius summit. France will reportedly join Britain insending Storm Shadow missileswith a 250km (120-mile) range. Germany will provide two Patriot air defence launchers, 40 Marder infantry fighting vehicles and 25 Leopard 1A5 main battle tanks, part of a promised total of 100.

How does a country join NATO?,"The world’s most powerful military alliance has 31 members. Sweden is poised to make it 32, and Ukraine wants in as well.","On the final day of the NATO summit in Lithuania’s capital, Vilnius, the military alliance’s chief, Jens Stoltenberg, hastold reporters, “Ukraine is now closer to NATO than ever before.” In a joint press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Stoltenberg said: “I look forward to the day we meet as allies.” While Zelenskyy described the results of the NATO summit as good after allies pledged more military aid to Ukraine, he said an ideal situation would have been an invitation to Kyiv to become a member of the alliance. Here is how a country joins NATO: Since its creation in 1949, the world’s most powerful military alliance has increased its membership from 12 to 31 countries through nine rounds of enlargement. NATO’s founding members were Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom and United States. Their aim was to curb Soviet expansion and encourage political integration in Europe. Once a country is invited to join the alliance from all of its members, a formal process of accession talks begins.  Countries interested in joining NATO are asked to agree to a membership action plan tailored to the individual country and potentially requiring political, legal, military and security reforms. The following steps outline theprocessof joining NATO: NATO is resourced through the direct and indirect contributions of its members. For 2023, NATO’s military budget was set at 1.96 billion euros. Member countries contribute to the budget based on a cost-sharing formula derived from the gross national product of each country. In 2006, the alliance’s defence ministers agreed to commit a minimum of 2 percent of their GDPs to defence spending. So far, only eight countries adhere to this guideline: Greece, the US, Lithuania, Poland, the UK, Croatia, Estonia and Latvia.  There are 22 countries that are members of both the European Union and NATO: Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain. There are five states that are in the EU but not the military alliance: Austria, Cyprus, Ireland, Malta and Sweden.  Sweden applied to join NATO along with Finland in May 2022. Finland became the military alliance’s 31st member in April. However, Sweden’s bid was stalled by Turkey. Stoltenberg announced on Monday that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed to forward Sweden’s membership bid to Turkey’s parliament. Ukraine has voiced its desire to join NATO and the EU. Russia has long objected to Ukrainian membership in the military alliance. On Tuesday, Zelenskyy called the lack of a time frame for membership “unprecedented” and “absurd”. We value our allies. We value our shared security. And we always appreciate an open conversation.Ukraine will be represented at the NATO summit in Vilnius. Because it is about respect. But Ukraine also deserves respect. Now, on the way to Vilnius, we received signals that… — Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa)July 11, 2023  Al Jazeera’s James Bays, reporting from the summit in Vilnius, said ​​Zelenskyy also defined what he thought NATO’s communique on Ukraine’s membership meant and compared Kyiv’s NATO membership pathway to its EU membership. “He said being made a candidate of the EU doesn’t mean ‘I’m an EU member,’ but it shows a message to Russia and my people. He said the same would apply if an invitation was issued to Ukraine to be a NATO member,” Bays said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/12/how-does-a-country-join-nato-2
Surovikin: Russian general missing since Wagner mutiny ‘resting’,Surovikin reportedly had advance knowledge of the Wagner rebellion. A lawmaker says he’s ‘not available for now’.,"A Russian lawmaker has saidSergei Surovikin, a deputy commander of Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine, who has not been seen in public since theWagner Group mutiny, is “resting”. Dubbed “General Armageddon” for his aggressive tactics in the Syrian and Chechen conflicts, he was last seen when he posted a video appeal urging top mercenary Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Wagner chief, to cease his rebellion in Russia last month. Andrey Kartapolov, head of the Russian State Duma Defence Committee, said in a video posted to social media on Wednesday, “Surovikin is currently resting. [He is] not available for now.”  Last month, a New York Times report based on a United States intelligence briefing said that Surovikin had advance knowledge of themutinyand that the Russian government was investigating whether he was complicit. Some Russian outlets reported that the missing official had been arrested, but there was no official confirmation and the Kremlin declined to answer questions. Shortly after the Wagner rebellion ended, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, when asked whether President Vladimir Putin still trusted Surovikin, said: “[Putin] is the supreme commander-in-chief and he works with the defence minister and with the chief of the General Staff.” Several of Russia’s leading generals dropped out of public view following the mercenaries’ armed rebellion on June 23-24, which aimed to oust Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Commander-in-Chief Valery Gerasimov. On Monday, Gerasimov was seen in a video for the first time since the episode, pictured listening to a report about Ukrainian missile attacks. In scenes that shocked the world, Russia’s Wagner Group mercenaries began their uprising on June 23. They quickly seized a southern Russian city and threatened to march on Moscow. They halted their advance, with Prigozhin claiming he did not want to overthrow Putin, but rather protest against the conditions endured by his forces in Ukraine. The Wagner chief had for months railed against Russia’s top brass, accusing them of failing to properly arm his fighters despite their alleged successes in Ukraine. Regardless, Prigozhin’s mutiny is widely understood to have posed the most serious challenge to Putin since he assumed the presidency in 1999. Ultimately, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko brokered a deal between Russia and Wagner to end the rebellion. Prigozhin and his men were to move to Belarus, but Lukashenko announced last week that the Wagner chief only visited the country and was now back in Russia. On Monday, the Kremlin announced that Putin, who has cast the Wagner chief as a backstabber, met with Prigozhin five days after the short rebellion. According to Pavel Felgenhauer, a defence and military analyst based in Moscow, an “uneasy ceasefire” is being observed by Russia and Wagner.

‘Very dangerous’: Russia slams G7 security assurances to Ukraine,"Group of Seven countries have announced security assurances to Ukraine to deter future Russian attacks, a move decried by Moscow.","Russia has warned Western powers against providing security assurances to Ukraine, casting this as adangerous mistakethat would affect Moscow and expose Europe to greater risks for years ahead. Group of Seven (G7) countries announced on Wednesday an international framework that paves the way for long-term security assurances for Ukraine to boost its defences against Russia and deter Moscow from future aggression. In a joint declaration, which other nations can join, the United States, Germany, Japan, France, Canada, Italy and Britain, as well as the European Union, said the measures encompass elements including modern advanced military equipment, training, intelligence sharing and cyberdefence. In return, Ukraine would pledge improved governance measures, including through judicial and economic reforms and enhanced transparency. “We consider this move to be badly mistaken and potentially very dangerous,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in response to the security assurances. “By providing any kind of security guarantees for Ukraine, these countries would be ignoring the international principle on the indivisibility of security. By providing guarantees to Ukraine, they would be impinging on the security of the Russian Federation.” He added Russia could not tolerate anything threatening its security, and hoped that the West would recognise the risks attached to the decision. Such a move is “fraught with highly negative consequences in the medium, long and even short term” said Peskov. “By taking such a decision, these countries will make Europe much more dangerous for many many years to come. And of course, they will do a disservice to us, something we will take into account and keep in mind in [the] future.” According to a British government statement, the G7 security assurances set out how allies will support Ukraine over the coming years to end the war that was instigated by Russia last year, “and deter and respond to any future attack”. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak acknowledged that the G7 pledge was not a substitute for Ukraine’s membership in theNATOmilitary alliance, which Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is pressing for. During a two-day NATO summit in Lithuania that ends on Wednesday, members were positive on Ukraine’s future membership, butstopped shortof issuing a timeline or a formal invitation into the alliance.    After Zelenskyy and NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg addressed reporters on Wednesday, Al Jazeera’s James Bays, reporting from the summit in Vilnius, said: “If you listen to the actual words of President Zelenskyy, he’s still not happy with everything he received at this summit.” “He said there was obviously positive news because we’re seeing a lot of support … in terms of military hardware to Ukraine.” Former Russian diplomat Vyacheslav Matuzov told Al Jazeera that while Russia did not consider NATO forces on its doorstep as a significant issue, since Scandinavian countries are already part of the alliance, Moscow would likely mirror any future moves to boost its security.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/12/the-kremlin-slams-g7-announcement-of-security-guarantees-to-kyiv
Full text: NATO Vilnius summit communique,NATO leaders are meeting in the Lithuanian capital against the backdrop of Russia’s continuing invasion of Ukraine.,"NATO leaders are holding their annual summit as Ukraine looks to the security alliance for support in its attempt to push back invading Russian forces. The Vilnius communique, however, while emphasising NATO’s support for Ukraine, gave no clear timetable on when the country might be able to join the alliance, in a major disappointment for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who had travelled to the Lithuanian capital. “Ukraine’s future is in NATO,” the leaders said in the joint statement on Tuesday. “We will be in a position to extend an invitation to Ukraine to join the alliance when allies agree and conditions are met,” the declaration said, without specifying the conditions. The communique also touched on the Asia Pacific, with the leaders of Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea all attending as NATO allies. It said China was a challenge to NATO’s interests, security and values with its “ambitions and coercive policies” triggering a furious response from Beijing. And it accused Beijing and Moscow of “mutually reinforcing attempts to undercut the rules-based international order”. China has said it wants peace in Ukraine, but has not condemnedRussia’s full scale invasionsince it began in February 2022. Here is the full text of the communique: The NATO Invitee associates itself with this Communiqué. 1.           We, the Heads of State and Government of the North Atlantic Alliance, bound by shared values of individual liberty, human rights, democracy, and the rule of law, have gathered in Vilnius as war continues on the European continent, to reaffirm our enduring transatlantic bond, unity, cohesion, and solidarity at a critical time for our security and international peace and stability.  NATO is a defensive Alliance.  It is the unique, essential and indispensable transatlantic forum to consult, coordinate and act on all matters related to our individual and collective security.  We reaffirm our iron-clad commitment to defend each other and every inch of Allied territory at all times, protect our one billion citizens, and safeguard our freedom and democracy, in accordance with Article 5 of the Washington Treaty.  We will continue to ensure our collective defence from all threats, no matter where they stem from, based on a 360-degree approach, to fulfil NATO’s three core tasks of deterrence and defence, crisis prevention and management, and cooperative security.  We adhere to international law and to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and are committed to upholding the rules-based international order.  This Summit marks a milestone in strengthening our Alliance. 2.           We warmly welcome President Zelenskyy to the inaugural meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council.  We look forward to our valuable exchanges with the Heads of State and Government of Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and the Republic of Korea, as well as the President of the European Council and the President of the European Commission at this Summit.  We also welcome the engagements with the Foreign Ministers of Georgia and the Republic of Moldova, and with the Deputy Foreign Minister of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as we continue to consult closely on the implementation of NATO’s tailored support measures. 3.           We welcome Finland as the newest member of our Alliance. This is an historic step for Finland and for NATO. For many years, we worked closely as partners; we now stand together as Allies. NATO membership makes Finland safer, and NATO stronger. 4.           We reaffirm our commitment to NATO’s open door policy and to Article 10 of the Washington Treaty. Every nation has the right to choose its own security arrangements. We look forward to welcoming Sweden as a full member of the Alliance and, in this regard, welcome the agreement reached between the NATO Secretary General, the President of Türkiye, and the Prime Minister of Sweden. 5.           Peace in the Euro-Atlantic area has been shattered.  The Russian Federation has violated the norms and principles that contributed to a stable and predictable European security order.  The Russian Federation is the most significant and direct threat to Allies’ security and to peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area.  Terrorism, in all its forms and manifestations, is the most direct asymmetric threat to the security of our citizens and to international peace and prosperity.  The threats we face are global and interconnected. 6.           Strategic competition, pervasive instability and recurrent shocks define our broader security environment.  Conflict, fragility and instability in Africa and the Middle East directly affect our security and the security of our partners.  The People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) stated ambitions and coercive policies challenge our interests, security and values.  We remain open to constructive engagement with the PRC, including to build reciprocal transparency, with a view to safeguarding the Alliance’s security interests.  We continue to be confronted by cyber, space, hybrid and other asymmetric threats, and by the malicious use of emerging and disruptive technologies. 7.           Russia bears full responsibility for its illegal, unjustifiable, and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine, which has gravely undermined Euro-Atlantic and global security and for which it must be held fully accountable.  We continue to condemn in the strongest terms Russia’s blatant violations of international law, the Charter of the United Nations, and OSCE commitments and principles.  We do not and will never recognise Russia’s illegal and illegitimate annexations, including Crimea.  There can be no impunity for Russian war crimes and other atrocities, such as attacks against civilians and the destruction of civilian infrastructure that deprives millions of Ukrainians of basic human services.  All those responsible must be held accountable for violations and abuses of human rights and international humanitarian law, particularly against Ukraine’s civilian population, including the forced deportation of children and conflict-related sexual violence.  The destruction of the Kakhovka dam highlights the brutal consequences of the war started by Russia.  Russia’s war has had a profound impact on the environment, nuclear safety, energy and food security, the global economy, and the welfare of billions of people around the world.  Allies are working to enable exports of Ukrainian grain and actively support international efforts to alleviate the global food crisis. 8.           Russia must immediately stop this illegal war of aggression, cease its use of force against Ukraine, and completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its forces and equipment from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders, extending to its territorial waters.  We urge all countries not to provide any kind of assistance to Russia’s aggression and condemn all those who are actively facilitating Russia’s war.  Belarus’ support has been instrumental as it continues to provide its territory and infrastructure to allow Russian forces to attack Ukraine and sustain Russia’s aggression.  In particular Belarus, but also Iran, must end their complicity with Russia and return to compliance with international law. 9.           We welcome the strong support in the UN General Assembly for efforts to promote a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace in Ukraine.  We welcome and support President Zelenskyy’s commitment in setting out the principles for such a peace through his Peace Formula.  We are committed to achieving a just and lasting peace that upholds the principles of the UN Charter, in particular sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence.  We underline that this cannot be realised without Russia’s complete and unconditional withdrawal.  While we have called on Russia to engage constructively in credible negotiations with Ukraine, Russia has not shown any genuine openness to a just and lasting peace. 10.         We reaffirm our unwavering solidarity with the government and people of Ukraine in the heroic defence of their nation, their land, and our shared values.  We fully support Ukraine’s inherent right to self-defence as enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter.  We remain steadfast in our commitment to further step up political and practical support to Ukraine as it continues to defend its independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders, and will continue our support for as long as it takes.  We welcome efforts of all Allies and partners engaged in providing support to Ukraine.    11.         We fully support Ukraine’s right to choose its own security arrangements.  Ukraine’s future is in NATO.  We reaffirm the commitment we made at the 2008 Summit in Bucharest that Ukraine will become a member of NATO, and today we recognise that Ukraine’s path to full Euro-Atlantic integration has moved beyond the need for the Membership Action Plan.  Ukraine has become increasingly interoperable and politically integrated with the Alliance, and has made substantial progress on its reform path.  In line with the 1997 Charter on a Distinctive Partnership between NATO and Ukraine and the 2009 Complement, Allies will continue to support and review Ukraine’s progress on interoperability as well as additional democratic and security sector reforms that are required.  NATO Foreign Ministers will regularly assess progress through the adapted Annual National Programme.  The Alliance will support Ukraine in making these reforms on its path towards future membership.  We will be in a position to extend an invitation to Ukraine to join the Alliance when Allies agree and conditions are met. 12.         The security of Ukraine is of great importance to Allies and the Alliance.  To support Ukraine’s further integration with NATO, today we have agreed a substantial package of expanded political and practical support.  We have decided to establish the NATO-Ukraine Council, a new joint body where Allies and Ukraine sit as equal members to advance political dialogue, engagement, cooperation, and Ukraine’s Euro-Atlantic aspirations for membership in NATO.  It will provide for joint consultations, decision-making, and activities, and will also serve as a crisis consultation mechanism between NATO and Ukraine. 13.         The continued delivery of urgently needed non-lethal assistance to Ukraine by NATO through the Comprehensive Assistance Package (CAP) remains a priority.  Since the Madrid Summit, Allies and partners have committed over 500 million euros to the CAP.  To support Ukraine’s deterrence and defence in the short, medium, and long term, we have agreed today to further develop the CAP into a multi-year programme for Ukraine.  The assistance provided will help rebuild the Ukrainian security and defence sector and transition Ukraine towards full interoperability with NATO.  Allies will continue to fund the CAP in a sustained and predictable way.  We highly welcome and encourage partner contributions. 14.         Russia has increased its multi-domain military build-up and presence in the Baltic, Black, and Mediterranean Sea regions, and maintains significant military capabilities in the Arctic.  Russia’s more assertive posture, novel military capabilities, and provocative activities, including near NATO borders, as well as its large-scale no-notice and snap exercises, continue to threaten the security of the Euro-Atlantic area.  In the High North, its capability to disrupt Allied reinforcements and freedom of navigation across the North Atlantic is a strategic challenge to the Alliance.  NATO and Allies will continue to undertake necessary, calibrated, and coordinated activities, including by exercising relevant plans. 15.         Russia’s deepening military integration with Belarus, including the deployment of advanced Russian military capabilities and military personnel in Belarus, has implications for regional stability and the defence of the Alliance.  NATO will remain vigilant and further monitor developments closely, in particular the potential deployment of so-called private military companies to Belarus.  We call on Belarus to stop its malign activities against its neighbours, to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, and to abide by international law. 16.         Russia is modernising its nuclear forces, including its large stockpile of theatre-range weapons, and expanding its novel and disruptive dual-capable delivery systems.  It is unacceptable that Russia uses such dual-capable systems to attack civilians and critical civilian infrastructure in Ukraine.  We condemn Russia’s announced intention to deploy nuclear weapons and nuclear-capable systems on Belarusian territory, which further demonstrates how Russia’s repeated actions undermine strategic stability and overall security in the Euro-Atlantic area.  We condemn Russia’s irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and coercive nuclear signalling.  We recall the Joint Statement of the Leaders of the Five Nuclear Weapons States issued on 3 January 2022 on Preventing Nuclear War and Avoiding Arms Races.  We call on Russia to recommit – in words and deeds – to the principles enshrined in that Statement. 17.         Russia’s actions demonstrate a posture of strategic intimidation and underline the continued need for NATO to monitor all of these developments and adapt its posture as necessary.  Allies will continue to work closely together to address the threats and challenges posed by Russia and reiterate that any use of Chemical, Biological, Radiological or Nuclear weapons by Russia would be met with severe consequences. 18.         Russia has intensified its hybrid actions against NATO Allies and partners, including through proxies.  This includes interference in democratic processes, political and economic coercion, widespread disinformation campaigns, malicious cyber activities, and illegal and disruptive activities of Russian intelligence services.  We are enhancing the tools at our disposal to counter Russian hybrid actions and will ensure that the Alliance and Allies are prepared to deter and defend against hybrid attacks. 19.         We seek stability and predictability in the Euro-Atlantic area and between NATO and Russia.  NATO does not seek confrontation and poses no threat to Russia.  In light of its hostile policies and actions, we cannot consider Russia to be our partner.  Any change in our relationship depends on Russia halting its aggressive behaviour and fully complying with international law.  We remain willing to keep open channels of communication with Moscow to manage and mitigate risks, prevent escalation, and increase transparency.  At the same time, we will continue to consult on and assess the implications of Russia’s policies and actions for our security, and respond to Russian threats and hostile actions in a united and responsible way. 20.         We categorically reject and condemn terrorism in the strongest possible terms.  Countering terrorism in all its forms and manifestations is essential to our collective defence.  NATO’s role in the fight against terrorism contributes to all three core tasks of the Alliance and is integral to the Alliance’s 360-degree approach to deterrence and defence.  Allies will continue to fight this threat with determination, resolve, and in solidarity.   As part of a broader effort to better respond collectively to this threat, we will further develop Allies’ capabilities, and continue to engage with the Global Coalition to Defeat Da’esh and with partner countries in order to support their efforts and to help them build their capacity to counter terrorism.  NATO will also continue to engage, as appropriate, with other international actors to ensure added value and complementarity. 21.         Terrorist organisations threaten the security of our populations, forces and territory.  They have expanded their networks, enhanced their capabilities and invested in new technologies to improve their reach and lethality.  We will continue to deter, defend and respond to threats and challenges posed by terrorist groups, based on a combination of prevention, protection and denial measures.  We have today tasked the Council in permanent session to update NATO’s Policy Guidelines and Action Plan on Counter-Terrorism, and reassess, in consultation with our regional partners, the areas where NATO can provide civil-military assistance to partners in this field.  Our approach to terrorism, and its causes, is in accordance with international law and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and upholds all relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions on the fight against terrorism. 22.         NATO’s southern neighbourhood, particularly the Middle East, North Africa and Sahel regions, faces interconnected security, demographic, economic, and political challenges.  These are aggravated by the impact of climate change, fragile institutions, health emergencies, and food insecurity.  This situation provides fertile ground for the proliferation of non-state armed groups, including terrorist organisations.  It also enables destabilising and coercive interference by strategic competitors.  Russia is fuelling tensions and instability across these regions.  Pervasive instability results in violence against civilians, including conflict-related sexual violence, as well as attacks against cultural property and environmental damage.  It contributes to forced displacement, fuelling human trafficking and irregular migration.  These trends pose serious transnational and humanitarian challenges and have a disproportionate impact on women, children, and minorities.  In response to the profound implications of these threats and challenges within and in the vicinity of the Euro-Atlantic area, we have today tasked the North Atlantic Council in permanent session to launch a comprehensive and deep reflection on existing and emerging threats and challenges, and opportunities for engagements with our partner nations, international organisations, and other relevant actors in the region, to be presented by our next Summit in 2024. 23.         The People’s Republic of China’s stated ambitions and coercive policies challenge our interests, security and values.  The PRC employs a broad range of political, economic, and military tools to increase its global footprint and project power, while remaining opaque about its strategy, intentions and military build-up.  The PRC’s malicious hybrid and cyber operations and its confrontational rhetoric and disinformation target Allies and harm Alliance security.  The PRC seeks to control key technological and industrial sectors, critical infrastructure, and strategic materials and supply chains.  It uses its economic leverage to create strategic dependencies and enhance its influence.  It strives to subvert the rules-based international order, including in the space, cyber and maritime domains. 24.         We remain open to constructive engagement with the PRC, including to build reciprocal transparency, with a view to safeguarding the Alliance’s security interests.  We are working together responsibly, as Allies, to address the systemic challenges posed by the PRC to Euro-Atlantic security and ensure NATO’s enduring ability to guarantee the defence and security of Allies.  We are boosting our shared awareness, enhancing our resilience and preparedness, and protecting against the PRC’s coercive tactics and efforts to divide the Alliance.  We will stand up for our shared values and the rules-based international order, including freedom of navigation. 25.         The deepening strategic partnership between the PRC and Russia and their mutually reinforcing attempts to undercut the rules-based international order run counter to our values and interests.  We call on the PRC to play a constructive role as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, to condemn Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, to abstain from supporting Russia’s war effort in any way, to cease amplifying Russia’s false narrative blaming Ukraine and NATO for Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, and to adhere to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter.  We particularly call on the PRC to act responsibly and refrain from providing any lethal aid to Russia. 26.         In 2014, at the Wales Summit Allied Heads of State and Government agreed the Defence Investment Pledge.  Since then Allies have made remarkable progress and all have increased their defence spending, developed further their forces and capabilities, and have contributed to Allied operations, missions and activities.  However, as the Strategic Concept sets out, our nations are now facing more profound security threats and challenges than at any time since the end of the Cold War. 27.         Consistent with our obligations under Article 3 of the Washington Treaty, we make an enduring commitment to invest at least 2% of our Gross Domestic Product (GDP) annually on defence.  We do so recognising more is needed urgently to sustainably meet our commitments as NATO Allies, including to fulfil longstanding major equipment requirements and the NATO Capability Targets, to resource NATO’s new defence plans and force model, as well as to contribute to NATO operations, missions and activities.  We affirm that in many cases, expenditure beyond 2% of GDP will be needed in order to remedy existing shortfalls and meet the requirements across all domains arising from a more contested security order.    28.         We commit to invest at least 20% of our defence budgets on major equipment, including related Research and Development.  We recognise this should be met in conjunction with a minimum of 2% of GDP annual defence expenditure.  We need to maintain our technological edge, and continue to modernise and reform our forces and capabilities, including through the integration of innovative technologies. 29.         We commit to contribute the necessary forces, capabilities and resources to the full range of NATO operations, missions and activities.  This includes meeting requirements for deterrence and defence, providing the forces needed to implement NATO’s defence plans and contribute to NATO crisis management operations.  Allies will ensure that our forces are ready and have the necessary personnel, equipment, training, spares, logistics, infrastructure, and stockpiles.  We commit to improve the interoperability of our national forces, including through transparent compliance with, and further development of, NATO standards and doctrines. 30.         To have the necessary capabilities, the Alliance requires a strong and capable defence industry, with resilient supply chains.  A strong defence industry across the Alliance, including a stronger defence industry in Europe and greater defence industrial cooperation within Europe and across the Atlantic, remains essential for delivering the required capabilities.  Furthermore, consistent with our commitments, obligations and processes, we will reduce and eliminate, as appropriate, obstacles to defence trade and investment among Allies. 31.         NATO is the foundation of our collective defence.  NATO’s key purpose and greatest responsibility is to ensure our collective defence, against all threats, from all directions.  NATO will continue to fulfil three core tasks: deterrence and defence; crisis prevention and management; and cooperative security.  These are complementary to ensure the collective defence and security of all Allies. 32.         Deterrence and defence are at the heart of the Alliance, underpinned by Article 5 of the Washington Treaty and an enduring transatlantic bond.  We are modernising NATO for a new era of collective defence.  We are united in our commitment and resolve to prevail against any aggressor and defend every inch of Allied territory. 33.         Guided by our sovereign decisions, and in response to the threats we face, we remain vigilant and stand together in solidarity ensuring a substantial and persistent presence of our military forces across the Alliance on land, in the air and at sea, in line with our 360-degree approach.  NATO’s deterrence and defence posture is based on an appropriate mix of nuclear, conventional and missile defence capabilities, complemented by space and cyber capabilities.  It is defensive, proportionate and fully in line with our international commitments.  We will employ military and non-military tools in a proportionate, coherent and integrated way to respond to all threats to our security in the manner, timing and in the domain of our choosing. 34.         In response to a radically changed security environment, we are strengthening NATO’s collective defence, against all threats, from all directions.  We cannot discount the possibility of an attack against Allies’ sovereignty and territorial integrity.  Since 2014, and in particular at the 2022 Madrid Summit, we have taken decisions to strengthen our posture and set a clear trajectory for accelerated military adaptation.  Today, we have agreed significant measures to further enhance NATO’s deterrence and defence posture in all domains, including strengthening forward defences and the Alliance’s ability to rapidly reinforce any Ally that comes under threat. We will fully implement these measures and deny any potential adversary any possible opportunities for aggression.  We have: 35.         We welcome the rapid progress towards the full integration of Finland into NATO’s deterrence and defence, and have agreed to complete this process as soon as possible. 36.         We need a robust and resilient defence industry able to sustainably meet the need of significantly strengthened collective defence. We have endorsed a Defence Production Action Plan, and its action items.  This Plan will ensure long-term NATO engagement across the Alliance based on the principles of transparency, equitable treatment and inclusive participation.  With this Plan, and in support of Allies’ own priorities, we are committed to leveraging the Alliance’s role as a convener, standard-setter, requirement setter and aggregator, and delivery enabler to promote sustainable defence industrial capacity.  This will be underpinned by a renewed and urgent focus on interoperability and improving materiel standardization to ensure that our forces can operate seamlessly together, with an initial focus on land munitions.  The Plan will ensure our understanding of defence industry across the Alliance, including small and medium-size enterprises, help aggregate demand to meet NATO’s capability targets, encourage multinational cooperation and more agile procurement, and enhance transparency with industry. 37.         Our robust military capabilities are critical for NATO’s deterrence and defence.  We continue to invest more in advanced and interoperable capabilities across all domains, placing particular emphasis on combat-capable, predominantly heavy, high-end forces and capabilities.  These will reflect the requirements of NATO’s defence plans and other tasks.  We will ensure that these capabilities are resourced to maintain the required high levels of readiness.  We continue to improve the deployability, interoperability, standardisation, responsiveness, force integration and support of our forces in order to conduct and sustain high-intensity operations, including crisis response operations, in demanding environments.  The NATO Defence Planning Process plays a key role in the sharing of risks and responsibilities, and we reaffirm our commitment to providing our respective shares of the capabilities required by the Alliance to fulfil our three core tasks.  Our capability development plans will ensure that we maintain our technological edge, recognising the challenges and opportunities presented by emerging and disruptive technologies, while ensuring their timely integration.  We have also decided to significantly increase our stockpiles of certain battle-decisive munitions. 38.         We will continue to strengthen and regularly exercise the Alliance’s ability to rapidly reinforce any Ally that comes under threat.  Exercises are a key way of demonstrating the Alliance’s resolve and capability.  We are adapting and streamlining our decision-making processes and improving the effectiveness of our alert and response system. 39.         We will individually and collectively deliver the full range of forces, capabilities, plans, resources, assets and infrastructure needed for deterrence and defence, including for high-intensity, multi-domain warfighting against nuclear-armed peer competitors.  Accordingly, we will strengthen training and exercises that simulate conventional and, for Allies concerned, a nuclear dimension of a crisis or conflict, facilitating greater coherence between conventional and nuclear components of NATO’s deterrence and defence posture across all domains and the entire spectrum of conflict. 40.         We have accelerated our efforts, both nationally and in NATO, to ensure the enablement of SACEUR’s Area of Responsibility, including logistics, and to improve our ability to support the reinforcement and sustainment of Allied forces into, across, and from the entire Alliance territory, including through prepositioning of ammunition and equipment.  As part of the enablement of SACEUR’s Area of Responsibility, we are taking forward our work on fuel supply distribution arrangements, as the timely provision of fuel to NATO’s military forces where required in Europe underpins the Alliance’s readiness and responsiveness.  We recognise that the changed security environment represents a more demanding challenge to the Alliance’s collective logistics and we will make political and military efforts to address this challenge, recognising that credible deterrence and defence relies on adequate logistics capability.  Effective military mobility is essential for enablement and further progress is required.  Efforts to ensure a coherent approach and synergies between NATO and the EU in the area of military mobility should be pursued. 41.         NATO Integrated Air and Missile Defence (IAMD) remains key for credible deterrence and defence, and the indivisible security and freedom of action of the Alliance, including NATO’s capability to reinforce, and to provide a strategic response.  NATO IAMD is an essential and continuous mission in peacetime, crisis, and times of conflict.  NATO IAMD incorporates all measures to contribute to deter any air and missile threat or to nullify or reduce their effectiveness.  This mission is conducted in a 360-degree approach, and tailored to address all air and missile threats emanating from all strategic directions from state and non-state actors. 42.         Allied IAMD deployments, including those on the Eastern flank in response to the Russian aggression against Ukraine, as well as exercises and training demonstrate Allied solidarity and resolve.  Based on the Strategic Concept, the new baseline for deterrence and defence posture agreed in Madrid in 2022, and the new generation of defence plans, NATO continues to strengthen its IAMD by improving IAMD readiness, responsiveness, effectiveness, and interoperability, as well as availability of airspace.  NATO and Allies continue to improve IAMD capabilities, such as surveillance, interceptors, and command and control.  We will continue to take into account the increasingly diverse and challenging air and missile threats ranging from simple Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to sophisticated hypersonic missiles. 43.         The fundamental purpose of NATO’s nuclear capability is to preserve peace, prevent coercion and deter aggression.  Nuclear weapons are unique.  As long as nuclear weapons exist, NATO will remain a nuclear alliance.  NATO’s goal is a safer world for all; we seek to create the security environment for a world without nuclear weapons.  The circumstances in which NATO might have to use nuclear weapons are extremely remote.  Any employment of nuclear weapons against NATO would fundamentally alter the nature of a conflict.  The Alliance has the capabilities and resolve to impose costs on an adversary that would be unacceptable and far outweigh the benefits that any adversary could hope to achieve. 44.         The strategic nuclear forces of the Alliance, particularly those of the United States, are the supreme guarantee of the security of the Alliance.  The independent strategic nuclear forces of the United Kingdom and France have a deterrent role of their own and contribute significantly to the overall security of the Alliance.  These Allies’ separate centres of decision-making contribute to deterrence by complicating the calculations of potential adversaries.  NATO’s nuclear deterrence posture also relies on the United States’ nuclear weapons forward-deployed in Europe.  National contributions, by Allies concerned, of dual-capable aircraft, as well as the provision of conventional forces and military capabilities in support of NATO’s nuclear deterrence mission, remain central to this effort. 45.         NATO will take all necessary steps to ensure the credibility, effectiveness, safety and security of the nuclear deterrent mission.  This includes continuing to modernise NATO’s nuclear capability and updating planning to increase flexibility and adaptability of the Alliance’s nuclear forces, while exercising strong political control at all times.  The Alliance reaffirms the imperative to ensure the broadest possible participation by Allies concerned in NATO’s nuclear burden-sharing arrangements to demonstrate Alliance unity and resolve. 46.         The Alliance is committed to ensuring greater integration and coherence of capabilities and activities across all domains and the spectrum of conflict, while reaffirming the unique and distinct role of nuclear deterrence.  NATO will continue to maintain credible deterrence, strengthen its strategic communications, enhance the effectiveness of its exercises and reduce strategic risks.  NATO is ready and able to deter aggression and manage escalation risks in a crisis that has a nuclear dimension. 47.         Missile defence can complement the role of nuclear weapons in deterrence; it cannot substitute them.  The aim and political principles of NATO Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) remain unchanged from the 2010 Lisbon Summit.  NATO BMD is purely defensive and is aimed at countering ballistic missile threats emanating from outside of the Euro-Atlantic area.  Allies remain committed to the full development of NATO BMD, to pursue the Alliance’s collective defence and to provide full coverage and protection for all NATO European populations, territory, and forces against the increasing threat posed by the proliferation of ballistic missiles. 48.         NATO BMD is based on voluntary national contributions, including the US European Phased Adaptive Approach assets in Romania, Türkiye, Spain, and Poland, as well as the NATO BMD command and control, the only component eligible for common funding.  Additional voluntary national contributions will provide robustness.  We are committed to completing additional essential components of NATO BMD command and control, which is necessary for achieving the next major milestone before reaching the Full Operational Capability. 49.         Strategic stability, delivered through effective deterrence and defence, arms control and disarmament, and meaningful and reciprocal political dialogue remains essential to our security.  Arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation strongly contribute to the Alliance’s objectives.  Allies’ efforts on arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation aim to reduce risk and enhance security, transparency, verification, and compliance.  We will pursue all elements of strategic risk reduction, including promoting confidence building and predictability through dialogue, increasing understanding, and establishing effective crisis management and prevention tools.  These efforts will take the prevailing security environment and the security of all Allies into account and complement the Alliance’s deterrence and defence posture.  We will make use of NATO as a platform for in-depth discussion and close consultations on arms control efforts.    50.         Arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation have made and should continue to make an essential contribution to achieving the Alliance’s security objectives and for ensuring strategic stability and our collective security.  NATO has a long track record of doing its part on disarmament and non-proliferation.  After the end of the Cold War, NATO dramatically reduced the number of nuclear weapons stationed in Europe and its reliance on nuclear weapons in NATO strategy.  Allies remain collectively determined to uphold and support existing disarmament, arms control, and non-proliferation agreements and commitments.  We will further strengthen arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation, as a key element of Euro-Atlantic security, taking into account the prevailing security environment and the security of all Allies. 51.         Russia’s violations and selective implementation of its arms control obligations and commitments have contributed to the deterioration of the broader security landscape.  We condemn Russia’s purported suspension of the New START treaty and failure to comply with its legally-binding obligations under the Treaty.  We call on Russia to return to full implementation of the Treaty as well as to act responsibly and engage constructively to reduce strategic and nuclear risks.  We also condemn Russia’s decision to withdraw from the landmark Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, which further demonstrates Russia’s continued disregard for arms control, and is the latest in a series of actions to undermine Euro-Atlantic security.  Allies urge Russia to implement its commitments and obligations, and to use the remaining time before its withdrawal to reconsider its decision.  Allies will continue to consult on the implications of Russia’s withdrawal from the CFE Treaty and its impact on the security of the Alliance. 52.         The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) remains the essential bulwark against the spread of nuclear weapons.  It is the cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime and disarmament architecture, the only credible path to nuclear disarmament, and the framework for international cooperation in sharing the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, science and technology.  Allies remain strongly committed to the full implementation of the NPT across its three pillars, including Article VI.  Russia blocking consensus at the Tenth NPT Review Conference was irresponsible.  We call on all NPT States Parties to work together to implement and strengthen the NPT in the current NPT Review Cycle.  We underline the urgent need to bring the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty into force.  We call for the immediate commencement and early conclusion of negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament of a treaty banning the production of fissile material for use in nuclear weapons or other explosive devices in accordance with Conference on Disarmament report CD/1299 and the mandate contained therein.  We call on all states that have not yet done so to declare and maintain voluntary moratoria on the production of fissile material for use in nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. 53.         NATO Allies support the ultimate goal of a world without nuclear weapons, in full accordance with all provisions of the NPT, achieved in an effective and verifiable way that promotes international stability and which is based on the principle of undiminished security for all.  NATO’s nuclear burden-sharing arrangements have always been fully consistent with the NPT. 54.         We reiterate that the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) stands in opposition to and is inconsistent and incompatible with the Alliance’s nuclear deterrence policy, is at odds with the existing non-proliferation and disarmament architecture, risks undermining the NPT, and does not take into account the current security environment.  The TPNW does not change the legal obligations on our countries with respect to nuclear weapons.  We do not accept any argument that the TPNW reflects or in any way contributes to the development of customary international law.   We call on our partners and all other countries to reflect realistically on the ban treaty’s impact on international peace and security, including on the NPT, and join us in working to improve collective security through tangible and verifiable measures that can reduce strategic risks and enable lasting progress on nuclear disarmament. 55.         The PRC is rapidly expanding and diversifying its nuclear arsenal with more warheads and a larger number of sophisticated delivery systems to establish a nuclear triad, while failing to engage in meaningful transparency or good faith efforts to achieve nuclear arms control or risk reduction.  We oppose any attempt to produce or support the production of plutonium for military programmes under the guise of civilian programmes, which undermines the objectives of the NPT.  We urge the PRC to engage in strategic risk reduction discussions and to promote stability through greater transparency with regard to its nuclear weapon policies, plans and capabilities. 56.         We reiterate our clear determination that Iran must never develop a nuclear weapon.  We remain deeply concerned about Iran’s escalation of its nuclear programme.  We call on Iran to fulfil its legal obligations under its Non-Proliferation Treaty-required safeguards agreement and political commitments regarding nuclear non-proliferation without further delay.  The fulfilment by Iran of these obligations and commitments is crucial to allow the IAEA to provide credible assurances of the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme. We also call on Iran to stop all ballistic missile activities inconsistent with UNSCR 2231. 57.         We condemn in the strongest terms the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s (DPRK) WMD and ballistic missile programmes which violate multiple UN Security Council Resolutions.  We reiterate that the DPRK must abandon its nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programmes, and any other weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programmes, in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner.  We urge the DPRK to return to, and fully comply with, the NPT and IAEA safeguards.  We call on the DPRK to accept the repeated offers of dialogue put forward by all parties concerned, including Japan, the United States, and the Republic of Korea. 58.         The potential use of Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) materials or weapons against NATO by hostile state and non-state actors remains a central and evolving threat to our security.  We are implementing NATO’s new CBRN defence policy, as agreed at the Madrid Summit, and are investing in the military capabilities required to effectively operate, fight and prevail in any environment, and to ensure our national and collective resilience against CBRN risks and threats. 59.         NATO safeguards the freedom and security of all its members using both political and military means.  The evolving security environment increasingly requires that NATO will take a structured and tailored approach that uses non-military and military tools in a deliberate, coherent, and sustained manner, throughout the full spectrum of peace, crisis and conflict.  NATO uses a variety of non-military tools which support the Alliance’s three core tasks.  It also continues to serve as a platform for enhancing the coherent use of these tools by Allies, under their own authority and control, and alongside other international actors.  We will continue to strengthen effective, clear, and convincing strategic communication. 60.         As the war in Europe has fundamentally shifted the nature of the Euro-Atlantic security environment, the emphasis on intelligence has become even more prominent and essential to Alliance decision-making and strategic planning.  The value of the NATO intelligence enterprise comes first and foremost from the Allied intelligence and security services working closely together to share intelligence and continue to ensure that the Alliance has a comprehensive understanding of the global strategic picture.  To that end, Allies’ intelligence capabilities will contribute to improving NATO’s understanding of the threats, risks and challenges, and to optimising our significant and diverse analysis capabilities.  We will strengthen our intelligence cooperation within the Alliance and with partners as appropriate.  NATO and Allies will enhance their security and counter-intelligence measures to respond effectively to hostile intelligence activity. 61.         National and collective resilience are an essential basis for credible deterrence and defence and the effective fulfilment of the Alliance’s core tasks, and vital in our efforts to safeguard our societies, our populations and our shared values.  Resilience is a national responsibility and a collective commitment rooted in Article 3 of the Washington Treaty.  Today we have agreed the 2023 Alliance Resilience Objectives.  We build on the 2021 Strengthened Resilience Commitment.  The Resilience Objectives will strengthen NATO and Allied preparedness against strategic shocks and disruptions.  They will boost our national and collective ability to ensure continuity of government and of essential services to our populations, and enable civil support to military operations, in peace, crisis and conflict.  Allies will use these objectives to guide the development of their national goals and implementation plans, consistent with their respective national risk profile.  We will also work towards identifying and mitigating strategic vulnerabilities and dependencies, including with respect to our critical infrastructure, supply chains and health systems.  Allies should also promote societal resilience.  As we strengthen our efforts to build resilience, we will continue to work with our partners engaged in similar efforts, in particular the European Union, in order to make the Euro-Atlantic area and our broader neighbourhood more secure.  The actions, commitments and legal obligations of individual Allies in other international bodies also contribute to enhancing our resilience. 62.         The Alliance’s ability to fulfil its core tasks increasingly relies on the adoption of digital technologies.  Recognising the urgency of a digitally-transformed Alliance, we have endorsed a Digital Transformation Implementation Strategy to underpin our ability to conduct Multi-Domain Operations, drive interoperability across all domains, enhance situational awareness, political consultation, and employ data-driven decision-making. 63.         Emerging and disruptive technologies (EDTs) bring both opportunities and risks.  They are altering the character of conflict, acquiring greater strategic importance and becoming key arenas of global competition.  The operational importance of EDTs as well as of access to and adaptation of commercial technologies in current operations have been highlighted in the context of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine.  NATO’s strategic competitors and potential adversaries are investing heavily in technologies that can be highly effective, particularly in malign hybrid activities, and decisive in conflict.  We are accelerating our own efforts to ensure that the Alliance maintains its technological edge in emerging and disruptive technologies to retain our interoperability and military edge, including through dual-use solutions.  We are working together to adopt and integrate new technologies, cooperate with the private sector, protect our innovation ecosystems, shape standards, and commit to principles of responsible use that reflect our democratic values and human rights.  We will ensure that we act in accordance with international law and seek to build public trust.  NATO’s Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic (DIANA) has now launched its first challenges to start-ups in NATO countries.  To further develop our transatlantic innovation ecosystem, the NATO Innovation Fund, the world’s first multi-sovereign venture capital fund, will begin to invest in deep-tech in the coming months.  Complementing the recently agreed strategies on Artificial Intelligence and Autonomy, NATO will develop further strategies for key emerging and disruptive technologies, including on Quantum Technologies and on Biotechnology and Human Enhancement to address the opportunities and risks they present.    64.         We continue to face growing hybrid threats and challenges from state and non-state actors, who use hybrid activities, including through interference and the harmful use of technologies, to target our political institutions, our critical infrastructure, our societies, our democratic systems, our economies, and the security of our citizens.  We remain united in defending our open and democratic societies against these malign activities.  We reiterate that hybrid operations against Allies could reach the level of an armed attack and could lead the Council to invoke Article 5 of the Washington Treaty.  We will continue to prepare for, deter, defend against and counter hybrid threats, including by potentially deploying Counter Hybrid Support Teams.  We continue to develop comprehensive preventive and response options and stand ready to apply them to enhance resilience and deter malign actors from engaging in hybrid operations.  Individual Allies may consider, when appropriate, attributing hybrid activities and responding in a coordinated manner, recognising attribution is a sovereign national prerogative.  We will continue to address disinformation and misinformation, including through positive and effective strategic communications.  We will also continue to support our partners as they strengthen their resilience in the face of hybrid challenges. 65.         The threat to critical undersea infrastructure is real and it is developing.  We are committed to identifying and mitigating strategic vulnerabilities and dependencies with respect to our critical infrastructure, and to prepare for, deter and defend against the coercive use of energy and other hybrid tactics by state and non-state actors.  Any deliberate attack against Allies’ critical infrastructure will be met with a united and determined response; this applies also to critical undersea infrastructure.  The protection of critical undersea infrastructure on Allies’ territory remains a national responsibility, as well as a collective commitment.  NATO stands ready to support Allies if and when requested.  We have agreed to establish NATO’s Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure within NATO’s Maritime Command (MARCOM).  We also agreed to set up a network that brings together NATO, Allies, private sector, and other relevant actors to improve information sharing and exchange best practice. 66.         Cyberspace is contested at all times as threat actors increasingly seek to destabilise the Alliance by employing malicious cyber activities and campaigns.  Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine has highlighted the extent to which cyber is a feature of modern conflict.  We are countering the substantial, continuous, and increasing cyber threats, including to our democratic systems and our critical infrastructure, as well as where they are part of hybrid campaigns.  We are determined to employ the full range of capabilities in order to deter, defend against and counter the full spectrum of cyber threats, including by considering collective responses.  A single or cumulative set of malicious cyber activities could reach the level of armed attack and could lead the North Atlantic Council to invoke Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, on a case-by-case basis.  We remain committed to act in accordance with international law, including the UN Charter, international humanitarian law, and international human rights law as applicable.  We continue to promote a free, open, peaceful, and secure cyberspace, and further pursue efforts to enhance stability and reduce the risk of conflict, by ensuring that international law is respected and by supporting voluntary norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace.  Today, we endorse a new concept to enhance the contribution of cyber defence to our overall deterrence and defence posture.  It will further integrate NATO’s three cyber defence levels – political, military, and technical – ensuring civil-military cooperation at all times through peacetime, crisis, and conflict, as well as engagement with the private sector, as appropriate.  Doing so will enhance our shared situational awareness.  Strengthening our cyber resilience is key to making our Alliance more secure and better able to mitigate the potential for significant harm from cyber threats.  Today we restate and enhance our Cyber Defence Pledge and have committed to ambitious new national goals to further strengthen our national cyber defences as a matter of priority, including critical infrastructures.  We have launched NATO’s new Virtual Cyber Incident Support Capability (VCISC) to support national mitigation efforts in response to significant malicious cyber activities.  This provides Allies with an additional tool for assistance.  We will further seek to develop mutually beneficial and effective partnerships as appropriate, including with partner countries, international organisations, industry, and academia, furthering our efforts to enhance international stability in cyberspace.  Complementing our existing exchanges, we will hold the first comprehensive NATO Cyber Defence Conference in Berlin this November, bringing together decision-makers across the political, military, and technical levels. 67.         Space plays a critical role for the security and prosperity of our nations.  Space is also an increasingly contested domain, marked by irresponsible behaviour, malicious activities, and the growth of counterspace capabilities by NATO’s potential adversaries and strategic competitors.  Maintaining secure use and unfettered access to space is key to effective deterrence and defence.  As part of our work on space as an operational domain, we are accelerating the integration of space into planning, exercising and executing joint and multi-domain operations in peacetime, crisis, and conflict in order to ensure space effects are coordinated across all domains.  We have committed to enhancing the sharing of our space data, products and services within NATO in support of the Alliance’s requirements and defence plans.  We welcome the ongoing efforts on the Alliance Persistent Surveillance from Space (APSS) multinational programme, which will improve NATO’s intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capacity.  We welcome the establishment of the NATO Space Centre of Excellence in France.  Allies are committed to upholding international law and we will continue to support international efforts to reduce space threats by promoting norms, rules, and principles of responsible space behaviours.  We reaffirm that hostile operations to, from, or within space could reach the level of armed attack and could lead the North Atlantic Council to invoke Article 5 of the Washington Treaty. 68.         Energy security plays an important role in our common security.  The energy crisis intentionally exacerbated by Russia has underlined the importance of a stable and reliable energy supply and the diversification of routes, suppliers, and sources.  We will continue to develop NATO’s capacity to support national authorities in protecting critical energy infrastructure.  We are committed to ensuring secure, resilient, and sustainable energy supplies to our military forces.  As we adapt our Alliance to the ongoing energy transition, we will ensure military capability, effectiveness and interoperability.  Allies are seeking and will continue to seek diversification of their energy supplies, in line with their needs and conditions. 69.         Climate change is a defining challenge with a profound impact on Allied security facing present and future generations.  It remains a threat multiplier.  NATO is committed to becoming the leading international organisation when it comes to understanding and adapting to the impact of climate change on security.  We will continue to address the impact of climate change on defence and security, including through the development of innovative strategic analysis tools.  We will integrate climate change considerations into all of NATO’s core tasks, adapt our infrastructure, military capabilities and technologies ensuring resilience to future operating environments.  To contribute to the mitigation of climate change, we are committed to significantly cutting greenhouse gas emissions by the NATO political and military structures and facilities; we will also contribute to combatting climate change by improving energy efficiency, transitioning to clean energy sources, and leveraging innovative next-generation clean technologies, while ensuring military effectiveness and a credible deterrence and defence posture.  We will continue to strengthen our exchanges with partner countries, the scientific community, as well as other international and regional organisations that are active on climate change and security.  We welcome the establishment of a NATO Centre of Excellence for Climate Change and Security in Montreal. 70.         We are committed to integrating the Human Security and the Women, Peace and Security agendas across all our core tasks.  We will continue to work towards fully operationalising this objective, through robust policies and clear operational guidelines, in order to enhance our operational effectiveness and ensure synergies between the civilian and military structures.  In doing so, we are working with partners, international organisations, and civil society.  We reaffirm our commitment to an ambitious human security agenda.  Our Human Security Approach and Guiding Principles allows us to develop a more comprehensive view of the human environment, contributing to lasting peace and security.  Today, we endorse a NATO Policy on Children and Armed Conflict, and an updated Policy on Combatting Trafficking in Human Beings.  Our ongoing work on human security also includes cultural property protection. 71.         We recognise the critical importance of women’s full, equal, and meaningful participation in all aspects of peace and stability, noting the disproportionate impact that conflict has on women and girls, including through conflict-related sexual violence.  We will consistently continue to implement our Policy on Women, Peace and Security, and, in this context, we will advance gender equality and integrate gender perspectives and foster the principles of the Women, Peace and Security agenda set out by the UN Security Council in all that we do, including in NATO operations, missions, activities, and our work on emerging challenges.  We will assess and update NATO’s Policy on Women, Peace and Security. 72.         NATO’s partnerships are, and will continue to be, essential to the way NATO works.  They play an important role in supporting NATO’s three core tasks and our 360-degree security approach.  We are grateful to our partners for their significant contributions to NATO’s situational awareness, operations, missions, and activities, including Trust Fund projects.  The current security environment highlights the significance of partnerships.  They are crucial to protect the global commons and enhance our resilience.  We will strengthen our ties with partners that share the Alliance’s values and interest in upholding the rules-based international order.  We will continue to strengthen political dialogue and practical cooperation with partners, based on mutual respect, benefit and interest of both Allies and partners.  This contributes to stability beyond our borders and enhances our security at home.  We will increase outreach to countries in our broader neighbourhood and across the globe and remain open to engagement with any country or organisation, when doing so could bolster our mutual security.  We remain committed to the principles underpinning our relations with our partners, and have taken steps to make our partnerships more strategic, more coherent and more effective.  We will discuss common approaches to global security challenges where NATO’s interests are affected, share perspectives through deeper political engagement, and seek concrete areas for cooperation to address shared security concerns.  In line with our Comprehensive Approach Action Plan, we will continue to pursue coherence within NATO’s own tools and strands of work, concerted approaches with partner nations and organisations such as the UN, the EU, and the OSCE, as well as further dialogue with non-governmental organisations. 73.         The European Union remains a unique and essential partner for NATO.  Our strategic partnership is essential for the security and prosperity of our nations and of the Euro-Atlantic area.  It is built on our shared values, our determination to tackle common challenges and our unequivocal commitment to promote and safeguard peace, freedom and prosperity.  NATO recognises the value of a stronger and more capable European defence that contributes positively to transatlantic and global security and is complementary to, and interoperable with NATO.  The development of coherent, complementary and interoperable defence capabilities, avoiding unnecessary duplication, is key in our joint efforts to make the Euro-Atlantic area safer.  Such efforts, including recent developments, will lead to a stronger NATO, help enhance our common security, contribute to transatlantic burden sharing, help deliver needed capabilities, and support an overall increase in defence spending.  Non-EU Allies continue to make significant contributions to the EU’s efforts to strengthen its capacities to address common security challenges.  For the strategic partnership between NATO and the EU, non-EU Allies’ fullest involvement in EU defence efforts is essential.  We look forward to mutual steps, representing tangible progress, in this area to support a strengthened strategic partnership.  We reaffirm in their entirety all the decisions, principles, and commitments with regard to NATO and EU cooperation.  We will continue to further strengthen this partnership in a spirit of full mutual openness, transparency, complementarity, and respect for the organisations’ different mandates, decision-making autonomy and institutional integrity, and as agreed by the two organisations. 74.         In the context of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, NATO-EU cooperation has become more significant.  We have unequivocally demonstrated unity of purpose and common resolve in leveraging our complementary, coherent and mutually reinforcing roles.  NATO and EU will continue to support Ukraine.  In this respect, we welcome the establishment of the dedicated NATO-EU Staff Coordination on Ukraine.  We have also achieved tangible results in strategic communications, including the fight against disinformation, countering hybrid and cyber threats, exercises, operational cooperation, defence capabilities, defence industry and research, counter-terrorism, and defence and security capacity building.  We are further expanding our cooperation on resilience, protection of critical infrastructure, emerging and disruptive technologies, space, security implications of climate change, and geostrategic competition.  We will also continue to address the systemic challenges posed by the PRC to Euro-Atlantic security.  Political dialogue between NATO and the EU remains essential to advance NATO-EU cooperation. 75.         The Western Balkans is a region of strategic importance for NATO as highlighted by our long history of cooperation and operations.  We remain strongly committed to the security and stability of the Western Balkans by supporting reforms that advance the respective NATO and EU aspirations of the countries in the region.  We will continue to enhance our political dialogue and practical cooperation in order to support reforms, regional peace and security, and counter malign influence, including disinformation, hybrid, and cyber threats, posed by both state and non-state actors.  The region requires continued attention and commitment from the Alliance and the international community to counter these challenges.  Democratic values, the rule of law, domestic reforms, and good neighbourly relations are vital for regional cooperation and Euro-Atlantic integration, and we look to continued progress in this regard.    76.         NATO strongly supports the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a stable and secure Bosnia and Herzegovina, in accordance with the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina and other relevant international agreements.  We encourage domestic reconciliation, and urge political leaders to refrain from divisive and secessionist rhetoric and actions.  We remain committed to the country’s Euro-Atlantic aspirations.  We continue to support reform efforts, including through the newly agreed Defence Capacity Building package, NATO HQ Sarajevo, and wide-ranging cooperative security and partnership tools, and through the country’s Reform Programme with NATO.  We encourage Bosnia and Herzegovina to take advantage of NATO’s support and intensify efforts to make progress on reforms in key areas, including the much-needed political, electoral, rule of law, economic, and defence reforms, without prejudice to a final decision on NATO membership. 77.         Strengthening NATO-Serbia relations would be of benefit to the Alliance, to Serbia, and to the whole region.  We look to Serbia to engage with NATO and its neighbours in a constructive manner, including in its public communications on the mutual benefits of NATO-Serbia cooperation.  We support the EU-facilitated Dialogue and other efforts aimed at the normalisation of relations between Belgrade and Pristina, and urge the sides to seize the moment and engage in good faith towards reaching a lasting political solution.  We call on both sides to immediately de-escalate, return to dialogue, and engage constructively in implementing the agreement on the path to normalisation between Belgrade and Pristina reached recently in Brussels and Ohrid. 78.         We remain committed to NATO’s continued engagement in Kosovo, including through the NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR).  KFOR will continue to provide a safe and secure environment and freedom of movement in Kosovo in line with UNSC Resolution 1244.  The recent escalatory actions are unacceptable and we condemn the violence in northern Kosovo as well as the unprovoked attacks that caused serious injuries to NATO soldiers.  We have increased KFOR’s troop presence to respond to the recurrent tensions.  Any changes to our force posture in KFOR will remain conditions-based and not calendar driven. 79.         The Black Sea region is of strategic importance for the Alliance. This is further highlighted by Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine. We underline our continued support to Allied regional efforts aimed at upholding security, safety, stability and freedom of navigation in the Black Sea region including, as appropriate, through the 1936 Montreux Convention. We will further monitor and assess developments in the region and enhance our situational awareness, with a particular focus on the threats to our security and potential opportunities for closer cooperation with our partners in the region, as appropriate. 80.         We reiterate our support to the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Georgia within its internationally recognised borders.  We stand firm in our support for Georgia’s right to decide its own future and foreign policy course free from outside interference.  We call on Russia to withdraw the forces it has stationed in Georgia without its consent.  We further call on Russia to reverse its recognition of the Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions of Georgia; to end the militarisation of these regions and continued attempts to forcibly separate them from the rest of Georgia through the construction of border-like obstacles; and to cease the human rights violations and abuses, including arbitrary detentions, and harassments of Georgian citizens.  We highly appreciate Georgia’s substantial contributions to NATO operations, which demonstrate its commitment and capability to contribute to Euro-Atlantic security.  We remain committed to making full use of the NATO-Georgia Commission and the Annual National Programme (ANP) in deepening political dialogue and practical cooperation with Georgia.  We reiterate the decision made at the 2008 Bucharest Summit that Georgia will become a member of the Alliance with the Membership Action Plan (MAP) as an integral part of the process; we reaffirm all elements of that decision, as well as subsequent decisions.  We welcome the progress made in implementing the enhanced Substantial NATO-Georgia Package, including Crisis Management, Cyber Security, Military Engineering, and Secure Communications, as well as new initiatives in the areas of Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Defence and Training Facilities.  To advance its Euro-Atlantic aspirations, Georgia must make progress on reforms, including key democratic reforms, and make best use of the ANP. 81.         We reiterate our support for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Republic of Moldova within its internationally recognised borders and call on Russia to withdraw all of its forces stationed in the Transnistrian region without Moldova’s consent.  We stand firm in our support for Moldova’s right to decide its own future and foreign policy course free from outside interference, and fully respect Moldova’s constitutional neutrality.  NATO is stepping up political and practical support to strengthen its resilience and uphold its political independence in light of the deteriorating security environment.  Allies welcome Moldova’s efforts to promote democratic reforms and are committed to supporting Moldova as it advances its European integration.  NATO will continue to provide practical assistance through the enhanced Defence Capacity Building Package, as Moldova works to strengthen its security and defence capabilities and modernise its Armed Forces. 82.         The Middle East and Africa are regions of strategic interest.  We will deepen our political engagements and public diplomacy outreach to our long-standing partners in the Mediterranean Dialogue and Istanbul Cooperation Initiative.  We will also increase our outreach to relevant regional organisations, including the African Union and the Gulf Cooperation Council.  We are implementing the Defence Capacity Building packages for Iraq, Jordan, Mauritania, and Tunisia.  We will also explore with the Jordanian authorities the possibility of establishing a NATO Liaison Office in Amman. 83.         NATO and Allies remain committed in our support to Iraq and its ability to stabilise the country.  We recognise the continued efforts and progress of the Government of Iraq and the Iraqi Security Forces to combat ISIS/Da’esh.  We encourage further progress in Iraq’s fight against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.  Our NATO Mission Iraq continues to deliver non-combat advisory and capacity building support to the Iraqi security institutions in the greater Baghdad area, and has deepened collaboration with Iraq’s Ministry of Defence.  Based on the request from the Iraqi government, we are considering broadening NATO Mission Iraq, by evolving it to provide advice to the Iraqi Ministry of Interior on its Federal Police.  NATO Mission Iraq will continue to be demand-driven, and will be carried out with the full consent of the Iraqi authorities, in full respect of Iraq’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and in close coordination with relevant partners and international actors. 84.         Iran’s support to the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine has an impact on Euro-Atlantic security.  We call upon Iran to cease its military support to Russia, in particular its transfer of Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) which have been used to attack critical infrastructure, causing widespread civilian casualties.  We express our serious concern over Iran’s malicious activities within Allied territory.  We also call upon Iran to refrain from destabilising actions, including seizures of maritime vessels, and to play a constructive role in fostering regional stability and peace. 85.         The Indo-Pacific is important for NATO, given that developments in that region can directly affect Euro-Atlantic security.  We welcome the contribution of our partners in the Asia-Pacific region – Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and the Republic of Korea – to security in the Euro-Atlantic, including their commitment to supporting Ukraine.  We will further strengthen our dialogue and cooperation to tackle our shared security challenges, including on cyber defence, technology and hybrid, underpinned by our shared commitment to upholding international law and the rules-based international order. 86.         NATO’s engagement with other international and regional organisations, including the United Nations, the OSCE, and the African Union, contributes to international security.  We will strengthen these interactions to advance our shared interests.  We are exploring the possibility of establishing a Liaison Office in Geneva to further strengthen our engagement with the United Nations and other relevant international organisations. 87.         We will ensure that our political decisions are adequately resourced. We will build on the progress made to ensure that increased national defence expenditures and NATO common funding will be commensurate with the challenges of a more contested security order. 88.         We pay tribute to all women and men who work tirelessly for our collective security, honour all those who have paid the ultimate price or have been wounded to keep us safe, and their families. 89.         NATO remains the strongest Alliance in history.  As in the past, we will stand the test of time in safeguarding the freedom and security of our Allies and contributing to peace and security. 90.         We express our appreciation for the generous hospitality extended to us by the Republic of Lithuania.  We look forward to meeting again for the Alliance’s 75th anniversary in Washington, D.C. in 2024, followed by a meeting in the Netherlands in 2025.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/12/full-text-nato-vilnius-summit-communique
Ukraine F-16 fighter pilot training to start soon in Romania,Ukraine’s defence minister says he hopes training lasts no longer than 6 months so fighter planes can be in combat against Russia soon.,"The training of Ukrainian pilots onUnited States-made F-16 fighter jetsis to begin in Romania in August, officials have said on the sidelines of the NATO summit in Lithuania. Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov announced the Romania training programme on Tuesday alongside Dutch Defence Minister Kajsa Ollongren and Denmark’s acting Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen. “Hopefully, we will be able to see results in the beginning of next year,” Poulsen told reporters. Resnikov said he hoped the training would last no longer than six months and that by that point, Ukraine will beusing the combat aircraftin its fight against Russia’s invasion of his country. The Netherlands and Denmark are leading an 11-nation coalition to train Ukrainian pilots on the US fighter jets, which Ukraine argues will help turn the tide of the war in its favour. Training Ukrainian pilots in the use of advanced fighter planes was previously seen as controversial butreceived the green lightin May at the G7 summit in Japan. Russia later warned that providing Kyiv with F-16would be a “colossal risk”as it threatens spreading the war to other parts of Europe. Though Ukraine’s allies have committed to providing training and other support, the opening of thefighter pilot schooldoes not mean F-16s will actually be delivered to Kyiv. Ukraine’s military supporters have yet to commit to sending warplanes. Romania announced last week that it intended to set up an F-16 training centre for military pilots from NATO partner states and Ukraine.     Romania, which shares a long border with Ukraine and has been a NATO member since 2004 and a European Union member since 2007, has increased defence spending in response to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. After Moscow’s forces invaded Ukraine in February 2022, NATO increased its presence on Europe’s eastern flank by sending additional multinational battlegroups to alliance members Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria and Slovakia. The fighter pilot training facility will aim to position Romania as “a regional leader in the field of F-16 pilot training” and contribute to “improving cohesion, demonstrating unity and strengthening the deterrence and defence posture Euro-Atlantic”, the Romanian government said in a statement. Romania has played an increasingly prominent role in the alliance throughout Russia’s war in Ukraine, including hosting a NATO meeting of foreign ministers in November. The government has also approved the acquisition of an unspecified number of “latest generation” US-made F-35 fighter jets as part of Romania’s push to modernise its air force.

Russia’s Medvedev says NATO’s Ukraine aid brings world war closer,The deputy secretary of Russia’s Security Council said Western military aid would not stop Moscow’s victory in Ukraine.,"Increased assistance for Ukraine from NATO members brings the threat of a third global conflict closer, Russia’s Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy secretary of the Kremlin’s powerful Security Council, has warned. Commenting late on Tuesday as thefirst day of the NATO summitin Lithuania wrapped up, Medvedev said thatpledges of military aidfrom the Western defence alliance to Kyiv would not deter Russia from achieving its goals in Ukraine. Russia’s foreign minister issued similar warnings that Moscow had no intention to end its war. “The completely crazy West could not come up with anything else … In fact, it’s a dead end. World War Three is getting closer,” Medvedev wrote on the Telegram messaging app. “What does all this mean for us? Everything is obvious. The special military operation will continue with the same goals,” he said, using the official Russian name for its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Medvedev, who had cast himself as a liberal moderniser when he was Russian president from 2008-2012, has more recently presented as a fiercely anti-Western Kremlin hawk. In January, he threatened that defeat in a conventional war in Ukraine couldlead to a nuclear war. Diplomats say his views give an indication of thinking at the top levels of the Kremlin elite.     According to Russia’s state-run TASS news agency, Medvedev also said that Moscow’s goal of preventing the “neo-Nazi group” in Kyiv from joining NATO was now “impossible” and removing the Ukrainian government was necessary. “We insisted on that from the very outset, but it is impossible, and, therefore, this group has to be eliminated. This is possible and necessary,” Medvedev said, according to TASS. Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also said on Tuesday that the war in Ukraine would not end while the West used Ukraine as a proxy to inflict a strategic defeat on Moscow. “Why doesn’t the armed confrontation in Ukraine come to an end? The answer is very simple: It will continue until the West gives up its plans to preserve its domination and overcome its obsessive desire to inflict on Russia a strategic defeat at the hands of its Kiev [Russia’s spelling for Kyiv] puppets,” Lavrov said in an interview with Indonesian media, according to TASS. “For the time being, there are no signs of change in this position,” Lavrov said. Russia’s Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov joined the rising chorus of NATO condemnation, saying that the Western military bloc planned to concentrate troops on Russia’s borders, according to a report in TASS on Wednesday. “The meeting in Vilnius demonstrated the bloc’s intention to concentrate more and more troops on Russian borders. We have nowhere to retreat,” Antonov told TASS. NATO statements emerging from the summit in Vilnius had confirmed the “anti-Russian drive” of the alliance, which has thrown all its resources “into the fight against our country”, the ambassador said. As well as warning of another world war, Medvedev also advocated on Tuesday for Russia to use cluster munitions, which he called an “inhuman weapon”, after what he said were reports of Ukraine already using them in battle.    TheUnited States announcedlast week that it would supply Kyiv with cluster munitions, which typically release large numbers of small bomblets over a wide area and are banned by many countries because of the danger they pose to civilians during and after conflicts. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu also said on Tuesday that Moscow would use “similar” weapons in Ukraine if the US supplied Kyiv with cluster bombs. Shoigu also warned that Russian cluster weapons are “much more effective than the American ones, their range is wider and more diverse”. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of already using cluster munitions on the battlefield.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/12/russias-medvedev-says-natos-ukraine-aid-brings-world-war-closer

Russia launches latest drone attack on Kyiv as NATO meets,Russia also conducted air raids on Kyiv in the early hours of Tuesday morning with Iranian-made Shahed drones.,"Russia launched at least 15 drones to attack Kyiv and other regions for a second consecutive night, with air defence systems engaged in repelling the aerial weapons just hours before Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was to meet with leaders of the NATO military alliance. Ukraine’s air defences shot down 11 of the Iranian-made Shahed drones launched by Russia in the early hours of Wednesday morning, the Ukrainian Air Force said on the Telegram messaging app. “A difficult night … The enemy attacked our area with ‘Shaheds’,” Ihor Taburets, the military head of the Cherkasy region southeast of Kyiv, said on the Telegram messaging app. Two people were injured in the attacks and fire broke out at a non-residential infrastructure facility, Taburets said. It was not immediately known how many drones in total were launched on Cherkasy and how many on Kyiv. Serhiy Popko, the head of Kyiv’s military administration, said earlier that the air attack came on the “504th day of the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation into Ukraine”. Russia had also conducted air raids on Kyiv and other locations in the early hours of Tuesday morning withIranian Shahed drones. Washington, DC-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said the Ukrainian military reported shooting down 26 of 28 Shahed 131 and 136 drones, which were likely intended by Moscow to be a “demonstrative response to the 2023 NATO Summit”, which started in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, on Tuesday.    The Russian drones also attacked port infrastructure and a grain terminal in the Odesa region, according to Ukrainian commanders. “Russia’s drone strikes on port infrastructure also coincide with the first day of the NATO summit in Vilnius and are likely intended to discourage NATO members from providing more military aid to Ukraine,” the ISW said on Tuesday. “Russia may be threatening the Black Sea grain deal to message the deal’s original broker, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, that his recent statement of support for Ukraine’s NATO membership and the return of the fiveUkrainian Azovstal commanderson July 7 has not gone unnoticed and is not appreciated by the Kremlin,” the ISW added. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Saturday that Ankara had promised under a prisoner exchange agreement to keep the five Ukrainian commanders in Turkey for the duration of the war and complained that Moscow had not been informed of the move to return them to Kyiv.

"NATO stops short of Ukraine invitation, angering Zelenskyy",The military alliance says it will invite Ukraine to become a member only when ‘conditions are met’ but gives no timeline.,"NATO leaders say Ukraine should be able to join the military alliance in the future but stopped short of offering Kyiv an immediate invitation, angering President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The leaders of the 31 member states begana two-day summitin the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, on Tuesday as Ukrainian troops struggle to make significant gains in a counteroffensive against Russian forces occupying parts of their country. “Ukraine’s future is in NATO,” the leaders said in adeclaration, but they offered no timeline for the process. “We will be in a position to extend an invitation to Ukraine to join the alliance when allies agree and conditions are met,” the declaration said without specifying the conditions. NATO did drop a requirement for Ukraine to fulfil what is called a membership action plan, effectively removing a hurdle on Kyiv’s way into the alliance.  But the failure to go much beyond a 2008 promise on future membership appeared a bitter blow to Zelenskyy, who was in Vilnius toaddress an admiring crowdof Lithuanian supporters in a packed city square before meeting NATO leaders. Before his arrival, Zelenskyy hadcriticisedNATO leaders in a Twitter post. “It’s unprecedented and absurd when a timeframe is not set, neither for the invitation nor for Ukraine’s membership,” he wrote. Al Jazeera’s Jonah Hull said that while NATO’s support for Ukraine is “unflinching and unquestioned”, the outcome of the first day of the summit was not what Kyiv had hoped for. “They get this commitment towards a future invitation to join with conditions to be fulfilled that aren’t entirely clearly spelled out and, importantly, no timeline on all of that,” he said from Vilnius. Hull said Zelenskyy had lobbied the head of the summit for an invitation to be issued immediately, even if it was contingent on the war coming to an end. “He said that while he had faith in NATO, he didn’t necessarily have confidence, believing that any form of uncertainty would be interpreted by Russia as weakness,” Hull added. The NATO stance highlighted the divisions among its 31 members over giving a date or a straightforward invitation for Ukraine to join. Kyiv has been pushing for a swift entry, bound together with security guarantees, since even before Russia unleashed its full-scale invasion in February 2022. NATO members in Eastern Europe have backed Kyiv’s call, arguing that bringing Ukraine under NATO’s security umbrella is the best way to deter Russia from attacking again. Countries such as the United States and Germany have been more cautious, wary of any move they fear could draw NATO into a direct conflict with Russia. The NATO declaration said: “We reaffirm our unwavering solidarity with the government and people of Ukraine in the heroic defence of their nation, their land, and our shared values.” In strong language towards Moscow, it said: “The Russian Federation is the most significant and direct threat to Allies’ security and to peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area.” Asked about Zelenskyy’s criticism, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said at a news conference: “There has never been a stronger message from NATO at any time, both when it comes to the political message of the path forward for membership and the concrete support from NATO allies.” He said previous accessions to NATO had not been accompanied by a timeline. “They are conditions-based, have always been,” he said. Mindful of Zelenskyy’s disappointment over his hopes for a membership timetable, Western officials stressed that there would be a broader package of support proposals designed to give Ukraine a military edge over Russian forces. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the G7 group of leading industrialised economies would issue a declaration on long-term support to kick in once “peace is obtained”. This is expected to be announced on Wednesday after the NATO summit ends. In the nearer term, Berlin pledged another $771m (700 million euros) in military assistance for Kyiv. The new aid includes two Patriot missile system launchers, another 40 Marder infantry fighting vehicles and 25 Leopard 1 tanks. President Emmanuel Macron also said France was joining the United Kingdom in supplyinglong-range SCALP, or Storm Shadow, cruise missiles to allow Ukraine to strike Russian targets deep behind the front lines. And Denmark and the Netherlands said an 11-nation coalition will start training Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 fighter jets next month with a new training centre to be set up in Romania. The summit was also buoyed by the prospect of Sweden joining NATO as its newest member after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Monday abruptlydropped his objectionsto the move while pushing to revive talks for Turkey to join the European Union.    A spokesperson for the Russian foreign ministry, Maria Zakharova, told Al Jazeera that NATO members are only united about Ukrainenot joining the alliance. “You can see here that NATO decided not to include Ukraine. What support are we talking about? This means that NATO members have been pulling Ukraine into the Western world at a time where Ukraine calls for help. They abandoned Ukraine, let it down.” “They invite Finland and Sweden, but not Ukraine. Why? This is a question that should be posed on all TV channels – why not?” Moscow, which has cited NATO’s eastern expansion as a factor in its decision to invade Ukraine, hascriticised the summitand warned Europe would be the first to face “catastrophic consequences” should the war escalate. “Potentially, this issue [of Ukraine joining NATO] is very dangerous for European security, … and therefore, those who will make the decision must be aware of this,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. European leaders did not seem to understand that moving NATO military infrastructure towards Russia’s borders was a mistake, he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/11/nato-stops-short-of-ukraine-invitation-angering-zelenskyy
"What are France’s SCALP missiles, and how can they help Ukraine?","France to deliver deep-strike missiles to Ukraine as part of increased efforts to help its counteroffensive against Russia, President Emmanuel Macron says.","France says it will supply Ukraine with long-range cruise missiles to help its counteroffensive against Russia. Speaking on Tuesday on the sidelines of aNATO summitin Lithuania, French President Emmanuel Macron said the delivery of the missiles was aimed at enabling Ukrainian forces “to have the capacity to strike deeply”. Macron did not specify what weapons would be provided but French government officials told reporters the president was referring to SCALP missiles, which can travel 250km (155 miles). The announcement comes months after the United Kingdom began delivering its identical missiles, which it calls Storm Shadow, to Ukraine. SCALP is a 1,300kg (2,870lb) missile armed with conventional explosives, usually launched from aircraft such as the UK air force’s Eurofighter Typhoon or France’s Rafale. Built by European manufacturer MBDA, it is the longest-range Western weapon supplied to Kyiv so far – three times that of Ukraine’s capacities before the UK’s Storm Shadow delivery in May.    The missile is capable of striking targets far into Ukraine’s Russian-occupied east, well behind front lines that have remained relatively fixed for months. MBDA said on its website that the SCALP is “designed to meet the demanding requirements of preplanned attacks against high-value fixed or stationary targets such as hardened bunkers and key infrastructure”. It has been used in a number of conflicts, including in Iraq, Libya and Syria. The missile uses inertial navigation, GPS and terrain referencing to chart a low-altitude course to its target to avoid detection. It also uses an infrared camera to match images of the target to a stored picture “to ensure a precision strike and minimal collateral damage”, MBDA said. The warhead can be programmed to detonate either above the target in what is known as an airburst, on impact or after penetration. Such capabilities are “critical for Ukraine’s forces to disrupt Russian logistics and command and control”, said Ivan Klyszcz, a researcher at the Estonia-based International Centre for Defence and Security. SCALP attacks could help “with Ukraine’s current approach to operations … namely, to advance slowly so as to protect its forces and reduce its own casualties as much as possible”, he added. While some Western allies are concerned that Ukrainian forces might conduct attacks into Russia itself, Macron’s comments implied that Paris had received assurances from Kyiv that the missiles would not be fired into Russia. Speaking in Vilnius, he said the delivery of the missiles “would preserve the clarity and coherence of our doctrine, that is to say, to permit Ukraine to defend its own territory”.    His message from Vilnius matched that of UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, who said in May that Storm Shadow would “allow Ukraine to push back Russian forces based within Ukrainian sovereign territory”. Macron did not say how many of the missiles would be sent but a French diplomatic source told the Reuters news agency they were talking about 50 SCALP missiles. France is understood to have an arsenal of fewer than 400, according to the defence magazine Defense et Securite Internationale. The missiles would come from existing French military stocks, a French military source told the Agence France-Presse news agency, adding that it would be a “significant number”. Separately, a French military source told Reuters the missiles were being integrated into Ukraine’s Russian-made fighter jets. Rather than being an escalatory step, the source argued, the long-range weapons would help even the balance of forces with Russia capable of firing much further. “It rebalances things and enables Ukraine to hit deep into Russian lines and can penetrate tougher targets,” the source said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned that France’s decision to send the missiles “is a mistake” that would have harmful consequences for the Ukrainian side. “Of course, that forces us to take countermeasures,” Peskov said. Russia says Western arms deliveries to Ukraine cannot influence the course of the war, which Moscow refers to as a “special military operation”. They would only aggravate the fate of the “Kyiv regime”, Peskov said. Russia reacted with fury after the UK announced it would supply a batch of Storm Shadow missiles, warning the UK risked being “fully dragged” into the conflict.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/11/what-are-frances-scalp-missiles-and-how-can-they-help-ukraine
Top Russian official says Poland wants to seize parts of Ukraine,Foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova touts theory often raised by Moscow without any evidence.,"A top Russian official has suggested thatNATO might notbe offering Kyiv membership yet because Poland considers western Ukraine part of its territory and intends to invade. In an interview with Al Jazeera on Tuesday, Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said: “There is now an obvious desire of Poland to invade the western part of Ukraine. This is why Ukraine is not invited to NATO.” Since Moscow’s troops invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022, several Russian officials have proposed that Poland wants to seize part of Ukraine, a theory for which there is no evidence. Poland has been one of Ukraine’s strongest supporters during its war with Russia and has not questioned its territorial integrity. Zakharova made her comments as NATO leaders began a two-day summit in Lithuania, a meeting that is being dominated by the prospect of Ukrainian membership. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg has promised the alliance will send a “clear, united and positive message” on Ukraine’s potential membership, but those comments were not strong enough to satisfy Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who said it was “absurd” that a timeline for joining the alliance was not set. While most members back Ukrainian membership in the long term, some countries, such as the United States and Germany, have said Kyiv’s application can only be seriously considered after the war ends because any moves before that would risk a direct confrontation between NATO and Russia.  But Zakharova claimed the alliance and Russia are already at war. “It is truly funny – you truly believe that NATO is already not at war with Russia – because all the fighters, mercenaries, military instructors, advisers and intelligence data are provided by NATO to the Kyiv regime,” she said in Moscow. “NATO is certainly involved in the confrontation with Russia. We’ve been talking about this every day that with regards to Russia, they have launched a hybrid war, meaning military confrontation, sanctions, pressure, political pressure against Russia. “And as for Ukraine, there is no Russia-Ukraine conflict. It does not exist because Ukraine is used by NATO – first and foremost by the US and Great Britain – as an instrument, as leverage to influence Russia.” In comments reminiscent of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who often rails at what he calls the “collective West”, Zakharova said Western countries “believe they have a moral right to ensure their political dominance in the world”. “But Russia’s understanding of security matters and security guarantees is based on the understanding of international law, which includes the UN Charter and the entire package of documents developed by the UN Security Council,” she said. “This is our understanding of how peace should be built and how the world should be built,” she added. Regarding evidence that Russia has violated international law in the current conflict, Zakharova turned the blame on Ukraine, wherethousands of civilianshave died in more than 500 days of war, saying: “I agree with those who say that international law is violated in Ukraine. I truly support this statement, but the question is when the international law was violated. It was violated in 2014 when in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, they carried out an unconstitutional coup d’état.” Ukraine’s then-president, Viktor Yanukovych, fled the country in February that year as mass protests were held against his government after he had pulled out of an agreement for closer political and trade ties with the European Union in favour of a closer relationship with Moscow. Days later, Russia invaded Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula and subsequently annexed it. “It’s not because the Ukrainian people rose above their authorities, but the US, Great Britain, France, Germany, Poland and Baltic states united to oust Ukrainian authorities and to bring to power those who they support,” Zakharova said of what became known as theMaidan Revolution. “It’s at that point when the international law was violated,” she insisted. “We have been talking about it for almost 10 years. Unfortunately, the West didn’t want to talk about it because everyone would learn the truth of what they were doing in Washington,” she added.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/11/top-russian-official-says-poland-wants-to-seize-parts-of-ukraine
"As NATO meets on Ukraine, Russian officials fire warnings at West",Russia has long objected to Ukrainian membership of the Western military alliance. This week’s meeting is stirring old arguments.,"As NATO leaders gather in Lithuania for ameetingthat is being dominated by the Ukraine war, and Kyiv’s desire to join the military alliance, Russia has issued a series of threats. Maria Zakharova, spokesperson of the Russian foreign ministry, told Al Jazeera on Tuesday: “We had an objective to weaken NATO because the United States, Britain and the entire NATO had an objective to weaken Russia. Just look at their statements for years, they wanted to weaken our country.” Sergey Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, warned that Moscow would take “appropriate steps” in the event of “possible NATO enlargement”, adding that his country would protect its “legitimate security interests”. Addressing reporters in the Russian capital on Tuesday, he said, in comments carried by the TASS news agency, that the Kremlin was struck by the speed at which Finland and Sweden abandoned their long-held principle of neutrality to join NATO. Before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, Russia repeatedly warned the Western military alliance against making Ukraine a member, saying it did not want NATO on its doorstep. While there is broad consensus among NATO members to support Ukraine’s future membership, some states such as Germany and the United States stress that Kyiv’s application can only be seriously considered after Russia’s war ends. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a regular news briefing: “Russia is perceived by them [NATO leaders] as an enemy, as an adversary. It is in this vein that the discussions [in Vilnius] will be conducted. “We are monitoring this very carefully, because much of what has been said will be subject to in-depth analysis in order to take measures to ensure our own security.” At the heart of NATO’s two-day summit is the issue of Moscow’s aggression in Ukraine and how to counter it. Hours before it began, Russia attacked Kyiv with Iranian-made Shahed drones and air raid sirens rang out in the capital; Ukraine said it shot all of them down. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said he expects the group to “send a clear, united and positive message on the path towards membership for Ukraine”, but those comments were not strong enough to satisfy Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who claimed it was “absurd” that a timeline for joining the alliance was not set. US President Joe Biden said Washington and its allies were discussing sending more arms and equipment to Ukrainian forces – pledges that saw Russia baulk. By announcing more aid plans, the US has signalled a lack of interest in talks to end the war, Russia’s RIA news agency cited senior diplomat Konstantin Gavrilov as saying. Gavrilov also warned that Europe would be the first to face “catastrophic consequences” if the war escalates. Ukraine, with some of its country under Russian occupation last year, made the defiant move and formally applied for NATO membership last September. “De facto, Ukraine is already in the alliance. Our weapons are the weapons of the alliance. Our values are what the alliance believes in … Vilnius must confirm all this,” Zelenskyy said on the eve of the NATO summit. Meanwhile, Russia’s ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov, warned of “the most unfavourable outcome” amid a standoff between Moscow and NATO countries. “The decisions of the West are posing increasingly insurmountable obstacles to a way out of the acutest political and military crisis, fraught with the most serious consequences for international security,” Antonov said on Monday, as quoted by his embassy on Telegram.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/11/russia-slams-nato-leaders-summit-in-vilnius
Russian submarine commander killed by gunman on morning run,Online news outlets claim that sub commander Stanislav Rzhitsky was involved in missile attack on Ukraine that killed 23 civilians.,"A Russian submarine commander and deputy chief in charge of military mobilisation in Russia’s southern city of Krasnodar has been shot dead, Russia’s state TASS news agency reported, citing law enforcement bodies. According to TASS, the official, Stanislav Rzhitsky, was killed by a gunman on Monday morning and a criminal case into the killing has been opened. The slain official was also the commander of a Russian Black Sea Fleet submarine that local online news outlets in Ukraine claimed wasresponsible for launching Kalibr cruise missiles at Ukrainian targets. Rzhitsky had commanded the Krasnodar submarine, named after the city, in the Russian Navy, TASS reported. It was unclear whether he was the captain of the submarine at the time of his killing. According to the Russian defence ministry, the Krasnodar is a diesel-electric submarine built for the Black Sea Fleet and designed “to fight surface ships and submarines, lay mines and conduct reconnaissance”. Online media covering Russia and Ukraine claimed that Rzhitsky was shot four times during a morning run near a sports complex, and that he had been involved in a submarine-launched missile attack on the Ukrainian city of Vinnytsia in July 2022 that killed 23 civilians,including three children. Stanislav Rzhitsky, who was killed by a killer in Krasnodar, was involved in a missile attack on Vinnitsa.Recall that on July 15, 22, 23 people (including 3 children) were killed as a result of a missile attack on Vinnitsa.pic.twitter.com/8XelDLVZXG — Ukraine Front Lines (@EuromaidanPR)July 10, 2023  Russia attempted to justify the missile attacklast year by claiming its submarine-launched missiles had targeted a meeting of Ukrainian air force commanders and representatives of Western arms suppliers. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the missile attack on the city “an open act of terrorism”, which had killed civilians going about their daily business.    United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said at the time that he was “appalled” by the deaths in Vinnytsia and the European Union said that it was an “atrocity”. Both the UN and EU called for accountability. Among the three children killed was a four-year-old girl with Down’s syndrome Liza Dmitrieva, who was en route to see a speech therapist with her mother when the missile struck. Liza’s mother, Iryna Dmitrieva, was severely injured and left fighting for her life.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/11/russian-submarine-commander-killed-by-gunman-on-morning-run
Australia to deploy surveillance aircraft to assist Ukraine,"The Wedgetail, with as many as 100 crew and support staff, will operate from Germany for at least six months.","Australia will send a Royal Australian Air Force surveillance aircraft to Germany to help support Ukraine by protecting vital humanitarian and military supply lines. The E-7A Wedgetail, one of Australia’s most sophisticated early warning and airborne control platforms, will be based in Germany for six months along with as many as 100 crew and support personnel, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told a news conference in Berlin on Monday. “This is an important contribution,” he said, standing alongside German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. “Australia, of course, is a long way from Europe. But one of the things that this war has done is remind us that in today’s interconnected globalised world, an event such as the land war in Europe has animpact on the entire world. We’ve been impacted by our economy, [and] we’ve been shocked by the brutal invasion and the disregard for the international rules-based order, which we had come to think was something that we hoped would be a permanent presence. So it is important that the democratic world react to defend the rules-based order.” Scholz gave his backing to the move. “It is truly very important to know how much Australia supports Ukraine,” he said, noting the backing for Kyiv from countries beyond Europe. “Ukraine needs this support.” Kyiv began a renewedcounteroffensivea month ago to take back lands occupied by Russia since it began itsfull-scale invasionof the country in February 2022. Western countries have promised to stand by Kyiv, providing it with the weapons, military equipment and ammunition it needs. “The deployment of the E-7A Wedgetail as an additional early warning capability will help ensure that vital support flowing to Ukraine by the international community is protected,” Australia’s Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles said in a statement. “Australia is committed to ensuring Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity prevails against Russia’s assault on the rules-based order.” The Wedgetail will operate only in European airspace avoiding Ukrainian, Russian or Belarusian skies, the statement said. Based on a Boeing 737-700 aircraft, the Wedgetail is modified to combine long-range surveillance radar, secondary radar and tactical voice and data communications systems to provide airborne early warning and control, according to Australia’s air force. It is capable of unlimited long-range deployment with in-flight refuelling. Albanese was in Berlin in advance of theNATO summit, which starts in Vilnius on Tuesday. Australia has been invited to the meeting as an Indo-Pacific Quad partner, along with Japan, New Zealand and South Korea. While in Berlin, Albanese also attended the signing of an in-principle agreement to deliver more than 100 Australian-made Boxer armed carriers to Germany in one of Canberra’s largest-ever defence export deals.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/11/australia-to-deploy-surveillance-aircraft-to-assist-ukraine
Russian attack on Ukrainian aid distribution point kills seven,Zaporizhia Governor Yuriy Malashko says Russian attack on school where humanitarian aid distributed a ‘war crime’.,"A Russian attack on a humanitarian aid distribution point in southeastern Ukraine has killed seven people, Ukrainian officials said, while two people were also killed byRussian shelling in the east of the country. Yuriy Malashko, governor of Ukraine’s Zaporizhia region, said a guided aviation bomb was used in Sunday’s attack on a school building being used to distribute humanitarian aid in the small town of Orikhiv. Malashko calledthe attack a “war crime”. “They hit a humanitarian aid delivery spot in a residential area,” Malashko said on social media. “Four people died on the spot: women aged 43, 45 and 47 and a 47-year-old man.” The death toll has since increased, officials said. “Rescuers removed the bodies of three people with no signs of life from under the rubble. The number of dead has risen to seven,” Ukraine’s emergency services wrote on Telegram later on Monday. Rescue and recovery operations were now complete. Malashko said 11 people wounded in the attack were being treated in hospital. Ukraine’s general prosecutor’s office said the incident was being investigated as a war crime. The prosecutor’s office also said that two people had been killed and three wounded on Monday in Russian shelling of the village of Hostre and the city of Avdiivka in the Donetsk region. Orikhiv, with a pre-war population of about 14,000 people, is in the front-line southeastern region of Zaporizhia where Ukrainian soldiers last month werepushing to recapture heavily fortified positions from Russian forces.

NATO ‘must confirm’ Ukraine is ‘de facto’ a member: Zelenskyy,"While questions about the type of weapons and how many to provide Kyiv continue to be debated by NATO members, Ukraine’s leader seems assured that more are on the way.","Most NATO members stand together with Ukraine and the alliance’s upcoming Lithuania summit must confirm Kyiv is a de facto member, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says. He also indicated on Monday that further pledges of arms supplies for Ukraine in its war with Russia will be forthcoming at the Vilnius gathering. “The majority of the alliance stands firmly with us,” Zelenskyy said in his nightly video message. “When we applied for membership of NATO, we spoke frankly: de facto, Ukraine is already in the alliance. Our weapons are the weapons of the alliance. Our values are what the alliance believes in … Vilnius must confirm all this.” While questions about the type of weapons and how many to provide Kyiv continue to be debated by NATO members, Ukraine’s leader seems assured that more are on the way. “I am sure that there could well be positive news regarding weapons for our men from Vilnius,” Zelenskyy said. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has said Kyiv will not become a member while war rages and the summit will not issue a formal invitation. Still, allies are divided over how swiftly Ukraine should be allowed to join after the fighting ends. While eastern European countries say a road map should be offered to Kyiv, the United States and Germany are wary of any move that might take the alliance closer to war with Russia. Finland’s Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen told Al Jazeera the alliance was “committed to Ukraine’s membership in NATO in the future”, and to discussing a “future architecture to be put in place once the aggressor leaves the country and ends the war”. But at present, Valtonen said efforts would focus on further aid and support for Ukraine. The US last week announced it decided to sendcluster munitionsto Ukraine to help its military push back invading Russian forces entrenched along the front lines. More than 120 countries have signed the 2008 United Nations Convention on Cluster Munitions to ban their use – including some of Ukraine and the US’s key allies such as France and the United Kingdom. NATO will also raise targets for the stockpiling of ammunition as Kyiv is burning through shells much faster than Western countries can produce them. At the same time, allies will show how they aim to implement NATO’s goal, agreed at last year’s Madrid summit, of putting more than 300,000 troops on high alert to counter Russia, up from 40,000 in the past.

‘Historic day’: Turkey’s Erdogan agrees to back Sweden’s NATO bid,NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg announces that President Erdogan agrees to forward Sweden’s bid to Turkey’s parliament.,"Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has agreed to back Sweden’s bid to join NATO after a year of blocking the move, citing Turkish security concerns. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg announced on Monday that Erdogan agreed to forward Sweden’s membership bid to Turkey’s parliament. After talks in Vilnius, Lithuania, with Erdogan and Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson, Stoltenberg said Turkey had agreed to move forward. “I’m glad to announce … President Erdogan has agreed to forward the accession protocol for Sweden to the Grand National Assembly as soon as possible and work closely with the assembly to ensure ratification,” Stoltenberg said at a news conference. “This is a historic day.” NATO membership requires the approval of all of the military alliance’s members. Turkey has held up Sweden’s NATO accession since last year, accusing Stockholm of harbouring Kurdish activists Ankara regards as “terrorists”. A series of demonstrations in Stockholm, including stunts by anti-Islam activists whoburned the Quran, also angered Turkish officials. A joint statement issued after three-way talks stated Turkey and Sweden would work closely on “counterterrorism coordination” and boost trade ties. Earlier on Monday, Erdogan had upped the stakes further by demanding that the European Union revive Turkey’s stalled membership bid as a condition for Sweden to join NATO. The surprise announcement by Erdogan before departing for a NATO summit in Lithuania’s capital added new uncertainty to Sweden’s bid to become the alliance’s 32nd member. It was the first time that Erdogan linked his country’s ambition to join the EU with Sweden’s efforts to become a NATO member. “Turkey has been waiting at the door of the European Union for over 50 years now, and almost all of the NATO member countries are now members of the European Union,” Erdogan told reporters in Istanbul. “I am making this call to these countries that have kept Turkey waiting at the gates of the European Union for more than 50 years. Come and open the way for Turkey’s membership in the European Union. When you pave the way for Turkey, we’ll pave the way for Sweden as we did for Finland.” US President Joe Biden praised “the commitment” by Erdogan on Sweden’s NATO bid. “I stand ready to work with President Erdogan and Türkiye on enhancing defense and deterrence in the Euro-Atlantic area. I look forward to welcoming Prime Minister Kristersson and Sweden as our 32nd NATO Ally.  And I thank Secretary General Stoltenberg for his steadfast leadership,” a White House statement said. Finland’s Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen told Al Jazeera her country, which became a member in April, had been lobbying for its neighbour’s bid to also be ratified. “Our membership is not complete without Sweden,” Valtonen said. Finlandappliedin May 2022 alongside neighbouring Sweden as fears of Russian aggression rose in northern Europe following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

"NATO membership of Ukraine, Sweden in focus at Vilnius summit","NATO leaders will meet in Lithuania this week to discuss Russia’s aggression, as well as overcome differences over the perspective membership of Ukraine and Sweden.","Brussels, Belgium –The 31 leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) are set to convene for a two-day summit in Lithuania’s capital Vilnius this week. The military alliance members will seek to reaffirm their support for war-torn Ukraine on Tuesday and Wednesday, overcome differences over Sweden’s perspective NATO membership, and display a united stance against Russia’s aggression. “This week, at the NATO summit, we will strengthen our deterrence and defence, including with more investment. We will step up our support for Ukraine, and move Ukraine closer to NATO,” the military alliance’s Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters in Vilnius. “Lithuania seeks this summit to be remembered as the summit of decisions – not just declarations,” Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda said in a tweet on the eve of the summit. For Ukraine, a key decision after the Vilnius summit is to gain confirmation on its NATO membership. Kyivappliedto become a member of the alliance last September, seeking to fortify its borders with Russia. Since then, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, his officials – and Ukrainians within the country and around the world – have been lobbying NATO nations to speed up Kyiv’s accession process. But NATO members remain divided over the issue of offering Kyiv the alliance membership amid an ongoing war despite a broad consensus to signal strong support for Ukraine. Nations like the United States and Germany have displayed a restrictive stance towards the idea, compared to NATO’s Baltic members like Lithuania and Poland. In aninterview with broadcaster CNNover the weekend, US President Joe Biden said that Ukraine was still in the middle of a war with Russia, and if Kyiv became a NATO member, then it would drag the entire alliance into the battlefield – a sentiment shared by Germany, Turkey and some other NATO members. “For example, if you did that, then, you know – and I mean what I say – we’re determined to commit every inch of territory that is NATO territory. It’s a commitment that we’ve all made no matter what. If the war is going on, then we’re all in war. We’re at war with Russia, if that were the case,” Biden said. The US leader was referencing NATO’s cornerstone for collective defence – Article 5, which states that an armed attack against one NATO member is an armed attack against all. But a day before the onset of the summit, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in a tweet that “following intensive talks, NATO allies have reached consensus on removing MAP (Membership Action Plan) from Ukraine’s path to membership”. He welcomed this decision and said that it offers Ukraine clarity on becoming a NATO member. Following intensive talks, NATO allies have reached consensus on removing MAP from Ukraine's path to membership. I welcome this long-awaited decision that shortens our path to NATO. It is also the best moment to offer clarity on the invitation to Ukraine to become member. — Dmytro Kuleba (@DmytroKuleba)July 10, 2023  Moreover, on Friday, when Stoltenberg was asked whether NATO’s declaration regarding Kyiv’s Ukraine membership will be stronger than the alliance’s 2008 Bucharest Summit Declaration, when Ukraine and Georgia were promised a similar future in NATO, Stoltenberg said that there are differences this year. “One important difference is that Ukraine has come much closer to NATO, because NATO allies have worked closely with Ukraine for many years, especially since 2014. So, this has ensured a much higher level of cooperation and interoperability between Ukraine and NATO,” he said. Meanwhile, the Kremlin has said that Ukraine becoming a member of NATO would demand “a harsh response” from Russia.    But NATO chief Stoltenberg told reporters in Brussels on Friday that at the Vilnius summit, he expects the alliance to agree to a multiyear programme of assistance to Ukraine, in the face of threats from Russia. “We have already pledged 500 million euros [$548m] for critical needs, including fuel, medical supplies, de-mining equipment and pontoon bridges. We will also help build Ukraine’s security and defence sector, including with military hospitals. And we will help Ukraine transition from Soviet-era to NATO equipment and standards,” he said. He added that NATO will also upgrade its political ties with Kyiv by setting up a NATO-Ukraine Council, which Zelenskyy will inaugurate as a part of this week’s summit. According to Stoltenberg, the Council would act like a consultation mechanism between NATO members and Ukraine, whereby if Kyiv feels threatened, specific issues could be instantly discussed and decided by the Council, bringing Ukraine closer to the alliance. “The NATO-Ukraine Council is a step in the right direction for Kyiv because it will send quite a strong message not only to Ukrainians but also to the Russian President Vladimir Putin,” Harry Nedelcu, geopolitics director at Rasmussen Global and leader of its Ukraine Advisory Service, told Al Jazeera. “But at this summit, the serious debate with respect to Ukraine is going to be on providing Kyiv with more security guarantees in the interim period, until the country joins NATO. These guarantees would include enhancing Ukraine’s military capabilities, and also helping the country develop its own military industry to sustain itself,” Nedelcu added. So far, the US, Germany, the United Kingdom and other countries have said they would pledge to embolden Ukraine militarily in the face of Russian aggression. While strengthening and supporting Ukraine remains a key priority at the Vilnius summit, another pressing matter is Sweden’s future in NATO. Sweden and Finland applied to become NATO memberslast May. While Finland has joined, Turkey and Hungary have been holding up Sweden’s membership. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused Sweden of providing safe haven to members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and the Democratic Union Party (PYD) in Syria, both of which Ankara considers “terrorist” organisations. Erdogan also asked Sweden to lift an arms embargo on Turkey imposed in 2019 after Ankara’s incursion into northern Syria. He said these were important “security concerns” for Turkey that had to be resolved before he agreed to NATO’s enlargement.    While Sweden has passed an “anti-terrorism” law and lifted the arms embargo, the recent incident of theburning of the Quranin the country has once again angered Turkey, and Erdogan has repeatedly expressed that Stockholm has not done enough to quash Kurdish groups. Erdogan and Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson will meet in the presence of Stoltenberg before the Vilnius summit begins to resolve their differences. “A good scenario would be if in Vilnius, Erdogan says, ‘I am satisfied with the actions of the Swedish parliament and I am ready to put this in front of my Parliament’,” a senior NATO official told journalists in a press briefing before the summit. “There are more than 50 percent of chances that this happens, but let’s see,” he added. According to Bruno Lete, security and defence expert at the German Marshall Fund of the United States (GMF) in Brussels, from a technical perspective there is nothing that prevents Sweden from becoming a NATO member. “Sweden has one of the most performant armed forces in Europe. So, this is really a political problem,” he told Al Jazeera. “Turkey is using its veto on Swedish membership to pursue its self-interest. Turkey is interested in regaining access to the US F-16 jet fighter programme. The country was removed from the programme years ago after it decided to buy Russian S-400 systems despite warnings from Washington not to do so,” he said. “At this point, negotiations between Turkey and Sweden are still in a deadlock. But the real kingmaker here is the United States, which has decision-making power on pulling Turkey back into the jet fighter programme. The problem is that Washington is not so keen to do so,” Lette said, adding that once Turkey ratifies Sweden’s membership, Hungary will follow suit. In his interview with CNN, Biden acknowledged Turkey’s ambitions and said that Turkey is seeking to modernise its F-16 fleet, along with Greece. “And so, what I’m trying to, quite frankly, put together is a little bit of a consortium here, where we’re strengthening NATO in terms of military capacity of both Greece as well as Turkey, and allow Sweden to come in. But it’s in play. It’s not done,” Biden said. Prior to his departure to the Vilnius summit, Erdogan denied links between Sweden’s NATO membership and Ankara’s F-16 goal. But he said if Turkey became a member of the European Union, it would speed up Sweden’s NATO membership. In a press conference in Vilnius before the summit, Stoltenberg said he supported Turkey’s EU membership and highlighted that it is still possible that Sweden could join NATO at the summit.  Another key priority for the transatlantic military alliance is countering threats from China, an integral issue for leaders from Japan, Australia, New Zealand and South Korea who are also attending the summit. At the NATO summit last year in Spain’s capital Madrid, the alliance identified China as a “systemic challenge to Euro-Atlantic security” and has acknowledged Beijing’s “no-limits” partnership with Russia. But according to GMF’s Lete, while the leaders from Asia, Australia and New Zealand want NATO to weigh in further on China, the alliance’s goal to partner with these nations is merely for information exchange and situational awareness and is not a military partnership. “A recent proposal to increase the NATO presence in Asia by opening a representation office in Tokyo was actually blocked by France. The alliance focuses on addressing the Chinese strategic threat here locally in Europe, not by expanding its presence in Asia,” he said. “I believe NATO is well equipped to deal with external threats and the rapidly changing world order,” Lete said. “Its core mission to defend Europe and bind both sides of the Atlantic is more relevant than ever. But in my opinion, the biggest challenge NATO will need to deal with in the future emerges from the inside.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/10/nato-membership-of-ukraine-sweden-in-focus-at-vilnius-summit
"New data suggests 50,000 Russian deaths during Ukraine war",Independent Russian media shed light on one of Moscow’s closest-held secrets.,"Nearly 50,000 Russian men have died in the war in Ukraine, according to the first independent statistical analysis of Russia’s war dead. Two independent Russian media outlets, Mediazona and Meduza, working with a data scientist from Germany’s Tübingen University, used Russian government data to shed light on one of Moscow’s closest-held secrets — the true human cost of its invasion of Ukraine. To do so, they relied on a statistical concept popularised during the COVID-19 pandemic called excess mortality. Drawing on inheritance records and official mortality data, they estimated how many more men below the age of 50 died between February 2022 and May 2023 than normal. Neither Moscow nor Kyiv gives timely data on military losses, and each is at pains to amplify the other side’s casualties. Russia has publicly acknowledged the deaths of just about 6,000 soldiers. Reports about military losses have been repressed in Russian media, activists and independent journalists say. Documenting the dead has become an act of defiance, and those who do so face harassment and potential criminal charges. Despite such challenges, Mediazona and BBC News Russian, working with a network of volunteers, have used social media postings and photographs of cemeteries across Russia to build a database of confirmed war deaths. As of July 7, they had identified 27,423 dead Russian soldiers. “These are only soldiers who we know by name, and their deaths in each case are verified by multiple sources,” said Dmitry Treshchanin, an editor at Mediazona who helped oversee the investigation. “The estimate we did with Meduza allows us to see the ‘hidden’ deaths, deaths the Russian government is so obsessively and unsuccessfully trying to hide.” To come up with a more comprehensive tally, journalists from Mediazona and Meduza obtained records of inheritance cases filed with the Russian authorities. Their data from the National Probate Registry contained information about more than 11 million people who died between 2014 and May 2023. According to their analysis, 25,000 more inheritance cases were opened in 2022 for males aged 15 to 49 than expected. By May 27, 2023, the number of excess cases had shot up to 47,000.    That surge is roughly in line with a May assessment by the White House that more than 20,000 Russians had been killed in Ukraine since December, though lower than the US and UK intelligence assessments of overall Russian deaths. In February, the UK Ministry of Defence said approximately 40,000 to 60,000 Russians had likely been killed in the war. A leaked assessment from the US Defense Intelligence Agency put the number of Russians killed in action in the first year of the war at 35,000 to 43,000. “Their figures might be accurate, or they might not be,” Treshchanin, the Mediazona editor, said in an email. “Even if they have sources in the Russian Ministry of Defence, its own data could be incomplete. It’s extremely difficult to pull together all of the casualties from the army, Rosgvardia, Akhmat battalion, various private military companies, of which Wagner is the largest, but not the only one. Casualties among inmates, first recruited by Wagner and now by the MoD, are also a very hazy subject, with a lot of potential for manipulation. Statistics could actually give better results.” Many Russian deaths – as well as amputations – could have been prevented with better front-line first aid, the UK Ministry of Defence said in an intelligence assessment published on Monday. Russia has suffered an average of about 400 casualties a day for 17 months, creating a “crisis” in combat medical care that is likely undermining medical services for civilians in border regions near Ukraine, the ministry said. Independently, Dmitry Kobak, a data scientist from Tübingen University who has published work on excess COVID-19 deaths in Russia, obtained mortality data broken down by age and sex for 2022 from Rosstat, Russia’s official statistics agency. He found that 24,000 more men below the age of 50 died in 2022 than expected, a figure that aligns with the analysis of inheritance data. The COVID-19 pandemic made it harder to figure out how many men would have died in Russia since February 2022 if there had not been a war. Both analyses corrected for the lingering effects of COVID on mortality by indexing male death rates against female deaths. Sergei Scherbov, a scholar at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria, cautioned that “differences in the number of deaths between males and females can vary significantly due to randomness alone”. “I am not saying that there couldn’t be an excess number of male deaths, but rather that statistically speaking, this difference in deaths could be a mere outcome of chance,” he said. Russians who are missing but not officially recognised as dead, as well as citizens of Ukraine fighting in units of the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk republics, are not included in these counts. Kobak acknowledged that some uncertainties remain, especially regarding the deaths of older men. Moreover, it is hard to know how many missing Russian soldiers are actually dead. But he said neither factor is likely to have a huge effect. “That uncertainty is in the thousands,” he said. “The results are plausible overall.” The Russian defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Meduza is an independent Russian media outlet that has been operating in exile for eight years, with headquarters in Riga, Latvia. In April 2021, Russian authorities designated Meduza a “foreign agent”, making it harder to generate advertising income, and in January 2023, the Kremlin banned it as an illegal “undesirable organisation”. Moscow has also labelled independent outlet Mediazona as a “foreign agent” and blocked its website after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/10/new-data-uncovers-50000-russian-deaths-during-the-ukraine-war
"Russia confirms Wagner-Putin meeting, releases Gerasimov video","Russia appears to be trying to take control of the confusing narrative around the Wagner Group, after last month’s shocking mutiny.","Russian President Vladimir Putin held talks withWagnerleaderYevgeny Prigozhinfor three hours, days after a short-lived rebellion led by the mercenary chief and his private army, the Kremlin has confirmed. Monday’s announcement came shortly after Russia’s defence ministry published a video featuring the country’s military chief,Valery Gerasimov, marking the first time he has been seen publicly since Wagner’s rebellion aimed to oust him. Both updates appeared to be an attempt by Moscow to take control of the narrative surrounding the Wagner Group after a turbulent period. During last month’s unexpected yet brief revolt in Russia, the Wagner chief denouncedGerasimovandDefence Minister Sergey Shoigu,accusing them of failing to provide his fighters in Ukraine with ammunition. The Putin-Prigozhin meeting took place at the Kremlin on June 29 and involved commanders from the military company, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. The confirmation of a face-to-face meeting with Putin, who has branded Prigozhina backstabbing traitor, adds a new twist to the uncertainty surrounding the mercenary chief. His fate and whereabouts have been unknown since the abortive mutiny, which many observers say has severely weakened Putin’s authority. According to Peskov, Putin offered an “assessment” of Wagner’s actions on the battlefield in Ukraine and “of the events of June 24” – the armed rebellion which was halted just before hoards of mercenaries planned to march on Moscow. The president also “listened to the explanations of the commanders and offered them options for further employment and further use in combat” during the meeting. “The commanders themselves presented their version of what happened,” Peskov said. “They underscored that they are staunch supporters and soldiers of the head of state and the commander-in-chief, and also said that they are ready to continue to fight for their homeland.” Thirty-five people took part in the talks, including Wagner commanders and the leadership of the company, namely Prigozhin himself. Tensions had come to a head on June 24, after Prigozhin raged for months at Russia’s top brass in foul-mouthed diatribes, accusing them of incompetence in their war efforts in Ukraine. Prigozhin had cast his Wagner fighters as leading on the battlefields and, throughout the Ukraine war, has been first to announce gains against Kyiv’s troops, ahead of the Russian army. Last month’s mutiny threw the top mercenary’s long-standing relations with Putin into question and, so it seemed, he was exiled to Belarus, under a deal brokered by President Alexander Lukashenko. Minsk added to the uncertainty surrounding the pact last week, saying Prigozhin was no longer in Belarus, and had returned to Russia. Observers see the rebellion as the biggest challenge to Putin’s authority since he came to power. Wagner commanders “stressed that they are staunch supporters … of the head of state”, Peskov said. “They also said that they were ready to continue fighting for the motherland.”   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/10/putin-met-with-wagner-leader-gerasimov-makes-an-appearance
Timeline: Use of controversial cluster bombs in past conflicts,The widely condemned use of cluster bombs can be traced back to World War II.,"Several countries have announced they will not send Ukrainecluster munitionsfollowing the United States’ decision to send the controversial weapons to the front line. On Friday, Washington confirmed it would supply Kyiv with the widely condemned bombs as part of a new $800m security package. US President Joe Biden defended his decision as difficult but necessary, saying Ukraine needed them and has assured Washington that the bombs would not be used to target territory in Russia. More than 100 countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany and Canada, have signed an accord under the Convention on Cluster Munitions to ban the production, stockpiling, use and transfer of cluster bombs. Paul Hannon, of the Cluster Munitions Coalition (CMC), said the US move will “contribute to the terrible casualties being suffered by Ukrainian civilians both immediately and for years to come”. Cluster munitions typically release large numbers of smaller bomblets that can kill indiscriminately over a wide area but have a high failure rate leaving those that fail to explode to pose a danger for decades after a conflict ends. Here is a timeline of the use of the weapons throughout history: 1943, Battle of Kursk (World War II): Soviet forces dropped cluster munitions on German forces in Kursk, western Russia. 1943 in the UK (World War II): Germany released 1,000 butterfly bombs on Grimsby, a port city in northeast England. 1960s and 70s, Vietnam War: US forces targeted Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam with cluster munitions during the Cold War. According to amonitor,  the US dropped 413,130 tonnes of cluster munitions over Vietnam between 1965 and 1973. Citing authorities, the Red Crossreportedthat Laos is contaminated by about 80 million cluster submunitions, affecting all 17 provinces and resulting in 300 yearly casualties. 1975-88 in Western Sahara: Moroccan forces used cluster munitions against non-state armed groups. 1978, Lebanon: During Israel’s invasion, Tel Aviv used cluster munitions in southernLebanon. 1979-89, Afghanistan: Soviet forces used cluster munitions in Afghanistan from 1979 to 1989. 1982, Falklands War: British forces released cluster bombs on Argentinean infantry positions during the 10-week undeclared war, in which hundreds died. 1991, Gulf War: According to Human Rights Watch, the 61,000 aerial-delivered cluster munitions released by the US and its allies accounted for “about one-quarter of the bombs dropped on Iraq and Kuwait”. 1992-95, Bosnian War: Yugoslav forces used available cluster munitions during the war for independence. According to the CMC, in 1992, 195 people in Bosnia and Herzegovina were victims of cluster bombs. During the war, the highest number of causalities reached 175, with 31 deaths. 1994-96, First Chechen War: Russian forces used cluster munitions against Chechen independence groups. 1995, Croatia: On May 2-3, Serbian forces attacked Zagreb using cluster bombs. 1996-99 in Sudan: Sudanese government forces air-dropped cluster munitions in southern Sudan. 1998, Ethiopian-Eritrean War: Ethiopia and Eritrea exchanged bomb strikes, with Ethiopia attacking the Asmara airport and Eritrea targeting the Mekelle airport. 1998-99, Albania: Yugoslav forces launch cross-border rocket attacks on Albania. 1999 in Yugoslavia (Kosovo War): NATO allies dropped 1,765 cluster bombs containing 295,000 bomblets. 2001-02, Afghanistan War: The US dropped 1,228 cluster bombs containing 248,056 bomblets in Afghanistan between October 2001 and March 2002, according to HRW. 2003-06, Iraq War: Nearly 13,000 cluster munitions were used by the UK and the US during three weeks of combat, according to the CMC. 2008, Georgian war: Russia used air- and ground-launched cluster bombs during a conflict in South Ossetia. Georgia also used cluster munitions. Together, their cluster munitions killed at least 16 civilians and injured another 54. 2011 in Libya: Then-President Muammar Gaddafi’s forces used cluster munitions in a village in Misrata, Libya. Ongoing since 2012 in Syria: The use of cluster munitions in the Syrian conflict started in 2012, since the Arab Spring revolutionary protests. 2014-15, Crimea: Russia and Ukraine used cluster munitions during Moscow’s invasion to annex Crimea,accordingto Human Rights Watch (HRW). 2015-18 in Yemen: Saudi Arabia used UK-made cluster bombs againstHouthirebels in Yemen 2022, Ukraine War: According to HRW, Russia and Ukraine have extensively used cluster bombs during the conflict.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/10/timeline-use-of-controversial-cluster-bombs-in-past-conflicts
Poland detains Ukrainian citizen over spying for Russia,"The detention brings the total number of people rounded up in an espionage probe to 15, the interior minister says.","Poland has detained a member of a Russian spy network, bringing thetotal numberof people rounded up in an investigation to 15, according to Interior Minister Mariusz Kaminski. A hub for Western military supplies to Ukraine, Poland says it has become a key target of Russian spies and it accuses Moscow of trying to destabilise it. “The Internal Security Agency has detained another member of the spy network working for Russian intelligence,” Mariusz Kaminski said on Monday in a post on Twitter. “The suspect kept surveillance of military facilities and seaports. He was systematically paid by the Russians.” The Russian embassy in Warsaw did not immediately react to the development. Prosecutors said in a statement that the individual arrested was a Ukrainian citizen who had been in Poland since 2019 and that he could face up to 10 years in prison if found guilty. He will be kept in pre-trial detention, prosecutors said. In June, Poland detained a Russian professionalice-hockey playeron spying charges. Russia said at the time it had demanded an explanation from Poland over its arrest of Russian citizens. In March, Poland said it had broken up a Russian espionage network and detained nine people it said were preparing acts of sabotage and monitoring rail routes to Ukraine. The following month Poland said it was introducing a 200-metre (218-yard) exclusion zone around its Swinoujscie Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) terminal, citing concerns over Russian espionage. Prosecutors said on Monday that further arrests as part of the investigation could not be ruled out.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/10/poland-detains-ukrainian-citizen-over-spying-for-russia

Ukraine’s Zelenskyy brings home Azovstal commanders from Turkey,"Russia denounces the soldiers’ return, accusing Kyiv and Ankara of violating a prisoner exchange deal under which the men were to remain in Turkey until the end of the war.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has returned home, from a visit to Turkey, with five commanders of Ukraine’s former garrison in Mariupol, a move Russia said violated the terms of a prisoner exchange deal engineered last year. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Saturday that Ankara had promised under the exchange agreement to keep the men in Turkey and complained that Moscow had not been informed of the move. The five commanders, lionised as heroes in Ukraine, led last year’s defence of thesouthern port of Mariupol, the biggest city Russia has captured in its invasion. Thousands of civilians were killed inside Mariupol when Russian forces laid the city to waste during a three-month siege. Zelenskyy on Saturday posted a one-minute video showing himself and other officials shaking hands andhugging the smiling commandersbefore they boarded a Czech aeroplane together. “We are returning home from Turkey and bringing our heroes home,” said Zelenskyy, who met Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for talks in Istanbul on Friday. “Ukrainian soldiers Denys Prokopenko, Svyatoslav Palamar, Serhiy Volynsky, Oleh Khomenko, Denys Shleha. They will finally be with their relatives,” he said on the Telegram messaging app. Kyiv had finally ordered the Ukrainian defenders, whoheld out for weeks in tunnels and bunkersunder a steel plant, to surrender in May last year. Russia freed some of them in September last year in a prisoner swap brokered by Ankara under terms that required the commanders to remain in Turkey until the end of the war. Zelenskyy gave no explanation for why the commanders were being allowed to return home now and there was no immediate comment from Turkey. Many Ukrainians hailed the news on social media. “Finally! The best news ever. Congratulations to our brothers!” Major Maksym Zhorin, who is fighting now in eastern Ukraine, said on Telegram.    The Kremlin, however, accused Ukraine and Turkey of violating agreements by releasing the commanders. “The return of the leaders of the Azovites from Turkey to Ukraine is nothing more than a direct violation of the terms of the existing agreements. Moreover, in this case, the terms were violated by both the Ukrainian side and the Turkish side,” said Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman. “No one informed us about this. According to the agreements, these ringleaders were to remain on the territory of Turkey until the end of the conflict,” he said. Peskov added that the release was a result of heavy pressure from Turkey’s NATO allies ahead of next week’s summit of the military alliance at which Ukraine hopes to receive a positive sign about its future membership. In a ceremony alongside the men in the western city of Lviv, Zelenskyy thanked Erdogan for helping secure the soldiers’ release and pledged to bring home all remaining prisoners. He said that before the outbreak of war, “many people in the world still did not understand what we are, what you are, what to expect from us and what our heroes are. Now everyone understands”. Denys Prokopenko, one of the five commanders, told the gathering that his men “will have our word to say” in the counter-offensive launched by Ukrainian forces in the past month. “The most important thing is that Ukraine has seized the strategic initiative and is advancing,” he said. Analysts said the return of the soldiers could strain Turkey’s relations with Russia. Ankara has so far managed to maintain a delicate balancing act, even helping broker a deal with Russia last year that allowed the safe export of grain and fertiliser from Ukrainian ports. “Turkey’s a member of NATO, which has been backing Zelenskyy and Ukraine in the war. But at the same time, Erdogan has maintained good relations personally with President [Vladimir] Putin of Russia,” Bulent Ali Riza, the founding director of the Turkey Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), told Al Jazeera. “Erdogan has not applied sanctions, unlike the other members of the Western alliance and he’s been able to do this successfully. Until now, he’s been able to broker the grain deal because he has connections with both sides. And yet, with these most recent moves that he has made – hosting Zelenskyy and then releasing the Azov fighters – is obviously going to be interpreted by Russia as heavily tilted to the other side,” Bulent said,    The repatriation of the commanders came as Ukraine marked the 500th day of Russia’s full-scale invasion. In honour of the day, Zelenskyy released a video of him visiting Snake Island, a Black Sea outcrop that Russian forces seized on the first day of the invasion last year and later abandoned. Speaking from the island, Zelenskyy honoured the Ukrainian soldiers who fought for the territory and all other defenders of the country, saying that reclaiming control of the island is “great proof that Ukraine will regain every bit of its territory”. “I want to thank – from here, from this place of victory – each of our soldiers for these 500 days,” the Ukrainian leader said. “Thank you to everyone who fights for Ukraine!” United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken marked the 500 days by describing Russia as “the sole obstacle to a just and lasting peace” and promising to back Kyiv “for as long as it takes”. France’s foreign ministry said the time frame “must bring Russia to the realisation that it is in an impasse and immediately stop its illegal war of aggression”. The latest US pledge of support included plans to supply widely-banned cluster munitions. Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov promised the munitions would not be used in Russia. The General Staff of Ukraine’s Armed Forces said Ukrainian troops on Saturday “continued offensive operations” in two sectors in the southeast. Officials said that a Russian rocket strike on the town of Lyman killed eight civilians and wounded 13 others early on Saturday. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, posted images showing some of the dead, including a body lying under a bicycle and body fragments on the pavement next to a damaged vehicle, saying that “the Russian terrorists are continuing to strike civilians in Donetsk”. Lyman is a few kilometres from the front line, where Russian troops have recently intensified fighting in the forests of Kreminna. The United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defence, meanwhile, said in its latest intelligence update that the eastern town of Bakhmut captured by the Russians in May has seen some of the most intense fighting along the front during the last week. It said that Ukrainian forces have made steady gains in both the north and south of Bakhmut. “Russian defenders are highly likely struggling with poor morale, a mix of disparate units and a limited ability to find and strike Ukrainian artillery,” the ministry added.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/8/ukraines-zelenskyy-returns-azov-commanders-released-to-turkey
"Ukraine war reaches 500 days, UN laments 9,000 civilians killed","UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine marks 500 days of war, deplores ‘horrendous’ civilian death toll.","More than 9,000 civilians, including 500 children, have been killed since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022, the United Nations has said,condemning the cost to civilians as the war in Ukraine reached the 500-day mark. The UN’s Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) said in a statement on Friday that it “deplored the horrendous civilian cost of the war in Ukraine” and was able to confirm that9,000 civilians had been killed so far in the conflict. The mission warned that the actual toll is likely to be far higher than the number of officially confirmed deaths. “Today we mark another grim milestone in the war that continues to exact a horrific toll on Ukraine’s civilians,” Noel Calhoun, the deputy head of HRMMU, said in the statement to mark the 500th day since the start of the invasion. While this year the casualty numbers in Ukraine have been lower on average than in 2022, the figure began to climb again in May and June, the monitors noted. On June 27, 13 civilians, including four children, were killed in a missile attack on Kramatorsk in eastern Ukraine. UN deplored horrendous civilian cost of war in Ukraine, as country marked 500 days since beginning of Russia’s large-scale invasion.More than 9,000 civilians, incl over 500 children, killed since 24 Feb 2022 attack, but real number could be much higher.👉https://t.co/vs1nE0ZOeIpic.twitter.com/hlj5R2hQl5 — UNHumanRightsUkraine (@UNHumanRightsUA)July 7, 2023  And far from the front line in Ukraine’s western city of Lviv, 10 people were killed and another 37 were wounded during a missile attack early on Thursday morning that the mayor called the biggest attack on civilian infrastructure since the invasion began.    The UN said that the attack was also the first to take place in an area protected by the World Heritage Convention and had damaged a historic building. The UN monitoring mission in Ukraine also noted that three times as many civilians were killed in the last 500 days compared with the entire previous eight years of hostilities in eastern Ukraine, when Russian-backed separatists seized Crimea and other areas. Russia regularly bombards Ukraine with air attacks, including indiscriminate artillery and missile fire that have been especially deadly for civilians. Russia has also attacked civilian infrastructure and supply lines, depriving civilians of power and water. The cities of Bucha and Mariupol became bywords for Russian atrocities last year, after reports and images of massacres there shocked the world and prompted allegations of war crimes and even genocide. On Friday,the US announced that it would provide Ukrainian forces with cluster munitions, which human rights groups have slammed because of the dangers posed to civilians by the use of such weapons.    Cluster bombs release large numbers of bomblets across wide areas and the indiscriminate nature of the explosives presents a major threat to civilians, both during conflict and long afterwards because a percentage of bomblets fail to explode. More than 120 countries have signed the 2008 UN Convention on Cluster Munitions to ban their use.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/8/more-than-9000-civilians-killed-as-ukraine-war-hits-500-days-un
"Ukraine ‘deserves’ NATO membership, Turkey’s Erdogan says","Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also called for a return to peace talks saying, ‘a fair peace creates no losers’.","Turkey supports Ukraine’s NATO membership aspirations, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but he also urged for a “return to peace efforts” to end the conflict that hasnow raged for 500 dayssince Russia invaded Ukraine last year. “There is no doubt that Ukraine deserves membership of NATO,” Erdogan told a joint press conference with the Ukrainian president in Istanbul early on Saturday, adding that the two sides should go back to peace talks. “A fair peace creates no losers,” the Turkish leader said, according to the Reuters news agency. Zelenskyy thanked Erdogan for his support, whichcomes ahead of a key NATO summitthat is set to start on Tuesday in Vilnius, Lithuania. “I am grateful for the support of Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty. Peace formula. Protection of our countries, our people and our interests,” the Ukrainian leader wrote in a tweet regarding his talks with Erdogan.

Protection of our…pic.twitter.com/FfsniYKZ7q — Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa)July 7, 2023   The Ukrainian leader has lobbied intensively for his embattled country to beinvited to join the Western military alliance, arguing that Ukraine has become Europe’s last line of defence against Russia’s aggression. This week, Zelenskyy visited the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria to drum up support for Ukraine’s NATO membership bid ahead of the military alliance’s July 11-12 summit. In Prague, he won a pledge of support for Ukraine to join NATO “as soon as the war is over”, and in Sofia, he secured backing for membership “as soon as conditions allow”. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also reaffirmed his view that Ukraine would become a member.    However, thetimeline for Ukraine’s membershipremains unclear. On Friday, the United States dampened Ukraine’s hopes of any rapid accession to the alliance, saying this week’s summit would not result in a NATO membership invitation. US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the Vilnius summit “will be an important moment on that pathway towards membership”, but that Ukraine has “further steps it needs to take before membership in NATO”. NATO countries have debatedwhen and how Ukraine can become a memberand under what circumstances. Member countries such as Germany insist that certain conditions must be met, including the military being under civilian and democratic control. It remains unclear what exactly Ukraine will be offered at the summit in the Lithuanian capital, and Zelenskyy has acknowledged that Kyiv is unlikely to be able to join NATO while at war with Russia.     Russian President Vladimir Putin has threatened unspecified action if Ukraine joins NATO. Zelenskyy’s talks in Turkey were being watched closely by the Kremlin, which has tried to break its international isolation by cultivating strong relations with the Turkish leader Erdogan. Erdogan has tried to portray himself as a neutral mediator between Kyiv and Moscow, substantially boosting wartime trade with Russia while also supplying Ukraine with drones and other weapons that helped keep Kremlin forces from seizing Kyiv in the first weeks of the war.    Though the Turkish leader reaffirmed his longstanding call for the two sides to enter peace negotiations, Erdogan risked drawing the ire of Putin by delivering unequivocal support for Ukraine’s NATO aspiration. Erdogan said Putin will visit Turkey next month and that he and the Russian president would discuss possible prisoner swaps between Russia and Ukraine, which Erdogan has helped to arrange in the past. Erdogan also said that he would push Putin to extend a deal that Turkey and the United Nations had brokered last year under which Ukraine was able to ship grain to the global market from ports on the Black Sea. The deal will expire on July 17 unless Russia agrees to its renewal.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/8/ukraine-deserves-nato-membership-turkeys-erdogan-says

US to give Ukraine widely banned cluster munitions despite fears,"Banned by many countries, cluster munitions leave unexploded bombs that pose a risk to civilians for decades to come.","Washington, DC –The United States has authorised the transfer ofcluster munitionsto Ukraine against the objections of rights advocates who have been calling for a ban on the weapons, which they say endanger civilians. The administration of President Joe Biden confirmed the move on Friday, arguing that US-made cluster bombs are safer than the ones Russia is already using in the conflict. The transfer comes as Ukraine pushes on with a counteroffensive against Russian troops in the east of the country. “We recognise that cluster munitions create a risk of civilian harm from unexploded ordnance,” US national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters. “This is why we’ve deferred the decision for as long as we could. But there is also a massive risk of civilian harm if Russian troops and tanks roll over Ukrainian positions and take more Ukrainian territory and subjugate more Ukrainian civilians.” Sullivan added that cluster munitions would serve as a “bridge” to supplement conventional artillery as the US ramps up production of regular bombs and shells for Ukraine. Biden later toldCNNthat it was a “very difficult decision” on his part, adding that the “Ukrainians are running out of ammunition”. The weapons are part of a tranche of US military assistance to Ukraine that also includes armoured vehicles and anti-armour weapons, the Pentagon announced. Rights advocates slammed the Biden administration’s decision, highlighting their threat to Ukrainian civilians. Sarah Yager, the Washington director at Human Rights Watch, called the US move “devastating”. “They are absolutely awful for civilians.” Yager told Al Jazeera in a television interview. “I think when legislators and policymakers here in the United States see the photos coming back of children with missing limbs, parents injured, killed by our own American cluster munitions, there’s going to be a real awakening to the humanitarian disaster that this is.”    Each cluster bomb can contain hundreds of smaller explosives that spread across a targeted area, but not all of these bomblets detonate on impact. Theunexploded bombs, known as duds, can remain embedded in the ground for years, posing a serious danger to civilians, most notably children. While cluster munitions are not banned internationally, more than 120 countries – including most NATO members – have signed on to a convention prohibiting their use. The US, Ukraine and Russia are not party to that agreement. On Friday, Farhan Haq, a spokesperson for United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, reiterated the UN chief’s support for the Convention on Cluster Munitions. “He wants countries to abide by the terms of that convention, and so as a result, of course, he does not want there to be continued use of cluster munitions on the battlefield,” Haq said. Germany, a NATO member and top Ukraine ally, has also voiced opposition to sending cluster munitions to Ukraine. But NATO Secretary-GeneralJens Stoltenbergsuggested that the alliance does not take a position on the issue, leaving it to the individual states to make their own policies. “Cluster munition is already in use in the war on both sides. The difference is that Russia uses the cluster munitions in a war of aggression to occupy, to control, to invade Ukraine while Ukraine is using it to defend itself against aggression,” Stoltenberg told Al Jazeera’s diplomatic editor James Bays in an interview. But Yager dismissed the argument that Russia’s use of the weapons justifies further deployment of cluster munitions by Ukraine. “The fact that Russia is using them is just another reason why they should not be used,” she said.    With the US providingmilitary support, Ukraine has been making only modest gains in amuch-anticipated counteroffensivelaunched last month. Last year, US envoy to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield slammed Russia for using “exceptionally lethal” weapons in Ukraine,including cluster munitions. On Friday, Sullivan said Washington has “written assurances” from Kyiv that it would use the cluster munitions in a careful way to minimise civilian harm. Patrick Fruchet, a landmine clearance expert, said explosive remnants of war – bombs that “fail to go bang” when launched – are a major source of risk in conflict areas. Fruchet said the main concern with cluster munitions is their failure rate and their “twitchy” qualities, which makes the unexploded devices vulnerable to detonation when handled. “You see a lot of children coming upon novel-looking devices and being attracted to them because they’re unusual, … and there’s a tendency to pick them up,” he said. The Pentagon said on Thursday that the cluster bombs it is considering providing to Ukraine have a dud rate lower than 2.35 percent. But Fruchet said the dud estimate on the explosives are unreliable, citing his experience with the UN Mine Action Servicein Afghanistan, where he dealt with cluster bombs with a supposed failure rate of 5 percent. “The teams on the ground, we saw failure rates of up to 40 percent based on going out and clearing the space – knowing how many cluster munitions would have been in one clamshell and then basically counting how many we had to clear,” he said. BREAKING: Amnesty International opposes the transfer of cluster munitions to the armed forces of Ukraine Daniel Balson,@AmnestyUSA’s Advocacy Director for Europe and Central Asia said:https://t.co/WEaSFb9IJA — Amnesty International USA (@amnestyusa)July 6, 2023  Unlike landmines, cluster bombs are not designed to be triggered by the proximity of people or vehicles; they are meant to explode when dropped. But once left unexploded, the bomblets “function in practice very similarly to landmines” – they go off if they are disturbed, Fruchet told Al Jazeera. The duds can still detonate decades after they are dropped. “There’s no reason to believe that they ever really become inert, that they ever become harmless,” Fruchet said. “These things are made to an industrial standard. They’re often stored for a long time.” For example in south Lebanon,cluster munitionsfired by Israel during the 2006 war continue to endanger civilians today. On Friday, Amnesty International slammed the US decision and called on Washington to reconsider its policy. “The USA’s plan to transfer cluster munitions to Ukraine is a retrograde step, which undermines the considerable advances made by the international community in its attempts to protect civilians from such dangers both during and after armed conflicts,” the group said in a statement.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/7/us-to-give-ukraine-widely-banned-cluster-munitions-despite-fears
Syria cracked down on Wagner after mutiny in Russia: Report,"Syrian authorities swiftly moved to isolate and control Wagner operatives after the mercenary group rebelled against the Kremlin, Reuters has reported.","Authorities in Syria and Russian military commanders took swift measures against localWagneroperatives to prevent an uprising in Russia from spreading to the Middle Eastern nation, six sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters, after mercenary boss Yevgeny Prigozhinordered his men to march on Moscowlast month. The crackdown included ordering mercenary fighters to sign new contracts with the Russian defence ministry or promptly leave Syria, Syrian officials and other sources based near deployed Russian forces said. Damascus did not publicly comment on theJune 23-24 Wagner mutiny, in which Prigozhin ordered his men fighting for Russia in Ukraine to march on the Russian capital before adeal brokered by Belarussaw them turn back. As they watched events unfolding, senior Syrian military and intelligence officials privately voiced concern that the mutiny could disrupt the Russian military presence they had relied on for so long, according to a senior Syrian Republican Guard officer and a Syrian source briefed on developments. Russia deployed its military forces and, crucially, its airpower to Syria in 2015, helping President Bashar al-Assad beat back rebels intent on toppling him. Wagner has since been involved in combat missions and security for oil installations in Syria, with the first suspected Wagner deaths there reported as early as 2015. “Assad was counting on strengthening his alliance with Prigozhin and was considering increasing the number of fighters considerably to help himretake western Syria,” Karam Shaar, senior fellow at the New Lines Institute, told Al Jazeera. Now “he will have to fall back in line with the Kremlin’s position, while in the past he was able to talk to each party separately” with a level of autonomy, Shaar said. A group of Russian military officers were quickly dispatched to Syria to help take charge of Wagner forces there, according to a regional military source close to Damascus and two Syrian sources with knowledge of the events, who did not provide further details. About a dozen Wagner officers deployed in Syria’s central province of Homs and other areas were summoned to Russia’s operational base at Hmeimim, in western Latakia province, according to the Republican Guard officer and one of the Syrian sources briefed on the developments. The officer said this occurred “in the early hours of the mutiny”.    Syria’s military intelligence cut landlines and internet links overnight on June 23 from areas where Russian Wagner forces were deployed to prevent them from communicating among themselves, with Wagner in Russia, and even with relatives back home, the three sources said. By the morning of June 24, Syrian military intelligence and Russian defence officials were coordinating closely to isolate and control Wagner operatives, according to the senior Republican Guard officer, a Syrian security source and two Syrian sources briefed on the developments. Wagner fighters in Syria were asked to sign new contracts in which they would report directly to Russia’s defence ministry and their pay would be cut, a source with knowledge of Wagner’s deployments and two other sources with knowledge of the events said. Those who refused the terms were flown out on Russian Ilyushin planes in the following days, two of those sources said. One said they numbered “in the dozens,” surprising Syrian officials who expected more would refuse and head into exile. Between June 25 and 27, flight-tracking data from Flightradar24 shows at least three trips by a Russian Ilyushin plane between Latakia, Syria and Bamako, the capital of the West African nation of Mali, where Wagner also has operations. Reuters could not establish whether Wagner personnel were on board the flights. The fate of Wagner assets in Syria remains unclear, including Syrian oilfields under Evro Polis, a company linked to Wagner that Western officials have said profits from those assets. The European Union imposed sanctions on the firm in 2021. According to Shaar, “What’s going to happen with Wagner’s economic interests in Syria is that the Kremlin – basically Putin – will replace Prigozhin and take over his investments.” The mercenary group’s presence in Syria is relatively small, at between 250 and 450 personnel, or roughly 10 percent of the estimated Russian military strength, Syrian sources said, according to Reuters. There are no official figures on staffing, which vary over time. For years, Moscow denied any connection with Wagner, but the group has played a very public role in Russia’s war in Ukraine. Putin said after the mutiny that his government funds the group. In the wake of the Wagner uprising, Syria’s leadership quickly restated publicly the importance of its military alliance with Russia. “The Syrian government’s relationship with Russia goes back many decades, all the way to the Soviet 1950s,” Aron Lund, a fellow at Century International, told Al Jazeera. “Now with the war [in Ukraine], Russia’s direct presence in Syria and the military, diplomatic, and other support it provides for Damascus – all that is invaluable to the Assad regime. Keeping Russia engaged and supportive is an existential issue at this point.” Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s son Hafez, a potential successor to his father, graduated with honours from Moscow State University days after Prigozhin’s mutiny. On that occasion, Syrian first lady Asmaa al-Assad “took the opportunity to restate Syria’s support for Russia,” Lund said. “Our Russian friends did not hesitate when they stood with us in our war,” she was quoted by Russian media as saying. “So we did not hesitate, and we won’t hesitate, to stand with them in their war.”   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/7/syria-cracked-down-on-wagner-after-mutiny-in-russia-report
Russia’s Wagner fighters have not visited Belarus barracks: Minsk,"Belarus adds to the uncertainty surrounding the Russian mercenary force, which was expected to be exiled after its brief mutiny.","No one from the Russian Wagner mercenary group has yet visited a disused military camp that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has offered for Wagner’s use, according to an adviser to Minsk’s defence minister. Under the terms of an agreement brokered by Lukashenko to end an armed mutiny by Wagner last month, its leader Yevgeny Prigozhin was supposed to move to Belarus along with those of his fighters who did not wish to sign up with the Russian defence ministry. But the deal does not seem to be playing out on those lines. Asked if Wagner had come to look at the site, the adviser, Leonid Kasinsky, said on Friday, “They have not come, they have not looked.” Lukashenkosaid on Thursdaythat Prigozhin was in Russia, and that the question of his thousands of fighters’ relocation had yet to be settled. He said Wagner’s fighters were still in the permanent camps where they had been located since they left the front, and that he expected to discuss the matter in a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin.  Lukashenko said Belarus had offered Wagner the disused Soviet-era military quarters near Tsel, but added that “Wagner has a different vision for deployment”, on which he declined to elaborate. Kasinsky said around 300 tents at the camp had been put up for an exercise and were not connected to Wagner. The Kremlin has said it is not tracking Prigozhin’s movements, but state-backed media has turnedmore sharply againstthe mercenary chief in recent days. In an interview with Al Jazeera, Russian defence and military analyst Pavel Felgenhauercastthe situation between Russia and Wagner, which has baffled war analysts, as a ceasefire, saying that the Kremlin is not yet ready to take the mercenary force on. Last month’s Wagner mutiny threw the top mercenary’s relations with the Russian leader into question and, so it seemed, he was exiled. Tensions had come to a head after Prigozhin raged for months at Russia’s top brass in foul-mouthed diatribes, accusing them of incompetence in their war efforts in Ukraine.

US says Russian fighter jets again harass Reaper drones in Syria,Russian fighter jets accused of conducting dangerous manoeuvres for second day near US military drones over Syria.,"Russian fighter jets have again flown dangerously close to several US MQ-9 Reaper drones operating over Syria –the second such incident of harassment in 24 hours– setting off flares and forcing Washington’s unmanned aerial vehicles to take evasive manoeuvres, the United States air force said. The protest from the US air forces came as the French military said that two of its fighter jets on patrol over the Iraq-Syria border area were forced to manoeuvre “to control the risk of accident” involving a Russian Sukhoi SU-35 warplane on Thursday. The Russian aircraft had engaged in “non-professional interaction” with two of France’s Rafale planes deployed to the region as part of “Operation Chammal”, which seeks to contain the ISIL (ISIS) group in Iraq and Syria, the French military said. Two separate incidents on Wednesday and Thursday involving Russian warplanes and US Reaper droneswere captured on video,the US said. “The events represent a new level of unprofessional and unsafe action by Russian air forces operating in Syria,” the US military said. “We urge Russian forces in Syria to cease this reckless behaviour and adhere to the standards of behaviour expected of a professional air force so we can resume our focus on the enduring defeat of ISIS,” Lieutenant General Alexus Grynkewich, head of US Air Forces Central Command, said in a statement. In the first incident, which took place about 10:40am (07:40 GMT) local time on Wednesday in northwest Syria, Russian Sukhoi SU-35 fighters closed in on a Reaper drone, and one of the Russian pilots moved their aircraft in front of the US aerial vehicles and engaged the SU-35’s afterburner, which greatly increases its speed and air pressure. The jet blast from the afterburner could have potentially damaged the Reaper’s electronics, and Grynkewich said it reduced the drone operator’s ability to safely operate the aircraft. Later, a number of so-called parachute flares released by the Russian planes moved into the drone’s flight path. The flares are attached to parachutes. In the second incident,which took place over northwest Syriaat approximately 9:30am (06:30 GMT) on Thursday local time, “Russian aircraft dropped flares in front of the drones and flew dangerously close, endangering the safety of all aircraft involved,” Grynkewich said. The Reaper drones involved in the incidents were not armed with weapons and are commonly used for reconnaissance missions. Earlier this year,a diplomatic dispute erupted briefly when the US claimed that Russian jetswere responsible for the downing of a Reaper drone, valued at more than $30m and packed with sensitive US spying technology, operating over the Black Sea.    Moscow denied its warplanes were responsible for the drone crashing into the sea in March but video footage released by the US military showed the Russian planes engaged in manoeuvres to hamper the drone’s flight path. US officials said the Russian jets flew around and in front of the Reaper drone several times for 30 to 40 minutes, and then one “struck the propeller” of the drone, “causing US forces to have to bring the MQ-9 down in international waters”. The US said the drone was operating in international airspace, reportedly west of Ukraine’s Crimea over the Black Sea. The Russian defence ministry said thedrone had intruded into an area that was declared off-limits by Russian authorities. Of the latest incidents, US Army General Erik Kurilla, head of US Central Command, said in a statement that Russia’s violation of ongoing efforts to clear the airspace over Syria “increases the risk of escalation or miscalculation”. About 900 US forces are deployed to Syriato work with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces battling ISIL fighters. In April, Russian forces operating in Syria accused the US military of engaging in “provocative actions” on the ground. Russia together with Turkey carries out joint patrols in northern Syria and has agreed on special zones where the US-led coalition can operate in its fight against ISIL.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/7/us-says-russian-fighter-jets-again-harass-reaper-drones-in-syria
US to send cluster bombs to Ukraine despite humanitarian concerns,"The weapons, banned by more than 100 countries, will be in a new aid package expected to be announced on Friday.","The United States has decided to send cluster munitions to Ukraine, multiple news outlets have reported, despite concerns about the deployment of weapons banned by more than 100 countries. A weapons package including cluster munitions fired from a 155-millimetre Howitzer cannon is expected to be announced as soon as Friday, three US officials told the Reuters news agency on condition of anonymity. The New York Times, citing people familiar with the discussions who requested anonymity, reported that several of US President Joe Biden’s key aides, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, had recommended the US send the weapons at a meeting of top national security officials last week, despite what they described as their own deep reservations. Cluster bombs release large numbers of smaller bomblets across a wide area posing a major threat to civilians both during the war and long afterwards because some of the bomblets will fail to explode. More than 120 countries have signed the 2008 United Nations Convention on Cluster Munitions to ban their use including some of Ukraine and the US’s key allies such as France and theUnited Kingdom. Ukraine, Russia and the US have not signed that treaty although a 2009 law bans the US from exporting cluster munitions with bomblet failure rates above 1 percent, which covers virtually the entire US military stockpile. Biden, however, can override such prohibitions in cases deemed in the interests of US national security. Earlier,Human Rights Watch(HRW) criticised Ukraine and Russia for their use of cluster weapons in the conflict. The rights group said Russia had “extensively used cluster munitions, causing many civilian deaths and serious injuries”, while Ukrainian cluster munition rocket attacks on the then-Russian-occupiedcity of Izyumin 2022 had killed at least eight civilians and wounded 15 more. Ukraine told HRW it had not used cluster munitions in or around the city at the time. “Cluster munitions used by Russia and Ukraine are killing civilians now and will continue to do so for many years,” Mary Wareham, the group’s acting arms director, said in a statement. “Both sides should immediately stop using them and not try to get more of these indiscriminate weapons.” Despite the humanitarian concerns, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other senior Ukrainian officials have been calling for new stocks of cluster weapons saying they are the best way to break through the Russian trenches that areslowing Kyiv’s counteroffensive. Ukraine is also running low on conventional artillery shells. One US official told the Times it had become clear that the current battlefield situation had made cluster weapons “100 percent necessary”. A Pentagon official said last month that the US military believed cluster munitions would be useful for Ukraine, but they had not been approved for Kyiv because of congressional restrictions and concerns among allies. The total aid package is expected to be worth as much as $800m and includes munitions for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), and ground vehicles such as Bradley fighting vehicles and Stryker armoured personnel carriers, officials said. It will be the 42nd aid package since Russia began itsfull-scale invasionof Ukraine in February 2022.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/7/us-to-send-cluster-bombs-to-ukraine-despite-humanitarian-concerns
NATO tracks movements of Russia’s Wagner mercenaries: Stoltenberg,NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg says Western military alliance is monitoring movements of Russian mercenary force and their leader Yevgeny Prigozhin.,"NATO is closely following the movement of Russia’s Wagner mercenary force as well as their boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Western military alliance’s secretary general has said, following revelations thatneither the private army’s fighters nor their leader had taken up exile in Belarus. NATO’s Jens Stoltenberg made his comments on Thursday amid reports that Prigozhin was back in Russia and had not taken up the offer of exile in Belarus, which was agreed after Wagner forces began andended a 24-hour mutiny against the Russian military leadershipon June 24. Asked by Al Jazeera’s diplomatic editor James Bays to comment on reports that Prigozhin hadreturned to the Russian city of St Petersburg, Stoltenberg said that NATO had tracked the Wagner leader’s recent travels, which he described as “moving a bit around”. “On Prigozhin, well, what we can say is that we monitor closely where the Wagner soldiers are moving around, and also where he [Prigozhin] is moving,” Stoltenberg said in Brussels. “I will not go into the details, but we have seen some preparations for hosting large groups of Wagner soldiers in Belarus. So far we haven’t seen so many of them going to Belarus,” he said. “And then we have seen Mr Prigozhin moving a bit around,” Stoltenberg said, adding that he would not go into further details.     Prigozhin’s return to Russia was revealed by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko on Thursday. Lukashenko – whomediated the exile deal that ended the Wagner mutinylast month – said that after a brief period in Belarus, the Wagner chief had returned to Russia. “As for Prigozhin, he’s in St Petersburg. He is not on the territory of Belarus,” Lukashenko told reporters. “Where was he this morning? Maybe he went to Moscow, or some other place. But he is not in Belarus,” Lukashenko said, according to Belarusian state news agency BelTA. Lukashenko also said that Wagner’s troops were in their camps, but he did not specify the location of the camps. He did say that Wagner troops were offered the use of Belarusian military camps, but that the private armed group had not made a final decision. Wagner maintains camps in Russia and Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine. According to BelTA, Lukashenko said that he plans to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin soonto discuss the Wagner situation, among other topics, and that he did not think there would be “any problems” with Wagner mercenaries continuing to work “in the interests of Russia” despite their recent mutiny.    “One should not lose such a unit despite all the subtle details,” Lukashenko said, according to BelTA. “I wish the entire army fought as well as these guys. But these are the problems of the Russian Federation and President Putin,” he added. Shortly after the aborted Wagner rebellion in Russia,which saw Wagner fighters come within 200km (124 miles) of Moscow, Stoltenberg said that NATO was preparing for the arrival of Wagner forces in Belarus and that the Western alliance would protect “every ally, every inch of NATO territory” against threats from either“Moscow or Minsk”. Prigozhin’s return to Russia raises many questions about the deal that ended the Wagner military challenge to Putin’s power. Asked of the whereabouts of Prigozhin on Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov shrugged off the question, saying that Moscow had neither the desire nor the means to track his movements – but reaffirmed that the deal that ended the mutiny envisaged the Wagner boss’s move to Belarus.    Washington DC-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) described Peskov’s statement on Prigozhin as “absurd”, noting that the Russian security services “have the ability to detain Prigozhin or restrict his movements in Russia” if they so wished. The ISW also said on Thursdaythat Lukashenko appears to be attempting to distance himself from the exile deal, and is “pinning the responsibility on the Kremlin to enforce the deal”. “Prigozhin’s ability to freely operate in Russia suggests that Prigozhin is still protected by some security guarantees and/or that the Kremlin continues to prioritize undermining his reputation in Russia over targeting Prigozhin physically or legally,” the ISW said. While the Kremlin has sought to play down the fact that Prigozhin had escaped punishment for his mutiny so far, Russian state TV launcheda fierce attack on the Wagner chiefon Wednesday, saying that a criminal investigation of mutiny against Russia’s military leadership was still under way. In a programme called 60 Minutesbroadcast on Russia’s state Russia-1 TV channel,Prigozhin was branded a “traitor”and viewers were told that the case against him was in full swing.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/7/nato-tracks-movements-of-russias-wagner-mercenaries-stoltenberg

"Analyst: ‘Uneasy ceasefire’ between Wagner, Russia after mutiny",Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin was expected to relocate to Belarus under a deal brokered by Minsk. Lukashenko says he’s in Russia.,"Having led anarmed rebellionin Russia that sent shockwaves across the world, Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin was meant to relocate to Belarus as part of a deal brokered by the ex-Soviet nation’s president, Alexander Lukashenko. Both Lukashenko and Prigozhin have for years held strong ties with President Vladimir Putin. But last month’s mutiny threw the top mercenary’s relations with the Russian leader into question and, so it seemed, he was exiled. Tensions had come to a head after Prigozhin raged for months at Russia’s top brass in foul-mouthed diatribes, accusing them of incompetence in their war efforts in Ukraine. He cast his Wagner fighters as leading on the battlefields, before marching towards Moscow. On Thursday, however, Lukashenko told reporters that the Wagner boss was back in Russia. The details were vague. “Yevgeny Prigozhin is in St Petersburg … Where was he this morning? Maybe he went to Moscow, or some other place. But he is not in Belarus,” Belarusian state news agency Belta quoted Lukashenko as saying. According to some reports in Russian media, Prigozhin was in Russia to finalise his affairs there. The Kremlin said it was not following his movements, but confirmed the Wagner boss’s departure for Belarus was part of the deal negotiated by Lukashenko. Al Jazeera spoke to Pavel Felgenhauer, a defence and military analyst based in Moscow, about the latest uncertainties surrounding the Russia-Belarus-Wagner scandal. Al Jazeera: Wasn’t the Wagner chief supposed to stay in Belarus? Pavel Felgenhauer:[Prigozhin] didn’t really [leave] from Russia, he had made a brief visit to Belarus and then returned, so he’s not in exile there. Al Jazeera: But as part of the deal brokered by Belarus, surely Prigozhin was meant to stay out of Russia, where he recently led an armed rebellion? Felgenhauer:Apparently not. The deal was that he would move his base there, maybe in the future, but immediately, right now, not. There is, I would say, a ceasefire between Prigozhin and the Kremlin, a freeze of the situation that was agreed together with President Lukashenko of Belarus. This is an uneasy ceasefire, but both sides are more or less holding it. Prigozhin is travelling in Russia, doing his business. Al Jazeera: Only a few days ago, his business involved turning his thousands of armed men towards the Kremlin. Why is Putin allowing this? Felgenhauer:It’s a ceasefire between Prigozhin and the Kremlin. They retreated from attacking Moscow, but they’re still a credible fighting force, and apparently, the Kremlin is not ready to take them on. Al Jazeera: In his comments on Thursday, Lukashenko said his offer to station some fighters in Belarus still stands. Will they be moved, in your view? Felgenhauer:Lukashenko does not know because this is a lot of people and weapons, and the transfer would not be easy to negotiate, so, right now, it’s kind of freezing of the situation as it was on June 24. Al Jazeera: Weren’t the fighters supposed tohand over their heavy weaponryto the Russian army? Felgenhauer:There was talk about that, but it’s not clear whether it happened or not yet. I think that’s going to be negotiable. Al Jazeera: No state tolerates rebel groups unless they can’t defeat them. Is Putin allowing this because he can’t defeat the Wagner Group? Felgenhauer:Sort of. They are not ready to take them on right now, especially as Ukrainians are counterattacking. The Kremlin is not ready to take on Wagner. They’re keeping the ceasefire negotiated by Lukashenko. Lukashenko maybe would want these men to move to his country and have his own mercenaries, though there would be a problem – who’s going to pay them? Right now, it’s a frozen situation. The mutiny was not crushed. It ended in a ceasefire, in a balance situation. Al Jazeera: It appears the Belarusian president was asked on Thursday whether he is worried Wagner might rebel against him. His answer seemed flippant, he said, “Anything can happen in life.” Heads of state don’t usually take such a casual approach to critical matters of national security. Doesn’t that sound strange to you? Felgenhauer:Well, it is for Western ears. The Wagner Group reminds me of the Landsknecht companies of 16th-century Germany, who could hire themselves to different princes, and that was considered normal, so that’s more or less how it is right now, and Lukashenko would maybe want to have mercenaries to make his regime more stable, but he understands that their loyalty is not to him. Their loyalty is to their own company.

"Shoigu: Who is the Russian defence chief, detested by Wagner?","The general, who was once seen as President Putin’s successor, is accused by the mercenary leader of failing the war effort in Ukraine.","Kyiv, Ukraine– Subutai was one of the most successful generals in history. Genghis Khan’s supreme commander laid waste to China and Central Asia, led Mongol hordes to Iran and the eastern Mediterranean, and turned Kyiv, one of Eastern Europe’s largest cities, into a smouldering ruin. In a historytextbookpublished in Tuva, Russia’s mostly Buddhist, Turkic-speaking province that borders northwestern China, Subutai has the face of Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu. The textbook’s author and other Tuvan intellectuals proclaimed Shoigu no less than a modern-day reincarnation of Subutai. And when the war in Ukraine started in February 2022, Shoigu apparently wanted to live up to the reputation by reportedly promising Russian President Vladimir Putin to take Kyiv within three days. Shoigu’s tenure, improbably long by Russian standards, dates back to 1991, when the former construction manager and minor Communist official became head of the emergencies ministry. Within years, he turned it into one of Russia’s most effective and popular government agencies as it promptly responded to natural and man-made disasters, including bombings and other attacks. In 2012, two years before Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula, Shoigu was appointed defence minister, even though he had never served in the military. Putin trusted him to conduct reforms that supposedly made Russia’s military “the world’s second most powerful” after the US army, in the words of Kremlin supporters.  The claim was ostensibly proven by the salvation of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The Russian campaign to help al-Assad regain most ofSyriaturned into a showroom for Russia’s advanced weaponry. The public barely noticed that the actual Russian boots on the ground in Syria were those of the nascent Wagner private army while visually impressive strikes, such as the launch of cruise missiles from a warship in the Caspian Sea, were militarily insignificant. Shoigu revelled in glory and was often seen in television reports with Putin, conferring, hunting or fishing. “He has serious chances [of succeeding Putin], much higher than anyone else for now,” Nikolay Mitrokhin of Germany’s Bremen University, told Al Jazeera in2021. But two years later, Shoigu’s political career faces a dead end, Mitrokhin says now, because Shoigu played a key role in preparing the faltering war in Ukraine. “Played and lost. And a general who loses a war loses any political perspective – apart from an attempt to start a riot and seize power by force,” Mitrokhin told Al Jazeera. The war showed that Russia’s actual military might was nothing but a Potemkin village built on unfounded reports, well-produced videos and multibillion-dollar budgets. The military swallowed all of these budgets without producing results such as hypersonic missiles that can go to outer space or sophisticated tanks that have never been seen in Ukraine. It was not entirely Shoigu’s fault. He simply epitomised the operational logic of Russia’s governing structures and military machine, which are mired in corruption and fake reporting, observers said. “He didn’t do anything that would contradict the logic of existence and evolution of Russia’s government system as a whole and the logic of development of the armed forces in particular,” Pavel Luzin, a military analyst who fled Russia following official pressure, told Al Jazeera.    A popular meme that went viral on June 24 as the Wagner Group marched towards Moscow was a chart showing the Russian army’s “ratings”: “2021 – the second-best army in the world “2022 – the second-best army in Ukraine “2023 – the second-best army in Russia” Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin said he did not want to topple Putin during his mutiny. He wanted the president to hand overShoiguand Valery Gerasimov, Russia’s top general and chief of the general staff. The Wagner warlord regularly accused them of botching the war effort and causing the death of “tens of thousands” of servicemen with their orders aimed at pleasing Putin but not at winning actual battles. Wagner for months appeared to be the most effective part of Russia’s war machine in Ukraine – but its takeover of the southeastern city of Bakhmut was widely seen as aPyrrhic victory. The very existence of Wagner was proof of how ineffective the regular army was with its demoralised, barely trained soldiers, poor supplies, malfunctioning weaponry and decision-making rooted in World War II stratagems, analysts said. “The fact that Prigozhin and Wagner were needed was shameful to the ‘invincible and legendary’ [army] and a constant reminder that the defence ministry and the army can’t do without them,” David Gendelman, an independent military analyst, told Al Jazeera. Moreover, Prigozhin did not just keep a low profile following orders, he said. “Instead, Prigozhin unashamedly advertised himself and his victories, openly flipped off Shoigu and Gerasimov,” Gendelman said. Shoigu detested Wagner’s relative success and growing popularity in Russia. First, Wagner was barred from recruiting prison inmates after tens of thousands of them had been killed during suicidal “meat marches” on Ukrainian positions in Bakhmut and elsewhere. And then, Shoigu’s ministry started forcing Wagner fighters to sign contracts making them part of the regular army – and reducing Prigozhin’s role. His aborted rebellion and banishment to Belarus made Shoigu look stronger. Wagner’s attempt to kick Shoigu out failed, “and his sacking would be an ambiguous political signal”, Gendelman said. So what next for Shoigu? He may follow the political trajectory of other top officials who were promoted with a demotion, in the Russian political lingo, Mitrokhin said. One of them, Dmitry Medvedev, who was Russian president from 2008 to 2012 while Putin waited out a constitutional limit on consecutive terms, now serves as deputy head of Russia’s Security Council, a consultative body with limited power. “Most likely, [Shoigu] will be appointed to a third-rate position such as one more deputy head of the Security Council or chairman of some joint body with Belarus or a presidential envoy,” Mitrokhin said. “And then, if he survives, he’ll be sent into retirement,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/6/shoigu-who-is-the-russian-defence-chief-detested-by-wagner
"After brief exile in Belarus, Wagner boss in Russia: Lukashenko","Mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin is back in Russia less than two weeks after leading rebellion, according to the Belarusian president.","Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, who last month brokered a deal to end Wagner’smutinyin Russia, has said that its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, was no longer in Belarus. Lukashenko said on June 27 that Prigozhin, whose fighters briefly captured a southern Russian city and marched towards Moscow, had arrived in Belarus as part of the June 24 deal that defused the crisis. But addressing reporters on Thursday, he said: “As for Prigozhin, he’s in St Petersburg. He is not on the territory of Belarus.” A business jet linked to Prigozhin left St Petersburg for Moscow on Wednesday and headed for southern Russia on Thursday, according to flight tracking data, but it was not clear if the mercenary chief was on board. Lukashenko said an offer for Wagner to station some of its fighters in Belarus – a prospect that has alarmed neighbouring NATO countries – still stands. He said he did not see it as a risk to Belarus and did not believe Wagner fighters would ever take up arms against his country. After Lukashenko’s announcement, the Kremlin said it was not tracking Prigozhin’s movements. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that no date had yet been set for a meeting between President Vladimir Putin and Lukashenko, and said he could not yet confirm details of what would be on the agenda.  Lukashenko has spoken proudly of his role in ending the mutiny, which Putin has said could have plunged Russia into civil war. Last week, Lukashenko said he had persuaded Putin not to “wipe out” Prigozhin. But much remains unclear about the terms of the deal Lukashenko brokered and whether it is being implemented as agreed. Russian state TV on Wednesdaylaunched a fierce attackon Prigozhin and said an investigation into what had happened nearly two weeks ago was still being vigorously pursued. Journalist Yulia Shapovalova told Al Jazeera from Moscow that according to Lukashenko, the movement of mercenary fighters into Belarus depends on the Wagner management and Russian authorities. Lukashenko said he was “absolutely not worried” about Wagner forces in his country, said Shapovalova. The rebellion saw Wagner forces sweep into the southern city of Rostov-on-Don and capture military headquarters there before marching towards the Russian capital in what Prigozhin described as a “march of justice” to oust Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu and chief of the general staff Valery Gerasimov. Prigozhin said his fighters had come within 200km (124 miles) of Moscow when he ordered them to stop the advance under the deal brokered by Lukashenko. The abortive rebellion represented the biggest threat to Putin in his more than two decades in power and exposed weakness in the Kremlin. Lukashenko’s statement on Thursday followed Russian media reports that said Prigozhin was spotted in St Petersburg, Russia’s second largest city. Those reports cast his presence as part of agreements that allowed the billionaire to finalise his affairs there. Lukashenko said the issue of relocating Wagner forces had not yet been resolved, the TASS news agency reported. The Belarusian president also hit out at the West over the Ukraine war and said it was likely that Kyiv would try to demonstrate its power against Russia before a key NATO summit in Lithuania next week, TASS reported. He was quoted as saying nuclear weapons would only be used in Ukraine in the case of possible NATO “aggression”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/6/after-brief-exile-in-belarus-wagner-boss-in-russia-lukashenko
Russian frigates arrive in China in sign of ‘close cooperation’,The Cold War-era Gromkiy and Sovershenniy will take part in joint drills with the Chinese navy during a week in Shanghai.,"Two Russian navy ships have arrived in Shanghai in the first port visit by the Pacific Fleet to China in three years, in a further demonstration of the two countries’ close ties 16 months after Moscow began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The Cold War-era frigates Gromkiy and Sovershenniy sailed into China’s largest city on Wednesday and were greeted by Chinese sailors dressed in white parade uniforms holding placards welcoming their arrival, according to Russia’s state-run TASS news agency. The ships, whose base isVladivostok, will remain in China until July 11 and are expected to take part in joint drills with the Chinese navy focusing on ship-to-ship communications, manoeuvring in formation and maritime search and rescue, Chinese state media said. “Their arrival is symbolic and very important,” Dmitry Lukyantsev, a representative of the Shanghai Committee for Foreign Affairs and Russia’s consul general in Shanghai, told TASS. “This is the first call by Pacific Fleet ships after the three-year pandemic period and this vividly shows that our states maintain exclusively close cooperation absolutely in all the directions, including the military and political sphere.” The same vessels passed through watersnear the self-ruled island of Taiwanat the end of June. This month they sailed past Japan’s Okinawa Islands, where the United States has a major military base. China and Russia’s military cooperation underlines the strength of the two government’s informal alliance, which has endured despite the Ukraine war. Despite having had close ties with Ukraine, China has not explicitly condemned Moscow’s invasion, insisting that it is neutral in the conflict. It has also tried to mediate a peaceful solution to the crisis. The naval visit follows a meeting in Beijing this week between China’s Minister of National Defence Li Shangfu and the head of Russia’s navy, Admiral Nikolai Yevmenov, the first formal military talks between the two countries since a short-lived mutiny by the Russian mercenary group Wagner on June 24. China has reassured Russia of its continued support since the uprising, and Li told Yevmenov that China hoped for increased exchanges, joint exercises and other forms of cooperation to help defence ties “reach a new level”, according to China’s defence ministry. “The Chinese and Russian navies have close exchanges and frequent interactions,” the ministry quoted Li as saying. “It is hoped that the two sides will strengthen communication at all levels, regularly organise joint training, joint patrols and joint war games.” China has the world’s largest navy by number of hulls and isvastly superiorto Russia’s not only in terms of size but also in technical prowess.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/6/russian-frigates-arrive-in-china-in-sign-of-close-cooperation
"Russia TV blasts Wagner boss Prigozhin, says mutiny probe ongoing",Russia’s state Russia-1 TV channel broadcast a programme in which Wagner boss branded ‘a traitor’ and says criminal investigation is continuing over mutiny.,"Russian state TV has launcheda fierce attack on Yevgeny Prigozhin, the exiled boss of the Wagner mercenary force, saying that an investigation into the private army’s short-lived mutiny against the Moscow military leadership was still under way. In a programme called 60 Minutes broadcast on Wednesday on Russia’s state Russia-1 TV channel,the Wagner boss was branded a “traitor”and viewers were told that the criminal case against Prigozhin was in full swing. Prigozhin’s Wagner force crossed from Ukraine into Russiaon June 24 and took control of the southern city of Rostov-on-Don as a unit of his fighters sped towards Moscow in an attemptto remove key Russian military officials. Butthe Wagner convoy stopped within 200km (124 miles) of Moscow, and to the surprise of many, Prigozhin said he had called off his operation after agreeing to lead his forces into Belarus after a deal was struck with the country’s leader Alexander Lukashenko, and in order to not spill Russian blood. Under the deal, all criminal charges against Prigozhin and the Wagner fighters who participated in the mutiny were to be dropped.    The host of the 60 Minutes programme, Russian lawmaker Yevgeny Popov, said Prigozhin was “a traitor” and video footage shot during police raids of Prigozhin’s office and residence in Saint Petersburg was shownas proof of the Wagner chief’s criminality. The footage showed boxes full of high-denomination roubles in Prigozhin’s office and bundles of dollars in his luxurious residence, along with what was called his personal helicopter, an arms cache, a collection of wigs, a fully equipped medical treatment room, and a collection of souvenir sledge hammers, the tool Wagner fighters allegedly used to bludgeon traitors to death in videos that have surfaced online. The footage was presented by a specially invited guest – journalist Eduard Petrov. “Nobody planned to close this case. The investigation is ongoing,” Petrov told the viewers. He also said that Russian investigators had concluded that a video used by Prigozhin as a pretext to start his mutiny against Russian military chiefs – which claimed to show a Russian missile attack on a Wagner camp – was a fake.    Cash worth 600 million roubles ($6.58m) had been found in Prigozhin’s properties, he added. The programme also showed what it said were multiple passports Prigozhin had used and which carried different names. “A normal person can’t have so many passports,” Petrov said. “Why did this person have such strange powers like the serious leader of some kind of criminal group?” he asked. “We need to get to the bottom of who was on whose side [in the mutiny]. We need to punish and prosecute them,” he added. “I consider that the creation of Yevgeny Prigozhin’s image as a people’s hero was all done by media fed by Yevgeny Prigozhin,” Petrov also said, referring to media outlets financed by Prigozhin. “After it [the mutiny] failed, they quickly closed and fled,” he said.    Washington, DC-based think tank, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said on Wednesday that the general director of Russia’s TASS news agency had been replaced in what Ukrainian officials said may indicate the Kremlin’s unhappiness with how the Wagner mutiny was reported. The Kremlin also continues to be concerned with security in the Russian capital following the Wagner mutiny as police in Moscow are now reportedly receiving training in the use of battlefield weapons, such as grenade throwing and light machine gun shooting, as well as “urban combat tactics”. “Such training indicates that the Kremlin is attempting to improve the ability of security forces in Moscow to defend the regime against potential future threats” in the aftermath of the Wagner rebellion, the ISW said.

"At least 4 killed in Russian missile attack on Lviv city, Ukraine",Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi says Russian missile hit a residential apartment building in the city.,"At least four people have been killed and more than 30 injured in a Russian missile attack on a residential apartment block in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, one of the largest attacks on the city’s civilian infrastructure since the start of Russia’s invasion last year, officials said. Ukraine’s Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko reported on Thursday that at least four people were killed in the attack which destroyed the third and fourth floors of an apartment building. Rescuers were working to reach those still trapped under rubble, he said. Ukraine’s Interior Ministry later updated the number of injured to 32, including one child. The emergency services said they had managed to rescue seven people from the destroyed building and evacuated 64 others. “This is the biggest attack on Lviv’s civilian infrastructure since the beginning” of Russia’s invasion, Lviv’s Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said on his Telegram channel, adding that rescuers were working to “clear debris and pull out all the dead” from the building. Russia attacked Lviv with 10 Kalibr missiles launched from the Black Sea, Ukraine’s air force said, adding that seven of the 10 missiles were shot down. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy took to social media early on Thursday to condemn the attack, and to offer his condolences to the relatives of those killed in Lviv as well as promise a “strong” response “to the enemy”. Zelenskyy’s post on Twitter featured a video which showed the extent of damage to a building in Lviv. Lviv. Consequences of the night attack by Russian terrorists. Unfortunately, there are wounded and dead. My condolences to the relatives! There will definitely be a response to the enemy. A strong one.pic.twitter.com/9yl1MT6Eu4 — Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa)July 6, 2023  Lviv’s regional Governor Maksym Kozytskyi also posted a 13-second video clip showing a wide, curving, four-storey apartment building with parts of the upper floors missing or in rubble. Kozytskyi said earlier that a critical infrastructure facility had been damaged, without providing further details. The reports ofdamage and civilian deaths in Lvivfollowed air raid alerts across Ukraine in the early hours of Thursday morning and reports of cruise missiles entering Ukrainian airspace. Sadovyi, the city’s mayor, had reported a series of explosions in his city. “Friends, we will not talk about the consequences of shelling now,” he said on his Telegram channel earlier. “All the city services are doing their work,” he said.    Russia has launched waves of drone and missile attacks across Ukraine since its invasion in February 2022, though the Lviv region – which is located hundreds of kilometres from the front lines – had been largely peaceful. In late June,Lviv was hit in an extensive Russian drone assaultthat had hit Kyiv and other cities. Ukraine has recently bolstered its air defence systems with Western-supplied weapons and the number of Russian missiles and drones breaking through has diminished. But the spokesperson for Ukraine’s air forces, Yuriy Ignat, recently said that newly supplied air defence systems were still insufficient to cover the entire country.

UN wants more access to Ukraine nuclear plant amid sabotage warnings,International Atomic Energy Agency seeks access to rooftop of Zaporizhzhia reactors to check for presence of explosives.,"The United Nations’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has called for increased access to the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine asMoscow and Kyiv accused each other of planning acts of sabotageat what is Europe’s largest nuclear power facility. The IAEA said on Wednesday that it was seekingadditional access to the Zaporizhzhia plantto “confirm the absence of mines or explosives at the site”. “With military tension and activities increasing in the region where this major nuclear power plant is located, our experts must be able to verify the facts on the ground,” IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said in a statement on Wednesday. Recent inspections at the siteby IAEA staff had not found “any visible indications of mines or explosives”, but additional access “would help clarify the current situation at the site” at a time when “unconfirmed allegations and counter allegations” were circulating, Grossi said. “In particular, access to the rooftops of reactor units 3 and 4 is essential, as well as access to parts of the turbine halls and some parts of the cooling system at the plant,” the IAEA chief said in the statement. IAEA experts at 🇺🇦's#Zaporizhzhyanuclear power plant have inspected parts of the facility – including sections of the perimeter of the large cooling pond – so far without observing any visible signs of mines or explosives, but additional access is neededhttps://t.co/UlWeMsaFdUpic.twitter.com/Fpq124tDap — IAEA – International Atomic Energy Agency ⚛️ (@iaeaorg)July 5, 2023  Ukraine and Russia accused each other Wednesday ofplanning to attack the Zaporizhzhia plant, though neither side provided evidence to support their claims of an imminent threat to the facility, which has been under Russian control since the beginning of March 2022, shortly after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Citing intelligence reports, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy alleged on Tuesday night that Russian forces had placed “objects resembling explosives” on top of several of the plant’s power units to “simulate” an attack from the outside. “Their detonation should not damage power units but may create a picture of shelling from Ukraine,” according to a statement from the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces.    On Wednesday evening,Zelenskyy once again accused Russia of planning to stage an incidentat the nuclear plant similar to the destruction last month of the Nova Kakhovka dam in Ukraine’s southern Kherson region. “Now they have also mined this nuclear power plant. And this is a fact,” Zelenskyy said in a video address to university students and staff in Argentina. “Why? Moscow is considering various scenarios, including those similar to the man-made disaster at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant … [that is], for cynical military purposes. But we should not even think about which scenario is the most likely. We should only think about how to prevent any disastrous scenario,” he said.    In Russia,authorities claimed Kyiv was also plotting an act of “sabotage” at Zaporizhzhia. “The situation is quite tense because the threat of sabotage from the Kyiv regime is really high – sabotage that could have catastrophic consequences,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday. “The Kyiv regime has repeatedly demonstrated its readiness not to rule anything out,” he said. Peskov said Russia was pursuing “all measures” to counter the alleged Ukrainian threat. Renat Karchaa, an adviser to Russia’s state nuclear company Rosenergoatom, which controls the Zaporizhzhia plant, said there was “no basis” for Zelenskyy’s claims of a plot by Moscow to simulate an explosion at the facility. “Why would we need explosives there? This is nonsense” aimed at “maintaining tension”, Karchaa said on Wednesday, according to the Interfax news agency. Karchaa had alleged in televised remarks on Tuesday that Ukraine’s military was planning to strike the plant overnight with ammunition laced with nuclear waste, but no such attack occurred.    Regular power outages resulting from shelling around the Zaporizhzhia plant made it impossible to operate the site safely, and its six reactors have been shut down since September to minimise the threat of a disaster. Over the last year, the IAEA has repeatedly expressed alarm over the possibility of a radiation catastrophe like the one at Chornobyl after a reactor exploded in 1986. Ukraine has claimed in recent weeks that Moscow might try to cause a deliberate leak at the nuclear plant to derail Kyiv’s ongoing counteroffensive in the surrounding Zaporizhia region. Al Jazeera’s Rob McBride, reporting from Kyiv, said that Ukraine has warned that Russia may be planning “a so-called false flag” operation by setting off explosives on the roof of the Zaporizhzhia plant to make it appear as though Ukrainian forces had attacked the site. The Kremlin, on the other hand, has accused Kyiv of planning to strike the nuclear facility with long-range precision weapons. And both sides have compared the situation at Zaporizhzhia with the destruction last month of the Nova Kakhovka dam, for which each blames the other.    “Moscow says the destruction of the dam shows what Kyiv is capable of,” McBride said. “Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says the failure of the international community to punish Russia for destroying the dam has emboldened it now to attack the nuclear plant,” he said. Amid the heightened tensions at Zaporizhzhia, people living in the vicinity of the plant have beenwarned by Ukraine’s health ministry to be ready to evacuatein case of a major radiation leak, McBride added. Last week, Ukrainian emergency workers held a drill to prepare for a potential release of radiation from the plant. In case of a nuclear disaster at the plant, approximately 300,000 people would be evacuated from the areas closest to the facility, according to the country’s emergency services. Ukrainian officials have said the shut-down reactors are protected by thick concrete containment domes, and experts have said that the plant’s design allows it to withstand barrages. Ukraine’s health ministry on Tuesday released guidelines in the event of an emergency and urged residents to pack emergency bags, containing supplies like face masks and food, wrapped in plastic. “If authorities have officially announced a radiation emergency, stay indoors or get out as soon as possible,” the ministry said in a statement. “Stay tuned for further announcements and follow the instructions.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/6/un-wants-more-access-to-ukraine-nuclear-plant-amid-sabotage-warnings

Biden ‘anxiously looking forward’ to Sweden joining NATO,US president reiterates support for Sweden’s NATO application as he meets the country’s prime minister at White House.,"Washington, DC –United States President Joe Biden has said he is “anxiously looking forward” to Swedenjoining NATOas he hosted the northern European country’s Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson. The White House also renewed calls for Turkey to approve Sweden’s bid to join the alliance on Wednesday in advance of a NATO summit in Lithuania next week. “I want to reiterate: The United States fully, fully, fully supports Sweden’s membership in NATO. The bottom line is simple – Sweden is going to make our alliance stronger,” Biden told reporters before the meeting. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre also urged Sweden’s admission into NATO “as soon as possible”. “Sweden is a strong, capable defence partner that shares NATO’s values and will strengthen the alliance and contribute to European security,” Jean-Pierre said on Wednesday as the two leaders held talks in Washington, DC. Sweden and neighbouring Finland started seekingNATO membershiplast year after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The US-led alliance has acollective defencepact, meaning an attack on one member is considered an attack on all.    On Wednesday, Kristersson thanked Biden for his “strong support” for Sweden’s NATO bid. “We do seek common protection, but we also do think that we have things to contribute with to be a security provider for the whole of NATO,” he said. NATO members need to unanimously agree to allow new countries into the bloc. Finlandofficially joinedthe alliance in April, but Sweden’s application is still pending. Hungary and Turkey have not ratified Sweden’s accession, but Ankara is seen as the main hurdle. Turkey has accused Sweden of providing a safe haven to members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which it considers a “terrorist” group. In June of last year, Turkey, Sweden and Finland signed a so-called trilateral memorandum to address Ankara’s grievances about banned armed groups. Turkey, however, has said that Sweden has not fulfilled all of its commitments in the agreement. Further complicating the issue are the twoQuran-burning protestsby far-right activists during demonstrations in Sweden this year that have angered Turkey. The Swedish government has condemned the desecration of Islam’s holy book but allowed the demonstrations to proceed – with the country’s courts allowing them as free speech. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan criticised a Quran-burning protestlast month. “Turning a blind eye to such atrocious acts is to be complicit,” he said on Twitter. Earlier this week, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also signalled that Ankara is sticking to its position against Stockholm. “We have made it clear that the determined fight against terrorist organisations and Islamophobia are our red line,” he said.    For its part, Washington has rejected the burning of the Quran while calling on Turkey to approve Sweden’s NATO bid. “The burning of religious texts is disrespectful and hurtful, and what might be legal is certainly not necessarily appropriate,” US Department of State spokesperson Vedant Patel said in June. Meanwhile, US officials have been calling on Turkey to lift its opposition to Sweden’s NATO bid. Kristersson’s visit to the White House as come weeks after he met Secretary of StateAntony Blinkenin Sweden. At that time, Blinken said he hoped Sweden’s NATO accession would be finalised before the Lithuania summit, which is set to start on July 11.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/5/biden-anxiously-looking-forward-to-sweden-joining-nato
"‘Steady, deliberate’: Ukrainian advance meets Russian resistance",Ukraine says its counterattack has been successful so far given its lack of air power and limited resources.,"Just over a month into its counteroffensive, Ukraine continues to make incremental advances and claims to be eroding the ability of invading Russian forces to fight back. Ukrainian forces recaptured 28.4 square kilometres (11 square miles) of territory in the previous week, bringing the counteroffensive’s total gains to 158sq km (61sq miles), said Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar. The Ukrainian army was “advancing steadily, deliberately working its way through very difficult minefields … 500 metres a day, 1,000 metres a day, 2,000 metres a day, that kind of thing,” Chairman of the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley told the National Press Club in Washington on June 30. He estimated the counteroffensive could take as many as 10 weeks. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said his forces destroyed 2,500 pieces of Ukrainian equipment since the counteroffensive began on June 4. “Overall, neither of the enemy’s goals in either direction has been met,” said Shoigu during a speech at the defence ministry. “This confirms the prowess of Russian warriors and the obviously inflated hopes for the acclaimed Western armaments.” Al Jazeera could not verify either Russian or Ukrainian figures, but Ukrainian officials insisted that territorial gains were not the priority at this stage. Ukraine’s Secretary of the National Security and Defence Council Oleksiy Danilov described “the number one task” of the armed forces as “the maximum destruction of manpower, equipment, fuel depots, armoured vehicles, command posts, artillery, and air defence forces of the Russian army”. These are softening operations in advance of a major attack, say military experts, and they reflect the tactics Ukraine employed ahead of major advances in September last year. Ukrainian commander of the armed forces Valery Zaluzhny told the Washington Post he was “pissed off” by those who complained about the slow pace of the counteroffensive. “This is not a show,” Zaluzhny said. “It’s not a show the whole world is watching and betting on or anything. Every day, every metre is given by blood.” The counteroffensive would be both faster and more effective if it had been accompanied by mastery of the air, he said, referring to Western allies’ reluctance to provide F-16 planes in a timely manner. He also said his forces were outgunned – sometimes 10 to 1 – because of ammunition shortages. Throughout the 71st week of the war, the main action was concentrated in specific battles. On the eastern front, Russia and Ukraine fought in the areas of Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Marinka, all in the Donetsk region. On the southern front, Ukraine claimed to be making progress in at least two areas – south of Orikhiv, in western Zaporizhzhia and on the Zaporizhzhia-Donetsk administrative border.  Bakhmut remained of special importance to both sides. Russia occupied most of the town in early June after fighting for it for a year. Ukraine has since been engaged in an attempt to retake the city by flanking it to the north and south. On June 28, Ukraine’s general staff said its forces seized “a strategic initiative and are leading a broad offensive action” forcing Russians out of captured positions. Maliar reported advances of 1,200 metres towards Klishchiivka and 1,500 metres towards Kurdyumivka, both south of Bakhmut. She said Ukrainian troops still controlled the southwestern outskirts of Bakhmut, but the heaviest fighting was now around the city. “The offensive is proceeding in several directions and our troops are advancing everywhere,” she said during a telethon. Russia responded by moving elite troops to Bakhmut. Ukraine’s eastern forces spokesman Colonel Serhiy Cherevatyi said a Russian airborne forces regiment had been transferred to Bakhmut from Lyman. Ukraine’s general staff said it was still “kicking out” Russian forces from their positions around Bakhmut on July 3. “The opponent is doing crazy resistance and suffers huge losses. Some tough fighting going on here,” it said. Cherevatyi said of the 180,000 Russian troops on the eastern front, the best 50,000 were defending Bakhmut armed with more than 300 tanks, 330 artillery pieces, and 140 multiple-launch rocket systems. “For them, the city is not only of military importance, but also of information and propaganda,” he said. Russia’s defence ministry said it repelled all Ukrainian attacks on the eastern front near Bakhmut and Lyman. “Russian sources are increasingly claiming that Ukrainian forces are currently conducting assaults in southern Ukraine with smaller infantry groups and fewer armoured vehicles than during earlier counteroffensive operations,” wrote the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a think-tank. One source cited described Ukrainian tactics: “Now the enemy is acting in relays, using small assault groups in waves. As soon as one unit runs out of steam, a new unit takes its place.” ISW said the reporting suggests Ukrainian forces are not currently attempting large-scale operations that would result in rapid territorial advances. “Ukrainian officials have routinely indicated that Ukrainian forces have yet to commit a substantial portion of their forces to counteroffensive operations, and have yet to launch the main phase of the counteroffensive,” it said. Ukraine started its counteroffensive with mechanised units, but appeared to have returned to guerrilla tactics it employed early in the war after sustaining highly publicised losses of tanks and armoured fighting vehicles in June. Russian drones were able to ferret out armoured columns and guide artillery strikes against them. However, those guerrilla tactics were not always successful. Russian occupation governor of Kherson Vladimir Saldo said a few dozen Ukrainian troops had been cleared from the eastern side of the Antonivsky Bridge in a special forces operation. He said there were no further Ukraine troops the left bank of the Dnipro river. “The destruction of the [Ukrainian] units that landed … in the Antonovsky bridge area has been completed,” said the Russian defence ministry on July 3. Ukraine indirectly confirmed increased Russian activity on the Dnipro. Russian forces were stepping up artillery attacks and air strikes against the right bank of the Dnipro from the Kinburn Spit, said Natalia Humeniuk, spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern forces. The aim was to distract Ukraine’s forces from efforts to cross the river to the left bank. Humeniuk said Russian forces returned to positions they retreated from after the Nova Kakhovka Dam breach flooded them, and were launching reconnaissance patrols across the river to spy on Ukrainian activities. In just one day, she said, Ukrainian forces had sunk two boats with 66 Russian troops in the Mykolaiv area.  Ukraine has warned for weeks that Russia is preparing to create a nuclear contamination incident at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, where it maintains about 5,000 troops. “According to operational information, outside objects resembling explosive devices were placed on the outer roofs of the third and fourth power units of the [power plant],” the general staff said. The goal of this sabotage was not necessarily to damage the reactors, but to make it look as if Ukraine had shelled the plant, it said. “It is important that all Ukrainians are morally prepared for the detonation of the [facility], as well as trained in how to act in any situation. We simply have no other way out,” said Maliar. Russia, meanwhile, accused Ukraine of planning to attack the nuclear plant. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov raised the specter of a potentially “catastrophic” provocation by the Ukrainian army at the facility, which is Europe’s largest. “The situation is quite tense. There is a great threat of sabotage by the Kyiv regime, which can be catastrophic in its consequences,” Peskov said.

Russian reporter returns to Moscow after Chechnya attack,Russian journalist and her lawyer were severely beaten and threatened with weapons in Chechnya.,"An award-winning Russian investigative journalist was flown back to Moscow after being attacked in Chechnya and hospitalised with injuries. Media advocates and rights groups voiced concern afterYelena Milashinasaid she was beaten and held at gunpoint with her lawyer during a work trip to the Chechen capital Grozny in southern Russia. “Milashina is in Moscow in hospital. Her condition is, frankly, difficult. She was really severely beaten, beaten with a stick,” said Dmitry Muratov, editor of her paper, Novaya Gazeta. Alexey Venediktov, former editor-in-chief of the disbanded Ekho Moskvy radio station, posted photos on Telegram showing Milashina and her lawyer, Alexander Nemov, in a small plane together flying back to Moscow. Muratov said Milashina’s fingers had been broken after the attackers demanded access to her phone. The journalist also had her head shaved and green dye poured on her. It remains unclear who the assailants were. Milashina, 45, has won widespread acclaim for her investigative reporting, which included exposing the alleged torture and killings of gay people in Chechnya and other abuses by feared Chechen paramilitary forces. In a video interview, the journalist said 10 to 15 attackers beat her with plastic pipes. Milashina said authorities routinely used such pipes to strike detainees in Chechnya, and she had written about the practice before. She described how the assailants stopped the pair while driving. “They threw the driver out of the car, got in, bent our heads down, tied my hands, forced me down to my knees and put a gun to my head,” Milashina said. In a different interview with the Russian rights group Team Against Torture, she said the attack was linked to her work with Nemov, adding the assailants told the lawyer: “You are defending too many people here. There is no need to defend anyone here.” On Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman said it would take time for a full investigation into the attack to be conducted. “Let’s just wait. The reactions have all been voiced and now all actions are being taken,” Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov said those responsible for Tuesday’s violence should be identified. For years, Milashina has exposed human rights violations in Chechnya and has faced threats, intimidation, and attacks. In 2020, a dozen people beat her and another lawyer in a hotel lobby. Since 2000, Novaya Gazeta has seen six of its journalists and contributors killed, including investigative reporterAnna Politkovskayawho was shot dead in Moscow.

Ukraine says ‘particularly fruitful’ few days in counteroffensive,Officials acknowledge stiff resistance from Russian forces as they make incremental advances in east and south.,"A Ukrainian counteroffensive against Russian forces has been “particularly fruitful” in recent days, according to a senior security official. The comments by Oleksiy Danilov, who heads Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, were Kyiv’s latest positive assessment of the month-old counterattack, although Moscow has not acknowledged advances by Ukraine. Ukraine’s Deputy Defence MinisterHanna Maliaralso reported gains around the ruined eastern city of Bakhmut amid fierce Russian resistance. Russian forces captured the city in May after 10 months of fighting. “At this stage of active hostilities, Ukraine’s Defense Forces are fulfilling the number one task – the maximum destruction of manpower, equipment, fuel depots, military vehicles, command posts, artillery and air defense forces of the Russian army,” Danilov wrote on Twitter. “The last few days have been particularly fruitful,” he said, without providing any details from the battlefield. The Ukrainians are in the early stages of their campaign to take back land occupied by the Russians since they launched theirfull-scale invasion in February 2022, and are up against minefields, anti-tank ditches and other obstacles, as well as layered defensive lines reportedly up to 20 kilometres (12 miles) deep in some places. In its latest assessment, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington, DC-based think tank, said Danilov’s comments appeared to underline an “ongoing campaign to attrit Russian manpower and assets over attempting to conduct massive sweeping mechanized maneuvers to regain large swaths of territory rapidly”. Earlier, Maliar said on July 3 Ukraine had liberated about 37.4sq km (14.4sq miles) of territory in eastern and southern Ukraine over the previous week. “The current pace of Ukrainian operations is not indicative of a stalemate or evidence that Ukraine cannot retake large areas,” ISW said. Gains were reported in the south where Valeriy Shershen, spokesperson for the Tavria, or southern military command, said Ukrainian troops had advanced by up to 2km (1.2 miles) in the Berdyansk direction against fierce Russian resistance.    In the areas outside Bakhmut, Maliar said, troops had pushed forward in the south but there was no progress in the city’s north where fighting was intense. “… Our forces are encountering serious resistance,” she told national television. “The enemy is pouring in all its forces to stop in the south and in the east.” Russian forces, she said, were also making advances further north, near Lyman and in Svatove, where Russian troops have recently been particularly active. In Makiivka, a town in the Russian-controlled part of the eastern Donetsk region, Ukraine’s military had destroyed a formation of Russian forces. Russia-installed officials said one civilian died and 36 others were injured in the attack. Russia’s defence ministry spokesperson Lieutenant General Igor Konashenkov, meanwhile, said Russian troops repelled 10 Ukrainian attacks in the direction of Donetsk in the previous 24 hours, according to state news agency TASS. He said dozens of Ukrainian soldiers were injured or killed and key equipment including HIMARS systems destroyed. Russia also claimed to have repelled attacks near Lyman and disrupted Ukrainian operations in the Zaporizhia region, where Ukraine says its forces have captured a cluster of villages. Each side has said the other is suffering heavy losses, and it is not possible to verify the front-line accounts.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/5/ukraine-says-particularly-fruitful-few-days-in-counteroffensive
At least 43 hurt after Russian attack on small Ukrainian town,"Twelve children, including two babies, among the injured as residents of Pervomaiskyi in northeast express shock at events.","Ukrainian officials said at least 43 people, including 12 children, were injured after a Russian attack on the small town of Pervomaiskyi in the northeastern Kharkiv region. Television footage showed black smoke billowing from a block of tall flats with cars in flames nearby, while Andriy Yermak, the head of Kyiv’s presidential office, shared images from the town of burned and destroyed cars. Regional governor Oleh Syniehubov said the attack happened at about 1.35pm Kyiv time (10:35 GMT) on Tuesday. Pervomaiskyi is home to about 28,000 people and is relatively far from the front lines. “I only remember that when the explosion sounded, we were thrown up into the air,” a local, who gave her name only as Alla, said on the street as she hugged her granddaughter. “Then we continued walking, we saw blown out windows everywhere, I saw cars on fire. I just can’t get a grip of myself, my legs are still shaking.” Syniehubov said the youngest of the injured was a three-month-old baby. The child’s condition was not immediately clear. Another baby was also hurt. Both were among dozens taken to hospital. Some said the attack was linked to a military funeral that was taking place in the town. Major Maksym Zhorin, a former commander of a fighting unit known as theAzov battalionthat is now part of the Ukrainian army, said about 100 people had gathered for the funeral of Oleh Fadeenko, a soldier with the call-sign Baby who he said had been killed in fighting near Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine. “They targeted the site where the ceremony was taking place,” Zhorin said on the Telegram messaging app. Russia did not immediately comment on the attack.

The NATO chief, a former prime minister of Norway, has led the alliance since 2014. His current term in office was due to expire on October 1. He has already had his tenure extended three previous times. The news of his latest extension comes a week before the alliance’s annual summit, which is due to take place in Vilnius, Lithuania, this year. Stoltenberg welcomed the NATO members’ decision in a tweet, writing, “The transatlantic bond between Europe & North America has ensured our freedom & security for nearly 75 years, and in a more dangerous world, our Alliance is more important than ever.” Honoured by#NATOAllies' decision to extend my term as Secretary General until 1 October 2024.

Putin reassures Asian nations of stability after Wagner mutiny,"During a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation meeting, the president casts Russian society as united after the rebellion.","Russian President Vladimir Putin has assured leaders in Asia that his country is stable and united despite a brief mutiny instigated by the Wagner Group, which sent shock waves across the world. “The Russian people are consolidated as never before,” Putin told a virtual meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) on Tuesday. The Eurasian group includes China and India and focuses on international security, defence, and economic and political policy. “Russian political circles and the whole of society clearly demonstrated their unity and elevated sense of responsibility for the fate of the fatherland when they responded as a united front against an attempted armed mutiny,” Putin added. Putin thanked members of the SCO, who he said had backed his efforts “to protect the constitutional order, the lives and security of citizens”. He told them that Russia would stand up against Western pressure, sanctions and “provocations” imposed over what Moscow calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine. The president added that he seeks to boost economic ties with members of the SCO. Russia views countries such as China, India and Iran – the newest member of the SCO – as key partners in confronting the United States and resisting what it portrays as Washington’s attempts to dictate the world order. Last month,Wagner Group boss Yevgeny Prigozhin seizedthe city of Rostov-on-Don and marched towards Moscow, demanding the removal of Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu. Prigozhin’s uprising ended hours after it began within 200km (124 miles) of Moscow. He struck a deal with the Kremlin to end the operation with a pact brokered by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. Prigozhin, now in exile in Belarus, later released an audio statement saying the march was not meant to overthrow the government. The future of Wagner’s assets and subsidiaries remains uncertain, but some of the group’s businesses have shut down. After the short-lived mutiny, Western leaders said the revolt had displayed vulnerabilities in Russia’s security and defence policies. Iran and Chinadownplayedthe unexpected mutiny and called it an “internal affair”.   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/4/putin-reassures-asian-allies-of-stability-after-wagner-mutiny
"Health fears for jailed, emaciated ex-Georgia leader Saakashvili",Supporters and family fear that former Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili has been poisoned in prison after losing about 60kgs in weight.,"Georgia’s imprisoned former presidentMikheil Saakashviliappeared frail and severely emaciated via video link at a court hearing considering an abuse-of-power case against him. Saakashvili and his supporters claim he has been poisoned while imprisoned and that henow weighs about 60kg(132 lbs), half of what he weighed when he was arrested in October 2021. From a private clinic where he was being held, he told the court on Monday that despite his poor health, he was “spiritually fit and determined to serve the country”, according to local news site Agenda. Saakashvili, 55, lifted his shirt to show his ribs protruding from his chest, a hollow abdomen and skin clinging tightly to his bones. “A totally innocent man is being kept in custody,” he said in coverage carried live on several independent TV channels. “I did not commit any crime,” he said. The former president is being held at a civilian hospital, where he was transferred last year after staging a 50-day hunger strike to protest his detention. “Putting me in jail will not break me. I am going to be actively involved in Georgian politics,” he said.    Saakashvili, who served as Georgia’s president from 2004-13 and led the so-called Rose Revolution protests that drove the previous president out of office, left for Ukraine after the end of his second term. He holds Ukrainian citizenship and was the governor of the Odesa region in 2015-16. After leaving Georgia, Saakashvili was convicted in absentia for abuse of power and sentenced to six years in prison. He wasarrested in October 2021after returning to Georgia to try to bolster opposition forces before nationwide municipal elections. The former president is now on trial on charges of “abuse of office” connected to the violent dispersal of an opposition rally in 2007. Doctors have said Saakashvili risks dying from conditions he developed while in custody, though Georgian authorities say he is being given adequate medical care. His brother, David Saakashvili, said the ex-president was continuing to lose weight, was at risk of dying and might have been poisoned. The family says he is not receiving proper medical treatment.    The European Union and United States have urged Georgia to ensure Saakashvili is provided medical treatment and that his rights are protected. Amnesty International has branded his treatment as “apparent political revenge”. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday called forGeorgia to send Saakashvili to Ukrainefor medical treatment and said the Georgian ambassador would be called to the foreign ministry and encouraged to return to Georgia within two days for consultations with his government. In his daily video message on Monday evening, Zelenskyy accused Moscow of being behind the ex-leader poor treatment in prison and  called on the international community not to ignore Saakashvili but to “save this man”. “Ukraine has repeatedly called on the Georgian authorities to stop this demonstrative execution. Both we and our partners have offered various options to save Mykhailo,” he said. Right now, Russia is killing Ukrainian citizen Mykhailo Saakashvili at the hands of the Georgian authorities. We have repeatedly called on the official Tbilisi to stop this abuse and agree on Saakashvili's return to Ukraine.

Zelenskyy has repeatedly claimed that Saakashvili is being slowly killed in Georgian custody, describing it as a de facto public execution. Georgia, which had received significant US support under Saakashvili, lost a brief war against Russia in 2008, including control of its breakaway territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.

Ambassador Lynne Tracy met with Gershkovich at Lefortovo Prison in the Russian capital, Moscow, a State Department spokesperson said on Monday. Tracylast visitedthe detained journalist on April 17. “Ambassador Tracy reports that Mr Gershkovich is in good health and remains strong, despite his circumstances,” the spokesperson said. “We expect Russian authorities to provide continued consular access.” Russia arrested Gershkovich in late March in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg, accusing him of trying to obtain classified information about a Russian arms factory.Gershkovich’s legal team andhis supportershave dismissed the charges as baseless.    “Evan is a member of the free press who right up until he was arrested was engaged in newsgathering,” The Wall Street Journal previously said. “Any suggestions otherwise are false.” In April, the US State Department formally designated Gershkovich as “wrongfully detained” and called on Russia to release him immediately. But on June 22, aRussian judge rejectedan application for Gershkovich, 31, to be released from prison while awaiting trial. After that decision, Tracy – the US ambassador – accused Moscow of conducting “hostage diplomacy”. US officials have been calling on Russia to grant consular access to Gershkovich since his arrest, accusing the Russian authorities of violating international law by not allowing American diplomats to contact him. “This week marks 100 days that press freedom supporters & colleagues have pushed for the release of [Wall Street Journal] reporter Evan Gershkovich, unjustly imprisoned in Russia,” the Committee to Protect Journalists advocacy group tweeted on Monday. “Let’s stand together on this chilling milestone and demand Evan’s immediate release.” 🚨This week marks 100 days that press freedom supporters & colleagues have pushed for the release of@WSJreporter Evan Gershkovich, unjustly imprisoned in Russia.

Russia claims to have foiled an assassination attempt in Crimea,"Moscow says Ukraine ordered the alleged attack on Sergey Aksyonov, the Russian-installed head of the annexed peninsula.","Russia has claimed to have thwarted a Ukrainian assassination attempt on Sergey Aksyonov, the Russian-installed head of Crimea. The Federal Security Service (FSB) said in a statement on Monday that it had arrested a Russian national recruited as an assassin by Ukraine’s SBU intelligence agency, alleging the suspect had undergone explosives, reconnaissance and sabotage training in Ukraine. There was no immediate comment from Ukraine on the Russian allegation. It came amid Russian media reports that security has been stepped up in Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, and that additional security checks are being made on people wanting to cross a bridge from Russia’s southern Krasnodar region into Crimea. The FSB statement added that the plan had been to blow up Aksyonov’s car, but the agent was detained as he tried to retrieve an explosive device from a hiding place. The agency did not name the man it detained, but said he was in his mid-30s and had entered Crimea in June. He was being investigated on suspicion of “attempting to commit a terrorist act” and “illegally possessing explosives”. Aksyonov thanked the FSB for stopping what he called an attempt on the lives of the “Republic of Crimea’s leadership” and said he was sure the individuals who ordered the foiled attack would be found and punished. Ukraine has pledged to retake full control of Crimea and areas in the east and south of the country that Russia claims to have annexed since launching its invasion in February 2022. Kyiv has repeatedly said it will not negotiate any peace agreement until every Russian soldier has been removed from Ukrainian territory.

Viktor Bout, once dubbed “The merchant of death”, served 10 years of a 25-year sentence in US prisons on arms dealing charges until his release last December under theexchange with Griner, an Olympic gold medallist. RIA cited an official in the ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic Party of Russia’s (LDPR) local organisation as saying that Bout had been nominated as a candidate for the legislative assembly of the Ulyanovsk region in central Russia. Bout was arrested by US agents during a sting in Thailand in 2008. The US Department of Justice described him as one of the world’s most prolific arms dealers, charges Bout has always denied. Griner was sentenced in 2022 in Russia to nine years in a penal colony for possessing vape cartridges containing cannabis oil – which is banned in Russia – after a judicial process Washington labelled as a sham. Griner has since resumed her sports career. Bout publicly joined the LDPR following his return to Russia. Despite its name, the LDPR holds far-right, ultra-nationalist views and strongly supports President Vladimir Putin’sinvasion of Ukraine. The LDPR has previously provided a home to Andrei Lugovoi, who iswanted in the United Kingdomfor the 2006 murder of ex-KGB officer and Putin critic Alexander Litvinenko. Lugovoi has served as an LDPR member of Russia’s national parliament since 2007.

"‘Everywhere, things are hot’: Ukraine battles Russian onslaught",Mixed picture for Kyiv’s forces as Russia fights to hold onto Ukrainian territory captured in its 16-months-old invasion.,"Kyiv’s forces are fighting a fierce onslaught by Russian troops in parts of northeastern Ukraine, even as they make advances in the area around Bakhmut and in the south, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister has said, describing the situation as “complicated”. Hanna Maliar said that Russian troops were advancing near Avdiivka, Marinka, Lyman and Svatove. “Fierce fighting is going on everywhere,” Maliar wrote on social media on Sunday, adding: “The situation is quite complicated”. Russian accounts of the front-line fighting reported success in containing Ukrainian troops in the northeast and said its forces had pushed back Ukrainian attacks near villages ringing Bakhmut and in areas further south, particularly the strategic hilltop town of Vuhlear. Ukraine’s military has been engaged in a counteroffensive to recapture areas of the east and south seized by Russia since it began itsfull-scale invasion in February 2022. Initial Ukrainian advances have focused ontaking back clusters of villagesin the south, but have so far failed to produce a major breakthrough. Maliar said Ukrainian troops were advancing with “partial success” on the southern flank of Bakhmut in the east and near Berdyansk and Melitopol in the south. In the south, she said Ukrainian forces faced “intense enemy resistance, remote mining, deploying of reserves” and were only advancing “gradually”. “Everywhere, things are hot,” she said. General Oleksander Tarnavskiy, responsible for the southern front, said Ukrainian forces were “systematically destroying the enemy” and reported the deaths of several hundred Russian forces over the last 24 hours. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Ukraine’s commander-in-chief, General Valery Zaluzhniy, have reported steady, if slow, advances in the campaign. The president has acknowledged the relatively limited progress but said the fight is “not a Hollywood movie” with instant success. Ukraine has also had to endure persistent Russian air attacks on cities, although the Kremlin denies attacking civilian targets. On Sunday, Ukrainian writer Victoria Amelina died from injuries sustained when aRussian missile hit a busy pizza restaurantin the eastern city of Kramatorsk last week. The attack killed 12 people, some of them children, and injured dozens. Amelina’s death raises the death toll to 13. “With our greatest pain, we inform you that Ukrainian writer Victoria Amelina passed away on July 1st in Mechnikov Hospital in Dnipro,” PEN Ukraine said in a statement on its Facebook page. The 37-year-old, who was also a war crimes investigator, had been in the city with a delegation of Colombian journalists and writers, PEN said. Her novel “Dom’s Dream Kingdom” was published in 2017 and shortlisted for the UNESCO City of Literature Prize and the European Union Prize for Literature, according to PEN. Her poems, prose and essays have been translated into English, German, Polish and other languages. Since 2022, she had been working to document Russian war crimes since the invasion and advocate for accountability, PEN said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/3/everywhere-things-are-hot-ukraine-battles-russian-onslaught

Russia attacks Ukraine’s Kyiv as fierce battles rage in Donetsk,Russia launches first overnight drone attack on Kyiv in 12 days as Ukrainian officials report more civilian casualties in the front-line Donetsk region.,"Russia has launched an overnight drone attack on Kyiv after a 12-day break, according to a senior Ukrainian official, with air defence systems preliminarily destroying all targets on their approach. “Another enemy attack on Kyiv,” Serhiy Popko, a colonel general who heads Kyiv’s military administration, said in a post on the Telegram channel early on Sunday. “At this moment, there is no information about possible casualties or damage,” he said. The Reuters news agency reported blasts resembling the sound of air defence systems hitting targets in Kyiv. The Ukrainian capital and a number of central and eastern Ukrainian regions were under air raid alerts for about an hour after 2am local time (23:00 GMT). There was no immediate information about the scale of the attack. It came a day after Ukrainian officials reported more civilian casualties from Russian shelling in the country’s east and south.    In the eastern front-line Donetsk region, at least three civilians were killed and 17 wounded on Friday and overnight on Saturday, according to Governor Pavlo Kyrylenko. The Ukrainian General Staff reported that fierce clashes continued in three areas in Donetsk where it said Russia has massed troops and attempted to advance. It named the outskirts of three cities – Bakhmut, Lyman and Marinka – as front-line hot spots. In Ukraine’s southern Kherson region, five people including a child were wounded on Friday as well as in overnight attacks, according to Governor Oleksandr Prokudin. He said that Russian forces launched 82 artillery, drone, mortar shell and rocket attacks on the province, which is cut in two by a stretch of the 1,500km (930 mile) front line and still reeling from flooding unleashed by the collapse earlier this month of a major Dnipro River dam. Meanwhile, in Ukraine’s northwest, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a meeting of the country’s top military command and atomic energy officials at the Rivne nuclear power plant to discuss “the security of our northern regions and our measures to strengthen them”. Zelenkyy’s trip to Rivne was a rare journey for the Ukrainian leader to an area relatively far from the fighting. But it is near the border with Belarus, whereRussia’s Wagner mercenarieshave a deal to go after last week’s aborted uprising. Their leader Yevgeny Prigozhin was offered the option of resettling in Belarus, on Ukraine’s northern border. Separately, earlier on Saturday, Zelenskyy warned thata “serious threat”remained at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine’s south and said Russia was “technically ready” to provoke a localised explosion at the facility. He cited Ukrainian intelligence as the source of his information. Energoatom, Ukraine’s nuclear power authority, said on Friday it had conducted two days of exercises simulating the effects of an attack on the Zaporizhzhia plant. Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations, Vassily Nebenzia, issued a statement describing the Ukrainian allegations as “simply preposterous”. The facility, located near the city of Enerhodar in southern Ukraine, has been occupied by Russia since shortly after Moscow’s full-scale invasion in February 2022.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/2/russia-attacks-ukraines-kyiv-asfierce-battles-rage-in-donetsk
Ukraine commander irked by lack of arms promised for offensive,"Commander-in-chief of Ukraine’s armed forces Valery Zaluzhny says lack of fighter jets, artillery hampering offensive.","Ukraine’s counteroffensive planshave been slowed by a lack of adequate firepower, from modern fighter jets to ammunition for artillery guns, the country’s military commander-in-chief Valery Zaluzhny has said. Complaining about the slow deliveries of weapons promised by the West, Zaluzhny said in an interview with the Washington Post published on Friday that Kyiv’s Western supporters would not themselves launch an offensive without air superiority, but Ukraine is still awaiting F-16 fighters promised by its allies. “I do not need 120 planes. I’m not going to threaten the whole world. A very limited number would be enough,” he told the newspaper, saying that it “pi**es me off” when some in the West complain about the slow start and progress of the push against Russian forces. “They are needed. Because there is no other way. Because the enemy is using a different generation of aviation,” he said. He also complained he has a fraction of the artillery shells that Russia is firing.    Zaluzhny said he is in constant contact with Western partners, like Pentagon Joint Chiefs Chairman General Mark Milley, who arekeenly aware of Ukraine’s needs. “We have an agreement: 24/7, we’re in touch. So, sometimes I can call up and say, ‘If I don’t get 100,000 shells in a week, 1,000 people will die. Step into my shoes,’” he told the Washington Post. But Milley alone can’t make the decision, and the delays are deadly, Zaluzhny said. “It’s just that while that decision is being made, in the obvious situation, a lot of people die every day – a lot. Just because no decision has been made yet,” he said. “This is not a show,” he added. “It’s not a show the whole world is watching and betting on or anything. Every day, every metre is given by blood,” he said. The Washington, DC-based think tank, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), said on Friday that Zaluzhny responded to a question regarding military equipment losses in battles with Russian forces saying that Ukraine used its tanks and armoured cars in combat and did not save them up for “parades”. Zaluzhnyi also stated that#Ukrainianforces are continuing to use Western-provided armored vehicles and tanks in combat instead of saving them for “parades” when responding to a question about military equipment losses. 2/3 — ISW (@TheStudyofWar)July 1, 2023  Speaking later Friday in Washington, Milley said the United States and allies were working hard to supply Ukraine. “We are giving them as much help as humanly possible,” he said. Milley said the US was still in talks on providing Ukraine with F-16s and ATACMS, precision missiles that could more than double the range Ukraine forces are able to target. He acknowledged that some people had expressed impatience with the pace of the counteroffensive.    Milley told an audience at the National Press Club in Washington that Ukraine’s counteroffensive was “advancing steadily, deliberately working its way through very difficult minefields … 500 metres a day, 1,000 metres a day, 2,000 metres a day, that kind of thing”. He saidhe was unsurprised that progress was slowerthan some people and computers might have predicted. “War on paper and real war are different. In real war, real people die. Real people are on those front lines and real people are in those vehicles. Real bodies are being shredded by high explosives,” he said. “What I had said was this is going to take six, eight, 10 weeks, it’s going to be very difficult,” he added. “It’s going to be very long, and it’s going to be very, very bloody. And no one should have any illusions about any of that.” On Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his forces advanced “in all directions of our active operations”, while Hanna Maliar, the country’s deputy defence minister, said Ukraine’s military assessed progress as “going according to plan”, and that the counteroffensive should be evaluated by “a lot of different military tasks.” Zelenskyy also ordered security to be beefed up at his country’s border with Belarus, where fighters from the Russian mercenary group Wagner have been offered exile.    Zelenskyy said he had been informed on Friday of the situation in Belarusby the Ukrainian intelligence service GUR, foreign intelligence services and border guards. “By the decision of the Stavka [chief of staff], Commander-in-Chief [Valery] Zaluzhny and General [Serhiy] Nayev were instructed to strengthen the northern direction in order to guarantee peace. There are appropriate deadlines,” the Ukraine leader said in a video posted on Telegram. Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko has offered Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin refuge in his country after his fighters called off their mutiny to remove Russia’s military leadership. Western officials now fear that Wagner forces could destabilise Central and Eastern Europe from the soon-to-be bases in Belarus. The ISW said on Friday that sources report that Wagner will operate three large field camps in Belarus, and media reports have claimed that recruitment centres for the private mercenary force are still open in Russia and accepting new recruits.

Poland detains Russian ice-hockey player on suspicion of spying,Russia demands explanation after Polish justice minister says suspect was 14th member of spy ring to be arrested in NATO member country.,"Authorities in Poland have detained a Russian ice-hockey player who played for a top-tier Polish club on suspicion of spying. Zbigniew Ziobro, Poland’s justice minister and chief prosecutor, said on Friday the unnamed suspect was the 14th member of a spy network to be arrested by the country’s secret service. “Russian spies are falling one by one!” Ziobro said. “A spy who operated under the guise of an athlete was caught.” Later on Friday, Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Moscow “strongly protests” the arrest of a Russian citizen in Poland and demanded an explanation.    Poland’s National Prosecutor’s Office said the man, who was arrested on June 11, was accused of participating in an organised crime group and of acting on behalf of foreign intelligence against the interests of Poland. Such acts are punishable by up to 10 years in prison. The suspect regularly passed on information “about the results of his reconnaissance operations, for which he was regularly paid”, a statement released by the Office of Special Services in the Prime Minister’s Office. The statement said the group of spies was used by the Russians to conduct intelligence activities, including the monitoring of railways and the spreading of propaganda targeting NATO and Poland. “The suspects also prepared acts of sabotage ordered by the Russian intelligence. The whole ring was paid for the tasks carried out,” it said.

HRW reports new evidence of Ukrainian use of banned landmines,The rights group has previously published four reports documenting the use by Russian troops.,"Human Rights Watch (HRW) said on Friday that it uncovered new evidence of the indiscriminate use by Ukrainian forces of banned anti-personnel landmines against Russian troops who invaded Ukraine in 2022. The group called on Ukraine’s government to follow through with a commitment made earlier this month not to employ such weapons, investigate their suspected use and hold accountable those responsible. “The Ukrainian government’s pledge to investigate its military’s apparent use of banned anti-personnel mines is an important recognition of its duty to protect civilians,” Steve Goose, Human Rights Watch’s arms director, said in a statement. HRW said it shared its findings with the Ukrainian government in a May letter to which it received no response. Ukraine’s embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Ukraine in 2005 ratified a 1997 international treaty banning such mines and mandating the destruction of stocks of the weapons. Russia did not join the treaty and its use of anti-personnel mines “violates international humanitarian law … because they are inherently indiscriminate,” the report said. Anti-personnel mines are detonated by a person’s presence, proximity or contact and can kill and maim long after a conflict ends. Since Russia’s February 2022 invasion, HRW has published four reports documenting the use by Russian troops of 13 types of anti-personnel mines that killed and injured civilians. The new report is a follow-on to a January report that Ukrainian soldiers fired rockets that scattered thousands of PMF-1 mines in Russian-occupied areas in and around the eastern city of Izium between April and September 2022, when Kyiv’s forces recaptured it. The latest report said that fresh evidence of Ukrainian forces’ use of anti-personnel mines in 2022 came from photographs posted online by an individual working in eastern Ukraine that showed warhead sections of Uragan 220mm rockets. Those rockets each indiscriminately disburses 312 PFM-1S anti-personnel mines, said the report. Analysis of handwriting on one warhead determined that the first word was Ukrainian for “from,” while a second Latin alphabet word related to an organisation in Kyiv, which the report did not identify. The person who headed the organisation – also unidentified – had social media posts “indicating that they had donated funds to the Ukrainian military via a non-governmental organisation (NGO).” Photographs of Uragan warheads posted online bearing messages written in Ukrainian were linked to a different Ukraine-based group, the report said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/30/hrw-reports-new-evidence-of-ukrainian-use-of-banned-landmines-2
Future of Wagner contracts up to African states: Russia’s Lavrov,Saturday’s attempted mutiny in Russia has led to speculation about the status of Wagner operatives in the Central African Republic and elsewhere in Africa.,"Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said the future of contracts signed between various African countries and the Wagner mercenary group was a matter for those governments who had concluded such agreements. Speaking at a news conference on Friday, Lavrov said Wagner had worked in the Central African Republic (CAR) and other countries on the basis of contracts drawn up directly with the governments concerned. He also said Russia’s defence ministry had long had “several hundred” military advisers working in the CAR. Wagner mercenaries, who have been heavily involved in the Ukraine conflict, staged a brief mutiny last Saturday, taking control of the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don and marching on Moscow before a deal abruptly ended their revolt. The incident has led to speculation about the status of Wagner operatives in CAR and elsewhere in Africa as well as Moscow’s level of involvement with the group’s activity on the continent. On Tuesday, Russian president Vladimir Putin said Wagner was “fully financed” by the state, adding that around 86 billion rubles (approximately $940 million) was paid to the group between May 2022 – May 2023. Mali, where military authorities seized power in coups in 2020 and 2021, is battling a years-long operation against armed groups affiliated with ISIL (ISIS) and al-Qaeda. It has said that Russian forces there are not Wagner mercenaries but trainers helping local troops with equipment bought from Russia. The mercenaries have been blamed for human rights abuses including most notably an incident in March 2022 in Moura in central Mali, where local troops and suspected Russian fighters allegedly killed hundreds of civilians. In nearby Mauritania, thousands of Malians have fled to the M’bera refugee camp since 2021, according to United Nations officials running the camp. Almost 7,000 new arrivalswere recordedbetween March – April 2022 alone. In February, French President Emmanuel Macron described the deployment of Wagner troops in Africa as the “life insurance of failing regimes in Africa” that will only sow misery.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/30/future-of-wagner-contracts-up-to-african-states-russias-lavrov
Wagner mercenary ‘merch’ prices jump online after Russia mutiny,Merchandise bearing Wagner’s insignia – a human skull against a black and red backdrop – has shot up in price online.,"Online prices for merchandise bearing the insignia of Russia’s Wagner mercenary force – a human skull against a black and red backdrop – have shot up since the group’s short-lived armed mutiny against the Russian military, with buyers also posting five-star reviews and support for the mercenaries. Russia’s largest online retailer Wildberries’ weekly price breakdowns showed how costs have risen for Wagner paraphernalia after the private army’s boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, sent an armed convoy of fighters on a 1,200-kilometre (750-mile)charge towards Moscow on Saturday. After occupying the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don and appearing to have a clear shot at entering Moscow, Prigozhin abruptly halted the advance of his fighters on Saturday after agreeingto lead his forces into Belarus following talks with that country’s leader Alexander Lukashenko. Wagner fighters may be out of sight in Russia, but they appear to still be on the minds of Russian online shoppers. A Wagner uniform patch depicting the skull that can be sewn onto clothes fetched 525 roubles ($6) in the period June 25-29, up sharply from 294 ($3.36) roubles during June 18-25. Prices for a black T-shirt emblazoned with a picture of a Wagner fighter holding a violin jumped this week to 1,650 roubles ($18.80) from 1,236 roubles ($14.10). “Due to the situation in the country, the purchase was spontaneous,” wrote one buyer, Tatiana.    People have also been buying other regalia, such as Wagner keyrings, on the rival Russian E-commerce site, Ozon. “Very beautiful and original keyring,” wrote one five-star reviewer. “In memory of all those in Wagner’s ranks who died.” Wildberries and Ozon declined to comment on Thursday on the surge in Wagner merchandise prices. Elsewhere, Prigozhin face masks are now on sale in Saint Petersburg, alongside those of Putin, Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov and jailed opposition politician Alexey Navalny. Writing a review of a Wagner flag on Wildberries, one buyer, Vladimir, said: “The Wagner Private Military Company is the best. Good luck to you guys. The flag is excellent.” Wagner fighters, who have spearheaded some of Russia’s fiercest battles in Ukraine, have beenaccused of committing atrocities in conflicts around the worldin which they have become involved in recent years. United Nations experts in January called for an independent investigation intopossible war crimes and crimes against humanitycarried out in Mali by government forces and Wagner mercenaries. Russian President Vladimir Putin has described the private army’s actions as “treason”. Yet, when Wagner’s armoured convoy crossed from Ukraine into Russia on their so-called “march to Moscow” on Saturday, they were cheered enthusiastically by residents in Rostov-on-Don – the city they briefly took control of in southern Russia.

EU officials concerned over Russian threat with a ‘weaker Putin’,Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy tells EU summit that turmoil for Putin in Russia was advantageous to the West.,"The European Union officials have warned thatRussia has become more dangerousfollowing last weekend’s short-lived mutiny by the country’s Wagner mercenary force which had exposed that President Vladimir Putin was politically weaker than previously thought. Attending an EU summit in Brussels on Thursday, senior officials reiterated that the recent chaos in Russia – wherethe mercenary force came within 200km of Moscow(125 miles) on Saturday –  was an internal matter in which their governments played no role, but a weakened Putin was a concern for Europe. “A weaker Putin is a greater danger,” EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said as he arrived for the meeting on Thursday. “Putin has lost the monopoly of force,” Borrell said, adding that he expected that Putin “will be in cleaning mode internally, and a more assertive mode” following the threat to his power exposed by the mutiny of Wagner fighters. Borrell said EU member states intelligence services were analysing scenarios as “now we have to look at Russia as a risk because of the internal instability”.    NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that while it was “too early” to draw conclusions regarding the effects of recent events, Wagner’s weekend mutiny revealed “cracks and divisions” in Russia. “The mutiny we saw at the weekend demonstrates that there are cracks and divisions within the Russian system. At the same time, it is important to underline that these are internal Russian matters,” Stoltenberg said. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that “a regime change in Russia” was not a goal. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who addressed Thursday’s EU summit by video link, had a blunt message for those who claimed that a weakened Putin would make him more unpredictable and dangerous. “We are seeing their weakness, which we so badly need,” Zelenskyy said. “The weaker Russia is, and the more its bosses fear mutinies and uprisings, the more they will fear to irritate us. Russia’s weakness will make it safe for others, and its defeat will solve the problem of this war,” he said.    EU leaders agreed thatPutin had suffered a blow to his authority from the Wagner affair. Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda, one of several EU nations bordering Russia, insisted the chaos from the Wagner mutiny was all the more reason to take a robust posture towards Putin. Some say “that a strong Putin is less dangerous than a weak Putin. I don’t agree with that. We have to move forward and be decisive because now is a crucial moment of history”, Nauseda said. “This showed deep cracks in Putin’s system. This mutiny of last weekend will also have aftershocks that we will see,” said EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.    Officials from several member states and EU institutions said the chaos and instability created by the rebellion would not only force the EU to double down on its support for Ukraine with commitments for more ammunition but also to ensure fighting and violence do not spill over into the EU bloc itself afterWagner forces were allowed to leave Russia for neighbouring Belarus. “There is no room for hesitation,” said Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas. “We must continue to increase the price of Russian aggression.” Many EU nations are also members of NATO, and at NATO’s July 11-12 summit, they will look to offer Ukraine more security guarantees, if stopping short of full NATO membership. That approach for more support is expected to be fully endorsed by the time the two-day summit ends. As Putin has moved to reassert control since the Wagner uprising, the Kremlin has remained silent over the conspicuous absence of the deputy commander of Russia’s military operations in Ukraine and other senior Russian military figures.    Speculation about General Sergei Surovikin has been growing since he fell out of public view after the aborted weekend revolt by Wagner fighters and amid reports that he was sympathetic to the mercenary force’s objectives. While several media outlets have claimed that Surovikin has been arrested, the general’s whereabouts were a matter for the defence ministry, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the Russian news agency Interfax on Thursday. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington, DC-based think tank, said on Thursday that Peskov’s response to questions regarding the missing general was insightful. “Peskov could have denied ongoing speculations about Surovikin if there were no investigation of him,” the ISW said. “Peskov’s refusal suggests that Russian officials may be investigating Surovikin since Russian officials usually refuse to comment on ongoing investigations,” it said. The ISW also noted that Russian sources have given conflicting accounts of what may have happened to Surovikin, including that he was questioned by the security services over links to Wagner and has since been released. #KremlinSpokesperson Dmitry Peskov refused to address Army General Sergei#Surovikin’s whereabouts on June 29, prompting more speculations in the Russian information space.https://t.co/N68gnBsZSthttps://t.co/USgXEoQHG8pic.twitter.com/Jp6RWBGqLO — ISW (@TheStudyofWar)June 30, 2023  “It would be logical for Russian officials to question Surovikin or any other military officials with ties to Prigozhin after Wagner’s armed rebellion,” the think tank said. Asked whether Putin continued to trust Surovikin, Peskov said only that the president was working with Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Russia’s top general, Valery Gerasimov. Surovikin is considered an ally of Prigozhin but sided with the powers that were in Moscow during the Saturday march by Wagner forces towards Moscow. Prigozhin said his move on Moscow was to overthrow senior military leaders. He has long accused Defence Minister Shoigu and General Gerasimov of incompetence and blamed them for the multitude of battlefield failures Russian forces have suffered in Ukraine.

China unlikely to be worried by ‘weaker Putin’ post Wagner revolt,"‘New era’ ties are expected to continue given China and Russia’s shared concerns, with Beijing enjoying an even stronger position.","Taipei, Taiwan– Ties between China and Russia will remain strong even after the failed mutiny by the Wagner Group last weekend, but analysts say Beijing is likely to become increasingly cautious about Russian leader Vladimir Putin and the future stability of his government. Beijing, like many governments, remained largely silent on Saturday as Yevgeny Prigozhin’s mercenary troopsmarched towards Moscowafter seizing the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don. The following day, as the dust settled and Prigozhin agreed toexile in Belarus, China released a statement. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the incident “Russia’s internal affair” and said it supported Russia’s attempts at “maintaining national stability and achieving development and prosperity”. State media, which spent little time on Saturday’s events, also picked up on the theme of stability, noting the speedy resolution to the crisis by Putin’s government. Still, despite thepublic messaging downplayingthe weekend’s events, the mutiny probably did unnerve top Chinese officials, including President Xi Jinping, said Elizabeth Wishnick, a senior research scientist at Columbia University’s Weatherhead East Asian Institute. “For Xi Jinping, developments in Russia this weekend would have had to be very concerning, as they raised questions about regime security, a top concern for the Chinese leader,” she said.    Xi, who has developed strong ties with Putin in recent years, is in the midst of extending his rule into a personal grip over China as themost powerful leader since Mao Zedong. For a government that emphasises stability at all costs, even locking down tens of millions for COVID-19 and overturning the economy to achieve it, a situation such as that faced by Putin as the Wagner Group advanced on Moscow would have been Xi’s worst nightmare. “I think China will become more cautious in understanding that Mr Putin’s control of his country may not be as solid as people used to think. The perception that he is strong man in command of his country now has cracked,” said Shen Dingli, a Shanghai-based international relations scholar. “That will be calculated into the decisions of all players, not only China… [but] Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Germany, the US,” he said. “Even Putin himself, he knows his image has been tarnished.” China and Russia have long had a complex relationship but the two sides have become closer since Xi came to power in 2013, thanks to his close friendship with Putin and their shared animosity towards the United States. Both view the US as meddling in their backyards, either through Ukraine and NATO or Taiwan and Japan, and both oppose expanded US influence in their respective regions. The two countries declared a “no limits partnership” shortly before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year, which was conspicuously held off until the conclusion of the Beijing Winter Olympics. As the war drags on, China has helped keep Russia’s economy afloat in the face of Western sanctions despite maintaining an officially neutral position and offering tonegotiate peace talks. In March, Xi travelled to Moscow, shook hands with Putin, who had just been named in an arrest warrant by the International Criminal Court, and later agreed to a “new era” of cooperation between the two countries. “While recent events are of concern to China’s government, because of both geographical proximity and shared challenges, they are unlikely to negatively affect China’s desire and commitment to working with Russia on both bilateral and global issues,” Andy Mok, a senior research fellow at the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing, told Al Jazeera. Yurii Poita, the head of the Asia-Pacific section at Ukraine’s Center for Army, Conversion and Disarmament Studies, agrees the partnership is expected to continue in the short term. But he said Beijing might be making more contingency plans based on a revised understanding about the weaknesses in Russian security and defence. The mutiny also exposed Russian elites as unreliable partners, he noted. “We saw that Russian leadership just kept silent and some of them fled from Moscow to other cities. Even the price on the international flights just skyrocketed,” he said. For Xi, who is known tosurround himself with loyalistsand install them in key government positions, such a scenario would have been another nightmare had it happened in China. Wen-ti Sung, a political scientist at Australian National University, said while he expected the close relationship between China and Russia to continue over the long-term, the feeling may begin to shift. Russia was very much the junior partner before the coup and the mutiny has underlined that status, he stressed. “Xi still prefers Putin to the alternatives but Beijing now has reasons to have more reservations and become more transactional in dealings with Putin,” Sung said. “Aweaker Putinwill become less useful to China. A weaker Putin will have to be more beholden to domestic constituencies, less able to project a coherent foreign policy, therefore less able to consistently advance Russia’s common cause with China.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/29/china-unlikely-to-be-worried-by-weaker-putin-post-wagner-revolt
Russia holds General Sergei Surovikin over Wagner mutiny: Reports,The Moscow Times Russian-language service and a military blogger reported Surovikin’s arrest over links to the Wagner mercenary force uprising.,"Russian authorities have reportedly detained General Sergei Surovikin, the deputy commander of Russia’s military operations in Ukraine, amid a reported purge of military officials following the short-lived rebellion by Wagner mercenary forces, according to sources cited by the Moscow Times newspaper and a Russian military blogger. Surovikin, nicknamed “General Armageddon” by the Russian media for his reputed ruthlessness, is a veteran of Russia’s wars in Chechnya and Syria who has been decorated by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Citing two sources close to Russia’s Defence Ministry, the Russian-language service of The Moscow Times reported on Wednesday that Surovikin was arrested due to what one of the unnamed sources said was choosing Wagner chief Yevgeny “Prigozhin’s side during the uprising”. A Russian military blogger, Vladimir Romanov, also reported Surovikin’s arrest on Wednesday, according to the Moscow Times, while the Washington, DC-based think tank Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reported another Russian source as claiming that military “affiliates” of Surovikin had been “accused of complicity in the rebellion”. Russia’s Defence Ministry has yet to comment on the reports of Surovikin’s detention, the newspaper said. The Defense Ministry has yet to comment on the alleged arrest of Surovikin, who has not been seen in public since Saturday.https://t.co/dr7xM4N33k — The Moscow Times (@MoscowTimes)June 28, 2023   The ISW reported on Wednesday that a prominent Russian military blogging site had claimed that a “large-scale purge” of the Russian military command was under way following the attempt by Wagner forces to enter Moscow and apprehend the country’s senior military leaders. Russia’s Ministry of Defence is undergoing what Rybar, a pro-Kremlin military analysis channel on Telegram, described as a “crash test” for loyalty amid apparent “indecisiveness” by some in the Russian military command when it came to crushing the Wagner mutiny and their “support” for the private mercenary force, the ISW reported. Rybar said the uprising by the Wagner force had “become a pretext for a massive purge in the ranks of the Russian Armed Forces”. 3/ Russian authorities reportedly arrested Army General Sergei#Surovikinon June 28, possibly indicating that the#Kremlinintends to purge the MoD of figures viewed as disloyal.https://t.co/owjfEW9jU1pic.twitter.com/GMqcvNBZnF — ISW (@TheStudyofWar)June 29, 2023   “If Russian authorities did arrest Surovikin then the Kremlin will likely use Surovikin and his affiliates as scapegoats to publicly explain why the Russian military and Russian internal security apparatuses responded poorly to the rebellion and to justify a potential overhaul of the Russian military leadership,” the ISW wrote. “ISW cannot confirm any of these speculations about the command changes at this time, but it is evident that the armed rebellion is continuing to have substantial ramifications in the information space.” The Reuters news agency cited three United States officials on Wednesday as saying that Surovikin was known to be sympathetic to the Wagner rebellion but it was unclear if he actively supported it. Surovikin had been in support of Prigozhin but Western intelligence did not know with certainty if he had helped the rebellion in any way. As the uprising unfolded, he had publicly urged Wagner fighters to return to their bases on Saturday, Reuters reported. The New York Times also reported that Surovikin had advance knowledge that Prigozhin was planning a rebellion and that Russian authorities were checking if he was complicit.    The Kremlin, asked on Wednesday about the Times report, said there would be “a lot of speculation” in the aftermath of the Wagner mutiny, which saw mercenaries reportedly come to within 200km (124 miles) of Moscow. “There is now a lot of different speculation and gossip surrounding these events,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday, according to Russian news agencies. “I think that’s an example of that,” he said, dismissing the Times report. The Russian army and the people “all stood by the President (Vladimir Putin) during the uprising”, Peskov added. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko confirmed on Tuesday that the Wagner boss, Prigozhin, had arrived in the country as part of a deal he brokered and which narrowly prevented Wagner mercenaries from marching into Moscow. Wagner fighters have been offered an abandoned military site where they can “put their tents while thinking what to do next”, Lukashenko said.    Germany’s Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Wednesday the failed mutiny had weakened Putin but it was unclear if it would make the Kremlin any more likely to withdraw its troops from Ukraine. “I do believe he is weakened as this shows that the autocratic power structures have cracks in them and he is not as firmly in the saddle as he always asserts,” Scholz said in an hour-long interview with German broadcaster ARD. Scholz said he did not want to participate in speculation about how long Putin would likely remain in office, saying the West’s aim in supporting Ukraine was to help it defend itself, not to bring about regime change in Russia.    Asked if at any point on Saturday he had hoped the insurrection by the Wagner mercenaries was the end of Putin’s rule, he said it would have made no sense as it was unclear if what would come after Putin would be better. “The Wagner troops are a military unit that is acting very aggressively all over the world, and very concretely also in Russia’s war against Ukraine,” Scholz said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/29/russia-holds-general-sergei-surovikin-over-wagner-mutiny-reports

Ukraine says suspect directed Russia missile attack in Kramatorsk,Ukraine’s President Zelenskyy says man who allegedly ‘spotted’ for Russian forces attack on restaurant to be charged with treason.,"Ukraine has arrested a man accused of directing the Russianmissiles that hit a restaurantin the country’s city of Kramatorsk, killing at least 12 people and wounding more than 60, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and security officials said. Two sisters, both aged 14, were among three teenagers killed in the attack on Tuesday evening that hit the Ria Pizza restaurant in the city centre, which was popular with locals, soldiers, aid workers and journalists. The other teenager killed was 17, according to Prosecutor General Andrii Kostin. Ukrainian security officials said the man it arrested, an employee of a fuel transportation company, was suspected of filming the restaurant for Russian forces and informing them about its popularity. “The Security Service of Ukraine together with the police special forces detained the person who coordinated this terrorist attack,” Zelenskyy said in his nightly address to the nation on Wednesday. “Everyone who helps Russian terrorists destroy life deserves the maximum punishment. And this applies not only to some collaborators,” he said. “The spotter is being charged with treason. The possible punishment is life imprisonment. Accomplices of a terrorist state must be treated as betrayers of humanity,” he added, warning that more bodies may yet be found beneath the rubble of the restaurant. First of all, regarding yesterday's 🇷🇺 attack on Kramatorsk. Today, work continued all day at the site of the attack. Unfortunately, the death toll has increased. 🇷🇺 missiles claimed the lives of 11 of our people, including three children. My condolences to the families. More…pic.twitter.com/U1iNlfDqLd — Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa)June 28, 2023   Officials initially said Tuesday’s attack on the restaurant involved a Russian S-300 missile, a surface-to-air weapon that Moscow’s forces have repurposed for loosely-targeted attacks on cities, but Ukraine’s National Police later said Iskander short-range ballistic missiles were used. Kramatorsk is a front-line city that houses the Ukrainian Army’s regional headquarters. The death toll from the attack rose to 12 on Thursday following the discovery of another body, Ukraine’s emergency services said, as rescuers continued to search through rubble for possible survivors in a city where last year, about six weeks after the start of Moscow’s full-scale invasion,52 civilians were killedin a Russian missile attack on a train station. Tuesday’s missile attack also damaged 18 multi-story buildings, 65 houses, five schools, two kindergartens, a shopping centre, an administrative building and a recreational building, Ukraine’s Donetsk regional Governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said. Three Colombian citizens were also injured in the attack on the restaurant, Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro said in a tweet on Wednesday, adding that Bogota would lodge a diplomatic protest with Moscow for the attack that had harmed “defenceless Colombian civilians”. The three injured Colombians were identified as well-known writer Hector Abad Faciolince, former Colombian peace negotiator Sergio Jaramillo and journalist Catalina Gomez. Abad and Jaramillo were reported to be on a mission to express Latin American solidarity with the people of Ukraine. Rusia ha atacado a tres civiles colombianos indefensos.

Russia has insisted that it does not attack civilian targets, although its missiles havekilled many civiliansand destroyed civilian infrastructure – such as homes and businesses – across the country. The Russian Ministry of Defence said on Wednesday that its forces had hit a facility used by Ukrainian army officers in Kramatorsk but did not mention the pizza restaurant. “Strikes are only carried out on objects that are in one way or another linked to military infrastructure,” said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. “The Russian Federation does not carry out strikes on civilian infrastructure,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/29/ukraine-says-suspect-directed-russia-missile-attack-on-restaurant
"As Wagner troops marched on Moscow, Ukraine made further gains","Russian President Vladimir Putin’s position weakened by the Yevgeny Prigozhin’s mutiny amid Ukraine war, analysts say.","Seventy weekssince he ordered his troops into neighbouring Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin faced a major mutiny back home. On June 23, Wagner Group boss Yevgeny Prigozhin circulated a video purportedly showing a missile attack against his private military company that has been fighting alongside Russian soldiers. “According to eyewitnesses, the strike was delivered from the rear, that is, it was delivered by the military of the Russian Federation Ministry of Defence,” he wrote on Telegram. Prigozhin said his 25,000 armed men would “march for justice” to “stop the evil brought by the Russian military leadership”. He promised that after settling scores with Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of Staff General Valery Gerasimov, his troops would then return to the front lines in Ukraine. Prigozhin has frequently criticised the Russian military leadership, claiming their incompetence has led to the deaths of tens of thousands of soldiers. He put himself in competition with Shoigu and Gerasimov by claiming credit for the capture of Severodonetsk, Lysychansk and Bakhmut in Ukraine’s east, elevating Wagner’s reputation. After the occupation of Bakhmut in May, Russia’s defence ministry cycled Wagner mercenaries out and replaced them with regular marines and paratroopers. On June 10, Shoigu announced that all volunteer formations must sign military contracts with the Russian defence ministry by July 1. Prigozhin said that would not happen. “He was pushed to act because the defence ministry was trying to absorb Wagner, and he knew that once they grabbed Wagner, he had nothing – and God knows what would happen to him afterwards,” Seth Krummrich, a former US army colonel who is now the vice president at Global Guardian, a security consultancy, told Al Jazeera. Following their withdrawal from Bakhmut, Wagner forces either redeployed to Krasnodar in Russia, or remained encamped behind the front lines in Ukraine’s eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. Unengaged in the war, they were free to attack Russia itself. Well before 8am local time [05:00 GMT] on June 24, footage showed Prigozhin casually walking through the regional military headquarters of Rostov-on-Don, which his men had occupied. They were not only the headquarters for the 58th Combined Arms Army, currently engaged in Ukraine, but also the command centre for all Russian forces on Ukrainian soil. “They were able to walk in there,” Krummrich said. “That told me the Russian headquarters there was taken completely by surprise … or they’re realising what’s happening in Ukraine, they’re seeing the losses and the lies in Moscow, so there was an emotional support level,” he said.    By 10:30am [07:30 GMT], geolocated footage showed Wagner forces crossing the administrative border of the Voronezh region, where Russian troops surrendered to them. Wagner quickly seized the city of Voronezh with relatively little resistance. By early afternoon, Wagner forces had advanced past Lipetsk and were seemingly filmed driving on the M4 highway to Moscow with T-90 tanks and BMP-2 armoured personnel carriers. Bulldozer crews began to dig up a trench across the M4 to stop them. The Kremlin mobilised Rosgvardia (Russian National Guard), special police and special rapid response troops to barricade the capital, in what some observers said was increasingly looking like a coup attempt that could have led to civil war. By 6pm [15:00 GMT], Wagner troops were filmed in northern Lipetsk region, 330 kilometres (205 miles) from Moscow. In just a matter of hours, Wagner had covered half the distance from the Ukrainian border to Moscow. “Such fast moving and impactful developments make it almost certain … that Wagner had a plan for a military uprising already well worked out, had stockpiled equipment, and had analysed the weak points in the Russian military and state that it could exploit,” Phillips Obrien, professor of strategy at St Andrews University, wrote in a Substack post. Even the Russian air force was unable to stop the advancing columns because they carried Pantsir and manually portable air defence systems. “They had integrated air defence systems that are mobile, so they were able to protect their convoy and protect their movement. Any sort of aviation that came in they could strike it right away,” said Krummrich. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington-based think tank, assessed that Wagner forces “may have shot down up to three Mi-8 MTPR electronic warfare helicopters, one Mi-8 helicopter, one Ka-52 helicopter, one Mi-35 helicopter, one Mi-28 helicopter, and one An-26/Il-28 transport aircraft, resulting in the deaths of at least 13 pilots and airmen – and one of the single deadliest days for the Russian air force of the war in Ukraine to date”. The lack of resistance to Wagner was also remarkable. “Rosgvardia’s founding mission is to protect internal threats to the security of the Russian government, such as an advance on Moscow, and it is notable that Rosgvardia failed to engage even as Wagner captured critical military assets in Rostov-on-Don and destroyed Russian military aircraft,” said the ISW. In an address to the nation, Putin on June 24 declared Prigozhin a traitor and described his mutiny as “a betrayal of our people … a knife in the back of our country”. “Inflated ambitions and personal interests have led to treason,” Putin said. “Those who staged the mutiny and took up arms against their comrades – they have betrayed Russia and will be brought to account.” Yet by the end of the day, Prigozhin announced a deal brokered by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko that gave him immunity in Belarus. He claimed his decision to accept it was driven by a desire to avoid further bloodshed and civil war.  “[Prigozhin] did not see the people rising up. He has 25,000 soldiers. That’s maybe 10,000 foot soldiers. The rest are logistics. You can maybe take one neighbourhood in Moscow with that … there’s no chance of him taking it militarily. What he needed was a spark to set off a coup where the people rose up, but the people are clearly not at that point,” said Krummrich. “I think he struck too early.” Independent Russian news service Verstka reported that a 24,000 square kilometres (9,266 square miles) training base for Wagner was already under construction at Asipovichy in Belarus, 200km (124 miles) from the Ukrainian border. But it was unlikely that Putin would allow Prigozhin to live, said Krummrich. “I think he’s a dead man walking,” he added. “If you’re Putin, you have to kill him; you have to, because the next batch of oligarchs who decide to break off are going to be much more savvy, much more sophisticated, and they’re going to win.” In a second address to the Russian people on June 26, Putin left the door open for Wagner mercenaries to sign up with the armed forces, a sign of how greatly in need he is of trained and experienced personnel. “Today, you have the opportunity to continue your service to Russia by signing a contract with the defence ministry or other law enforcement or security agency, or return home,” Putin said. “Those who want to are free to go to Belarus. I will keep my promise.”    Ukrainian officials, meanwhile, greeted the short-lived rebellion across the border withcaution and hope, as Kyiv’s troops continued to probe Russian defences for weaknesses and reclaim occupied territory. Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said Ukraine’s counteroffensive had liberated 130sq km (50.1sq miles) by June 26, a gain of 17sq km (6.6sq miles) compared with a week earlier. Ukraine had also launched new offensives north and south of Bakhmut, Maliar said, in Orikhovo-Vasylivka, Bohdanivka, Yahidne, Klishchiivka and Kurdyumivka, reinforcing a flanking action that began in mid-May. Ukrainian troops advanced 1-2km (0.6-1.2 miles) along these new axes, she said. Ukraine’s southern forces continued to put pressure on Russian defences in front of the port cities of Melitopol and Berdyansk. “The Russian occupation forces are putting up strong resistance, while suffering significant losses in personnel, weapons and equipment. The enemy’s casualties over the past week are eight times more than ours,” Maliar said. It was not possible to independently verify the figures. But in an upbeat address to Ukrainians, President Volodymyr Zelenskyysaidhis country’s forces had “advanced in all directions”. “This is a happy day. I wished the guys more days like this,” he said in the video message that was released in the early hours of Tuesday after visiting Ukrainian forces on the front lines. “It was a busy day, a lot of emotions … I was honoured to award our warriors, to thank them personally, to shake their hands,” Zelenskyy added. Many observers noted that, despite the failure of Prigozhin’s mutiny, the chaotic weekend events left Putin looking weak. “There’s still other players in the game of thrones in Moscow that are waiting and watching,” said Krummrich. “They see the weakness. Blood’s in the water, and here come the sharks … His situation has become much more dangerous.” Lawrence Freedman, emeritus professor of war studies at King’s College London, wrote that the Russian president “let the Shoigu-Prigozhin argument fester without dealing with it decisively”. “As the confrontation reached a critical stage, the masses were not running out onto the streets to support [Putin] … Those urging Prigozhin to back off did so in regretful tones … without going out of their way to praise Putin as a glorious and irreplaceable war leader, whose judgement bordered on the infallible and whose bravery moved all those who witnessed it,” he continued. “Putin will be aware that at this vital moment when his position was under the greatest threat, many were watching to see what happened next.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/28/as-wagner-troops-marched-on-moscow-ukraine-made-further-gains
"What future awaits Russia’s Wagner army and its boss, Prigozhin?","Observers say Yevgeny Prigozhin is ‘doomed’ after turning on Russian President Vladimir Putin, known for vindictiveness towards turncoat allies.","Kyiv, Ukraine –Back in 2013, the year after Vladimir Putin’s return to presidency and the year before Moscow annexed Crimea, Aleksandra Garmazhapova got an undercover job. The investigative reporter briefly worked as an “online operator” typing up hundreds of pro-Kremlin comments from a snow-white office outside St Petersburg, Russia’s second-largest city and Putin’s hometown. The office reportedly hosted a “troll farm” that belonged toYevgeny Prigozhin, known at the time as “Putin’s chef” for his catering services to the Kremlin. Garmazhapova’s story was a major scoop that put the now infamous “troll farms” on the map and eventually got their owner blacklisted by Washington for meddling in the US presidential election in 2016. She is confident that afterWagner’s marchon Moscow, that stopped only 200km (124 miles) south of the Russian capital, “Putin’s chef” is a doomed man. “He’s not going to live long,” said Garmazhapova, who lives in Prague and was recently accused of “spreading fakes about the Russian army”. She now runs a group helping thousands of Russian men escape mobilisation. “We remember that Vladimir Putin is a pretty vindictive character, and he won’t forget the fact that he was humiliated in front of the entire world,” she told Al Jazeera.  After Prigozhin agreed to march Wagner back to southwestern Russia, Putin dropped incursion charges against him and his men and allowed them to relocate toBelarus. Even if Prigozhin is pressured to leave Belarus, he still has strongholds in Syria and several sub-Saharan nations, where Wagner fought and still has lucrative security contracts and stakes in timber trade and mining. “Africa awaits him, Syria awaits, there’s no one down there to replace him,” Marat Gabidullin, a former Wagner mercenary who fled to France and wrote about his experiences, told Al Jazeera. “His projects there can be called successful.” Alas, on Tuesday, the Al Hadath television channel in Saudia Arabia claimed that Russian military police raided Wagner headquarters in Syria and arrested four Wagner commanders. Africa may become Prigozhin’s last resort, reporter Garmazhapova said. “It can’t be ruled out that Prigozhin will have to spend the rest of his life in the Central African Republic or some other African nation,” she said. But Putin has indeed been notorious for punishment, especially to turncoat allies and colleagues. One of them was Aleksander Litvinenko, an intelligence officer who accused Putin of allegedly ordering several residential buildings blown up so that attacks could be blamed on Chechen separatists. Litvinenko, who defected to the United Kingdom, was lethally poisoned with radioactive polonium-210 in 2006 after Putin repeatedly called him a “traitor”. Analysts have been less inclined to think about Prigozhin’s imminent murder, but are puzzled about what’s going to happen to him and tens of thousands of Wagner fighters. “Is all of Wagner – or what is left of it – going to be incorporated into Russia’s armed forces? If so, what will happen to Wagner units outside of its immediate vicinity – in Syria, Africa, and elsewhere?” Kevork Oskanian of the UK’s Exeter University told Al Jazeera. “Beyond the appearance that Prigozhin has been well and truly expelled from the Russian elite because of his miscalculation, it is really difficult to say,” he said. Prigozhin’s life and career have been truly protean. At 62, he has the charisma of former US President Donald Trump and the business acumen of Eric Prince, the founder of theBlackwater private army, according to John Lechner, an author based in Washington, DC, who is writing a book on Prigozhin’s operations in Ukraine, Middle East and Africa. “He is a mix of people such as Prince, Trump, founders of Silicon Valley companies, and, of course, this mafia type, who speaks prison slang,” Lechner told Al Jazeera. “He knows how to build a company’s culture, knows how to make people admire him, be loyal to him.”     Contrary to media reports, Prigozhin did not found Wagner, but joined the nascent military company around 2015 as a food supplier, Lechner said. “I can imagine a step from providing food to providing people, soldiers. In principle, he replaced what he provides,” he said. Food was what made Prigozhin famous. Putin hosted several dignitaries in Prigozhin’s riverboat restaurant, and awarded him contracts to supply food to the military and public schools. The food was not as good as the delicacies served to Putin, and hundreds of servicemen and schoolchildren have reportedly been hospitalised after partaking in it. But Putin did not seem to care about the poisonings – and his “chef’s” checkered past. Prigozhin spent most of the 1980s in jail after being convicted of armed robberies and recruiting minors into a criminal gang. Recruitment and knowledge of prison slang are what Prigozhin excelled at – especially when touring dozens of penitentiaries last year to enlist tens of thousands of inmates. Wagner was founded by Dmitry Utkin, a former special forces officer with a penchant for Nazi ideology and the music of Adolf Hitler’s favourite composer, Richard Wagner. The group fought for pro-Russian separatists in southeastern Ukraine in 2014. One of them was Igor Strelkov, who fell out with Prigozhin after his men allegedly killed separatist leaders who disobeyed Moscow. Strelkov maintains that Prigozhin’s Belarusian banishment means that his powerful allies within the Kremlin still back him. In a Tuesday Telegram post, he claimed that Prigozhin will turn into “another [Mikhail] Khodorkovsky,” a Russian tycoon who opposed Putin and served 10 years in jail. “The difference is that Khodorkovsky ‘wanted [a coup], but didn’t dare try, but the ‘chef’ ‘tried but chickened out,’” Stelkov wrote. On Tuesday morning, Prigozhin’s private jet landed near the Belarusian capital, Minsk. “Yes, he is in Belarus. As I promised him – if you choose to switch sides with us for a while, we’ll help you,” said Belarusian President Aleksander Lukashenko, who brokered a truce between Prigozhin and Putin. But Wagner’s operations in Russia have not been terminated. Its recruitment centres in five St Petersburg sports clubs still enlist aspiring mercenaries, the Bumaga publication, an independent news website based in St Petersburg, found out. Wagner “has not been liquidated or outlawed, everything keeps on working,” one of the managers told Bumaga.    Several publications connected to Prigozhin’s media empire are blocked, and companies affiliated with him stopped working, Bumaga reported. The Wagner Center in a luxurious skyscraper in St Petersburg has also remained closed. “Because of the current situation and good weather, the Center recommends its residents and staffers to spend the weekend outdoors and in good company!” its administration posted on Saturday. Prigozhin’s presence in Belarus will be a constant threat to Putin – especially if thousands of his mercenaries refuse to join the Russian army and move to the bases that Belarusian authorities are reportedly building. “Wagner in Belarus will hang over Putin,” Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kushch told Al Jazeera. Prigozhin may even try to seize the Kremlin again – via the Smolensk road Napoleon used in 1812 to invade Russia and take Moscow. “A march towards Smolensk and Moscow can be as fast as the one to Rostov-on-Don [where the Saturday’s rebellion began] and farther towards the capital,” Kushch said. Wagner will operate in Belarus with even more impunity given the weakness of Lukashenko’s police and army, he said. “Let’s not bury Wagner quite yet. Belarusian law enforcement agencies will counter Wagner even less than the Russian guards,” he said.   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/28/what-future-awaits-wagner-army-and-its-chief
"Russia to continue work in CAR, Wagner business separate: Kremlin",The fate of Wagner mercenaries at home and in parts of Africa is uncertain after its abortive mutiny in Russia on Saturday.,"Russian advisers will continue working with the forces of the Central African Republic, but the operations there of the Wagner Group are the private military contractor’s own, separate business, the Kremlin says. The Kremlin statement on Wednesday concerns a country with which Russia has had close ties with in recent years. Hundreds of Russian operatives, including many from the Wagner Group, have been helping its government fight rebel uprisings against President Faustin-Archange Touadera since 2018. And Touadera is scheduled to attend the second Russia-Africa Summit in St Petersburg in July. But Wagner’s fate is uncertain after its abortive mutiny in Russia on Saturday. This week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told state broadcaster Russia Today that Wagner’s work in CAR “as instructors … will continue” and that the weekend’s events would not impact relations between Moscow and its partners and allies. Meanwhile, Bangui has remained upbeat about the situation with minister and presidential adviser Fidèle Gouandjika telling the Agence France-Presse news agency that what the country had in place was “a defence deal with Russia and not Wagner. … Moscow has subcontracted to Wagner, and if Russia doesn’t agree, it will send us a new contingent.” The mercenary group has been accused of multiple human rights abuses in CAR, Burkina Faso and Mali. And no, there are questions about whether the group could still be seen as a stabilising force for tackling armed groups after its mutiny in Russia. “They will be seen as too unstable and potentially a threat to the leadership in those countries,” Michael Mulroy, a former senior Pentagon official, told the Reuters news agency. “They almost started a coup in their own [country].”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/28/russia-to-continue-work-in-car-wagner-business-separate-kremlin
"Wagner boss Prigozhin has arrived in Belarus, says Lukashenko",The Belarusian leader confirms that Wagner forces are in Belarus as he hails his own role in halting the recent mutiny.,"Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has confirmed that the head of the Wagner paramilitary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has arrived in the country. He said he offered the mercenary group an abandoned military site where they could “put their tents while thinking what to do next”. Lukashenko is said to have brokered a deal which narrowly prevented Wagner mercenaries from marching on Moscow after theprivate army mutiniedagainst Russia’s military leaders. Lukashenko said there would be no Wagner recruitment points in Belarus but the nation’s citizens may join the group and issued an ominous warning that those who make such a decision should realise the “danger of death” for the job. Commenting on reasons that led to the mutiny, the Belarusian leader said it was an “interpersonal conflict” between Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Prigozhin “escalated into this fight”. “I know the work of Shoigu. Undeservedly he is sometimes criticised,” he said.    Lukashenko asked that he not be called “a mediator”, arguing he was “a participant” because it was a common problem for Russia and Belarus. He also said lessons have to be learned from the situation with the mutiny. “We need to be more attentive to such military collectives if we have spawned them. And we need to respond to their requests in time.” Putin’s supporters have insisted that his rule was not weakened by the revolt. Asked whether Putin’s power was diminished by the sight of Wagner’s rebel mercenaries seizing a military headquarters, advancing on Moscow and shooting down military aircraft along the way, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov accused political commentators of exaggerating, adding that: “We don’t agree.” Putin himself attempted to portray the dramatic events at the weekend as a victory for the Russian army. “You de facto stopped civil war,” Putin told troops from the defence ministry, National Guard, FSB security service and interior ministry gathered in a Kremlin courtyard to hold a minute’s silence for airmen slain by Wagner.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/28/wagner-boss-prigozhin-has-arrived-in-belarus-says-lukashenko
NATO will defend members from threat of Wagner forces in Belarus,Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg says the military alliance will protect members from threats by either ‘Moscow or Minsk’.,"NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has said the Western military alliance is ready to defend itself against any threat posed by the move of Russia’sWagner mercenary force to Belarusamid fears the relocation of the private army could create instability for NATO’s Eastern European members. Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin was reported to have arrived in Belarus on Tuesday under a deal negotiated by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, which narrowly prevented the mercenaries from marching on Moscow on Saturday after theprivate army mutiniedagainst Russia’s military leaders. “If Wagner deploys its serial killers in Belarus, all neighbouring countries face even bigger danger of instability,” Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said after a meeting in The Hague with NATO’s Stoltenberg and government leaders from six other NATO allies. Polish President Andrzej Duda said he hoped the threat posed by Wagner mercenaries to NATO would be on the agenda at a summit of all 31 members in Vilnius, Lithuania, on July 11-12. “This is really serious and very concerning, and we have to make very strong decisions. It requires a very, very tough answer of NATO,” Duda said.    NATO’s Stoltenberg said it was too early to say what the Wagner presence in Belarus could mean for NATO allies, but that the military alliance would protect “every ally, every inch of NATO territory” against threats from either “Moscow or Minsk”. “We have already increased our military presence in the eastern part of the alliance and we will make further decisions to further strengthen our collective defence with more high-readiness forces and more capabilities at the upcoming summit,” Stoltenberg said. Prigozhin hasnot been seen since Saturday, when he waved to well-wishers from a vehicle in the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, which his fighters briefly occupied. On Tuesday morning, a private jet believed to belong to Prigozhin flew from Rostov to an airbase southwest of the Belarusian capital of Minsk, according to data from FlightRadar24. Amid the fallout from Prigozhin’s mutiny against Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s supporters have insisted his rule has not been weakened by the revolt and that Russian officials have been trying to put the crisis behind them, with the FSB intelligence service dropping all criminal charges against Wagner fighters. Putin has also attempted to shore up his authority by thanking regular Russian troops for what he described as averting a civil war and has portrayed events over the weekend as a sort of victory for the Russian army.    “You de facto stopped civil war,” Putin told troops from Russia’s defence ministry, National Guard, FSB security service and interior ministry who gathered in a Kremlin courtyard on Tuesday. “You proved your loyalty to the people of Russia and the military oath,” Putin said, before holding a minute of silence for the airmen shot down and killed by Wagner forces on Saturday. In a separate meeting with defence officials, Putin said for the first time that the Wagner Group was wholly funded by the Russian federal budget, despite operating as an independent mercenary force. He added that since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Moscow has paid the group 86.262 billion rubles (about $1bn) in salaries. Moscow has said that preparations were under way for Wagner fighters still in Ukraine, who number about 25,000 according to Prigozhin, to hand over their heavy weapons to Russia’s military.    Talking to his military officials on Tuesday,Belarus’s Lukashenkosaid he had urged Putin not to kill the rebellious mercenary boss Prigozhin. “I said to Putin: we could waste him, no problem. If not on the first try, then on the second. I told him: don’t do this,” Lukashenko said, according to state media. Lukashenko also said that his military can learn much from the Wagner mercenaries. “They were at the very front of the attacking troops. They will tell us what’s important now,” Lukashenko said, according to the Belarusian news agency Belta. Wagner fighters could report on which weapons worked well in Ukraine and how attack and defence could be conducted successfully, Lukashenko was reported to have said.    “This is very valuable. We have to get this from the Wagner fighters,” Lukashenko said, adding that the mercenary troops were still in their bases in the Russian-occupied Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine. “But if they would like – and I understand that they are looking at a number of locations – then we will accommodate them,” he said. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington, DC-based think tank, said on Monday that Russian-language opposition media had reported that Belarus was in the process of constructing several military camps to house the Wagner fighters. The think tank added that a base, which would accommodate up to 8,000 fighters, was in the process of being constructed in the country’s Mogilev region, located approximately 200km (124 miles) east of Minsk. The ISW also said that Belarus is unlikely to be a truly safe place for Wagner fighters if Putin decides to renege on his deal to not prosecute them for mutiny. “Belarus will not offer Prigozhin or Wagner fighters a true haven if the Kremlin pressures Belarus,” the ISW said. “Putin may be presenting Belarus as a haven for Wagner fighters as a trap. The Kremlin will likely regard the Wagner Group personnel who follow Prigozhin to Belarus as traitors whether or not it takes immediate action against them,” it said. Putin is also attempting to destroy Prigozhin’s reputation among his fighters and within Russian society, the ISW said on Wednesday.

Russia bombs busy Ukraine restaurant,At least eight killed and dozens injured after Russian missile hits crowded pizza restaurant in centre of Kramatorsk.,"Three children were among the victims of a Russian missile attack on Kramatorsk city in eastern Ukraine that has killed at least eight people and injured dozens more, officials said. Russia fired two S-300 surface-to-air missiles at the city on Tuesday evening, authorities said, with one missile hitting the popular Ria Pizza restaurant in the city centre. A second missile struck a village on the fringes of the city, injuring five. “As of 07:00 (04:00 GMT) on June 28, the bodies of eight dead people (including three children, two of them born in 2008 and 2011)” were removed from beneath “the rubble of the destroyed cafe building”, the State Emergency Service of Ukraine said on Telegram. Ukraine’s interior ministry also confirmed one of the bodies pulled from the ruins of the restaurant was a teenager, while a baby was among the 47 who were injured. The restaurant was hit just before 8pm local time (17:00 GMT) when many people were eating dinner. Emergency services rushed to the scene. Photos showed twisted metal and piles of rubble with rescuers using cranes and other equipment to get to those trapped inside and dozens of volunteers working alongside them. “There were a lot of people in there — there are children under the rubble,” Yevgen, who had been dining with two friends told the AFP news agency. “We were just about to leave,” he said, but one of his friends was now “under the rubble”. In tears, a witness Natalia said her half-brother Nikita, 23, was trapped inside. “They can’t get him out, he was covered” by debris, she said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his nightly video message that the attacks showed that Russia “deserved only one thing as a consequence of what it has done — defeat and a tribunal”. Kramatorsk was one home to about 150,000 people and is about 30km (18 miles) west of the front lines in Donetsk province. The city has been afrequent target of Russian attacks, including a raid on its railway station in April 2022 that killed 63 people. Russia denies that it targets civilian sites. The attack came amid the continuing fallout from the Wagner mutiny with the leader of the mercenary force, Yevgeny Prigozhin, arriving in neighbouring Belarus, according to President Alexander Lukashenko. Prigozhin, 62, said he launched the mutiny to save his armed group after being ordered to place it under the command of the defence ministry, which he has cast as ineffectual in its conduct ofthe war in Ukraine. His fighters ended their campaign on Saturday to avert bloodshed after nearly reaching Moscow in a convoy of tanks.  Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus with an iron hand for 29 years while relying on Russian subsidies and support,portrayed the uprisingas the latest development in the clash between Prigozhin and Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu. He said he had told Prigozhin he would be “squashed like a bug” if he tried to attack Moscow, and warned the Kremlin would never agree to his demands to remove Shoigu and his top generals. A plane linked to Prigozhin was shown on a flight tracking service taking off from the southern Russian city of Rostov early Tuesday and landing in Belarus. Lukashenko said his country would accommodate Wagner fighters who wanted to go there. “We offered them one of the abandoned military bases. Please – we have a fence, we have everything – put up your tents,” Lukashenko was quoted by the state-run news agency BELTA.  Russian authorities said on Tuesday they closed a criminal investigation into the aborted armed rebellion led by Prigozhin and would press no charges against him or his troops. The Federal Security Service, or FSB, said its investigation found those involved in the mutiny, which lasted less than 24 hours, “ceased activities directed at committing the crime,” so the case would not be pursued. It was the latest twist in a series of stunning events that have broughtthe gravest threat so farto President Vladimir Putin’s grip on power following Moscow’s full scale invasion of Ukraine 16 months ago. In a military ceremony, Putin told about 2,500 Russian security personnel the people and the armed forces stood together in opposition to the rebel mercenaries. “You have saved our motherland from upheaval. In fact, you have stopped a civil war,” he said. Putin was joined by Shoigu whose dismissal had been one of the mutineers’ main demands. He also praised Wagner troops’actions in Ukraineand credited those who “didn’t engage in fratricidal bloodshed and stopped on the brink”. That was “likely in an effort to retain them” in the fight in Ukraine because Moscow needs “trained and effective manpower” as it faces a Ukrainian counteroffensive, according to a Washington-based think tank. The Institute for the Study of War also noted the break between Putin and Prigozhin was probably beyond repair, and providing the Wagner chief and his loyalists with Belarus as an apparent safe haven could be a trap.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/27/russia-bombs-busy-ukraine-restaurant-as-wagner-moves-to-belarus
UN documents summary execution of 77 Ukrainian civilians,A United Nations monitoring mission in Ukraine finds both Russia and Ukraine guilty of breaching international law.,"A United Nations mission in Ukraine has expressed grave concern over the summary execution of more than 70 Ukrainian civilians by Russian forces while also documenting other breaches of international law by both warring sides. The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) on Tuesday released its findings gathered between the start ofRussia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbouring countryin February last year to May of this year. “OHCHR is gravely concerned by the summary execution of 77 civilians – 72 men and 5 women – while they were arbitrarily detained by the Russian Federation, and the further death of one detainee (a man) as a result of torture, inhumane detention conditions and/or denial of necessary medical care,” read the report, referring to the UN’s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The UN agency also documented 864 cases of arbitrary detention by Russian troops, many of which also amounted to enforced disappearances. It also reported the detention of 260 civilians “based on their perceived political views or other legitimate exercise of freedom of expression”. The true number of cases might vary considering that Russia did not provide OHCHR with any access to conflict-related detainees, despite repeated requests, the UN agency said. More than 90 percent of the reported cases described being subjected to torture and ill-treatment, including sexual violence. “Such treatment appeared to be carried out to force the victims to confess to provision of assistance to Ukrainian armed forces, to compel them to cooperate with the occupying authorities, or to intimidate those considered to hold pro-Ukrainian views,” said the report.    Ukrainian security forces have also been found guilty of unlawfully detaining at least 75 individuals – mostly suspected of conflict-related criminal offences. They also held 65 civilians incommunicado to extract confessions. “Fifty-seven percent of interviewed detainees described being subjected to torture and ill-treatment by Ukraine, predominantly in unofficial places of detention and, to a lesser extent, in pre-trial detention facilities,” it said. OHCHR also raised concern over the “vagueness and overly broad” wording of a law introduced in Ukraine in March last year that established criminal liability for collaborationists. Under this law, the office of Ukraine’s prosecutor general opened more than 5,400 criminal proceedings leading to 500 guilty verdicts. “The vagueness and overly broad terminology in the legal provisions raise concerns with respect to the principle of legality and have led to arbitrary detention in a number of cases,” the UN agency said. So far, Ukraine has convicted 23 Russians, OHCHR said, adding that it was not aware of any criminal proceeding launched against Ukrainians involved in arbitrary detention or enforced disappearance.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/27/un-documents-summary-execution-of-77-ukrainian-civilians
‘Don’t see why not’: China envoy on backing Ukraine’s ’91 borders,"China’s EU envoy, Fu Cong, says Beijing respects the territorial integrity of all countries and stands for peace.","Brussels, Belgium –China’s envoy to the European Union has suggested that Beijing could back Ukraine’s aims of reclaiming its 1991 territorial integrity, which includes Crimea – the peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014. In a recent interview with Al Jazeera and two other media outlets, when Fu Cong was asked about supporting Kyiv’s goals, which includes reclaiming other Ukrainian regions now occupied by Russia, the senior Chinese diplomat said: “I don’t see why not. “We respect the territorial integrity of all countries. So when China established relations with the former Soviet Union, that’s what we agreed. But as I said, these are historical issues that need to be negotiated and resolved by Russia and Ukraine and that is what we stand for.”  The Chinese ambassador’s comments followed the 2023 Europe-China Business Summit in Brussels on June 16. In aninterviewwith the New York Times in April, Fu said that Beijing did not recognise Moscow’s efforts to annex Ukrainian territories including Crimea and the Donbas. Since Ukraine gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and backed separatist uprisings in parts of Luhansk and Donetsk, which are in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. Although Russia has claimed the peninsula and has extended its occupation in the Donbas, Western powers do not recognise Moscow’s moves. Besides Fu, Chinese leaders generally refrain from making public comments on Russia’s annexation of Ukrainian territories. When a United Nations referendum on recognising Crimea’s annexation was held in 2014, China abstained from voting and Liu Jieyi, China’s envoy to the UN at the timesaid: “China has always opposed intervention in the internal affairs of states and respected the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries”- a stance the Chinese foreign ministry reiteratedin a statementin April. China has not officially condemned the Kremlin for invading Ukraine in February 2022 and after Russian mercenary fighters threatened a large-scale rebellion in Moscow over the weekend, China’s alliance with Vladimir Putinremainsstrong. “As Russia’s friendly neighbour and comprehensive strategic partner of coordination for the new era, China supports Russia in maintaining national stability and achieving development and prosperity,” China’s foreign ministry said in a statement on Monday, downplaying theunexpected mutinyled by Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin as an “internal affair.” Ambassador Fu defended China’s position on Ukraine, saying it “has been very clear”. “We advocate peace and we believe that it is important to achieve peace as soon as possible by resolving differences on the negotiating table,” he said. In February, Beijingreleaseda 12-point proposal aimed at finding a “political settlement” to end the war. As part of these efforts, Chinasent ambassador Li Huito Kyiv, Moscow and other European countries last month. But Beijing’s renewed“no-limits”partnership with Moscow and its position on Russia’s war in Ukraine have seen China’s ties with the EU cool to a frost. Last week, as Chinese Premier Li Qiang visitedEurope for the first time since he took office, EU leaders urged him to get tough on Moscow. The Baltic nations and Poland are particularly frustrated with China, and back imposing sanctions against Beijing and reducing economic dependencies. In March, before a trip to China, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the blocshould focus on“de-risking” with China, rather than “de-coupling”. Fu told Al Jazeera that while China understands the EU’s ambitions for a resilient supply chain, the bloc “should not conflate economic security with national security, making it hurt free trade”. “De-risking should not become de-coupling in another name. The recent developments in the EU over Huawei and ZTE have been concerning,” Fu said, referring to the European Commission’s proposal to ban Huawei and ZTE from 5G networks earlier this month. “There is no evidence that they are harming cybersecurity and in our view, these baseless accusations go against the spirit of fair play and fair competition, which actually Europe claims to be the champion,” Fu added.    Besides bans, last week, the EU targeted Chinese entities which are allegedly supporting “Russia’s military and industrial complex in its war of aggression against Ukraine” in an eleventh sanctions package against Moscow. Prior to the announcement of more sanctions, Fu said China has not committed to stopping companies from helping Russia, but he hoped through “dialogue, misunderstandings could be resolved”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/27/dont-see-why-not-china-envoy-on-backing-ukraines-91-borders
Wagner’s weapons to be transferred to Russian troops: Official,Russia’s Federal Security Service closes criminal case against Wagner Group’s mercenary troops as Moscow prepares to transfer military hardware to its army.,"Heavy military hardware held by the Wagner Group will be transferred to Russian troops, the Russian defence ministry has said, as Moscow moves to bring the rebellious mercenary group under its control. “Preparations are under way for the transfer of heavy military equipment from the private military company Wagner to units of the Russian armed forces,” the Russian defence ministry said on Tuesday. Wagner chiefYevgeny Prigozhinled a briefmutinyat the weekend in Russia, sparking the most serious security crisis in decades and raising questions over President Vladimir Putin’s grip on power, as Moscow’s war in Ukraine drags on. But despite the gravity of the armed rebellion, Russia’s Federal Security Service announced it had closed a criminal case against the Wagner fighters who were seeking to topple the country’s military leadership.  On Saturday, Prigozhin ultimately called off an advance towards Moscow after Wagner forces seized the southern city of Rostov-on-Don, a nerve centre of the war in Ukraine, and shot down six Russian helicopters and a command and control plane. Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko ledmediation efforts, bringing about an abrupt resolution to the crisis. The Kremlin has since been at pains to stress that there had been a return to normal. In his firstaddress to the nationsince the rebels pulled back, Putin on Monday said he had issued orders to avoid bloodshed and granted amnesty to the Wagner fighters. He then accused Ukraine and its Western allies of wanting Russians to “kill each other” during the revolt. Prigozhindefendedhis actions as a protest – a bid to save his mercenary outfit and expose the failures of Russia’s military leadership, but not to challenge the Kremlin. In his first audio message since the incident, he bragged that the ease of Wagner’s advance on Moscow exposed “serious security problems”. “We went to demonstrate our protest and not to overthrow power in the country,” Prigozhin said, boasting that his men had “blocked all military infrastructure” including air bases on their route before they stopped 200 kilometres (125 miles) from Moscow. The turmoil in Russia was welcomed in Ukraine as an opportunity to seek momentum for a continuing counteroffensive. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday said his forceshad “advanced in all directions”after visiting soldiers on the front line in the eastern Donetsk region and the south of the country. Ukraine also reported minor successes in the east and repelled Russian counterattacks at several points on the front, including near Bakhmut, Lyman and Avdiivka, where the fighting is said to be particularly fierce.

Belarus role in Russia-Wagner feud ‘boosts Lukashenko’s clout’,"President Alexander Lukashenko has trumpeted his ‘peacekeeping’ role in quelling the Wagner mercenary group’s rebellion in Russia, raising questions about his motives.","Kyiv, Ukraine –A mediator’s mantle is not something Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko is often seen wearing. Dubbed “Europe’s last dictator”, Lukashenko hascracked down on criticsand protests with harrowing cruelty, human rights groups say. So when Lukashenko’s press service on Saturday night trumpeted his“peacekeeping” rolein quelling the Wagner private army’s rebellion in neighbouring Russia, the biggest question was: What’s in it for him? First, Lukashenko signalled that Russian President Vladimir Putin, his biggest political and financial patron, can’t write him off. “He simply showed that he is still useful to Russia, and that’s why he himself is still in Minsk,” John Lechner, an author in Washington, DC, who is writing a book about Wagner Group founderYevgeny Prigozhin, told Al Jazeera. By hosting Prigozhin and his men, Lukashenko also gets thousands of experienced mercenaries. “If Prigozhin stays in Belarus and manages Wagner or something similar, it boosts the political clout of Lukashenko, who will have his own real private army,” Nikolay Mitrokhin of Germany’s Bremen University told Al Jazeera. Belarusian authorities have started building camps for 8,000 Wagner men in the forests of the Mogilev region, which lies on the Russian border, the Verstka news portal reported on Monday. It is also only 100km (62 miles) southwest of the Belarusian capital, Minsk, and 200km (124 miles) north of the Ukrainian border And yet again, Lukashenko showed that he can punch above his weight. “He also shows the leaders of ex-Soviet nations that he’s still a sly middleman who can sort out sharp conflicts or at least diminish them,” Mitrokhin said. Saturday may go down in history as Putin’s worst day in power. Prigozhin accused the Russian Ministry of Defence ofstriking Wagner campsin Ukraine and killing 30 fighters to force members of the mercenary group into signing contracts and becoming part of the regular Russian forces. The Wagner Group marched from Ukraine into Russia and seized the southern city ofRostov-on-Don. Prigozhin then ordered his men to advance towards Moscow. Putin branded him a “traitor” and reportedly fled the Russian capital as Wagner men moved almost unimpeded, shooting down several aircraft andkilling pilots. They were about 200km (124 miles) south of Moscow – and seemed fully capable of becoming the first army to enter the city since 1812 when Napoleon’s army burned it down. And then, out of the blue, Lukashenko’s press service said he found “an absolutely beneficial and acceptable option for resolving the situation”. The deal Lukashenko brokered was simple: Putin drops insurrection charges against Prigozhin and his men, they retreat and Belarus takes in their chief.    Putin said on Monday that the Wagner fighters have to choose whether they want to sign up with the Ministry of Defence, return home or go to Belarus. “I’m sure this will be the choice of Russian warriors who realised their tragic mistake,” Putin said in a televised address. The accord followed multiple phone calls between Lukashenko and Prigozhin. “The conversation was complicated,” pro-Lukashenko analyst Vadim Gigin said in televised remarks. “They immediately revealed things of oh-my-God kind.” “Oh, my God” is what many would say about Prigozhin. He prefers not to stick to the letter of the law – Russian or international. Prigozhin’s “troll farm” allegedly used fake accounts or stolen identities of real Americans to spread Kremlin propaganda and interfere in the 2016 presidential elections in the United States. Prigozhin’s mercenaries are also accused of committing war crimes such as killing “traitors” with sledgehammers and videotaping the executions.  They helped Syrian President Bashar al-Assad regain control of most of his country – and then began operating in Libya and several sub-Saharan African nations. Africa remains Prigozhin’s citadel, where he keeps thousands of fighters and earns money by providing security services to several governments and trading “blood diamonds”, gold, tungsten, timber and weapons, according to All Eyes on Wagner, a French group that monitors the mercenary force. A former senior Wagner commander even praised Prigozhin for bringing stability to the Central African Republic, whose population, he said, “is absolutely excited about the presence of Russian mercenaries”. “Because the central government widens its control, there’s more order and people can safely move around without a danger of being killed,” Marat Gabidulin, who fled to France and wrote two books, told Al Jazeera. Prigozhin’s African connections could prove useful to Lukashenko in his own dealings with China, which have already brought in trade preferences and multibillion-dollar credits. These connections could also be useful to Beijing as it boosts its clout in Africa further, Igar Tyshkevich, a Belarusian analyst based in Kyiv, said in televised remarks. The troll farm’s spin doctors launched several successful media outlets and Telegram channels – and Lukashenko could use their expertise. “After the failure of Belarusian propaganda, such talents are needed,” Tyshkevich said. But the strategic, long-term consequences may be way worse. Any future conflicts between Prigozhin and Putin’s allies will backfire on Lukashenko. By providing shelter to a notorious accused war criminal, Lukashenko loses any chance of restoring ties with the West. “That’s why Lukashenko got into a traditional format of his political career’s stage – he won tactically, but strategically got himself into a very bad smelling place,” Tyshkevich concluded. For almost three decades, Lukashenko has been gradually ceding Belarusian independence to Moscow. What he got in return was apolitical shield from Western sanctions, discounted energy supplies and other economic perks. But Lukashenko has always been cunning enough not to cede too much. He let Russia deploy nuclear missiles in Belarus and use its territory to invade Ukraine – but refused to send his own army to the front lines. He also never completed the former Soviet Union’s largest integration project. In the late 1990s, he and Russian President Boris Yeltsin decided to merge their two nations into a “Union State”. Lukashenko hoped to helm both states, given Yeltsin’s poor health and alcoholism. But Yeltsin anointed Putin as a successor, and Lukashenko stalled the merger. These days, he can use Prigozhin to restore his clout in Russia. “For Lukashenko, this is a chance for a renaissance of his influence [in Russia] the way it had been in the late 1990s with the Union State,” Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kushch told Al Jazeera.

Russian fighter aircraft hold combat drills over Baltic Sea,Air exercises come amid growing number of intercepts between NATO and Russian military planes over the Baltic and Black Sea.,"Russia has started tactical fighter jet exercises over the Baltic Sea with the goal of testing readiness to perform combat and other special operations, the country’s defence ministry has said, a day after Moscow said its jets had scrambled to intercept United Kingdom military planes over the Black Sea. “The main goal of the exercise is to test the readiness of the flight crew to perform combat and special tasks as intended,” Russia’s defence ministry said on Tuesday. “The crews of the Su-27 [fighter jets] of the Baltic Fleet fired from airborne weapons at cruise missiles and mock enemy aircraft,” the ministry announced on the Telegram messaging channel, adding that as well as improving skills, Russian fighter pilots are on “round-the-clock combat duty” guarding the air space of Russia’s Kaliningrad exclave. Wedged between Poland and Lithuania on the Baltic coast, Kaliningrad is Moscow’s westernmost state and was part of Germany until the end of World War II. Given to the Soviet Union at the Potsdam Conference in 1945, the enclave has roughly 1 million residents – mainly Russians but also a small number of Ukrainians, Poles and Lithuanians.    Russia said last year that it had deployed warplanes armed with state-of-the-artKinzhal hypersonic missilesto the Chkalovsk airbase in Kaliningrad as part of its “strategic deterrence”. On Monday, the Russian defence ministry said that it had scrambled two fighter jets as UK Typhoon warplanes approached its border above the Black Sea and that the planes had “turned around and distanced themselves from the Russian border” following intervention from Russia’s fighter planes. The Typhoon jets were accompanying an RC-135 reconnaissance aircraft, the defence ministry said. “The Russian planes safely returned to their airfield. There was no violation of the Russian border,” the ministry said. Interceptions involving Russian and Western military aircrafthave multipliedover the Black Sea and Baltic Sea in recent months amid growing tensions over Moscow’s war in Ukraine. On Sunday, the UK’s Ministry of Defence said that Royal Air Force (RAF) Typhoon fighter aircraft operating with the NATO Baltic Air Policing mission in Estonia havescrambled to respondto Russian aircraft 21 times in the last 21 days. The RAF fighters are currently operating out of Estonia as part of NATO’s “quick reaction alert” to secure its eastern European flank. “The RAF Typhoons launch to monitor the Russian aircraft when they do not talk to air traffic agencies, making them a flight safety hazard,” the UK defence ministry said in a statement on Sunday. “These intercepts are a stark reminder of the value of collective defence and deterrence provided by NATO,” the UK’s Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said. RAF Typhoons in Estonia scrambled this afternoon to intercept a Russian Tu-134 ‘CRUSTY’ and 2x Su-27 ‘FLANKER’ Bs flying close to@NATOairspace.

Ukraine’s Zelenskyy says forces advancing ‘in all directions’,"President Zelenskyy toured front line positions in the south and east of the country, afterwards saying: ‘This is a happy day’.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hasvisited Ukrainian forces fightingon the front line that runs through the eastern Donetsk region and the south of the country, decorating troops on a day in which he said his forces had “advanced in all directions”. In an upbeat message to his nation after visiting the front lines, Zelenskyy said: “This is a happy day. I wished the guys more days like this.” “It was a busy day, a lot of emotions… I was honoured to award our warriors, to thank them personally, to shake their hands,” Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address, which was released in the early hours of Tuesday. The Ukrainian president also said he had spoken about weapons supplies withUnited States PresidentJoe Biden. “Today, I was in the area where these weapons will give more power, more protection to Ukrainians’ lives. And bring our victory closer, this is the main thing. All our land will be free – all of it,” he said. The president’s office posted four videos of Zelenskyy’s journey on Monday, which he said covered “hundreds of kilometres” and appeared to present encounters with his troops in at least three locations on the front lines. The Ukrainian leader’s interactions with his forces and positive comments on Ukraine’s ongoing counteroffensive contrasted starkly with the turmoil in Russia following theshort-lived weekend mutinyby the Russian Wagner Group’s mercenary forces.    One location visited by Zelenskyy was in the eastern Donetsk region, which has been a focal point of fighting in the 16-month-old war. Another was located in what was described as the Berdyansk sector in the south of the country – in areas where Ukrainian forces have captured villages. A third location was also on the southern front, further to the west. The first video showed Zelenskyy handing out military awards at an undisclosed indoor location and poring over maps with Oleksandr Syrskyi, the commander of Ukraine’s ground forces. “I have the honour to be here today, talk to the commander and first of all thank you, thank you for protecting our country, sovereignty, our families, children, Ukraine,” Zelenskyy said in the video. A second video showed Zelenskyy at a fuel station where he had coffee with soldiers. Dressed in his trademark military khaki T-shirt, he stood alongside troops in a queue at a counter and posed for photos with the soldiers and women working there. In the third video, Zelenskyy handed out decorations, posed with soldiers and again examined maps with officers. Loud booms resounded at least twice during the video.    Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said on Monday that Ukrainian forces had regained control over Rivnopil, a village west of a cluster of settlements recaptured in recent offensive operations in the Donetsk region. The village appeared to be the ninth retaken by Ukraine forces this month. In the past week, 17 additional square kilometres (10.5 sq miles) of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhia region have been recaptured, Maliar also said on Telegram, while a total of 130sq km (almost 81 sq miles) of Russian-occupied territory had been liberated since the start of the counteroffensive in early June. Ukraine also reported minor successes in the east. According to Maliar, the army advanced 1-2km (0.6-1.2 miles) in several directions during the previous week, despite fierce resistance from the Russians. Ukrainian forces also repelled Russian counterattacks at several points on the front, including near Bakhmut, Lyman and Avdiivka where the fighting is said to be particularly fierce right now. In the past seven days, there have been more than 250 battles in these areas, Maliar said. The United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defence said on Monday that Ukrainian forces had intensified their assaults around Bakhmut city and had made advances around the northern and southern parts of the city. There was also little evidence that Russia had theground force reserves requiredto “reinforce against” the many threats now posed by Ukraine “in widely separated sectors, from Bakhmut to the eastern bank of the Dnipro River, over 200km [124 miles] away”, the ministry said in an intelligence update.

Making his first public comments on Monday since ending the 24-hour mutiny andagreeing on Saturdayto withdraw his private army to camps in Belarus, Yevgeny Prigozhin said in a recording that he had acted “to prevent the destruction of the Wagner private military company” and that he did not intend to topple the government in Moscow.

Putin thanks those ‘who stood in the way of the mutineers’,Russian leader pays tribute to pilots killed fighting the short-lived Wagner mutiny and says he will honour promises of amnesty for mercenaries.,"President Vladimir Putin has paid tribute to pilots killed in the short-lived mutiny by the Wagner Group and expressed his thanks to those who opposed the rebellion in his first public comments since Saturday’s revolt was ended. “The courage and self-sacrifice of the fallen heroes-pilots saved Russia from tragic, devastating consequences,” Putin said in an address broadcast on state television late on Monday night. There has been no official information about how many pilots died or how many aircraft were shot down. “I thank all the soldiers and intelligence-service staff who stood in the way of the mutineers,” the president said, adding that everything possible was done on his orders to avoid bloodshed. He also thanked BelarusianPresident Alexander Lukashenkofor mediating with Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin to call off the armed group’s advance on Moscow. Putin – without mentioning Prigozhin by name – thanked the mercenary commanders and soldiers who avoided bloodshed, and said he would honour his promise to allow Wagner forces to relocate to Belarus if they wanted, sign a contract with Russia’s defence ministry or return to their families. All attempts to sow chaos in Russia were destined to fail, the president said. He blamed “Russia’s enemies” and said they “miscalculated”. “The organisers of the mutiny who betrayed the country also betrayed those who were on their side,” said Putin, who later met Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, the head of Russia’s main domestic security service and other top ministers, according to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Russia analyst Pavel Felgenhauer described Putin’s comments as a “victory speech directed towards the Russian public”. “Of course this doesn’t mean that problems have dissipated. It’s not fine actually because Putin called on the Wagner fighters to join the defence ministry – and they’re not doing it,” he told Al Jazeera. “They are still there with their weapons, they are well organised, they’re the best fighting force in the land right now. And what will be their next move is not clear. Right now, they most likely feel threatened. They didn’t disappear.” Earlier, Prigozhin defended his “march for justice” on Moscow with a convoy of tanks, saying the move wasnot an attempted coupbut a protest against Russia’s military leadership. He called the move a reaction to an attack on his forces that he said killed about 30 of his fighters. He spoke on Monday in hisfirst audio statementsince Saturday’s events. “We went to demonstrate our protest and not to overthrow power in the country,” Prigozhin said. “We halted at the moment when the first assault unit deployed its artillery [near Moscow], conducted reconnaissance and realised that a lot of blood would be spilled.” Prigozhin shocked the world with the armed revolt, which he abruptly called off as his fighters approached the Russian capital having shot down several aircraft but meeting no resistance on the ground during a dash of nearly 800km (500 miles). Russia’s three main news agencies reported on Monday that the criminal case against Prigozhin had not been closed, an apparent reversal of an offer of immunity publicised as part of the deal that persuaded him to stand down. Prigozhin gave few clues about his fate, including his whereabouts, or the deal – thrashed out by Lukashenko – under which he abandoned the move towards Moscow.    Though the mutiny was brief, it was not bloodless. Russian Telegram channels monitoring Russia’s military activity, including the blog Rybar with more than a million subscribers, reported on Saturday that 13 Russian pilots were killed. According to Rybar, three Mi-8 MTPR electronic warfare helicopters, and an Il-18 aircraft with its crew, were shot down by Wagner forces. Prigozhin expressed regret for attacking the aircraft but said they were bombing his convoys. The feud between the Wagner Group leader and Russia’s military brass has festered throughout the war. Andrei Gurulev, a retired general and current lawmaker who has had rows with the mercenary leader, said Prigozhin and his right-hand man Dmitry Utkin deserve “a bullet in the head”. Prigozhin taunted Russia’s military on Monday, calling his march a “master class” on how it should have carried outthe February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Russian political analyst Tatiana Stanovaya said Prigozhin’s mutiny “wasn’t a bid for power or an attempt to overtake the Kremlin” but a desperate move amid his escalating rift with the military leadership. While Prigozhin could get out of the crisis alive, he does not have a political future in Russia under Putin, Stanovaya said on Twitter. US President Joe Bidencalled the mutiny“part of a struggle within the Russian system” and said that NATO nations played no part in it. US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said it was “a new thing to see President Putin’s leadership directly challenged. It is a new thing to see Yevgeny Prigozhin directly questioning the rationale for this war and calling out that the war has been conducted essentially based on a lie.” White House National Security spokesperson John Kirby said US policy did not seek to change the government in Russia.

"Biden says US, NATO had no involvement in Wagner uprising",US president says NATO allies made sure there was ‘no excuse’ for Russia to blame the Wagner Group rebellion on the West.,"United States President Joe Biden has said that Washington and NATO had no involvement in anarmed uprising against the Kremlinincited by Yevgeny Prigozhin, leader of the Wagner Group of mercenaries. Speaking on Monday, Biden said he has spoken with “key allies” in the wake of the events. They agreed it was important to give Russian President Vladimir Putin “no excuse to blame this on the West”. “We made clear that we were not involved, had nothing to do with it. This was part of a struggle within the Russian system,” Biden said. “We’re gonna keep assessing the fallout of this weekend’s events and the implications for Russia and Ukraine,” he told reporters. “But it’s still too early to reach a definitive conclusion about where this is going.”    Biden’s comments came after a weekend of instability in Russia. On Friday, Prigozhin — an erstwhile Putin ally — accused Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu of launching rocket attacks on his mercenary forces in Ukraine, calling for an end to the “evil” of Russia’s military leadership. It was a major escalation in the ongoing war of words between Prigozhin and the Kremlin, whom he accused of mistreating his fighters in Ukraine. Soon after, the Kremlin announced it had opened a criminal case against Prigozhin for armed rebellion. By Saturday, Prigozhin had ordered his men to cross from Ukraine into Russia, to confront Russia’s military leadership in what he called a “march for justice”. The next hours saw Wagner forces seize the southern city of Rostov-on-Don and begin an advance towards Moscow, with Prigohzhin demanding the removal of Defence Minister Shoigu. Putin, meanwhile, accused Prigozhin of “treason” and a “stab in the back”. Then, just as quickly as the uprising began, it ended. The office of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced a deal had been brokered with Prigozhin, and that Wagner forces would stand down. Further details of that deal haveyet to emerge. Prigozhin, for his part, relocated to Belarus, where on Monday, in his first public statement since the uprising, he said his fighters had come within 200km (124 miles) of Moscow. However, he maintained the fighters “did not have the goal of overthrowing the existing regime and the legally elected government”. He added his forces turned around to “not shed Russian soldiers’ blood”. Long-term fallout from the weekend’s events — and their impact on Russia’s war in Ukraine —remain unclear. Wagner forces had previously played a key role in the fighting, particularly in capturing the eastern city of Bakhmut. Speaking to reporters on Monday, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller noted “it remains a dynamic situation” and it is unclear what the “ultimate implications” will be for US interests.    Still, he added: “It is certainly a new thing to see President Putin’s leadership directly challenged.” The statement echoed the words of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who on Sunday said the rebellion exposed “real cracks” in Putin’s government. As the events unfolded on Saturday, President Biden discussed the situation with French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and United Kingdom Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, according to the White House. On Sunday, he also spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau “as part of his close coordination with allies and partners following recent events in Russia”, the White House said. “As you know, the president very keenly tracks foreign policy developments around the world. His national security team was giving updates literally hour by hour throughout the weekend,” White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said on Monday. “He was absorbing all that information and making sure that — in the context of absorbing it — he was also sharing perspectives with allies and partners.” Biden also told reporters on Monday that he “spoke at length” with Ukrainian President Volodymyr  Zelenskyy, pledging the US’s continued support as Ukraine fights off invasion by Russia. “He and I agreed to follow up and stay in constant contact,” Biden said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/26/biden-says-us-nato-had-no-involvement-in-wagner-uprising
Moscow’s fallout with Wagner: Your guide to the Russian rebellion,"What’s next for Yevgeny Prigozhin and his fighters, and why have they been warring with Russian military chiefs? Here are the key things to know.","An attempted rebellion in Russiaamid the Ukraine warhas sent shock waves across the world, exposed internal struggles, and revealed the vulnerabilities of Moscow’s defence and security structures. On Saturday, mercenary fighters led by Wagner Group boss Yevgeny Prigozhin seized the city of Rostov-on-Don and marched, seemingly unopposed, towards Moscow, demanding the removal of Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu. Prigozhin’s uprising came to an abrupt end hours after it began within 200km (124 miles) of Moscow. He struck a deal with the Kremlin to end the operation, with a pact brokered by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. Since then, Prigozhin released anaudio statementsaying the march to Russian capital was not meant to overthrow the government. While his whereabouts and the fate of his troops remain unclear, one thing is certain: The Wagner revolt is the biggest threat Russian President Vladimir Putin has faced in his 22-year rule. Here’s your simple guide: Prigozhin grew up in St Petersburg, Putin’s hometown. Herose to prominenceas a catering entrepreneur in the Kremlin, earning him the nickname “Putin’s chef”. From then on,his business boomed.In 2014, Prigozhin diversified into the military sector and became the head of the Wagner Group, a private mercenary force allegedly founded by Ukrainian-born Russian army officer Dmitry Utkin in 2013. Wagner troops fight on behalf of Russia. They have led Moscow’s campaigns in Ukraine, and participated in conflicts in Syria, the Central African Republic, Libya, Sudan and Mozambique. Until recently, Wagner was ashadowy groupshrouded in secrecy. That all changed as the Ukraine war progressed, and Prigozhin is nowmore recognisablein Russia than ever before. Since Russia invaded Ukraine last February, Prigozhin has been leading the Kremlin’s military operations, especially in eastern Ukraine. In April,he announced the capture of Bakhmut, after a fierce months-long battle. Putin congratulated the Wagner chief and his troops, but did not acknowledge Prigozhin’s ongoing beef with Russia’s Ministry of Defence.    For months, Prigozhin’s scarred face, tightly shaven head and uneven tobacco-stained teeth became widely recognised, with the Wagner chief releasing videos on Telegram criticising Shoigu. In his almost daily videos, foul-mouthed Prigozhin argued that Russia’s military leaders were incompetent and that they did not provide enough ammunition to his fighters. He also accused them of attacking his troops in Ukraine. Russia’s Defence Ministry denied these claims as “informational provocation”. Journalist Yulia Shapovalova, in Moscow, told Al Jazeera that a criminal case of an “armed rebellion” was initiated on June 23 against Prigozhin, after he accused the Russian army of shelling Wagner positions. On Saturday, Prigozhin said his men had crossed the border from Ukraine into Russia and were ready to go “all the way” against the Russian military. After Wagner troops seized the Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, they marched towards Moscow. Putin accused Prigozhin of “treason” and a “stab in the back”. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, a Putin ally, said his forces would help Russian forces fight against Prigozhin’s revolt.  Prigozhin appeared determined to achieve his aims and according to some Russia watchers,baffledby the spectacle, had “gone rogue”. Ultimately, though, he abruptly aborted his mission. Belarus’s Lukashenko, Putin’s closest international ally, said he brokered a deal with the Wagner chief to de-escalate the situation that led the Wagner fighters abandoning their march on Moscow. Lukashenko’s office said the settlement contains security guarantees for Wagner troops, but the details remain scant. The Wagner chief is expected to live in exile in Belarus. Wagner fighters who did not participate in the march on Moscow will also be offered military contracts, according to the Kremlin. “Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that the criminal case against Prigozhin would be dropped and Prigozhin would go to Belarus – and his Wagner mercenaries who participated in the rebellion would not be prosecuted,” journalist Shapovalova said. But on Monday, several Russian media outlets reported that Prigozhin remains under investigation by the Federal Security Service (FSB), though his exact whereabouts remain unclear. On Monday, Prigozhinreleasedhis first audio statement since the rebellion, defending the move as a reaction to an attack on his force that killed about 30 of his fighters. “We started our march because of an injustice. We went to demonstrate our protest and not to overthrow power in the country,” Prigozhin said in the 11-minute audio clip. He did not offer any details as to where he was or what his future plans are. Prigozhin said his fighters hadthe support of “happy” civiliansin towns they went through as they advanced on Moscow. “In Russian towns, civilians met us with Russian flags and the symbols of Wagner,” Prigozhin said. “They were all happy when we passed through.” Prigozhin appears to have been driven out of Russia, at least for now, and how Moscow will proceed is unclear. “We have to wait and see what happens. It is interesting and could be probably called an active disobedience from the side of the Russian investigative committee and the FSB,” Shapovalova said. Colin Clarke, director of research at The Soufan Group,told Al Jazeerathat Prigozhin’s deal with Belarus does not necessarily guarantee his safety. “People that cross Vladimir Putin tend to have a bad track record of falling out of windows in Russia. We’ve seen them eliminated with little fanfare and in multiple, very brutal ways,” he said. Prigozhin seemed intent on toppling Shoigu, the defence minister. He has also heavily criticisedValery Gerasimov, the Russian commander leading Moscow’s war efforts in Ukraine. But on Monday, a Defence Ministryvideoshowed Shoigu visiting Russian troops. While the location and timing of the video are unclear, some Russian media outlets say his first public appearance since the weekend’s upheaval has ruled out his resignation. Asked by reporters whether Putin trusts Shoigu, Peskov said he wasn’t aware of any changes in the president’s attitude. On Sunday, Keir Giles, a senior consulting fellow of the Russia and Eurasia Programme at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera “All bets are off.” “We simply don’t have any fixed data points that we can rely on to figure out what’s going to happen next,” he noted. Western diplomats say the episode has lifted the lid on Putin’s weaknesses. Before a meeting with European Union foreign ministers in Luxembourg, the EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, told reporters: “The monster that Putin created with Wagner, the monster is biting him now.” “The political system is showing fragilities, and the military power is cracking,” Borrell said.

‘Not overthrowing power’: Wagner boss Prigozhin defends uprising,"Russian mercenary boss issues first statement since aborted mutiny, insists his forces reacted to being attacked by the military.","Wagner Group head Yevgeny Prigozhin defended his “march on Moscow” with a convoy of tanks, saying the move was not an attempted coup and was conducted as a protest against Russia’s military leadership. He called the move a reaction to an attack on his forces that he said killed about 30 fighters. He spoke on Monday in his first audio statement since the aborted armed rebellion he staged on Saturday. “We started our march because of an injustice. We went to demonstrate our protest and not to overthrow power in the country,” Prigozhin said in the 11-minute audio message. He did not offer any details as to where he was or what his future plans are. Prigozhin said his fighters hadthe support of “happy” civiliansin towns they went through as they advanced on Moscow. “In Russian towns, civilians met us with Russian flags and the symbols of Wagner,” he said. “They were all happy when we passed through.” The convoy stopped 200km (125 miles) short of Moscow and had “blocked all military infrastructure” including air bases along its path, he added. Russian media reported that a criminal probe against Prigozhin continued, and somelawmakers called for his head. Prigozhin said the way Wagner was able to seize the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don and a major military base without bloodshed had been testament to the effectiveness of his fighters. “We showed a master class as it should have beenon February 24, 2022. We did not have the goal of overthrowing the existing regime and the legally elected government,” he said. Victor Olevich, a political analyst with the Center for Actual Politics, told Al Jazeera it is not surprising that Prigozhin defended his actions. “It’s quite logical that Prigozhin would blame Russia’s military leadership, which he has been in conflict with for months. When a key southern city in Russia … has been taken over by a private military company, … of course whatever justifications are stated by Prigozhin, this created an internally dangerous situation.”   Earlier, Defence Minister Sergey Shoigumade his first public appearancesince the uprising that was meant to oust him. He appeared in a video aimed at projecting a sense of order after Russia’s most serious political crisis in decades. A feud between the Wagner Group’s leader and Russia’s military brass has festered throughout the war, and it erupted into a mutiny that saw the mercenaries leave Ukraine to seize a southern military headquarters and roll seemingly unopposed towards Moscow – before turning around after less than 24 hours. The Kremlin said it made a deal for Prigozhin to move to Belarus and receive amnesty along with his fighters. There was no confirmation of his whereabouts on Monday although a popular Russian news channel on Telegram reported he was seen at a hotel in the Belarusian capital, Minsk. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has proposed ways in which the WagnerGroup could continue to operate, Prigozhin said. “Lukashenko held out his hand and offered to find solutions for the continuation of the work of the Wagner private military company in a legal jurisdiction,” he said in the audio message.    Prigozhin renewed an allegation – so far unsupported by evidence – that the Russian military attacked a Wagner camp with missiles and then helicopters and said this was the immediate trigger for what he called the “march of justice”. Wagner stopped its advance towards Moscow at the moment when it realised it would have to confront waiting Russian troops and blood would inevitably be shed, he said, reiterating an assertion he made on Saturday. Prigozhin, a former close ally ofPresident Vladimir Putin, said he regretted his fighters had to kill Russian soldiers who attacked their convoy from helicopters. He also again complained about a military order that all volunteer units – including Wagner – must sign contracts by July 1 and place themselves under the control of the defence ministry. Fewer than 2 percent of Wagner’s men have signed up, Prigozhin added. “The aim of the march was to avoid the destruction of Wagner.” Olevich blamed the West for the rebellion, saying the situation would not have happened if not for the Western pressure on Russia. He said if the West destabilizes Putin’s government to the point where he is replaced, it would face a more dangerous government. “Is pushing Russia too far, is isolating Russia too much, is sanctioning Russia too heavily – can those measures bring Russia to such an unstable situation that the West will face a threat of an entirely different magnitude?” he asked. US President Joe Biden on Monday said the brief uprising was an internal struggle within Russia and the United States and its allies had nothing to do with it. “We made clear we were not involved, we had nothing to do with this,” Biden said in his first comments on the mutiny.

Qatar emir talks to Putin after Wagner mutiny in Russia,Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani calls for ‘resolving differences through dialogue and diplomatic means’ in phone call with the Russian president.,"Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani has held a telephone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, two days after a Russian militia group rebelled against Moscow. “The call dealt with discussing bilateral relations between the two countries, in addition to discussing the latest regional and international developments and developments in the Russian Federation,” Qatar’s state news agency QNA reported on Monday. Sheikh Tamim “affirmed Qatar’s position of calling for resolving differences through dialogue and diplomatic means” and called for a “need to respect Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders”, the news agency said. Qatar is among several Arab countries that have been largely neutral over Russia’s 16-month full-scale war on neighbouring Ukraine. For its part, the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement about the call that both leaders confirmed their mutual interest in further strengthening their countries’ ties in various areas. “The Qatari leader expressed his support for the actions of the Russian authorities related to theevents of June 24,” the ministry said. 🇷🇺🇶🇦 President Vladimir#Putinhad a telephone conversation with Emir of Qatar@TamimBinHamad Both Parties noted the high level of#RussianQataricooperation and confirmed their mutual interest in further strengthening it in various areas🤝 🔗https://t.co/UFsBFXWXKjpic.twitter.com/AQ7YcEULhp — MFA Russia 🇷🇺 (@mfa_russia)June 26, 2023  On Saturday, Qatar had expressed “deep concern” over the developments in Russia after thearmed uprisingby the Wagner mercenary group. “The State of Qatar is following, with deep concern, the developments in the Russian Federation, which resulted from the mutiny against the [Russian] army,” the Qatari foreign ministry had saidin a statement. “The escalation in Russia and Ukraine will have negative repercussions on international peace and security, and on food and energy supplies, which are already affected by the Russian-Ukrainian crisis.” So far, Wagner’s mercenaries have been among the most important troops in the Russian war effort. However, after months of tensions with Russia’s military leadership, Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin on Saturdayopenly opposedthe country’s Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu as he launched a dramatic march to Moscow.

Russia defence chief Shoigu appears in video after Wagner revolt,Footage of Sergey Shoigu visiting troops in Ukraine airs after a rebellion in Russia led by mercenary boss seeking his removal.,"Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu has made his first public appearance after Wagner Group chief Yevgeny Prigozhindemandedhe quit in a rebellion in Russia over the weekend that sentshockwavesacross the world. A video released on Monday by Shoigu’s ministry showed him visiting Russian troops in Ukraine. While it is unclear when the video was filmed, it appears to be aimed at projecting a sense of order after Wagner mercenaries on Saturday seized a Russian city, Rostov-on-Don, and marched seemingly unopposed towards Moscow. Prigozhin’s fighters advanced on the capital to remove what he called Russia’s corrupt and incompetent military leadership before suddenly heading back to an occupied area of eastern Ukraine after making a deal with the Kremlin to end the operation, which was brokered by Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko. But since the Wagner chief left Rostov-on-Don in an SUV, few details of the pact he agreed to have been released either by the Kremlin, Lukashenko or Prigozhin himself. It remains unclear what will ultimately happen to Prigozhin and his forces, but tensions between the mercenary chief and Russia’s military have been escalating for months. In recent weeks, he has released videos almost dailycriticisingthe Russian Ministry of Defence, arguing that its leaders are incompetent and it does not provide enough support to his fighters in Ukraine. Journalist Yulia Shapovalova told Al Jazeera from Moscow that a criminal case of an “armed rebellion” was initiated on Friday against Prigozhin after he accused the Russian army of shelling Wagner positions. “Kremlin spokesman Dimitry Peskov told reporters that the criminal case against Prigozhin would be dropped and Prigozhin would go to Belarus – and his Wagner mercenaries who participated in the rebellion would not be prosecuted,” she said. But on Monday, several Russian media outlets reported that Prigozhin remains under investigation by the Federal Security Service. “At the moment, Prigozhin’s whereabouts are unknown,” Shapovalova said, adding that the Wagner chief could also be accused of “active disobedience”. Shoigu’s appearance on Monday could rule out “theories of his possible resignation”. But whether there will be “rearrangements within the ministry of defence, it is hard to say now”, she cautioned. Prigozhin has regularly lashed out at Shoigu but has not directly attacked the Russian president, whose patronage helped the billionaire build his fortune and power. Even so, the rebellion is widely viewed as a problem for Putin, who has not been by challenged in such a manner in more than 20 years as leader of Russia. Asked by reporters on Saturday whether Putin trusts Shoigu, Peskov said he wasn’t aware of any changes in the president’s attitude. Meanwhile, the United Kingdom said this weekend’s events have helped Ukraine “gain impetus”. “There has been little evidence that Russia maintains any significant ground forces operational level reserves which could be used to reinforce against the multiple threats it is now facing in widely separated sectors,” the UK’s Ministry of Defence said. Other Western diplomatsnotedhow the Wagner uprising has displayed Russia’s vulnerabilities. Speaking to the US broadcaster NBC, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called the revolt “extraordinary.” “I think we’ve seen more cracks emerge in the Russian façade,” Blinken said. Before a meeting with European Union foreign ministers in Luxembourg, the EU’s foreign policy chief, Josef Borrell, told reporters: “The monster that Putin created with Wagner, the monster is biting him now.” “The monster is acting against his creator. The political system is showing fragilities, and the military power is cracking,” Borrell said.

Russia’s ‘internal affair’: China plays down Wagner mutiny impact,Beijing stresses ‘national stability’ as state media reports the collapse of the Wagner revolt strengthened rather than weakened Putin.,"China has expressed its support for Russia in the wake of the weekend’saborted Wagner mutiny, as state media projected a narrative of stability and minimal impact on Beijing’s ally. China’s foreign ministry described the incident as “Russia’s internal affairs” in a brief statement on Sunday afterWagner Group head Yevgeny Prigozhinled his soldiers to within 200 kilometres (124 miles) of Moscow before suddenly agreeing to withdraw as part of a deal brokered by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. Under the terms of the agreement, Prigozhin and the troops who backed the rebellion would not be prosecuted, and Prigozhin would go into exile in Belarus. “As Russia’s friendly neighbour and comprehensive strategic partner of coordination for the new era, China supports Russia in maintaining national stability and achieving development and prosperity,” Beijing said in the statement. Chinese media, meanwhile, reported on the story later than Western media and indexed it lower, while articles also stressed how quickly the Kremlin was able to defuse the situation and return to normal, said Wen-ti Sung, a political scientist who teaches at ANU’s Taiwan studies programme and works on US-Taiwan-China relations.  “In terms of propaganda, China’s state media focuses on presenting a positive image ofPutin, repairing the supreme leader’s image of unassailability and control, as well as highlighting continued stability of Russian society,” he told Al Jazeera. In a lengthy article on Sunday, the officialXinhuanews agency noted that “Xinhua reporters found that the incident did not cause a major disorder in Russian society and people’s life in Moscow and beyond was barely affected” despite some restrictions on movement. The tabloid Global Times, citing several Chinese experts, stressed that “despite the Western media saying the revolt exposed theweaknessof the Putin administration … the Kremlin maintains a strong capability of deterrence, which will further increase its authority.” The article included experts like Cui Heng, an assistant research fellow from the Center for Russian Studies of East China Normal University,  who made remarks like “quelling the revolt in such a short period of time actually consolidated the authority of the Putin administration, which has little impact on thefront-line battlefieldbetween Russia and Ukraine.” While China has officially remained neutral in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Beijing has provided vital economic support to Russia in the face of Western sanctions, and continues to refer to Moscow as a close “strategic ally”. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian leader Vladimir Putin also maintainclose personal ties, and are likely to continue doing so for the foreseeable future, ANU’s Sung said. “Xi still prefers Putin to the alternatives, but Beijing now has reasons to have more reservations and become more transactional in dealings with Putin,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/26/russias-internal-affair-china-plays-down-wagner-mutiny-impact
Australia announces new $74m assistance package to Ukraine,The money will go towards providing new military vehicles and artillery ammunition but funds are also being sent for humanitarian needs.,"Australia, one of the biggest non-NATO contributors to Ukraine, is to send an additional 70 military vehicles to Ukraine as part of its latest military assistance package for the country. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced the 110 million Australian dollars ($73.5m) package on Monday and told reporters the plan had been under consideration before the weekend’stumult in Russia. The package will include 28 M113 armoured vehicles, 14 special operations vehicles, 28 medium trucks and 14 trailers as well as an additional supply of 105mm artillery ammunition. “Australia is unwavering in our resolve to condemn and oppose Russia’s actions and to help Ukraine achieve victory,” Albanese said. Defence Minister Richard Marles said he was “proud” of the additional support Australia was offering. “We expect this to be a protracted conflict, and so we will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes,” he told reporters. The package, which did not include the Hawkei light armoured patrol vehicles or more Bushmaster infantry vehicles requested by Kyiv, comes as Ukrainecontinues a counteroffensiveto push Russian forces from areas they have occupied in the east of the country. Serhiy Cherevatyi, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s eastern military command, said the military advanced at least 600 metres (1,970 ft) over the previous day near Bakhmut, a citytaken by Wagner forcesin May after months of fighting. The Russian defence ministry said there had been at least 10 attacks in that area, which they repelled. Australia will also extend duty-free access for goods imported from Ukraine for a further 12 months to support its recovery and trade opportunities, the statement said. The additional commitments take Australia’s total contribution to support Ukraine to 790 million Australian dollars ($529m), just more than three-quarters of it in military assistance. There will, however, be an extra 10 million Australian dollars ($6.7m) for the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund, a United Nations-led fund to meet the urgent needs of millions of Ukrainian civilians caught up in the conflict. Foreign Minister Penny Wong saidsupporting Ukrainewas important because the principle that a “large country cannot simply change the borders of another country matters to us all”. She said that was something she had stressed to counterparts in the Pacific andSoutheast Asia, according to the Age newspaper.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/26/australia-announces-new-74m-assistance-package-to-ukraine

US officials see weakened Putin as Russia tumult reveals ‘cracks’,Members of US Congress say Wagner’s revolt has exposed Putin’s rule as more fragile than previously thought.,"The unprecedented challenge to Russian President Vladimir Putin byWagner Group fightershas exposed “cracks” in the strength of his leadership that may take weeks or months to play out, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said, as Russia ally China says it supports Moscow in “protecting national stability”. In a series of television interviews, Blinken and members of the United States Congress said that Saturday’s turmoil in Russia hasweakened Putinin ways that could aid Ukraine’s counteroffensive against Russian forces within its territory while benefitting Russia’s neighbours, including Poland and the Baltic states. “I don’t think we’ve seen the final act,” Blinken said on ABC’s This Week news programme after an aborted mutiny by forces led by Wagner Group founderYevgeny Prigozhin. Blinken said tensions that sparked the action had been growing for months and added the threat of “internal matter” could affect Moscow’s military capabilities in Ukraine. “We’ve seen more cracks emerge in the Russian façade. It is too soon to tell exactly where they go, and when they get there. But certainly, we have all sorts of new questions that Putin is going to have to address in the weeks and months ahead,” Blinken said. US officials expect to learn more soon about the events that unfolded in Russia, includingdetails of the dealwith Prigozhin mediated by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko that ledWagnerfighters to return to their bases. Forces led by Prigozhin, a former Putin ally and ex-convict, have fought the bloodiest of battles in Russia’s 16-month war in Ukraine. Meanwhile, China – which has maintained close ties with Putin since the Ukraine operation was launched – called the revolt an “internal affair” and expressed support for Putin’s government. This came after China’s Foreign Minister Qin Gang met Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Rudenko in Beijing on Sunday. According to Yulia Shapovalova, a journalist in Moscow, Russians are continuing to support Putin as “he controlled the situation” but “many admit the mutiny has dealt a blow to President Putin’s reputation”. “Others say that Prigozhin is obviously a player in Vladimir Putin’s political system and all he has – the funds, human resources, all the weapons – all that comes from the state and he totally depends on Vladimir Putin, despite his rivalry with the Ministry of Defence,” Shapovalova said. According to The Washington Post and New York Times, US intelligence agencies had picked up signs days ago that Prigozhin was preparing his troops to mutiny, with officials holding briefings at the White House, the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill about the potential for unrest a full day before Prigozhin made his move against the Russian military leadership. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner said Putin’s future actions in Ukraine could be inhibited by Prigozhin’s assertion that the rationale for invading Ukraine was based on lies. “Taking down the very premise makes it much more difficult for Putin to continue to turn to the Russian people and say, we should continue to send people to die,” Turner told CBS’s Face the Nation programme. Retired US Air Force General Philip Breedlove, former head of US European Command, said the turmoil demonstrates a degradation of Russian capabilities. “One of the outcomes, I believe, of the last 36 hours, maybe 48 hours, is that the institutions that we have long seen as being very secure in Russia are slowly unraveling,” Breedlove said in an interview. “The whole institution of the military now, the appearance of what the Russian military is, is much diminished.” US Senator Ben Cardin said the weekend turmoil in Russia does not ease Washington’s need to continue aiding Ukraine as it launches its long-awaited counteroffensive against Russia. “This is a critical time for Ukraine. This counteroffensive is going to be defining as to where we’re going to be in the next year or two,” Cardin, a Democrat who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told Fox News.    Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he discussed the weekend’s turmoil in a “positive and inspiring” phone call with US President Joe Biden and that the events had exposed the weakness of Putin’s rule. In a statement, Zelenskyy called for global pressure to be exerted on Russia and said that he and Biden had also discussed further expanding defence cooperation with an emphasis on long-range weapons. According to a White House statement, Zelenskyy and Biden discussed Ukraine’s ongoing counteroffensive. “President Biden reaffirmed unwavering US support, including through continued security, economic, and humanitarian aid,” the statement said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/25/us-officials-see-weakened-putin-as-russia-tumult-reveals-cracks
‘All bets are off’: An uncertain future after Wagner mutiny,"Speculation abounds on social media, but experts warn against drawing conclusions on the fate of the Wagner Group.","Following Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin’sshort-lived mutiny, Russian President Vladimir Putin and his government find themselves in unchartered territory. The crisis appears to have been averted, for now, but what happens next for Russia and the Wagner Group remains uncertain. “All bets are off,” Keir Giles, a senior consulting fellow of the Russia and Eurasia Programme at Chatham House, told Al Jazeera on Sunday. “We simply don’t have any fixed data points that we can rely on to figure out what’s going to happen next.” The events, which began on Saturday, appeared to take everyone but the battle-hardened mercenary group by surprise. Wagner forces rapidly took control of Rostov, one of Russia’s largest cities, where they were met with minimal resistance from local security forces and occupied the regional military headquarters. They continued to march on Moscow before Prigozhin ordered his mercenaries to turn back 200km (124 miles) from the capital. He agreed to go into exile in Belarus after brokering a deal with the country’s President Alexander Lukashenko. The mutiny appears to be over, but the fate of the mercenary group that has proven so influential in Ukraine, as well as Syria and many African countries, remains to be seen. The Kremlin has publicly announced aspects of the deal, including the agreement that Prigozhin will be allowed to go to Belarus without facing criminal charges. Lukashenko’s office said the settlement contains security guarantees for Wagner troops, but details are scant and, according to Giles, confusing. The specifics of the#Lukashenko-negotiated deal, how and on what timeline it will be implemented, the expected outcomes for each party, and the extent to which all involved parties will follow the agreement, remain unclear at this time.https://t.co/M5yx53y7GVhttps://t.co/LKDSQ1lGGh — ISW (@TheStudyofWar)June 25, 2023   “There are too many unanswered questions around this supposed deal that they’ve arrived at, but even the questions that do seem to be being answered make no sense,” Giles said. Joana de Deus Pereira, a senior research fellow at RUSI Europe, told Al Jazeera that it is “crucial to exercise caution and critically analyse the information” coming out of Russia in the past 24 hours. “Nothing is what it seems, and what it seems is not frequently what it is,” she said in an email. Public challenges of the Russian president rarely end well, with many leading critics, such as opposition figureAlexey Navalny, often ending up poisoned or dying under suspicious circumstances. “People that cross Vladimir Putin tend to have a bad track record of falling out of windows in Russia. We’ve seen them eliminated with little fanfare and in multiple, very brutal ways,” Colin Clarke, director of research at The Soufan Group, told Al Jazeera.    On Saturday, in a televised speech, Putin accused Prigozhin of “betrayal” and “treason” and described his actions as “a stab in the back of our troops and the people of Russia”. “All those who prepared the rebellion will suffer inevitable punishment,” Putin said, adding, “The armed forces and other government agencies have received the necessary orders.” Clarke said that Prigozhin’s deal with Belarus does not necessarily guarantee his safety. “I don’t think Putin will shy away from exacting revenge and punishing Prigozhin if he thinks that that’s necessary, and I think he probably will,” he said.    Putin has also proven to not be very accepting of criticism of Russia’s “special operation” in Ukraine, and has called for a “self-purification” to rid his country of anyone who questions the invasion. Prigozhin publicly questioned the rationale behind Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine launched on February 24, 2022. “The Ministry of Defence is trying to deceive the public and the president and spin the story that there was insane levels of aggression from the Ukrainian side and that they were going to attack us together with the whole NATO block,”, he said in a post on his Telegram channel. Since the Lukashenko deal was struck, Putin and top Russian officials have remained tight-lipped on Prigozhin’s future. Other leaders allied to Putin, however, have come out with criticism of the Wagner chief, including Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov. Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro calls Prigozhin a ""terrorist"" and condemned the Wagner Group's ""irrational threat"" One of the only Russian allies to explicitly condemn Prigozhin by name, which underscores the limited international support that Putin got during this crisis — Samuel Ramani (@SamRamani2)June 24, 2023  Deus Pereira believes that Prigozhin will “remain quiet for the next days” having left Rostov with much fanfare. “This is one of his biggest objectives – he was recognised by the population,” she explained. Prigozhin’s rhetoric following the deal may also have been a public relations exercise, according to Deus Pereira. After the deal was struck, she said, Prigozhin claimed it was to avoid “Russian blood” being shed – and he projected an image of “dignity” that stood in contrast to the “manifestations of warlordism portrayed by Kadyrov”. The Russian government has said it will not prosecute Wagner fighters who took part in the mutiny, while those who did not join were to be offered contracts by the Defence Ministry.    Prigozhin ordered his troops back to their field camps in Ukraine, where they had been fighting alongside regular Russian soldiers. On Saturday, Russian media reported Wagner troops downed several helicopters and a military communications plane. Russia’s Defence Ministry has not commented on these events. “While Prigozhin may be the face of the group, Wagner is a product and creation of Putin’s regime to be able to operate in several scenarios with plausible deniability. This will continue, possibly under a new name,” Deus Pereira said. The events of Saturday could have major repercussions in Africa, where the mercenary group has played anincreasingly central rolein long-running internal conflicts. The United States has accused the group of exploiting natural resources in Mali, the Central African Republic and elsewhere to fund fighting in Ukraine. The group has also been accused of playing an active role inSudan– where there is an ongoing civil war. A suspension of Wagner operations in Africa could impact the group’s finances. However, Clarke believes that the Wagner Group’s influence abroad could help protect it from being completely isolated by the Russian government. “It’s not possible for the Kremlin to marginalise Wagner,” he said. “Russia and Vladimir Putin depend on and, in fact, need the Wagner Group to carry out Russian foreign policy, not just in Ukraine, but around the world, in Libya, Syria, the Central African Republic, Mali and elsewhere.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/25/all-bets-are-off-an-uncertain-future-after-wagner-mutiny

Timeline: How Wagner Group’s revolt against Russia unfolded,Feud with Wagner Group owner Yevgeny Prigozhin is seen as the biggest threat Russian President Vladimir Putin has faced to his 22-year rule.,"Mutinous Russian mercenary fighters from theWagner Groupwere making their way to the capital before their leader Yevgeny Prigozhin ordered their to return to base to avoid bloodshed. This latest incident with Prigozhin in a months-long feud with Russia’s defence ministry over the fight in Ukraine was the biggest threat President Vladimir Putin has faced in his 22-year rule. The group rose to prominence after taking an increasinglyvisible role in the war in Ukraine, including hoisting the Russian flag in the city of Bakhmut after a months-long battle.

Wagner mutiny reflects fault lines in Russia: Analysts,"Ukraine war has produced ‘entitlement-carrying actors’ who have now clashed, moving the military action inside Russia, observers say.","There was a meme, “Bombing Voronezh”, poking fun at how Russia’s government responds to sanctions in ways that hurt itself. Today, the meme has become a reality as, afterseizing the city of Rostov, mutinous Wagner mercenaries advance on the actual city of Voronezh, halfway to Moscow. “I saw clouds of smoke from where the oil depot blew up, not far from my house,” 25-year-old Olesya from Voronezh told Al Jazeera. “Periodically, [people] post videos of how in different parts of the city either a shell is falling, or they’re shooting, or they blow up a car. There are lots of soldiers on the streets. My family and I do not leave the house, but just in case we’ve packed our things.” Olesya told Al Jazeera she has not heard of any casualties yet. Early on Saturday, Wagner troops took control of Rostov, one of Russia’s largest cities, meeting minimal resistance from local security forces and occupying the regional military headquarters. A video soon emerged ofWagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhinmeeting with senior Russian defence officials in Rostov. The oligarch and former Kremlin ally hasclaimedhis actions are not an attempted coup but a “march of justice” against the military high command that has “destroyed many tens of thousands of Russian soldiers’ lives”. Marat Gabidullin, a former Wagner fighter who was deployed in Syria, told Al Jazeera he believed Prigozhin “overestimated his genius, as it happened to him before”, and does not think the mutiny will succeed. But from a military point of view, Gabidullin added, Wagner is in the right place. “He’s in a strong position for negotiations: he managed to capture the headquarters of the [Southern Military District] group, located within the boundaries of a large city,” he explained. “The headquarters are his hostages. To smoke him out of there, you need to attract large forces. His mercenaries have learned to fight in the city; starting an operation against them means deploying a lot of military personnel.”    But Wagner’s revolt has implications aboutPresident Vladimir Putin‘s grip on power, the Russian war effort, and the state of affairs at home. “Among the few remaining sources of authority for the Putin regime was his longstanding claim that he restored ‘law and order’ after the ‘chaotic’ 1990s,” Kevork Oskanian, lecturer in comparative politics at the University of Exeter, told Al Jazeera. “This perception will now lie in tatters and leave him much more vulnerable over the longer term, even if he eventually prevails.” Historically, much of Putin’s popularity rested on restoring stability in Russians’ lives: During the post-Soviet collapse of the 1990s, Russia was plagued with turf wars between organised crime syndicates, pyramid schemes robbed citizens of money, an attempted coup left more than one hundred corpses on the streets of Moscow, while a real war raged with Chechen separatists to the south. He did this by incorporating a wide set of business, political, religious and even criminal interests into what has been termed his “power vertical”. Up until now, he has been able to balance the competing interests of the Russian elite with a great level of success. But as the war in Ukraine has dragged on with no clear path to victory in sight, that hasempoweredplayers such as Prigozhin, as well as Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov – who commands his own private militia known as “the kadyrovtsy” – at the expense of the official armed forces. “The current unravelling of the seeming Russian political stability reflects the internal pressures and the fault lines of a country that waged an unjust and disastrous war with its neighbour,” Gulnaz Sharafutdinova, professor of Russian politics at King’s College London, told Al Jazeera. “The war produced the inter-elite pressures, blame-shifting games and the entitlement-carrying actors who have now openly clashed, thereby moving the military action inside Russia.”   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/24/wagner-mutiny-reflects-fault-lines-in-russia-analysts
Wagner revolt in Russia dims outlook for its operations in Africa,Mali and CAR sought closer ties with Russia and military support to fight armed groups in both countries.,"A revolt by theWagnerforce in Russia poses a diplomatic quandary for Mali and Central African Republic (CAR), where forces from the mercenary group have played anincreasingly central rolein long-running internal conflicts. As the Wagner fighters barrelled towards Moscow on Saturday after seizing a southern city overnight, spokespeople for the governments of Mali and CAR declined to comment on the turmoil and how it might affect their security strategies against armed groups. Both countries havesought closer tieswith Russia and military support to battle the armed fighters, saying in the past that their military cooperation agreements are with Russia rather than with Wagner. “[Wagner’s] presence in Mali is sponsored by the Kremlin and if Wagner is at odds with the Kremlin … naturally Mali will suffer the consequences on the security front,” said Malian political analyst Bassirou Doumbia. Mali, where military authorities seized power in coups in 2020 and 2021, is battling a years-long operation against armed groups affiliated with ISIL (ISIS) and al-Qaeda. It has said Russian forces there are not Wagner mercenaries but trainers helping local troops with equipment bought from Russia. But the alliance has soured relations with the United Nations and alienated Western powers, who have said the fighters are Wagner forces and have alleged that they have committedpossible war crimesalongside Malian soldiers. The governments in Mali and Russia have denied the allegations. Wagner’s continued presence in Mali amid the continuing insurrection in Russia could prove problematic for Bamako’s relations with Moscow, which last year committed to send Mali shipments of fuel, fertiliser and food worth about $100m. “[The] exact consequences for Mali really depend on factors largely unknown such as the organisational autonomy of Wagner and their chain of command, and, of course, whether things escalate or not between [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and Wagner,” said Yvan Guichaoua, senior lecturer at the Brussels School of International Studies. He said there were no reports of unexpected troop movements in Mali as of Saturday morning. The power struggle in Russia could also have significant ramifications for CAR, wherehundreds of Russian operatives, including many from Wagner, have been helping the government fight several rebel insurgencies since 2018. Both CAR and Mali have been drawn increasingly into Russia’s orbit in recent years as the Kremlin sought greater influence inFrancophone Africato the dismay of former colonial power France, which has faced anti-French protests in the region and worsening relations with several West African governments. In February, French President Emmanuel Macron described the deployment of Wagner troops in Africa as the “life insurance of failing regimes in Africa” that will only sow misery. A suspension of Wagner operations in Africa could impact the group’s finances. The United States last October accused the mercenaries of exploiting natural resources in CAR, Mali and elsewhere to fund fighting in Ukraine – a charge Russia rejected at the time. Wagner began operating in Africa and the Middle East when it was founded in 2014 and was thought to have about 5,000 fighters, but has grown significantly since then. The paramilitary group made a name for itself internationally through its involvement in Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’sCrimean Peninsula in 2014, a move widely viewed as illegal by the international community. The group has also been involved in the continuing Russia-Ukraine war that began in February 2022 after Wagner forces were deployed in Ukraine on March 28, 2022. The group has 50,000 active fighters in Ukraine, according to British intelligence. According to the US National Security Council, while about 80 percent of its troops in Ukraine were withdrawn from prisons, it was stated that Wagner was effective in Russia’s alleged capture ofBakhmutin eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk region. Wagner has also sent fighters outside Ukraine to various conflicts in the Middle East and Africa, including the war inSyria. The group has cemented strong ties with several African governments over the past decade with operations in at least eight African nations, according to leaked US documents.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/24/wagner-revolt-in-russia-clouds-outlook-for-its-operations-in-afri
"Wagner boss calls off march on Moscow, agrees to exile in Belarus",Backdown by Yevgeny Prigozhin came after Belarus’s leader negotiated with him to end the mutiny.,"Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin ordered his mercenaries to halt their march on Moscow to avoid “shedding Russian blood” and agreed to live in exile in Belarus – ending one of the biggest challenges to President Vladimir Putin’s decades-long rule. Prigozhin said while his men were just 200km (120 miles) from the Russian capital, he decided on Saturday to turn them back to prevent killings. “They wanted to disband the Wagner military company. We embarked on a march of justice on June 23. Now, the moment has come when blood could be spilled,” said Prigozhin in an audio message. “Understanding responsibility [for the chance] that Russian blood will be spilled on one side, we are turning our columns around and going back to field camps as planned.”  Moscow braced for the arrival of the private army led by the rebellious mercenary commander by erecting checkpoints with armoured vehicles and troops on its southern edge. Red Square was shut down and the mayor urged motorists to stay off some roads. Wagner’s lightning insurrection appeared to develop with little pushback from Russia’s regular armed forces, raising questions aboutPutin’s grip on powerin the nuclear-armed nation even after the abrupt halt to Wagner’s advance.    Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko negotiated with the mercenary boss to stop Wagner’s troop movement after discussing the issue with Putin. Prigozhin accepted Lukashenko’s offer to halt the Wagner group’s advance and further steps to de-escalate the tensions, Lukashenko’s office said, adding the proposed settlement contains security guarantees for Wagner troops. Prigozhin did not say whether the Kremlin responded to his demand toremove Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu. The Wagner chief will move to neighbouring Belarus as part of the deal and the criminal case against him will be closed, the Kremlin said on Saturday. Prigozhin’s troops who joined him in the uprising will not face prosecution and those who did not will be offered contracts by the defence ministry, spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Lukashenko offered to mediate, with Putin’s agreement, because he had known Prigozhin personally for about 20 years, Peskov said. “Avoiding bloodshed, internal confrontation, and clashes with unpredictable results was the highest goal.” Putin faced the biggest threat to his 22-year rule yet with rebel mercenaries advancing towards the Russian capital after seizing a key southern military base. Wagner began pulling back fighters and equipment from the Russian city of Rostov-on-Don late on Saturday. Pavel Felgenhauer, a Russian defence analyst, said it remained to be seen how the incident plays out. “What’s really going to happen, we’ll have to see tomorrow. And who actually did give which concessions to whom,” he told Al Jazeera. “Ceasefires don’t hold that easily. Before you see the small print, it’s not the time to say that it’s over. It can easily unravel in an hour or two, or tomorrow.” Anna Matveeva, from the Russia Institute at King’s College London, said the events marked a significant change for Russia’s political landscape. “It’s the first chapter in Russia’s political transition. That’s the opening bid. We will see more developments to come,” she told Al Jazeera. If he accedes to Prigozhin’s demand to remove Shoigu, Prigozhin would emerge from the crisis as a clear winner in a major blow to Putin’s authority. If Prigozhin agreed not to press the demand, Putin could award him with more lucrative government contracts like those on which he has built his fortune in the past. However, it would be awkward and politically damaging for Putin to backtrack after branding Prigozhin a backstabbing traitor. Some observers speculated that Prigozhin could make concessions such as putting the Wagner Group under federal authority, or he could shift the force’sactivities back to Africa, where his mercenaries have been active in recent years. In a televised speech to the nation, Putin called the rebellion a “betrayal” and “treason”. “All those who prepared the rebellion will suffer inevitable punishment,” Putin said. “The armed forces and other government agencies have received the necessary orders.” Authorities declared a “counterterrorist regime” in the capital and its surrounding region, enhancing security and restricting some movement. On the southern outskirts, troops erected checkpoints, arranged sandbags and set up machine guns. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Saturday the revolt by Wagner troops exposed complete chaos in the country. “Today, the world can see that the masters of Russia control nothing. And that means nothing. Simply complete chaos. An absence of any predictability,” Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address. Addressing Putin while switching from Ukrainian to Russian language, Zelenskyy said, “The longer your troops remain on Ukrainian land, the greater the devastation they will bring to Russia.”   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/24/wagner-boss-says-march-on-moscow-halted-to-avoid-bloodshed
"Ukraine responds to Wagner mutiny in Russia with caution, hope","While the leadership in Kyiv is weighing how best to seize the moment, average Ukrainians are far less optimistic.","Kyiv, Ukraine— Ukraine’s top military expert has said that Kyiv has to make a “strategic, principal decision” on how to benefit from theunfolding turmoil in Russia. One such move could be an order to invade western Russia to bypass massive defence installations on the 1,000-kilometre-long (620-mile-long) front line in eastern and southern Ukraine, according to Lieutenant General Ihor Romanenko. “Those who make unorthodox decisions and implement them will succeed,” the former deputy chief of Ukraine’s general staff of armed forces told Al Jazeera, adding that it was time to strike Russian forces in the back. Such a plan looked like a “fairy tale” just a day ago, but the panic and disarray in Russia as troops of theWagnerprivate military contractor march on Moscow may provide Kyiv with a perfect opportunity to deliver the least expected blow, he said. Ukraine’s Western backers will, however, inevitably step in to dissuade Kyiv from such decisions to avoid Moscow’s use of nuclear weapons, Romanenko added. “Of course, our allies will meddle, will try to influence it somehow, in the ‘let’s-not-let-something-bad-happen’ way, to avoid escalation, the use of the weapons of mass destruction,” he said. The path to western Russia has already been paved. TheRussian Volunteer Corps(RVC), a group of fugitive Russian ultra-nationalists fighting for Ukraine, has conductedthree incursionsinto western Russian regions. They were backed by former Russian war prisoners who fight for Ukraine, as well as by volunteers from neighbouring Poland and Belarus. On June 1, they crossed into the western Russian region ofBelgorodto attack Shebekino, a city of 40,000, and seize the village ofNovaya Tavolzhanka. Tens of thousands of civilians fled Belgorod, and Novaya Tavolzhanka became Russia’s first area beyond Moscow’s control. On Saturday, RVC head urged its supporters to “get ready”. The group’s head, Denis Nikitin, wrote on RVC’s Telegram channel thatWagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhinemerged from the “processes of rot and decay” in Russia. “And what we have is an ambitious patriot, popular among people and servicemen, who has his own private army; the population demoralised by the prolonged bloody war and an incoherent government. Let’s get ready!” Nikitin wrote. While the top brass in Kyiv distanced themselves from the RVC’s incursions, Prigozhin’s rebellion caught them by surprise. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, “Russia’s weakness is obvious” and that the longer Moscow keeps its troops and mercenaries in Ukraine, the more chaos it would invite back home. “And the longer Russia keeps its troops and mercenaries on our land, the more chaos, pain and problems it will have for itself later,” Zelenskyy wrote.

Time to put an end to the evil everyone despised but was too afraid to tear down. — Dmytro Kuleba (@DmytroKuleba)June 24, 2023  Russia has already experienced a war that turned into a quagmire and showed how disorganised, demoralised and badly supplied the army was. Squads of servicemen rioted and marched home, triggering popular unrest and the government’s fall, a bloody civil war and the emergence of a totalitarian dictatorship. This is not a prediction of what may or may not happen in Russia next, but it is what took place more than a century ago, when dispirited tsarist troops left the World War I front lines to flock back to Russia. Tsar Nicholas II abdicated in 1917 after the Bolshevik Revolution, which paved the way for the Communist takeover. Russian President Vladimir Putin recalled the fear of “another 1917” in hisnational addresson Saturday. His Ukrainian counterpart also referred to the fateful year. Putin “again and again scares [Russians] with another 1917, but he can’t lead it to anything else,” Zelenskyy tweeted. “Ukraine is able to protect Europe from the spread of Russian evil and chaos. We keep our strength, unity and strength. All our commanders, all our soldiers know what to do,” Zelenskyy wrote. Average Ukrainians were far less optimistic about Russia’s possible disintegration as it may trigger the exodus of millions of refugees and the use of nuclear weapons. “This is happening again, and Ukraine will suffer greatly,” Andriy Lokshin, who serves in the “territorial defence” volunteer militia in Kyiv, told Al Jazeera. “We don’t need another Wedding in Malinovka,” he said, referring to the 1967 musical describing life in a Ukrainian village during the 1918-20 civil war in the former Russian empire. Other Ukrainians responded with schadenfreude and said that Putin’s plans of a blitzkrieg in Ukraine backfired. “They wanted to take Kyiv in three days, but got Rostov-on-Don in one,” Halyna Kerzhenets, who sells souvenirs in central Kyiv, told Al Jazeera, referring to the southwestern Russian city Prigozhin seized early on Saturday. Predictably, memes and jokes about the mutiny have been going viral. One of them ridiculed the Russian Ministry of Defence’s exaggerations while reporting Ukraine’s battlefield losses. “250,000 Wagner fighters were killed, 25,000 tanks destroyed, and three Prigozhins taken prisoner,” it read. Yet, observers saw the unfolding developments as a replay of the “Times of Trouble” that followed the death of Russian Tsar Ivan the Terrible more than four centuries ago. “Almost a reincarnation of the algorithm of Ivan the Terrible’s era, but in the mode of condensed historic time,” Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kushch told Al Jazeera. The notoriously cruel tsar was succeeded by his mentally challenged, childless son and two noblemen, as Russian nobles consolidated power and Poland tried to install its own candidates, including two “false” sons of Ivan the Terrible. “According to the genre’s laws, there must be an emergence of the oligarchic ‘seven noblemen’ and false-Putins, for the real Putin has enough doubles,” Kushch said.

I’ll be speaking to some of them later today and the most important thing is for all parties to behave responsibly,” he told the BBC. The country’s defence ministry said that “over the coming hours, the loyalty of Russia’s security forces, and especially the Russian National Guard, will be key to how this crisis plays out.” “This represents the most significant challenge to the Russian state in recent times,” it said. It added that Wagner troops had “almost certainly” occupied key security sites in Rostov-on-Don and that “further Wagner units were moving north through Voronezh Oblast, almost certainly aiming to get to Moscow”. “With very limited evidence of fighting between Wagner and Russian security forces, some have likely remained passive, acquiescing to Wagner,” it said. European Council chief Charles Michel tweeted the bloc was “closely monitoring the situation in Russia as it unfolds.

President Andrzej Duda said: “In connection with the situation in Russia, this morning we held consultations with the prime minister and the ministry of defence, as well as with allies. “The course of events beyond our eastern border is monitored on an ongoing basis.” German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has spoken to her counterparts within the Group of Seven industrialised nations, the foreign ministry in Berlin said, adding the German government’s crisis team was also meeting. “German nationals in Russia should definitely take advantage of our adapted travel advice,” Baerbock said earlier, after the ministry told travellers to avoid Moscow city centre. German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said it is too early to guess the possible consequences of the armed uprising and what it may mean forthe Kremlin’s war on Ukraine. “That is difficult to assess, especially since we do not know how unstable Russia will become and who will ultimately have the upper hand and who will join forces with whom,” he said. French President Emmanuel Macron “is following the situation very closely,” the Elysee said. “We remain focused on supporting Ukraine.” Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said the events taking place in Russia showed “how the aggression against Ukraine is causing instability also within Russia”, her office said in a statement. Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said for the moment there was no concern for Italians living in Russia, but said they were “advised to be cautious”. “With regard to the ongoing military invasion of Ukraine and the possible threat of erosion of the security situation in the country, especially for citizens of EU and NATO countries, our strong warning against travel to the Russian Federation is still in place,” news agency CTK quoted Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky as saying. Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev spoke to Putin by phone, Tokayev’s office said, and described the events in Russia as its internal affair while saying rule of law was necessary to maintain order. Putin briefed Tokayev on the situation, the Kazakh president’s office said, and thanked him for the understanding Kazakhstan has expressed. Russian state news agency TASS said Putin had also spoken to the leaders of Belarus and Uzbekistan. The country’s Security Council said in a statement that Minsk remained an ally of Russia and that internal disputes were “a gift to the collective West”. Qatar expressed its concern over the situation in Russia and called for “maximum restraint” from all parties. “The foreign ministry warns that escalation in Russia and Ukraine will have negative consequences for international peace and security and will impact food and energy supplies,” it said in a statement. The ministry called for restraint, reason and “sparing civilians the repercussions of confrontation”. “The escalation in Russia and Ukraine will have negative repercussions on international peace and security, and on food and energy supplies, which are already affected by the Russian-Ukrainian crisis,” the ministry said.

‘Spitting on soldiers’ graves’: Russians react to Wagner mutiny,Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin has angered Putin supporters as he stages mutiny against military command.,"The Russian-Ukrainian war took an unexpected turn on Saturday after the head of the Wagner Group, which has played a prominent role in the Kremlin’s war in Ukraine, called for a rebellion against Russia’s top military brass. The mercenary outfit Wagner, which carried out much of the grunt work in the battle of Bakhmut, mutinied against high command and seized the city of Rostov in southwestern Russia, largely unopposed by local security forces. The mutiny is the fruition of a long-running feud between Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin and Russian military chiefs. Prigozhin claims to have shot down three Russian helicopters, and that the armed forces have fired rockets on Wagner’s positions. Al Jazeera could not independently verify his claims. “Any internal turmoil is a mortal threat to our statehood and to us as a nation,” Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a televised speech on Saturday. “This is a blow to Russia, to our people. And our actions to defend the fatherland against such a threat will be tough. All those who deliberately stepped onto the path of treachery, who prepared an armed insurrection, who followed the path of blackmail and terrorist methods, will suffer an inevitable punishment, will have to answer before the law and before our people.” Although no one is certain what will happen next, all voices agree on one thing: this rebellion undermines Moscow’s war effort in Ukraine. “We should help even the devil if he’s against this regime!” exiled tycoon and Putin opponent Mikhail Khodorkovsky wrote on Instagram. “We should help because there is no worse crime than unleashing an aggressive war. If one criminal is ready to interfere with another – now’s not the time to make sour faces – we need to help, and then, if necessary, we will fight this one [Prigozhin], too. And yes, this is just the beginning.” Supporters of the Russian government decried the mutiny and urged for unity. “It’s a tough time, I didn’t think I’d live to see this,” said pro-Kremlin pundit and talk show host Vladimir Solovyov in a video address to his million-plus Telegram followers. “[Wagner’s] 25,000 men would be very useful at the front for the march on Lviv, Kyiv and if necessary, even further. But when you look at what’s going on, you ask yourself, how did this happen?” “The enemy is there, in Ukraine. We need to be fighting with Ukro-fascism. Stop, before it’s too late. There’s nothing scarier than civil war.” Russia’s former space chief Dmitry Rogozin said: “In war, you need to shove your political ambitions up your ass and support the front with all your might.” “Any attempt to weaken it is nothing but aiding the enemy.” Pro-Kremlin journalist Armen Gasparyan, who is wanted in Ukraine for “publically calling for the genocide of Ukrainian people”, called Prigozhin’s actions a betrayal and a “stab in the back of the army”. “Spitting on the graves of soldiers and officers who gave their lives to the Motherland,” he wrote on Telegram. “But we have a president and there is a consolidation in our society for the sake of a holy goal. We will win! Stop, do not go against the Motherland!” Igor “Strelkov” Girkin, the former Russian military intelligence operative who led the initial uprising in Ukraine’s Donbas back in 2014, analysed the situation at length for his 845,000 Telegram followers. He called Prigozhin’s claim of a missile attack on Wagner’s positions “a complete lie”. “To eliminate Wagner, it’s completely unnecessary to inflict blows on any camp,” he assessed. “It’s enough to whack Prigozhin himself. Well, maybe someone else from his inner circle along with him. And that’s all. And to hit ordinary soldiers and commanders is utter stupidity – even [generals Sergei] Shoigu and [Valery] Gerasimov have enough brains to understand this.” Girkin said he doubted that Prigozhin will be able to hold out for long, lacking the resources, support from the military and even control over Wagner itself, with much of his manpower still in Ukraine, to successfully march on Moscow. “If after five-six hours Wagner does not achieve significant success and military units do not openly go over to its side, the rebellion will drag on, and with each passing day its final success will be more and more improbable,” he wrote. “Well, if the Kremlin doesn’t screw up out of habit, of course, and start urgently searching for compromises.” Still, the fact of such a mutiny taking place is a sign of the tenuous grip President Putin has on power, according to Russian economist and University of Chicago professor Konstantin Sonin. “The fact that Wagner was able to easily capture the million-strong Rostov-on-Don, the 10th largest city in Russia, in which the headquarters of the Southern Military District is located, shows that Prigozhin’s plan has serious support among the regular army. Wagner was allowed into Rostov without resistance,” Sonin wrote on Facebook. “One way or another, this brings the end of both Putin (not in two years, as I wrote in the spring, but faster), and the war. Even if nothing changes at all, Prigozhin is captured or killed, and key Wagnerites are imprisoned, what has already happened is the collapse of the state on an epic scale, a historic episode.”   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/24/spitting-on-soldiers-graves-russians-react-to-wagner-mutiny
‘Internal betrayal’ in Russia: Transcript of Putin’s address,"The Russian president says his country is fighting for its future, as he accuses Wagner chief Prighozin of fomenting armed civil conflict.","Speaking during an emergency televised address in Moscow on Saturday, President Vladimir Putin has promised that he would not allow Russia to slip into civil war, after Yevgeny Prighozin, the leader of the Wagner mercenary force,seizeda key military headquarters overseeing the offensive in Ukraine. Below is the full transcript of Putin’s address: “I appeal to the citizens of Russia, to the personnel of the armed forces, law enforcement and security services, fighters and commanders currently fighting on their positions, repelling the enemy attacks, doing it heroically. I spoke to the commanders in all directions last night. I appeal also to those who were deceptively pulled into the criminal adventure, pushed towards a serious crime of an armed mutiny. Today Russia is fighting fiercely for its future, repelling the aggression of neo-Nazis and their handlers. Directed against us is the whole military, economical and information machines of the West. We fight for the lives and security of our people; for our sovereignty and independence; for the right to remain Russia, a state with a thousand-year history. This battle, where the fate of our people is being decided, requires all our forces to be united; unity, consolidation and responsibility. Everything that weakens us must be put to the side, any differences that may be used or are used by our enemies to disrupt us from within. Thus, the actions splitting our unity are a betrayal of our people, of our brothers in combat who fight now at the front line. It’s a stab in the back of our country and our people. It was such a blow that was dealt to Russia in 1917 when the country was fighting in World War I, but its victory was stolen. Intrigues, bickering and politicking behind the back of the army and the people turned out to be the greatest catastrophe, the destruction of the army and the state, loss of huge territories, resulting in a tragedy and a civil war. Russians were killing Russians, brothers killing brothers. The beneficiaries of that were various political chevaliers of fortune and foreign powers who divided the country, and tore it into parts. We will not let this happen again. We will protect our people and state from any threats, including internal betrayal. What we’re facing is exactly a betrayal. Big ambitions and personal interests led to treason. Betrayal of one’s own country and people and of the cause that fighters of Wagner were dying for alongside our soldiers. Heroes who liberated Soledar and Artemovsk, towns and cities of the Donbas, who fought and gave their lives to Novorossiya and for the unity of the Russian world. Their name and glory have been betrayed by those who are trying to organise the mutiny, pushing the country into anarchy and fratricide, to a defeat, in the end, and capitulation. I repeat: any internal mutiny is a deadly threat to our state, to us as a nation. It’s a blow against Russia, against our people. And our actions to defend the fatherland from such a threat will be brutal. Anyone who consciously went on the path of betrayal, who prepared the armed mutiny, went on the path of blackmail and terrorist actions, will be punished inevitably. They will answer before the law and our people. The armed forces and other departments have received the necessary orders. Additional anti-terrorist security measures are now being implemented in Moscow, Moscow region, and a number of other regions. Decisive actions will be taken to stabilise the situation in Rostov-on-Don, which still remains difficult. The operation of civilian and military control departments is practically blocked. As a president of Russia and the commander-in-chief, as a citizen of Russia, I will do everything to defend the country, protect the Constitution, lives and safety, liberty of the citizens. Those who organised and prepared the military mutiny, who turned weapons against their comrades-in-arms, have betrayed Russia, and will be held accountable for that. And those who are being pulled into the crime, I’m calling on you to not make this crucial, tragic, unrepeatable mistake. Make the only right choice – stop participating in criminal actions. I believe that we will defend and preserve what’s sacred for us. And together with the motherland, we will overcome all challenges, and become even stronger.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/24/internal-betrayal-transcript-of-vladimir-putins-address
"Who is Yevgeny Prigozhin, Wagner boss on passenger list of crashed plane?","Once known as ‘Putin’s chef’, Yevgeny Prigozhin rose to prominence after mercenaries from his Wagner Group played a role in the Ukraine war.","Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the RussianWagner Groupmercenary force, was listed as a passenger on a private jet which crashed north of Moscow on Wednesday, Russia’s state-owned TASS news agency has reported, citing Rosaviatsia, Russia’s aviation authority. Prigozhin rose to prominence after taking an increasinglyvisible role in the war in Ukraine, where his mercenaries were fighting on behalf of Moscow after regular troops suffered heavy attrition and lost territory in humiliating setbacks. Wagner troopsraised a Russian flagin the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut in April after a long and bloody battle, bagging a badly needed victory in the 15-month conflict. Prigozhin turned that moment of triumph into an opportunity just days later to accuse Russia’s military top brass of being responsible for the failures in Ukraine, something only a select few can do publicly without drawing retribution from the Kremlin. The running feud with the defence ministryreached new heightsin June when the Wagner leader claimed his fighters had crossed from Ukraine into the Russian border city of Rostov-on-Don – and that they would fight anyone who tried to stop them. The Wagner chief has alsoquestionedthe official Kremlin version of why Russia invaded Ukraine. “The defence ministry is trying to deceive society and the president and tell us a story about how there was crazy aggression from Ukraine and that they were planning to attack us with the whole of NATO,” Prigozhin said in a video clip released on Telegram by his press service at the time. In an emergency televised address, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the “armed mutiny” by Wagner amounted to treason and that anyone who had taken up arms against the Russian military would be punished. The revolt was defused in a deal whereby the Kremlin said that in order to avert bloodshed, Prigozhin and some of his fighters would leave for Belarus and a criminal case against him for armed mutiny would be dropped. Confusion has surrounded the implementation of the deal and the future of Prigozhin. The Kremlin said he attended a meeting with Putin five days after the mutiny. On July 5, state television said an investigation against him was still being pursued, and broadcast footage showing cash, passports, weapons and other items it said were seized on a raid on one of his properties. But in late July, Prigozhin was photographed in St Petersburg while a Russia-Africa summit was taking place in the city. This week he appeared in a video which he suggested was shot in Africa, where Wagner has operations in several countries.  Prigozhin, 62, was convicted of robbery and assault in 1981 and sentenced to 12 years in prison. Following his release, he opened a restaurant business in Saint Petersburg in the 1990s. It was in this capacity that he got to know Putin, then the city’s deputy mayor. He used that connection to develop a catering business and won lucrative Russian government contracts that earned him the nickname, “Putin’s chef”. He later expanded into other areas, including media and an infamous internet “troll factory” that led to his indictment in the US for meddling in the 2016 presidential election. In January, Prigozhin acknowledged founding, leading and financing the shadowy Wagner company. He said he had 50,000 men at his disposal “in the best times,” with about 35,000 on the front lines at all times. He did not say whether these numbers included convicts, but he is known to have toured Russian prisons to recruit fighters, promising pardons if they survived a half-year tour of front-line duty with Wagner. Prigozhin’s scarred face, tightly shaven head and uneven tobacco-stained teeth have become widely recognised, as is his vocabulary filled with expletives. Polls suggest he has become thefifth most recognisable figure after Putin, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu. He staked out a political niche among conservative Russians who revere Soviet leader Joseph Stalin and want to win the war in Ukraine, no matter what. “Comrade Stalin was absolutely right,” Prigozhin said in May, touting the death penalty for servicemen and officials who “fail” to support the faltering war effort. Such a law would be similar to Stalin’s WWII policies. Prigozhin also said that after losing tens of thousands of mercenaries in eastern Ukraine, his Wagner Group will have to recruit more people and “transform into an army with an ideology”. To some outside observers, Prigozhin’s transformation may be part of the Kremlin’s power transfer plan in case of a collapse similar to the “Times of Troubles” between the death of Tsar Ivan the Terrible and the ascension of the Romanov dynasty four centuries ago. Prigozhin’s company was called Wagner after the nickname of its first commander, Dmitry Utkin, a retired lieutenant colonel of the Russian military’s special forces. It soon established a reputation for brutality and ruthlessness. Wagner was first seen in action in eastern Ukraine soon after a separatist conflict erupted there in April 2014, in the weeks following Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula.    While backing the separatist uprising in the Donbas, Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland, Russia denied sending its own weapons and troops there, despite ample evidence to the contrary. Engaging private contractors in the fighting allowed Moscow to maintain a degree of deniability. Wagner personnel also deployed to Syria, where Russia supported President Bashar al-Assad’s government in a war. In Libya, they fought alongside the forces of renegade commander Khalifa Haftar. The group is also believed to operate in the Central African Republic and Mali. Prigozhin has reportedly used Wagner’s deployment to Syria and African countries to secure lucrative mining contracts. US Under Secretary of State Victoria Nuland said in January the company was using its access to gold and other resources in Africa to fund operations in Ukraine. Some Russian media alleged that Wagner was involved in the 2018 killings of three Russian journalists in the Central African Republic who were investigating the group’s activities. The slayings remain unsolved. Western countries and United Nations experts have accused Wagner mercenaries of human rights abuses throughout Africa, including in the Central African Republic, Libya and Mali. In 2021, the European Union accused the group of “serious human rights abuses, including torture and extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and killings,” and of carrying out “destabilising activities” in the Central African Republic, Libya, Syria and Ukraine. Several videos have surfaced purporting to show some of the activities that have contributed to Wagner’s fearsome reputation. A 2017 online video showed a group of armed people, reportedly Wagner contractors, torturing a Syrian and beating him to death with a sledgehammer before mutilating and burning his body. Russian authorities ignored requests by the media and rights activists to investigate. In 2022, another video showed a former Wagner contractor beaten to death with a sledgehammer after he allegedly fled to the Ukrainian side and was repatriated. Despite public outrage and demands for an investigation, the Kremlin turned a blind eye.   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/24/who-is-prigozhin-the-wagner-chief-taking-on-russias-military

Russian President Vladimir Putin condemned the rebellion, saying it was “a stab in the back of our country and our people”. “All those who prepared the rebellion will suffer inevitable punishment. The armed forces and other government agencies have received the necessary orders,” Putin said in a televised address to the nation on Saturday.

Wagner chief rejects Putin’s accusations of treason,Yevgeny Prigozhin says Putin is ‘deeply mistaken’ and that Wagner fighters are not traitors but ‘patriots.’,"Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Russian military contractorWagner Group, has rejected accusations of “treason” by President Vladimir Putin after his troops crossed crossed from Ukraine into the Russian border city of Rostov-on-Don, vowing to fight anyone who tried to stop them. On Saturday, Prigozhin posted an audio message on the social media app Telegram, claiming his forces had taken control of military facilities in the city, including the airfield. Videos and pictures posted online, including by Russia’s TASS news agency, showed armed men surrounding administrative buildings in Rostov and tanks deployed in the city centre. “All of us are ready to die. All 25,000, and then another 25,000,” he said, after earlier accusing the Russian top brass of having launched an attack on their camps in Ukraine, where the mercenaries are fighting on behalf of Moscow. “We are dying for the Russian people.” In an emergency televised address on Saturday, Putin said that the “armed mutiny” by Wagner amounted to “treason” and that anyone who had taken up arms against the Russian military would be punished. He added that he would do everything to protect Russia, and that “decisive action” would be taken to stabilise the situation in Rostov. The Federal Security Service (FSB) said Prigozhin’s actions were “a call to start an armed civil conflict on the territory of the Russian Federation” and “a stab in the back to Russian servicemen fighting pro-fascist Ukrainian forces”. In response, Russian authorities said security had been tightened in several regions and the mayor of Moscow announced that “anti-terrorist” measures were being taken in the capital. “With the aim of preventing possible terrorist acts on the territory of the city of Moscow and the Moscow region, an anti-terror operation regime has been introduced,” the country’s national anti-terrorist committee was quoted by Russian agencies as saying. Russia’s defence ministry addressed Wagner’s mercenary fighters in a statement, saying that they had been “deceived and dragged into a criminal adventure”. It urged them to contact its representatives and those of law enforcement services, and promised to guarantee their security. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the armed insurrection was evidence of Russia’s inherent political instability. “Russia’s weakness is obvious,” he said. “And the longer Russia keeps its troops and mercenaries on our land, the more chaos, pain, and problems it will have for itself later.” The events in Rostov were the latest provocation from Prigozhin since Russian authorities announced they would launch a criminal case against the mercenary chief, over threats he allegedly made to remove the country’s Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu. On Friday,Prigozhin accusedShoigu of ordering a rocket attack on Wagner’s field camps in Ukraine and railed against the toll it has taken on Wagner forces. “Huge numbers of our fighters, of our combat comrades, have been killed,” he said. “The evil that the military leadership of the country bears must be stopped. They neglect the lives of soldiers. They forget the word justice.” Prigozhin estimated that 2,000 of his fighters had been killed in the blasts, though he failed to provide evidence for that death toll. His message included a call to action that the Russian government has since interpreted as an appeal to mutiny. “There are 25,000 of us, and we’re going to figure out why this chaos is happening in the country,” Prigozhin said, indicating that he had more forces in reserve and support from military members. “Everyone is welcome to join. We must end this disgrace.” He also posted a video in which he dismissed Moscow’s claims that Kyiv was planning to launch an offensive on the Russian-controlled territories in eastern Ukraine in February 2022, a claim that had served as a rationale for launching a full-fledged invasion. He accused the defence ministry of “trying to deceive the public and the president” and “spin the story that there was insane levels of aggression from the Ukrainian side and that they were going to attack us together with the whole NATO bloc”. Prigozhin’s words marked a significant escalation in his long-running standoff with the Russian military’s top brass. In response, the ministry issued a statement saying Prigozhin’s accusations were “not true and are an informational provocation”. Prigozhinsaid his actions did not amount to a military coup but were rather, “a march of justice”.    Russia’s FSB security service opened a criminal case against him for calling for an armed mutiny, the TASS news agency said on Friday, citing the National Antiterrorism Committee. The security service also called on Wagner fighters to “take measures to detain” their leader. The deputy commander of Russia’s campaign in Ukraine, General Sergei Surovikin, appealed to the forces to submit to Moscow’s command. “I urge you to stop,” Surovikin said in a Telegram video, where he appeared in military fatigues, his hand perched on a rifle. “You must do this before it is too late. Obey the will and command of the elected president of the Russian Federation. Stop the convoys. Return to bases and places where you’re stationed.” The Kremlin has also said Putin was being “constantly” informed of the unfolding events and that “necessary measures are being taken”. Yulia Shapovalova, reporting for Al Jazeera from Moscow, said Russia’s Ministry of Defence released a statement in which it said Ukraine was taking advantage of the Wagner chief’s “provocation” and that Kyiv’s forces had launched an offensive in the direction of Bakhmut city. “Also, at the moment, armoured military personnel vehicles can be seen in the streets of Moscow. But generally, people report that the capital looks pretty calm right now. That’s probably because security measures have been stepped up in the capital and all the most important facilities have been taken under protection,” Shapovalova said. Several high-ranking Russian generals also released video messages addressing Prigozhin, saying that it was a time for unity in Russia as the country’s enemies in Ukraine and the West were “rejoicing right now”. The generals described the Wagner chief’s comments as a “stab in the back of the country and the president”, and the FSB has also appealed to Wagner fighters to detain their boss, Shapovalova added. The United States said it was monitoring the situation, with National Security Council spokesperson Adam Hodge telling reporters that US allies were also being consulted. The standoff, many of the details of which remained unclear, appears to be the biggest domestic crisis Putin has faced since he sent thousands of troops into Ukraine in February of last year in what he called “a special military operation”. “Over the past few months, Wagner Group played a vital role in the Russian attack on Bakhmut, on Soledar, and this conflict with the Ministry of Defence has been brewing for a lot of time,” Al Jazeera correspondent Ali Hashem reported from Donetsk. “What’s happening right now is just the top of the iceberg.” Prigozhin, whose frequent tirades on social media belie his limited role in the war as head of the Wagner private militia, has for months been openly accusing Shoigu and Russia’s top general, Valery Gerasimov, of rank incompetence and of denying his forces ammunition and support. “It’s really quite extraordinary. Prigozhin has been critical of the way in which the Ministry of Defence and the official Russian military have been prosecuting this war, really from the very beginning, calling them unprofessional, accusing them of leading unnecessary deaths of Russian soldiers,” Sam Greene, the director for democratic resilience at the Center for European Policy Analysis, told Al Jazeera. “But he has certainly taken that quite a few steps further.” Greene described the Russian war in Ukraine as a “money-making endeavour” for defence services — and the way he sees it, Prigozhin and Shoigu are jostling for resources and control. But Greene added that it is unclear what Prigozhin’s strategy is at present. “I will be honest: It is very difficult for me to understand the calculation that Prigozhin is making here,” Greene said. “This really is such a significant challenge that he either has to win it outright, or it’s hard to see how he’s going to survive in this system — or in fact, to survive at all.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/23/russian-authorities-launch-criminal-probe-into-wagner-group
‘Fake’ video of Ukrainians criticising Titan crew debunked,A fake video attributed to Al Jazeera claimed Ukrainians were upset with the Titan submersible crew for ‘wasting money’.,"Al Jazeera has debunked a fake video that has been circulating on social media. The video, falsely bearing the Qatar-based media network’s logo, reported that Ukrainians were criticising theTitan submersible’s crewfor wasting money that could have been donated to support Ukraine. An Al Jazeera spokesperson told the Reuters news agency that the content of the video clip was “fabricated”. “The video circulating on social media, claiming to be from Al Jazeera and featuring content that depicts Ukrainian people condemning the passengers of the Titan submarine for lavishly spending money on their expedition is not authentic,” the spokesperson said in an email on Friday. “We want to clarify that the video does not originate from Al Jazeera, and we assert that the content has been fabricated by a third party.”    Captions in the 94-second clip said Ukrainians were upset with the crew of the Titan submersible for “wasting money”, and that the funds should have gone to them amid Russia’s invasion of their country. “Ukraine needs help while these people spend fortunes on silly entertainment,” said an unidentified social media user, according to a caption in the video. The clip was widely shared on Twitter, Facebook and TikTok, garnering tens of thousands of views. The Reuters Fact Check team concluded that the video was “false”. “The video is an example of imposter content. It was not published by Al Jazeera.” The Titan submersiblehad been missingfor days in the Atlantic Ocean with five men on board. On Thursday, the United States Coast Guard said the submersible suffered a “catastrophic loss” that was consistent with the implosion of the vessel. Each person paid a sum of $250,000 for a chance to see the legendary Titanic wreckage some 13,000 feet (3,962 metres) below the ocean surface. Among those on board the vessel – owned by the company OceanGate – were UK billionaire Hamish Harding, Pakistani-British businessman Shahzada Dawood and his 19-year-old son Suleman. This is not the first time a video misidentified as Al Jazeera’s has circulated on social media. In November,a fake videoattributed to Al Jazeera alleged that drunk Ukrainian football fans vandalised World Cup-related posters with Nazi symbols in the capital city Doha. According to the fake video, three Ukrainians were detained after they painted a “Hitler moustache” on the 2022 World Cup’s mascot La’eeb, and further vandalised the poster with a Nazi salute.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/23/fake-video-of-ukrainians-criticising-titan-crew-debunked
Zelenskyy urges world to heed Ukraine’s ‘terror’ attack warning,President slams ‘countries pretending to be neutral’ after warning Russia could be planning an attack at Europe’s largest nuclear plant.,"Ukraine wants other countries to heed its warning that Russia may be planning to attack anoccupied nuclear power plantto cause a radiation disaster, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. On Thursday, he said Ukraine’s intelligence agencies had received information that Russia was considering what they cast as a “terror” attack involving a release of radiation. “Unfortunately, I had to be reminded more than once that radiation knows no national borders, and who it hits is determined only by the direction of the wind,” he said. Members of his government briefed have international representatives on the possible threat to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which has been controlled by Russia since March 2022, and is run by Ukrainian technicians. In his nightly address, Zelenskyy said he expected other nations to “give appropriate signals and exert pressure” on Moscow. “Our principle is simple: The world must know what the occupier is preparing. Everyone who knows must act,” Zelenskyy said. “The world has enough power to prevent any radiation incidents, let alone a radiation catastrophe.” The potential for a life-threatening release of radiation has been a concern since Russian troops invaded Ukraine last year and seized the plant, which is Europe’s largest nuclear power station.    The head of the UN’s atomic energy agency spent months unsuccessfully trying to negotiate for a safety perimeter to protect the facility as nearby areas came under repeated shelling. The Ukrainian leader’s nighttime remarks Thursday carried a tone of frustration with “countries that are pretending to be neutral even now” in the war. He accused “anyone who turns a blind eye to Russia’s occupation of such a facility” of enabling Moscow to commit an act of evil and terror. “Obviously, radiation does not ask who is neutral and can reach anyone in the world. Accordingly, anyone in the world can help now, and it is quite clear what to do,” Zelenskyy said. Russia has denied the accusations. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the claim as “another lie”. On Friday, Russia claimed it was the target of “an information and propaganda campaign to discredit the country in the international arena”. Russia’s Federal Security Service, the FSB, said five people were arrested for trying to smuggle a kilogram of the radioactive isotope Cesium-137 out of the country under the direction of a Ukrainian citizen. The FSB said the material was to be used for “organising staged scenes of the use of weapons of mass destruction.” Cesium-137 is often mentioned as of potential use in making a “dirty bomb” that could contaminate a wide area. The International Atomic Energy Agency noted Thursday that “the military situation has become increasingly tense” while a Ukrainian counteroffensive that got under way this month unfolds in Zaporizhia province, where the namesake plant is located, and in an adjacent part of Donetsk province. On Friday, IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi met with the director of Russian state nuclear corporation Rosatom to discuss the conditions at the plant. Rosatom director Alexey Likachev and other officials at the meeting in the Kaliningrad exclave “emphasised that they now expect specific steps” from the UN agency to prevent Ukrainian attacks on the plant and its adjacent territory, said a statement from the Russian corporation, whose divisions build and operate nuclear power plants. The governor of Zaporizhia, Yuriy Malashko, reported on Friday that Russian shelling in the southern province killed two people in the past day. An attack that hit a transportation company in Kherson, the capital of Kherson province, killed two others on Friday, governor Oleksandr Prokudin said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/23/zelenskyy-urges-world-to-heed-ukraines-terror-attack-warning
Western countries commit billions to rebuild war-ravaged Ukraine,"Homes, hospitals and key infrastructure lie in ruins nearly 16 months since Russia began its full scale invasion of Ukraine.","Foreign donors have pledged 60 billion euros ($66bn) for Ukraine over a multi-year period to help the country rebuild following Russia’s February 2022 invasion. The commitments were made at the two-day Ukraine Recovery Conference in London and were mostly comprised of a 50 billion euro ($55bn) commitment from the European Union announced on Tuesday and new pledges from the United Kingdom and the United States. “We had not envisaged this to be a pledging conference. Nevertheless, today at this conference, we can announce a combined 60 billion euros in support to Ukraine,” said British Foreign Minister James Cleverly. Nearly 16 months since Russia began itsfull-scale invasion, homes,hospitalsand critical infrastructure lie in ruins and Kyiv faces years, possibly decades, of rebuilding. The World Bank has estimated the cost of reconstruction at more than $400bn, a figure rising daily alongside the human toll of the war. Stressing the vast scale of the task, diplomats and political leaders at the London conference urged private-sector companies to invest as well. Nearly 500 companies from 42 countries have pledged to play their part, Cleverly said. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, who was at the conference, thanked the delegates for their financial backing adding that Ukraine would not wait for the end of the war to start rebuilding. Ukraine’s initial focus will be its energy sector, which has come under sustained attack in successive Russian raids, leaving families in the dark and unable to heat their homes during thebitterly cold winter months. A US promise of more than $1.3bn in new aid, included more than $500m to restore and improve the country’s energy grid. The conference also touched on issues such asUkraine’s future membership of the European Union, with officials stressing the need for the country to make additional progress to meet conditions such as reducing corruption and reforming the judiciary. Such reforms would send “a powerful message” to investors that they will get the “transparency, fairness and the functioning institutions they need to invest in Ukraine”, said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken also highlighted the importance of anti-corruption efforts by Ukraine, a country long plagued by graft. He said some of the money pledged by the US would also go towards upgrading ports and border infrastructure and digitising customs procedures to make it harder to break the rules. “The goal is to rebuild a Ukraine that is fit for [the] EU,” said German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock.

"Russia on UN ‘list of shame’ for killing children, Israel absent",UN chief Antonio Guterres criticised by right workers for ‘disservice’ to Palestinian children by leaving Israeli forces off list.,"The United Nations has placed Russia’s military and allied armed groups on its “list of shame” over thekilling and maiming of hundreds of children in its war against Ukraine, butIsraeli forces have been left off the listdespite killing more than 40 Palestinian children last year, according to reports. Human rights organisations had made repeated requests thatIsrael be added to the UN blacklistover the killing and maiming of Palestinian children in the occupied West Bank. Palestinian Ambassador to the UN Riyad Mansour on Thursday called UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres’s decision to leave Israel off the shame list a “big mistake”. In the UN’s annual reporton the treatment of children in conflict zones, which was distributed to members of the UN Security Council on Thursday, Guterres said that he was “appalled by the high number of grave violations against children in Ukraine” in 2022. According to news organisations that had seen a copy of the report, 477 children were listed as killed in Ukraine last year, including 136 deaths directly attributed to Russian forces and affiliated groups.    Ukrainian armed forces were responsible for killing 80 children, according to the report. Of the remaining child victims, neither of the two warring sides could be blamed with certainty. The children were mostly killed by air attacks, the UN report said. The UN also verified thatRussian forces and affiliated groupsmaimed 518 children in Ukraine and carried out 480 attacks on schools and hospitals. Russian armed forces also used 91 children as human shields, according to the report. Ukrainian armed forces maimed 175 children and carried out 212 attacks on schools and hospitals. Ukraine’s forces were not placed on the list. The UN chief said in the report that he was “deeply concerned” by the number of Palestinian children killed by Israeli forces in 2022. According to the report,42 Palestinian children were killedand 933 injured in 2022 by Israeli forces. In 2021, Israeli forces killed 78 Palestinian children. Israel has never been on the UN list of countries shamed for killing children.    Guterres said that he noted a “meaningful decrease in the number of children killed by Israeli forces, including by air strikes” last year compared with the previous report. Human Rights Watch welcomed the UN’s decision to name Russian forces but criticised the UN chief’s decision to leave Israel off the shame list, saying that he “had failed Palestinian children again”. “By adding Russia’s forces to his list of shame, the Secretary General is holding them to account for horrific violations against children,” said Jo Becker, the group’s advocacy director for children’s rights. “His [Guterres’s] unwillingness, year after year, to hold Israeli forces accountable for their grave violations against children has backfired, only emboldening Israeli forces to use unlawful lethal force against Palestinian children,” Becker said. “From 2015-2020, the UN attributed over 6,700 child casualties to Israeli forces. He has just verified 975 more in 2022. Yet he still omits Israel from his ‘list of shame’,” Becker wrote in a tweet. UN Secretary-General@antonioguterreshas failed Palestinian children again. From 2015-2020, the UN attributed over 6,700 child casualties to Israeli forces. He has just verified 975 more in 2022. Yet he still omits Israel from his ""list of shame.""https://t.co/lCMSmkR9cgpic.twitter.com/3d48AOlsvj — Jo Becker (@jobeckerhrw)June 22, 2023  Mansour, the Palestinian UN ambassador, said leaving Israel off the UN list was “very disappointing to the Palestinian people and to the Palestinian children”. “The Secretary General made a big mistake in not listing this current Israeli government. This is the most extreme government, loaded with fascist elements. If you do not list this government now, when will you list the Israeli government?” Mansour said. “It’s very unfortunate that he selected not to list them.” The UN report has long been controversial, with diplomats saying Saudi Arabia and Israel have exerted pressure in recent years in a bid to stay off the list of shame. A Saudi-led military coalition was removed from the list in 2020 several years after it was first named for killing and injuring children in Yemen. Al Jazeera’s diplomatic editor James Bays said that Russia’s inclusion marks the first time that “a permanent member of the Security Council has been on that black list”. “Again the report is controversial. Part of that is because of Israel, which the report said killed 42 children in 2022. Now the Secretary General says that’s a meaningful decline and he’s not putting them on the blacklist,” Bays said, but noting also that Israel’s war in Gaza in 2021 was 11 days long and the war in August 2022 lasted just three days. “The reality is #Israel is still killing many children,” Bays wrote in a tweet.

Ukraine missiles damage bridge to Crimea: Russian officials,"The Chonhar road bridge connecting Kherson to Crimea is damaged but there are no casualties, Russian-appointed officials say.","Ukrainian missiles have struck the Chonhar road bridge connecting Crimea with Russian-held parts of the southern Kherson region, according to Russian-appointed officials. The so-called “gate to Crimea”, known to Russians by a different spelling as the Chongar bridge, is one of a handful of links between Crimea – which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014 – and mainlandUkraine. It is on a route used by the Russian military to move between Crimea and other parts of Ukraine under its control.  Russian investigators said four missiles had been fired by Ukrainian forces at the bridge, the RIA news agency reported. It quoted a spokesman for military investigators as saying that markings found on the remains of one of the missiles suggested it had been made in France. Al Jazeera’s Ali Hashem, reporting from Mariupol, said one of the three bridges in the area was damaged. “Some analysts say that the attack came due to fear that the Russians are mobilising from that region for the army to resupply towards Kherson,” he said. “… Now we are still waiting to hear more from the Russian side about how this will be dealt with.” Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-appointed governor of Kherson, parts of which Russian forces have captured during what Moscow calls its “special military operation”, said the road bridge had been damaged but that there were no casualties. One picture Saldo posted on Telegram showed a large hole in the bridge’s surface with water visible beneath it and debris scattered nearby. Saldo suggested Ukraine may have used British-supplied Storm Shadow cruise missiles for the attack. “The Kyiv terrorists want to intimidate Kherson residents and sow panic among the population, but they will not succeed. We know how to repair bridges quickly: vehicle passage will be restored in the very near future,” he said. “We have an answer to every move by the enemy. A link between the Kherson region and Crimea continues to operate – a reserve route has been temporarily organised for vehicular traffic.” Sergei Aksyonov, Crimea’s Russian-appointed governor, told people to stay calm and said specialists were examining the site to determine when traffic over the bridge could resume. Kyiv says it wants to retake Crimea and drive all Russian forces from its territory. Yuriy Sobolevsky, a Ukrainian official on the governing body for the Kherson region, said the attack was “a blow to the military logistics of the occupiers”. “The psychological impact on the occupiers and the occupying power is even more important. There is no place on the territory of Kherson region where they can feel safe,” he said on the Telegram messaging application.

Ukraine offensive against Russia not ‘Hollywood movie’: Zelenskyy,Ukraine’s President Zelenskyy said vast minefields laid by Russian forces have slowed his country’s counteroffensive.,"Ukraine’s counteroffensive against Russian forceshas been “slower than desired”, but Ukrainian forces will not be pressured into speeding up, the country’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said, while Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow had observed a “lull” in Kyiv’s campaign. Ukrainian forces are being slowed in their advanceby vast minefields laid by Russian forces, Zelenskyy told to the United Kingdom’s BBC in an interview on Wednesday. With some 200,000 square kilometres (more than 77,000 square miles) of Ukrainian frontier territory littered with Russian land mines, the Ukrainian leader said that “at stake is people’s lives”. “Some people believe this is a Hollywood movie and expect results now. It’s not,” Zelenskyy told the BBC. “Whatever some might want, including attempts to pressure us, with all due respect, we will advance on the battlefield the way we deem best,” he said. Confirming that Ukrainian forces had retaken eight villages in the south and east of the country, Zelenskyy also said that Ukraine would never negotiate while Russian forces remain on Ukraine’s territory and that the conflict would not be allowed to stagnate. “No matter how far we advance in our counteroffensive, we will not agree to a frozen conflict” which would be “a prospectless development for Ukraine”, he said. Zelenskyy’s interview with the BBC coincided with a conference in London where allies pledged billions of dollars in economic and reconstruction aid, and on a day when Russia’s leader again said that Ukraine’s counteroffensive was faltering.    In televised remarks on Wednesday, Putin said thatKyiv had sustained serious military losses since beginning its pushearlier this month to retake territory held by Russian forces, and a “certain lull” had been observed by Moscow on the front lines in Ukraine. Contradicting the Russian president’s view of the conflict, thechief of Russia’s Wagner mercenary force, Yevgeny Prigozhin,accused Russian defence officials on Wednesday of not telling the truth about the progress of Ukraine’s counteroffensive. Moscow was losing territory to Ukrainian forces, Prigozhin said, and Russian defence officials were hiding the truth. “They are misleading the Russian people,” Prigozhin said in an audio message released by his spokespeople. A number of villages have been lost and Russian troops are suffering from a lack of arms and ammunition, he said. “Huge chunks have been handed over to the enemy,” Prigozhin said, warning that Ukrainian troops had already sought to cross the Dnipro river, a natural border on the front line. “All of this is being totally hidden from everyone,” the Wagner chief said. “One day Russia will wake up to discover that Crimea too has been handed over to Ukraine,” he added.    The Washington, DC-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said on Thursday that Russian sources had noted a “relatively slower pace of Ukrainian offensive operations” in the west of the Donetsk and Zaporizhia regions in recent days. However, the ISW said that Ukraine had long indicated that its counteroffensive would be a “series of gradual and sequential offensive actions”. Military analysts believe that Kyiv’s major counteroffensive operations have not yet started. 5/ Russian sources noted a relatively slower pace of Ukrainian offensive operations in both western#Donetskand western#Zaporizhiaoblasts compared to the previous days.https://t.co/hiIa26CVZt — ISW (@TheStudyofWar)June 22, 2023  “The success of Ukrainian counteroffensives should not be judged solely on day-to-day changes in control of terrain,” the ISW said. “The wider operational intentions of Ukrainian attacks along the entire front line may be premised on gradually degrading, exhausting, and expending Russian capabilities in preparation for additional offensive pushes,” it said. In his daily, late-night address on Wednesday, Zelenskky said that Ukrainian forces were “destroying the enemy” in the south of the country and making advances. In the east, “our defences are firming”, he said. “And I am especially grateful, guys, for every shot down Russian helicopter … Each [shot] is important,” he said.

Suspected Pentagon leaker pleads not guilty to federal charges,Former National Guardsman faces allegations that he leaked numerous classified national security documents online.,"The United States Air National Guardsmansuspected of leakingclassified national security documents on social media has entered a not-guilty plea to federal felony charges. Jack Teixeira, 21, appeared before a federal court in Worcester, Massachusetts, on Wednesday, several days after he was indicted by a grand jury on six counts of willful retention and transmission of national defence information. Standing next to his lawyers in an orange prison uniform, Teixeira responded, “Not guilty, your honour,” as the judge read out the charges against him. A trial date has yet to be set. Teixeira is accused of posting photos and transcribed copies ofsensitive materialon the social media forum Discord, revealing national security intelligence related to the war in Ukraine and other military interests.    Afterthe leakand Teixeira’s arrest in April, the Biden administration rushed to assure allies that the US is able to safeguard its national security secrets. Teixeirais being held in a federal prison in Plymouth County, south of Boston, as heawaits trial. A judge denied a bid by defence lawyers to reconsider the suspect’s detention order. “The important thing is Jack will now have his day in court,” his family said in a statement on Wednesday. “We are hopeful that Jack will be getting the fair and just treatment he deserves.” Investigators believe that the young man was the leader of a private Discord chat group titled Thug Shaker Central, where members shared jokes, their favouritetypes of gunsand views on international conflicts. The justice department has also said that Teixeira had a history of disturbing comments online. In November, for example, he posted that he would like to see a large number of people killed in a “culling of the weak-minded”. Authorities say that Teixeira, who worked as a military IT specialist of sorts, began sharing military secrets with the group in January. Questionshave been raisedabout how the government confers security status to personnel — and why Teixeira was able to access such sensitive materials. Memos filed in court show that Teixeira had been reprimanded on several occasions for mishandling or improperly viewing classified material.    In a statement released last week, US Attorney General Merrick Garland said Teixeira had been given access to information that “reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to national security if shared”. Each count Teixeira faces comes with a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, meaning that he could face a maximum of 60 years in prison. The US government has a history ofzealously pursuingthose who share national security secrets, even if they are deemed to be of public value or expose government wrongdoing.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/21/suspected-pentagon-leaker-pleads-not-guilty-to-federal-charges
‘Furious resistance’: Ukraine counteroffensive slowed by Russia,Ukraine sought to allay any disillusionment over small gains during the second week of its counteroffensive.,"Ukraine pressed counteroffensives on four main fronts during the 69th week of the war, but made frustratingly slow progress because of stiff resistance from Russian defensive positions. During a telethon on June 19, Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said over the previous week Ukrainian recaptured territory climbed to 113-square kilometres (44sq miles), only 13sq km (6sq miles) more than what Ukraine claimed it reconquered a week earlier. “The Russians are putting up a furious resistance,” she said, pointing out Russian troops fired an estimated 5,800 artillery rounds and 277,000 bullet rounds in just a week. Ukraine’s offensives were focused on Bakhmut and Donetsk city in the east. In the south, at the border between Donetsk and Zaporizhizhia regions, Ukraine advanced 7km (3 miles) into Russian-held territory towards Melitopol, and it maintained an open front in western Zaporizhizhia, south of Orikhiv. Maliar estimated killed or wounded Russians at 4,600 and destroyed equipment at 400 pieces of hardware. Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu said Ukrainian forces launched 263 attacks against Russian positions since June 4. “All attacks have been repelled,” he said. But Maliar was defiant on Telegram. “The biggest blow is yet to come. One must not measure the result of the work of the defence forces exclusively by settlements and kilometres traveled… The ongoing operation has several tasks and the military is carrying out these tasks,” she wrote. She may have been referring to suspected Ukrainian strikes at ammunition depots far behind the Russian front lines. Repeated explosions atRykove, in Kherson region, were suspected to come from a Russian warehouse.  Russia also claimed to have inflicted materiel losses. The leader of the “We are together with Russia Movement” in Zaporizhizhia, VladimirRogov, said Russian long-range weapons struck Ukrainian ammunition warehouses in Zaporizhizhia city, which lies in free Ukraine, citing a series of explosions there, inflicting a blow on the counteroffensive. Russia’s defenceministrysaid it successfully struck depots of Western-manufactured military hardware using sea-launched precision missiles, without saying where they had struck. “All the assigned targets have been neutralised,” it said. Ukraine’s position is whatever delays it might have suffered, its counteroffensive has made gains and suffered no territorial losses. “We have no lost positions. Only liberated ones. They have only losses,” Ukrainian President VolodymyrZelenskyysaid in a video address.    Ukraine’s general staff said Russia was focusing its attacks in the directions of Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Maryinka. Ukrainian ground forces commander Oleksandr Syrskyi said Russia was prioritising the defence of Bakhmut. “Despite the advance of our troops in the south and the loss of territory and settlements in this direction, the enemy continues to move some of the most combat-capable units to the Bakhmut direction,” he said. His forces were dominating high ground and forested areas as part of a strategy to gradually push Russian forces out of Bakhmut, Syrskyi said. Russia’s defence ministry said the fiercest fighting was in Zaporizhizhia, south of Orikhiv, where Ukraine launched waves of attacks by mechanised battalion groups, which were repelled. Russia claims it destroyed nine tanks and 20 armoured fighting vehicles. Ukraine’s southern forces said they were advancing and capturing enemy equipment, suggesting Russian forces might be retreating in disarray in places. “The enemy is fiercely resisting, moving units and troops, using reserves, so we have positive dynamics,” said its press centre. Ukraine also emphasised Russian manpower shortages. Eastern military spokesman Serhiy Cherevaty said Russian forces in Lyman “use a mixed group, which includes motorised rifle units, and airborne units, and units of the combat army reserve, as well as territorial troops”. “Storm-Z” units of prison inmates were being thrown into this mix. He also said Russian forces in Lyman were using obsolete T-62 tanks, some of which had been destroyed. Russia’s defence ministry, on the other hand, prioritised announcements of destroyed Western equipment. Ukraine’s allies have donated more than 250 tanks and hundreds of armoured fighting vehicles, touted by Western military analysts as superior to anything in the Russian arsenal. Russia said its forces repelled four attacks by a battalion tactical group in southern Donetsk near Novodonetskoye on June 18, destroying 35 tanks and some 70 armoured fighting vehicles, including Bradley fighting vehicles and Stryker armoured personnel carriers provided by the United States. Its defence ministry said its forces also destroyed Bradley fighting vehicles and German-provided Marder APCs on the bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson. Russian soldier Andrei Kravtsov was awarded a million roubles ($12,000) for allegedly destroying a German-built Leopard tank “during a special operation”. Ukraine did not confirm or deny these alleged losses.  Ukraine’s allies gradually shifted to longer-term pledges of military and financial assistance, evidently foreseeing a long war. During the 13th meeting of the Contact Group on Ukraine at Ramstein in Germany, Canada pledged $500mn in new funding, 288 AIM-7 air-to-air missiles, artillery ammunition, training and maintenance for F-16s, among other things. Denmark approved a fourth military aid package for Ukraine worth 2.95bn euros for 2023-2028. The US, UK, Denmark and the Netherlands pledged hundreds of air defence missiles. Norway, Germany and Denmark announced multi-year pledges. European Commission President Ursula Von DerLeyenproposed a budget of 50 billion euros to assist Ukraine over the next four years. The pledge was unveiled at a two-day London conference for the raising of funds to rebuild Ukraine. Shoigu announced Ukraine planned to use US-made HIMARS and UK-made Storm Shadow missiles against annexed Ukrainian territory. “Deployment of these particular missiles out of the special military operation zone will be regarded as direct involvement of the USA and UK in the conflict and will result in immediate retaliatory strikes at decision-making centres in Ukraine territory,”Shoigu warned. It was unclear where Russia would consider use of these missiles legitimate. Russia formally annexed Crimea in 2014, and Russian President Vladimir Putinformally annexedthe four regions of Ukraine he partially controls – Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhizhia and Kherson – on September 30, following referenda denounced as illegitimate by the West. Zelenskyy said the long-range Storm Shadow missiles provided by Britain were “now doing a very useful and accurate job at the front” – without specifying whether they had been used in the strike on the ammunition depot at Rykove.

Russia moves to legalise prisoners fighting in Ukraine war,Amnesty to be legally offered to criminals and crime suspects who agree to serve in Russia’s war in Ukraine.,"The Russian parliament’s lower house, the State Duma, has approved legislation that would give pardons to criminal convicts who volunteer to join Russian forces fighting in Ukraine, a move aimed at boosting troop numbersduring the first stages of Ukraine’s counteroffensive. The legislation sets in law the recruitment of prisoners and criminal suspects for the war in Ukraine, a practice first adopted by the Wagner mercenary force last year before Russia’s Ministry of Defence took over prison recruitment in early 2023, the Moscow Times reported on Tuesday. The State Duma said in a statement on Tuesday that amnesties for fighting at the front lines in Ukraine do not extend to all criminals in Russian prisons: acts of terror, sex offences, espionage and treason are among the serious crimes exempted. “The validity of the document does not extend to those who have previously been convicted of terrorist and extremist acts, as well as offences against the sexual sanctity of minors,” according to a statement published on the Duma’s website.    If the legislation becomes law, the criminal records of those who join the Russian army will be erased once they complete military service, receive a state award for fighting, are wounded in action or reach the retirement age of 65, the Moscow Times reported. Suspected criminals also receive a reprieve if they agree to serve in Ukraine. “For suspected criminals who agree to take up arms, authorities can suspend criminal proceedings against them if they face up to five years in prison for premeditated crimes or up to 10 years for acts of negligence. The bill notes that crimes committed after the law takes effect will not be expunged,” the Moscow Times reported. The legislation will next go through a single round of voting in Russia’s upper-house Federation Council, after which Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to sign them into law, the newspaper said. Even before the passage of the legislation, Yevgeny Prigozhin, the millionaire owner of the Wagner Group mercenary force, has been allowed torecruit criminal convicts as mercenaries, promising them pardons if they survive six months of fighting in Ukraine.    Over the weekend, Prigozhin said that 32,000 of his Wagner mercenaries recruited from prisons had returned home after serving in the war in Ukraine. In May, the Wagner boss said that about20,000 of his fightershad been killed in the battle for Ukraine’s Bakhmut city. With the high-profile acrimony between Wagner forces and Russia’s defence ministry continuing to rumble, Prigozhin has complained that his access to Russian prisons for recruitment has been blocked. The Washington, DC-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said on Tuesday that Wagner forces are attempting to recruit new fighters in “the wake of significant losses in Ukraine“. “Russian opposition outlet Verstka reported on June 19 that Wagner recruiters are disseminating messages on social media platforms calling for individuals aged 21 to 35 years old with a ‘gaming background’ to join Wagner as UAV specialists,” the ISW said. “Verstka noted that these recruits are not required to have any military experience,” the institute said. Ukrainian forces are making steady, incremental advances in the ongoing counteroffensive, according to Ukrainian military officials, and Russian troops are resisting fiercely behind fortified positions and minefields. Ukraine’s Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said on Tuesday that Ukrainian forces were moving forward but that the campaign would not be a quick offensive with successes like in a “movie”.

Russia: US and UK ‘fully dragged into conflict’ if Crimea bombed,Moscow alleges Kyiv plans to strike the annexed Crimean Peninsula with US-supplied HIMARS long-range rocket systems and British-supplied Storm Shadow cruise missiles.,"Russia has accused Ukraine of planning to attack annexed Crimea with long-range United States and British missiles and warned it would retaliate if that happened. Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu told a meeting of military officials on Tuesday that Moscow possesses information that Ukraine plans to strike Crimea with US-suppliedHIMARS long-range rocket systemsand British-supplied Storm Shadow cruise missiles. “The use of these missiles outside the zone of our special military operation would mean that the United States and Britain would be fully dragged into the conflict and would entail immediate strikes on decision-making centres in Ukraine,” Shoigu said. Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and considers it to be outside the scope of its invasion – which is focused in eastern and southern Ukraine, where Ukraine is fighting to retake territory. Kyiv, which says it is battling for its survival in a war of colonial conquest, said it wants to reclaim all of its territory, including Crimea, the home of Russia’s Black Sea naval base. Shoigu said Ukraine’s armed forces carried out 263 attacks on Russian positions since June 4, referring to what Moscow regards as thestart of Ukraine’s counteroffensive. “Thanks to the smart and selfless actions of our units, all of them [the attacks] have been repelled. The enemy has not accomplished its goals,” Shoigu said. Ukraine said it has recaptured eight villages in the early stages of its counterattack, and a defence official promised Kyiv’s“biggest blow” lay aheaddespite tough resistance from Moscow’s troops. “At this time, our soldiers in the south and east are actively destroying the enemy, physically cleansing Ukraine,” President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video message. “A defence against terror means destroying terrorists. And it is a guarantee that the state of evil will never have the opportunity to bring evil to Ukraine.” Russia on Tuesday struck at military and infrastructure targets in Kyiv and other parts of the country, including western areas far from the front lines, Ukrainian officials said. Also on Tuesday, local authorities in the Russian-controlled town of Nova Kakhovka in the southern region of Kherson said a Ukrainian drone strike killed a woman and wounded four people. The attack on public service facilities was carried out by loitering munitions, also known as“kamikaze drones”, they said. The strikes took place as attention has been focused on Ukrainian assaults against Russia’s defensive positions in the south and east in theinitial stages of its counteroffensiveseeking to push President Vladimir Putin’s troops back from territory seized since the invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. Kyiv said it has recaptured 113sq km (44sq miles) of land from Russian forces. But the latest strikes showed that Russia is capable of waging war beyond the southern and eastern front lines. Zelenskyy’s office said drones attacked the Kyiv region in several waves with the air alert lasting for four hours. Several commercial and administrative buildings and some private houses were damaged, it said.    Ukraine said it shot down 32 of 35 Iranian-made Shahed drones launched from Russia’s Bryansk region andthe Azov Sea. A “critically important facility” was struck in Lviv, far from the front lines and 70km (43 miles) from the border with Poland, Governor Maksym Kozytskiy said. He gave no details. The air force said Ukrainian air defences had been in action in most regions. “However, the main direction of attack by Iranian drones was the Kyiv region. More thantwo dozen Shahedswere destroyed here,” it said on Telegram. The energy ministry said debris from falling drones damaged electrical lines in the Kyiv region and also in the Mykolaiv region in the south, cutting off electricity for hundreds of residents. The air force said Russia also hit the southeastern industrial city of Zaporizhzhiawith Iskander and S-300 missiles.

"Russia launches ‘massive’ air attack on Kyiv, Ukrainian cities",Authorities say 28 of 30 drones shot down over the capital as air raid sirens heard across the country.,"Russia has launched a series of air raids across Ukraine aimed at Kyiv and cities from east to west. The General Staff of Ukraine’s Armed Forces said that according to preliminary information, Ukraine’s air defence systems shot down 28 out of 30 Iranian-made Shahed drones that Russia launched on Tuesday. About 20 enemy targets were identified and destroyed by Ukrainian forces and air defence in the airspace around Kyiv, Serhiy Popko, head of the Kyiv military administration, said on the Telegram messaging app. “Another massive air attack on the capital,” he wrote, adding that it was the first attack on the city in 18 days to use Shahed drones. Air raid sirens could be heard for nearly four and a half hours in the early hours of the morning in Kyiv and for several hours in many other parts of the country. The military administration of Lviv, a city of about 700,000 people that lies about 70 km (43 miles) from the border with Poland, said explosions were heard at about 5am (02:00 GMT) and that Russia hit “critical infrastructure” in the city, sparking a fire. According to preliminary reports, there were no casualties. There were also missile attacks in the Zaporizhia region in southeastern Ukraine where Yuriy Malashko, head of the military administration, said Russia targeted telecommunication infrastructure as well as agriculture and farming properties in its raids. No casualties were reported in the Zaporizhia raids. Three Shahed drones were also shot down over the southern region of Mykolaiv, governor Vitaliy Kim said on Telegram. It was not possible to independently verify the reports.

Ukraine says ‘biggest blow’ yet to come in counteroffensive push,Ukraine’s Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said Kyiv’s forces and Moscow’s troops are engaged in a ‘tough duel’ and Russia is throwing everything into the battle.,"Ukraine’s Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said the “biggest blow” inKyiv’s counteroffensivecampaign against Russian forces has yet to come but admitted the operation is difficult as Moscow is throwing all it can into the battle to prevent Ukraine from pressing forward. Ukraine began the first stage of its long-rumoured counteroffensive two weeks ago to reclaim land occupied by Russian forces. But amid reports of slow progress by Ukraine’s forces and stiff resistance by Russia, officials in Moscow have claimed the Ukrainian offensive has failed. The Ukrainian military, which has maintained a strict silence about the campaign in general, announced on Monday that small victories had been achieved andeight villages liberatedso far, along with some 113 square km (70 sq miles) of territory. “The biggest blow is yet to come,” Maliar said on Monday. “The ongoing operation has several objectives, and the military is fulfilling these tasks,” she wrote on the Telegram messaging app.    “The enemy will not easily give up their positions, and we must prepare ourselves for a tough duel,” she said. “In fact, that is what is happening right now.” Russian President Vladimir Putin said late last week the Ukrainian counteroffensive did not have any meaningful success. But some Russian military bloggers say Kyiv has made small gains at the expense of huge troop and equipment losses. While it is impossible to independently verify the military operation along the most contentious points of the front line, the Reuters news agency was able to confirm thatUkrainian forces have advancedin the early phase of the counteroffensive. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington DC-based think tank, cited sources on Sunday as saying that Ukrainian forces may be temporarily pausing counteroffensive operations to “reevalute their tactics for future operations”. ISW also reiterated that the main counteroffensive campaign had yet to start. “ISW has previously noted that Ukraine has not yet committed the majority of its available forces to counteroffensive operations and has not yet launched its main effort,” the ISW said in its daily situational analysis. “Operational pauses are a common feature of major offensive undertakings, and this pause does not signify the end of Ukraine’s counteroffensive,” it said.

Only liberated ones. They have only losses,” he said. Officials from two NATO member states said Moscow was redeploying some of its forces as it seeks to predict where Ukraine will strike.    United Kingdom and Estonian intelligence officials said that Russia had been moving some forces east along the front line from areas south of the Dnipro River flooded by the destruction of the huge Kakhovka hydroelectric dam on June 6. Overall the Ukrainian military said its counteroffensive is going according to plan, but at the same time admitted to a “difficult situation” on the front. In the south of the country, Ukrainian Commander-in-Chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi wrote on Telegram on Monday that the Ukrainian advance was hampered by fortifications, dense minefields and a “large number of reserves” but that the operation will remain on schedule. In a video, he also showed himself with Chief of General Staff Serhiy Shaptala at a command centre near the front. With this, Zaluzhnyi was likely also countering rumours in Russian state media, which has repeatedly claimed that he had been seriously injured in a missile attack in May.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/20/ukraine-says-biggest-blow-yet-to-come-in-counteroffensive-push

South Africa leader hails ‘historic’ Ukraine peace mission,President Cyril Ramaphosa noted the trip was the first time African leaders embarked on a peace mission ‘beyond the shores of the continent’.,"South African President Cyril Ramaphosa praised an African mission to broker peace in Ukraine as “historic” – despite a lukewarm reception by the leaders of warring Russia and Ukraine. Ramaphosa made the remarks on his return on Monday from talks in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv and the Russian city of St Petersburg – talks that did not yield any immediate results. The high-profile delegation of presidents and envoys met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday before flying to Russia to speak with its President Vladimir Putin the next day. “This initiative has been historic in that it is the first time African leaders have embarked on a peace mission beyond the shores of the continent,” Ramaphosa said in his weekly newsletter. He added “one of the key achievements” of the mission “was the positive reception” received from both sides, “which provides cause for optimism that the proposals will be given consideration”. Both Zelenskyy and Putin have agreed to further engagements, Ramaphosa said. A continental powerhouse, South Africa has refused to condemn the invasion of Ukraine, sayingit wants to stay neutraland prefers dialogue to end the war. The African leaders’ mission brought the voice of a continent that has badly suffered from the repercussions of the Ukraine conflict, particularly with rising grain prices. It put forward a 10-point proposal, including de-escalation, the recognition of countries’ sovereignty, unimpeded grain exports through the Black Sea, and sending prisoners of war and children back to their countries of origin. But the principles were deemed “very difficult to implement” by the Kremlin, while Zelenskyy ruled out talks with Moscow as long as Russian troops occupied Ukrainian territory. The diplomatic team included the presidents of South Africa, Senegal, Comoros and Zambia, as well as top officials from Uganda, Egypt and Congo-Brazzaville.

Russia blocks UN aid for Kakhovka dam collapse victims,Massive flooding caused by dam breach has contaminated drinking water and led to bans on swimming and eating seafood.,"Moscow has rejected United Nations’ offers to help people in Russian-occupied areas affected by flooding from the collapsed Nova Kakhovka Dam. Thedam was breachedon June 6, unleashing a wave of water from the Dnipro River on communities across southern Ukraine including Russian-occupied parts of the Kherson region. The floods destroyed homes and farmland, forced the evacuation of thousands, contaminated supplies of drinking water and sparked fears ofenvironmental disaster. The UN urged Russia to act in accordance with its obligations under international humanitarian law. “The UN will continue to do all it can to reach all people – including those suffering as a result of the recent dam destruction – who urgently need life-saving assistance, no matter where they are,” Denise Brown, UN humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine, said in a statement on Sunday. “Aid cannot be denied to people who need it.” The death toll from the disaster has risen to 52, with Russian officials saying 35 people had died in areas under its control and Ukraine’s interior ministry saying 17 had died and 31 were missing. More than 11,000 people have been evacuated on both sides. Ukraine accuses Russia of blowing up the Soviet-era dam, which has been under Russian control since the early days of its full-scale invasion in 2022. A team of international legal experts assisting Ukraine’s prosecutors in their investigation said it was “highly likely” the dam’s collapse was caused by explosives planted by the Russians. The Associated Press news agency reported Russia had “the means, motive and opportunity” to destroy the dam, citing drone photos and information from military and political sources in the area. Russia hasaccused Ukraineof causing the dam breach but the various Russian allegations, including that it was hit by a missile, fail to account for a blast so strong that it registered on seismic monitors in the region. The massive flooding that followed the explosion came as Ukraine was preparing to launch its counteroffensive and the Dnipro River forms the front line. “It’s a regular practice, to mine (places) before a retreat,” Illia Zelinskyi, commander of Bugskiy Gard told the AP, recounting how the rising waters rapidly swamped their positions. “In this context, their actions were to disrupt some of our supply chains as well as complicate a crossing of the Dnieper [Dnipro] for us.” Zelinskyi confirmed to the news agency that the explosion seemed to come from the area where the dam’s machine room was located. He and a United States official familiar with the intelligence both said Russian forces had been there for some time. The US official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive material. Photos, taken from Ukrainian drone footage and obtained by the AP, also showed dozens of Russian soldiers encamped on a bank of the Dnipro, looking relaxed as they walked back and forth to the dam with no cover. A photo dated May 28 also showed a car parked on the dam, its roof cut open to reveal enormous barrels, one with what appeared to be a land mine attached to the lid and a cable running towards the Russian-held side of the river. Although the car bomb itself would not have been enough to destroy the dam, it would have amplified any explosion originating in the machine room, a Ukrainian special forces communications official told the news agency.    Nova Kakhovkawas one of a series of dams built along the Dnipro River in the Soviet era designed to withstand enormous force. The release of the now-contaminated water has already forced the closure of popular Black Sea swimming beaches in Odesa and prohibited the consumption of fish and seafood from unidentified sources. “The beaches of Odesa have been declared as unsuitable for swimming due to the significant deterioration of the water … and real danger to health,” Odesa’s administration said on the Telegram messaging app. Water tests last week showed dangerous levels of salmonella and other “infectious agents,” Ukrainian officials said. Monitoring for cholera was also in place. Levels of toxic substances in sea organisms and on the seabed are expected to worsen. There are also concerns about land mines washing up along the coast.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/19/russia-blocks-un-aid-for-kakhovka-dam-collapse-victims

Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-installed official in Ukraine, said Ukrainian forces hadcaptured the village of Piatykhatkyin the Zaporizhia region, in Kyiv’s second gain on that front since it launched its counteroffensive earlier this month. Rogov said the Ukrainians had mounted waves of attacks and that “hundreds” of Ukrainian soldiers had been killed. Russia’s defence ministry said its forces repelled a series of Ukrainian attacks across three sections of the front line. The ministry said Kyiv was pressing most actively in the Zaporizhia region but did not mention Piatykhatky. Ukraine’s army said its air force carried out 14 raids on Russian positions and destroyed two anti-aircraft missile systems. Serhiy Bratchuk, the spokesperson for the Odesa military administration, said Ukraine destroyed a “significant” ammunition depot near the Russian-occupied port city of Henichesk in the southern region of Kherson. The United Kingdom said Russia and Ukraine were suffering high numbers of military casualties as Kyiv fights to dislodge the Kremlin’s forces from occupied areas. The most intense fighting was in the southeastern Zaporizhia region, around Bakhmut and further west in the eastern Donetsk region, the UK said. The boss of Russia’s Wagner Group,Yevgeny Prigozhin, said 32,000 men recruited from Russian prisons had returned home after the end of their contracts with the mercenary force in Ukraine.

Ukraine takes Zaporizhia village amid fierce front-line battles,"Ukraine’s counteroffensive continues with small advances as Russia conducts ‘effective’ defensive operations in the south, analysts say.","Ukrainian troopshave recaptured Piatykhatky, a village in the west of the Zaporizhia region, Kyiv’s second gain on that front since it launched its counteroffensive earlier this month. A Russian-installed official in the partly-occupied Zaporizhia region, Vladimir Rogov, said Ukraine had taken “operational control” of the settlement and that Russian troops were trying to counterattack with shelling. “The enemy’s ‘wave-like’ offensives yielded results, despite enormous losses,” Rogov said on the Telegram messaging app. There was no immediate comment from Ukraine on the situation and Al Jazeera could not independently confirm the battlefield reports. Ukraine said on June 12 it had taken control of Lobkove, a village next to Piatykhatky. Zaporizhia is the location of some of the most intense fighting since the counteroffensive began, according to a United Kingdom’s intelligence assessment on Sunday. Battles were also raging around the city of Bakhmut and in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, the UK said. Ukraine is on the offensive in these areas and “made small advances”, it said, adding that Russian forces are conducting “relatively effective defensive operations” in Ukraine’s south. Serhiy Bratchuk, a government spokesperson for Ukraine’s southwestern Odesa region, said Ukrainian forces destroyed a “very significant” ammunition depot near the Russian-occupied port city of Henichesk in nearby Kherson province. “Our armed forces dealt a good blow in the morning,” Bratchuk said in a video message posted to his Telegram channel. Western analysts and military officials have cautioned that Ukraine’s counteroffensive to dislodge Russian forces from occupied areas along the 1,000km (620-mile) front line could last a long time. Russia’s defence ministry made no mention of Piatykhatky in its daily update, in which it said its forces had repelled Ukrainian attacks in three sections of the front line. A separate statement from Russia’s Vostok group of forces said Ukraine had failed to take the settlement. The Ukrainian military said on Sunday that over the previous 24 hours, Russia carried out 43 air strikes, four missile attacks and 51 rocket launches. According to its statement, Russia continues to concentrate its efforts on offensive operations in Ukraine’s industrial east, focusing attacks around Bakhmut, Avdiivka, Marinka and Lyman in the Donetsk region, with 26 combat clashes taking place. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday praised Ukrainian forces for their “very effective” repelling of enemy assaults near Avdiivka. He also described the southern front as “the most brutal” and expressed gratitude to the troops fighting there. Meanwhile, the boss of Russia’s Wagner Group,Yevgeny Prigozhin, said that 32,000 men who joined up to fight with his mercenary group from jail had returned home after the end of their contracts in Ukraine. Prigozhin toured Russian prisons to recruit fighters, promising pardons if they survived a half-year tour of front-line duty with Wagner. In an interview last month, Prigozhin said herecruited 50,000 convicts, about 10,000 of whom were killed in Bakhmut. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who rarely comments on the course of the war, made two unusually detailed interventions last week in which he derided the Ukrainian push and said Kyiv’s forces had “no chance” despite being newly equipped with Western tanks. His comments appeared intended to reassure Russians at a crucial juncture, nearly 16 months into the conflict, as Ukraine seeks to break months of virtual deadlock and take back the 18 percent of its territory still under Russian control.    Meanwhile, the United Nations said on Sunday that Russia has “so far declined our request to access the areas under its temporary military control” after the destruction of theNova Kakhovka damon June 6 in the southern region of Kherson unleashed 18 cubic km (4.3 cubic miles) of water that submerged villages and farmland. “The UN will continue to engage to seek the necessary access. We urge the Russian authorities to act in accordance with their obligations under international humanitarian law,” said Denise Brown, the UN humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine, in a statement. “Aid cannot be denied to people who need it.” Zelenskyy accused Russia ofdeliberately blowing upthe dam, calling it a “war crime” and “brutal ecocide”.

"War in Ukraine must stop, South Africa’s Ramaphosa tells Putin",South African president says the war is having a ‘negative impact’ on the African continent and many other countries.,"South African President Cyril Ramaphosa – who is in Russia as part of a peace-seeking delegation – told his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin that thewar in Ukrainemust stop. Ramaphosa laid out the 10 points of the African peace initiative that is seeking agreement on a series of “confidence-building measures” – even as Ukraine last week began acounteroffensive to push back Russian forces. “This war has to have an end… It must be settled through negotiations and through diplomatic means,” said Ramaphosa in St Petersburg on Saturday at the 18th-century Konstantinovsky Palace. He added his delegation, consisting of seven African leaders, “came with a very clear message: that this war has to be ended”. “This war is having a negative impact on the African continent and indeed, on many other countries around the world,” Ramaphosa said. Putin interrupted opening remarks by African leaders seeking to mediate in the Ukraine conflict to deliver a list of reasons why he believed many of their proposals were misguided. He reiterated his position that Ukraine and the West had started the conflict long before Russia sent itsarmed forces over the borderin February last year. He said Russia had never refused talks with the Ukrainian side, which had been blocked by Kyiv. The group also includes leaders from Egypt, the Republic of the Congo, Senegal, Zambia, Uganda and Comoros. On Friday, the delegation held talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv. Ukraine’s leader said after meeting the leaders that peace talks with Russia would be possible only after Moscow withdrew its forces from occupied Ukrainian territory. “We have come to listen to you and through you to hear the voice of the Russian people,” said Comoros President Azali Assoumani, who currently heads the African Union, told Putin. “We wanted to encourage you to enter into negotiations with Ukraine.” African countries have been divided over their response to the conflict, with some siding with Ukraine, while others have remained neutral or gravitated towards Moscow. During their meeting with Zelenskyy, the Ukraine presidentrequestedthe African leaders push Putin to release political prisoners as a confidence-building measure. Putin, 70, on Saturday, praised the “balanced approach” of African countries towards the Ukraine conflict. “We welcome the balanced approach of African friends to the Ukraine crisis,” Putin told the visiting leaders. “We’re open to constructive dialogue with all those who want peace based on the principles of respect for each other’s interests, as well as justice.” The Russian leader also said exports of Ukrainian grain under a deal ensuring its safe passage through the Black Sea was not helping to resolve Africa’s problems with high global food prices – as only 3 percent has gone to the poorest countries. Putin said the food crisis had been caused by the actions of Western countries, not by what Russia calls a “special military operation” in Ukraine. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Saturday that there appeared to be “no chance” of extending the deal permitting Ukraine to export grain safely across the Black Sea through Russian-controlled waters. “It’s hardly possible to predict any final decision here, but I can say that, judging de facto by the status quo that we have, this deal has no chance,” Peskov told the Russian news outlet Izvestia. Al Jazeera’s Ali Hashem, reporting from Moscow, said while many were sceptical the peace mission could lead to a breakthroughbetween Russia and Ukraine, some argue the experience African leaders have from internal and regional conflicts may be able to come up with an “out of the box solution”. “However, this crisis is multilayered and intertwined … and that’s why its so complicated. The Americans, Europeans, the Chinese … everyone is trying to have their own say on it, and it doesn’t seem it’s going to be solved anytime soon.”   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/17/war-in-ukraine-must-stop-south-africas-ramaphosa-tells-putin
"Putin confirms nukes in Belarus, US slates Russian sabre-rattling",Russian President Vladimir Putin says the West is doing everything to inflict strategic defeat on Moscow in Ukraine.,"The United States has made no adjustments to its nuclear posture following Russia’s deployment of nuclear weapons in Belarus and denounced comments by Russian President Vladimir Putin that Moscow could “theoretically” use nuclear weapons if there was a threat to its territorial integrity or existence. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Friday that Washington had not changed its nuclear stance asPutin confirmed for the first time that Russia had placed nuclear arms in Belarus. “We have no reason to adjust our own nuclear posture. We don’t see any indications that Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon,” Blinken said. Blinken said it was “ironic” that Putin had placed Russian nuclear weapons in Belarus when the Russian leader had justified his invasion of Ukraine on the basis that he wanted to prevent Kyiv from obtaining such weapons. Speaking at Russia’s annual economic forum in Saint Petersburgon Friday, Putin said Russian tactical nuclear warheads had already been delivered to close ally Belarus, but stressed he saw no need for Russia to resort to nuclear weapons for now.    “The first nuclear warheads were delivered to the territory of Belarus. But only the first ones, the first part. But we will do this job completely by the end of the summer or by the end of the year,” Putin said. The Russian leader said the deployment of the warheads – the first outside Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union – was intended as a warning to the West about arming and supporting Ukraine. The West, he said, was doing everything it could to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia in Ukraine. “It is precisely as an element of deterrence so that all those who are thinking about inflicting a strategic defeat on us are not oblivious to this circumstance,” Putin said. But, for now,Russia had no need to resort to nuclear weapons, he said, adding that talks with the West to reduce Russia’s vast nuclear arsenal were a non-starter. “Nuclear weapons have been made to ensure our security in the broadest sense of the word and the existence of the Russian state, but we … have no such need [to use them],” Putin said. “Just talking about this [the potential use of nuclear weapons] lowers the nuclear threshold. We have more than NATO countries, and they want to reduce our numbers. Screw them,” he said. The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington, DC-based think tank, said on Friday that Moscow’s deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus is part of longstanding efforts to “cement Russia’s de facto military control over Belarus” but is unlikely to herald a Russian escalation. The#Kremlinclaimed#Russiahas begun transferring tactical nuclear warheads (under Russian control) to#Belarus, in line with previously announced plans.https://t.co/ywHzDwCVUphttps://t.co/Ls7uq84PZt — ISW (@TheStudyofWar)June 17, 2023  Striking a defiant tone on his war in Ukraine, the Russian leader said that Kyiv’s counteroffensive against Russian forces had no meaningful success so far and Ukraine’s forces were suffering heavy losses and would soon run out of their own military equipment, making them totally reliant on hardware supplied by the West. “There’s nothing left. Everything on which they fight and everything that they use is brought in from the outside. Well, you can’t fight like that for long,” he said. Focusing on Western-supplied armour such as German-made Leopard tanks, Putin said they were being destroyed regularly by his forces and if Kyiv acquired US-made F-16 fighter jets from its allies, they too would go up in flames. He also appeared to hint that Russia would target such fighter planes in locations outside Ukraine. “If they will be stationed outside Ukraine and used in combat operations, we will have to look at how to engage and where to engage those assets being used in combat operations against us,” he said.    Targeting F-16 aircraft outside Ukraine presented “a serious danger” of dragging NATO further into the conflict, he added. Later on Friday,Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyysaid that every metre of Ukrainian territory recaptured from Russian forces was “of the utmost importance” during the current counteroffensive operation. “Every soldier, every new step we take, every metre of Ukrainian land freed from the enemy is of utmost importance,” Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address after meeting top military commanders. Ukraine’s Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said earlier that troops were “engaged in active moves to advance in several directions at once” along the front line; and in the south, troops had advanced up to 2km (1.3 miles) “in each direction”. In Ukraine’s east, Maliar said Russian forces were trying to dislodge Ukrainian forces from established positions, while Ukrainian forces around the devastated city of Bakhmut were trying to push Russian forces out from the outskirts of the town.

What did Putin say at Russia’s flagship economic forum?,The Russian president touted his country’s resilient economy despite sanctions and said Ukraine’s forces stood ‘no chance’ of winning the war.,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has praised his country’s economic strength despite the imposition of toughinternational sanctionsover the conflict in Ukraine, called Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy a “disgrace” to the Jewish people and said Kyiv had no chance of winning the war. Speaking at the premier St Petersburg International Economic Forum on Friday,Putinalso asked the audience to hold a minute’s silence in honour of former Italian Prime MinisterSilvio Berlusconi, who died on Monday. Here’s a summary of what Putin said: The country’s macroeconomic trends were looking positive while “gaining momentum and strength”. “In April of this year, gross domestic product grew by 3.3 percent in annual terms, and by the end of the year it will add more than a percent,” Putin said. His government’s responsible budgetary and monetary policy had ensured that Russia had reached historically low levels of unemployment, which currently stood at 3.3 percent, he added. Ukraine’scounteroffensivewould fail as Kyiv’s troops sought to advance in several directions, Putin said, including in the southeastern region of Zaporizhia. “I think that Ukraine’s armed forces stand no chance here, as well as in other directions … I have no doubt about that.” The 70-year-old leader said Ukraine had almost depleted allof its own weaponsand armoury, and will soon be reliant on supplies solely from its allies. “Soon Ukraine will stop using its own equipment altogether. Nothing remains of it. Everything with which they fight and everything that they use is brought in from the outside. You can’t fight for long like that.” “[Western] tanks are burning. Several tanks have been destroyed, including Leopards… F-16s will also burn, there is no doubt. But if they are located outside Ukraine and are used in hostilities, we will have to look at how and where we can hit those weapons used in hostilities against us.” “There is a serious danger of NATO being further drawn into this armed conflict,” he warned of the military alliance. “We have never closed the door [on the idea of Ukraine peace talks].” Putin confirmed Moscow had sent nuclear arms to its ally Belarus, which borders Ukraine. “The first nuclear warheads were delivered to the territory of Belarus … This is the first part,” Putin said. He had announced plans to send tactical nuclear weapons – less powerful than strategic weapons – in March. “By the end of summer, the end of the year, we will complete the process,” of transferring tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, Putin added. He also said that the “use of nuclear weapons is certainly theoretically possible. For Russia, this is possible if a threat is created to our territorial integrity, independence and sovereignty, the existence of the Russian state.”    “As for [attacks] on these [Russian] border territories, well, this is an attempt to distract us … to force us to transfer some units deployed on other parts of the front line.” Putin criticised Zelenskyy and called him a “disgrace”. “I have many Jewish friends. They say Zelenskyy is not a Jew, he is a disgrace to the Jewish people.” The Russian leader has frequently described Ukraine as a Nazi state and used the false claim to justify his invasion, citing a goal of “denazification”. While the country’s public finances were “generally balanced”, Putin said a small current federal budget deficit existed and additional funds were needed to strengthen Russia’s defence capabilities. “We are obliged to do this to protect the sovereignty of our country.”    “We practically have no contacts, and it wasn’t us that rejected them,” he said regarding the tumultuous relationship that broke down further after Russia invaded Ukraine last year. “If there was a desire to conduct some kind of dialogue with us … they simply transferred this dialogue to the sphere of arms supplies.” “President Biden is a grown man and a seasoned politician. It’s not for me to tell him what to do. Let him do as he sees fit, and we will do what we believe is in the interests of the Russian Federation and the people of Russia. And everyone will have to reckon with this.” Putin criticised Europe for restarting coal-fired power plants while he praised the Kremlin’s climate policy. “Unlike many other states, we are fulfilling all the commitments we have taken on in this sphere. Even ahead of schedule,” he said. Some states have recently increased their electricity generation from coal, despite declarations to the contrary, he added. The president said the depositing of funds earned in Russia into foreign accounts carried “unacceptable risks” not only for the government, but Russian businesses, too. “Many of our businessmen were convinced of this by their own example when they saw and were surprised to find that their accounts and assets were frozen in the West,” he added. “I will say that if foreign manufacturers want to return again, come to our market, and we hear such conversations more and more often, we are not closing the doors to anyone. “You know very well that we have never driven anyone from our market or our economy.”   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/16/st-petersburg-forum-what-did-russian-president-putin-say
Fears of environmental disaster mount after Ukraine dam break,"An estimated 700,000 people are in need of clean water around the Nova Kakhovka dam as Kyiv accuses Moscow of ‘ecocide’.","Kyiv, Ukraine –Among displaced communities along the banks of Ukraine’s Dnipro River, bottled water has become the most coveted commodity. Thedestructionof the Nova Kakhovka dam on June 6 in the southern region of Kherson unleashed 18 cubic kilometres (4.3 cubic miles) of water that submerged villages and farmland. While water is all around, none of it is drinkable. “It is all poisoned,” Pavlo Khrapun, a humanitarian worker with the NGO Project Hope, told Al Jazeera. The man-made flood washed away chemical fertilisers from cultivated fields, flushed away pollutants from the riverbed, submerged cemeteries and released at least 150 tonnes of machine oil from the breached dam with additional fuel and industrial waste likely to have been discharged from plants around it. Khrapun, an expert in WASH – water, sanitation and hygiene – said his team has been working non-stop to deliver drinking water amid the almost constant sound of shelling and the threat posed by anti-tank and amphibious mines dislodged by the deluge. “People are very tired, very stressed, but mutual help motivates them,” Khrapun said. “They are focused on helping each other.” Floodwaters contaminated with chemicals and by bodies of people and animals are not just undrinkable. They also raise the risk of waterborne diseases, including diarrhoea and cholera. The United Nations estimated an “extraordinary” 700,000 people are in need of clean drinking water. UN Undersecretary General Martin Griffiths told Al Jazeera the dam breach is certain to have repercussions that will be felt for years to come. “This is an absolute calamity,” Griffiths said. Days after the explosion that caused the dam to collapse, Ukraine is still trying to find words for what it considers a crime. President Volodymyr Zelenskyyaccused Russia of deliberately blowing up the damand said the sabotage amounted to a “war crime”, “an act of terrorism” and “brutal ecocide”. The portmanteau word, which combines “ecology” and “genocide”, describes the wilful destruction of the environment as a weapon of war and is codified at the national level by a few states. Proponents have yet to secure its adoption under international law, but Ukrainian activists are hopeful the circumstances of Russia’s war on Ukraine could create momentum to do so.  Russia has denied causing the explosion at the dam as Ukraine was preparing to launch a counteroffensive and said Kyiv is responsible. Yevheniia Zasiadko, head of the Climate Department at Ecoaction – Centre for Environmental Initiatives in Kyiv, said the dam breach wiped out plant and animal species at risk of extinction, including the squacco heron and the little egret, and caused widespread and long-lasting damage. “There aren’t any doubts that this constitutes the crime of ecocide,” Zasiadko told Al Jazeera. Ecoaction said a number of habitats protected under the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance are likely destroyed or severely polluted, including the Black Sea Biosphere Reserve, a UNESCO biosphere reserve; the Kinburn Spit Regional Landscape Park; and numerous smaller sites. “The consequences will be felt not only by the nature reservoirs downstream but also upstream,” Zasiadko said, adding that the areas spared by the flood were nonetheless dependent on the Kakhovka Reservoir’s water. The Ukrainian Nature and Conservation Group said in a report that forestry resources may also suffer. Large areas along the south bank of the Dnipro River are home to Crimean pine, common pine and white acacia, none of which is well-suited to prolonged moisture exposure. “Consequently, these tree species may perish due to the extended period of flooding,” the group said. Debris from destroyed infrastructure and natural and man-made waste were spotted littering Odesa beach, causing concerns to mount for the Black Sea marine ecosystem. “The scale of destruction of wildlife, natural ecosystems and entire national parks is incomparably greater than the consequences for the wilderness of all military operations since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022,” the report concluded. Griffiths, who also serves as the UN’s emergency relief coordinator, said the ravaging of “one of the world’s most important breadbaskets” will almost inevitably lead to lower grain exports with repercussions for global food supplies. Ukraine’s Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food estimated that the flooding affected 100sq km (40sq miles) of farmland on the right bank of the Dnipro River, which is under Ukrainian control. Monika Tothova, economist at the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization, told Al Jazeera that no specific information was available on the damage to agricultural land under Russian control. “Based on the satellite images and modelling of the flooding, “it is very likely this year’s harvest will be a complete loss, depending how long the water stays,” Tothova said. The extent of the damage will depend on the scale of the floods and how fast the waters recede, the economist added. Beyond the province of Kherson, the dam also provided a vital source of irrigation to the Mykolaiv, Zaporizhia and Dnipropetrovsk regions and their wheat, barley, millet, rapeseed and sunflower crops. Russia’s war in Ukraine and the severe reduction in farms exports triggered a global food crisis last year, which the UN worked to mitigate by negotiating agrain export dealbetween Kyiv and Moscow with the help of Turkey. Griffiths told The Associated Press in an interview that while he was working alongside UN trade chief Rebeca Grynspan to ensure the extension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative, the impact of the dam breach posed a series of problems of “a whole new order of magnitude”. This is “a viral problem”, he said. “The truth is this is only the beginning of seeing the consequences of this act.” Reporting by Mansur Mirovalev in Kyiv and Federica Marsi in Milan.

Zelenskyy asks African leaders to push Russia on prisoner release,The delegation began their ‘peace mission’ in Ukraine and plan to visit Russia and meet President Putin on Saturday.,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged a group of African leaders to ask his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to free political prisoners from Crimea and beyond, saying it would be an “important step” during their trip to Russia on Saturday. Seven African leaders – the presidents of Comoros, Senegal, South Africa and Zambia, as well as Egypt’s prime minister and top envoys from the Republic of Congo and Uganda – visited Ukraine on Friday as part of a self-styled “peace mission” to both Ukraine and Russia to try to help end their nearly 16-month-old war. On Saturday, the African leaders will travel to meet Putin in the Russian city of St Petersburg. The mission to Ukraine, the first of its kind by African leaders, comes in the wake of other peace initiatives such as one by China. “This conflict is affecting Africa negatively,” South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said at a news conference alongside Zelenskyy and the four other African heads of state or government, after the leaders met for closed-door talks on Friday afternoon. The trip is seen as a crucial one as many African nations, to varying degrees, rely on food and fertiliser deliveries from Russia and Ukraine, whose war has jeopardised and impeded exports from one of the world’s most important breadbaskets. “I do believe that Ukrainians feel that they must fight and not give up. The road to peace is very hard,” Ramaphosa added. “Today, we even told President Zelenskyy that we not only recognise their [Ukrainians’] viewpoint, but we also respect how they feel about the war that’s going on. But we also said there is a need to bring this conflict to an end sooner rather than later.” Zelenskyy told reporters after the meeting with the delegation of African leaders, “I clearly said several times at our meeting that to allow any negotiations with Russia now that the occupier is on our land is to freeze the war, to freeze pain and suffering.” He also said that peace talks with Russia would be possible only after Moscow withdraws its forces from occupied Ukrainian territory. “We need real peace, and therefore, a real withdrawal of Russian troops from our entire independent land.” The mood of the news conference became tense when Comoros President Azali Assoumani floated the idea of a “road map” to peace, prompting questions from Zelenskyy who sought a clarification and insisted he did not want “any surprises” from their visit with Putin. Zelenskyy then urged them to help free political prisoners fromCrimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014. “Would you please ask Russia to liberate the political prisoners?” Zelenskyy said. “Maybe this will be an important result of your mission, of your ‘road map’.”    Earlier, explosions rocked Kyiv as air raid sirens blared in the Ukrainian capital as the visit began. “Putin ‘builds confidence’ by launching the largest missile attack on Kyiv in weeks, exactly amid the visit of African leaders to our capital,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter afterwards. “Russian missiles are a message to Africa: Russia wants more war, not peace.” Before their meeting with Zelenskyy, the African leaders visitedBucha, a Kyiv suburb where bodies of civilians lay scattered in the streets last year after Russian troops abandoned a campaign to seize the capital and withdrew from the area. The peace mission could propose a series of “confidence-building measures” during initial efforts at mediation, according to a draft framework document seen by the Reuters news agency. The document stated that the objective of the mission is “to promote the importance of peace and to encourage the parties to agree to a diplomacy-led process of negotiations”. Its measures could include a Russian pullback, removal of tactical nuclear weapons from Belarus and suspension of the implementation of an International Criminal Court arrest warrant targeting Putin. A ceasefire could follow and would need to be accompanied by negotiations between Russia and the West, the document stated. Kyiv said its own plan, which envisages the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian land, must be the basis for any settlement of the war. Meanwhile, a diplomatic standoff continues between South African officials and Polish authorities in Warsaw. South Africa’s News 24 reported that the row began after a charter plane with presidential security and journalists landed in the Polish capital from Johannesburg on Thursday afternoon. Ramaphosa, who landed on a separate flight, had to travel to Kyiv by train with an unknown number of security personnel even as the plane is reportedly still stuck in Warsaw. “A second charter plane that was apparently supposed to take the security team to a rendezvous with the president in the south of Poland before he travelled to Kyiv never arrived to pick up the South Africans upon their arrival at Warsaw’s Chopin Airport,” News 24 reported. “It is unclear who the service provider is who was to provide the second charter plane.” According to South African journalists at the scene, Polish authorities refused to let the South African security personnel leave the plane and threatened to confiscate 13 containers of weapons and equipment on it. In response, General Wally Rhoode, head of Ramaphosa’s security, called a news conference on the steps of the plane. “They are delaying us,” he said, accusing Polish authorities of “sabotage” and “racism”, according to media outlet EWN. “They’re putting the life of our president in jeopardy because we could have been in Kyiv this afternoon already.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/16/south-africas-ramaphosa-arrives-in-ukraine-on-african-peace-mission
US military chief says Ukraine offensive a ‘very difficult fight’,US General Mark Milley says Ukraine making ‘steady progress’ in counteroffensive that will take time and come at a ‘high cost’.,"Senior US military officials said Ukraine faces a tough fight in the ongoingcounteroffensive against Russian forcesand the campaign to take back territory will likely come “at a high cost”. The US assessment of Kyiv’s counteroffensivecame as Chechen fighters said they had deployed to Russia’s Belgorod region bordering Ukraine to prevent attacks frompro-Ukraine Russian partisan groupsand as Ukrainian military officials on Thursday reported advances along the front line in several locations. “Ukraine has begun their attack, and they are making steady progress. This is a very difficult fight. It’s a very violent fight, and it will likely take a considerable amount of time at a high cost,”US Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at NATO headquarters in Brussels on Thursday. Milley, speaking after a meeting of the US-led Contact Group of some 50 countries that give military aid to Ukraine, said it was far too early “to put any estimates” on how long the Ukrainian counteroffensive could last.    US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told the meeting that Kyiv needed both short-term and long-term support as the war was a “marathon, not a sprint”, and Ukraine needed even more weapons. Austin also said that Ukraine still had plenty of firepower left to conduct its counteroffensive, despite initial losses inflicted by Russia. Moscow has played up video footage showingGerman Leopard tanks and US-donated Bradley fighting vehicles it claims were captured at the start of Ukraine’s push to take back territory from Russia. “I think the Russians have shown us [those] same five vehicles about 1,000 times from 10 different angles,” Austin said of the video clips. “But quite frankly, the Ukrainians still have a lot of combat capability, combat power,” he said. “This is a war, so we know that there will be battle damage on both sides” and more important was Kyiv’s ability to repair damaged equipment, Austin said. “This will continue to be a tough fight as we anticipate it, and I believe that the element that does the best in terms of sustainment will probably have the advantage at the end of the day,” he added. The Ukrainian counteroffensive is in its early stages, and military experts say the decisive battles still lie ahead.    Ukraine has captured at least seven settlements and taken back 100 square kilometres (38 square miles) of territory in two major pushes in the south so far, Ukraine’s Brigadier-General Oleksii Hromov said on Thursday. “We are ready to continue fighting to liberate our territory even with our bare hands,” he said. Ukraine’s army on the southern front had advanced by up to 7km (4.4 miles) in the area along the Mokry Yali, as well as by up to 3km (1.8 miles) on another axis further west near the village of Mala Tokmachka, Ukrainian military officials said. “Our units and troops are moving forward in the face of fierce fighting [and] aviation and artillery superiority of the enemy,” Valeriy Shershen, a spokesperson for the Tavria military sector of southern Ukraine, told Ukrainian television. Advances in the east around the ruined city of Bakhmut, which Moscow seized last month, were also reported. Butthe big test of Ukraine’s offensive still lies aheadas Ukrainian troops have yet to reach the heaviest Russian defensive fortifications, which are set back from the front line. Kyiv is believed to have prepared an attack force of approximately 12 brigades of thousands of soldiers each, most using newly arrived Western armoured vehicles.    Washington, DC-based think tank, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), said on Friday that current operations by Ukrainian forces are “setting the conditions for wider Ukrainian counteroffensive objectives that are not immediately clear”. The current fighting “therefore represents the initial phase of an ongoing counteroffensive”, the ISW said. 3/ The UKR Tavrisk Group of Forces Press Center notably reported on June 15 that UKR forces have advanced up to one kilometer in the#Vulhedararea, and Tavrisk Commander Brigadier General Oleksandr Tarnavskyi stated that Ukrainian troops continue moving forward in this area. — ISW (@TheStudyofWar)June 16, 2023  Russian President Vladimir Putin insisted this week that Russian forces were inflicting 10 times more casualties on Ukrainians than they were enduring and that Kyiv’s offensive had been a failure. Chechnya ruler Ramzan Kadyrov also said on Thursday that fighters from the “Zapad-Akhmat” battalion had been deployed in Russia’s Belgorod region near the site of a cross-border attack in May by Russian-speaking pro-Ukrainian fighters. “Residents of the territories adjacent to the border with Ukraine can rest easy … Whoever encroaches on our borders will receive a lightning response,” Kadyrov said in a post on the Telegram messaging app.     ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/16/us-military-chief-says-ukraine-offensive-a-very-difficult-fight

Torture used by Russian forces in Ukraine may be state policy: UN,UN Special Rapporteur on Torture Alice Jill Edwards said widespread use of torture by Russian forces appears deliberate.,"Reports of thewidespread use of torture by Russian forces in Ukrainecould indicate that the severe abuse of Ukrainian prisoners of war and civilians is “state-endorsed” by Moscow, a United Nations expert has said. UN Special Rapporteur on Torture Alice Jill Edwards said on Thursday that she was alarmed by “reports and testimonies” which appeared to indicate that Russian forces in Ukraine are “consistently and intentionally inflicting severe physical and psychological pain and suffering” on both civilian and military prisoners. “The alleged practices include electric shocks, beatings, hooding, mock executions and other threats of death,” Edwards said in a statement. “If established, they … may also amount to a pattern of state-endorsed torture,” she said. “The consistency and methods of alleged torture suggests ‘a level of coordination, planning and organisation, as well as the direct authorisation, deliberate policy or official tolerance from superior authorities’,” the UN rapporteur said in a statement. Edwards said she and other UN rights experts had voiced their concerns in a letter to Moscow.    “Torture is a war crime, and the systematic or widespread practice of torture constitutes a crime against humanity,” Edwards said, warning that “obeying a superior order or policy direction” cannot be used to justify torturing prisoners. “Any individual involved should be promptly investigated and prosecuted,” she said. Those alleged to have been tortured were also often held in “grossly inadequate conditions” in facilities run by Russian forces inside Ukraine. Those who have reported suffering under Russian torture in Ukrainehave been left with physical and psychological injuries, including damage to internal organs, fractures and cracks in bones as well as hallucinations, sensory impairments, strokes and exacerbation of chronic diseases, the UN expert said. “The longer the war goes on, the more reports are emerging of torture and other inhuman treatment,” said Edwards, who plans to conduct a fact-finding mission to Ukraine later this year. “I strongly urge relevant authorities to ensure that civilians and prisoners of war are protected and treated humanely at all times,” she added.

IAEA’s Grossi says situation ‘serious’ at Ukraine nuclear plant,The head of the UN atomic energy agency visits the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant after dam breach.,"The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) says the situation at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine is “serious” but being stabilised. Grossi arrived at Europe’s biggest nuclear plant on Thursday to assess potential safety risks after thepartial collapseof the Kakhovka dam, whichcaused widespread floodingand exacerbated fears for the facility’s safety. The plant has been shut down, but it still needs water to cool the fuel in its reactors and its spent fuel to prevent a meltdown. It uses a cooling pond to keep its six reactors from overheating. The Kakhovka Reservoir was normally used to refill the pond but cannot do so now because of its falling water level due to the breach, officials said. Instead, the pond, which is separated from the reservoir, can be replenished using deep underground wells, they said. “On the one hand, we can see that the situation is serious,” Grossi said on a visit to the plant. “The consequences [of the dam’s destruction] are there, and they are real.” “At the same time, there are measures that are being taken to stabilise the situation.” He said it was unrealistic to expect Moscow and Kyiv to sign a document on the site’s security while fighting raged nearby. He also said that IAEA inspectors would remain at the site. “We have a political agreement which was formulated at the [United Nations] Security Council. Reaching a written agreement would be unrealistic at this stage because, as we know, there are no peace or ceasefire negotiations between the parties,” Russia’s TASS news agency quoted Grossi as saying. Grossi’s trip to the Zaporizhzhia plant was delayed by a day for security reasons as heavy fighting continues between Ukrainian and Russian forces. Russian forces captured both the nuclear plant and the Kakhovka hydroelectric dam shortly after President Vladimir Putin sent them into Ukraine on February 24, 2022. Grossi has repeatedly called for an end to the fighting in the vicinity of the facility to avoid any catastrophic accidents. Russia and Ukraine have blamed each other for shelling the facility, which has repeatedly cut power lines. The plant has diesel generators, as well as alternative water sources. Reporting from Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, Al Jazeera’s Jonah Hull said any damage to the plant could have “catastrophic consequences”. “It is hard to overstate the sort of dangers posed to this potentially hazardous place, given its location close to the front lines. “[Grossi] is clearly, to some degree, reassured by what is in place there,” he added. Alexei Likhachev, head of Russia’s state nuclear energy firm Rosatom, was quoted by the RIA news agency as saying that Grossi had observed during his visit the security measures taken at the plant to ensure its safety following the breach of the dam.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/15/iaeas-grossi-says-situation-serious-at-ukraine-nuclear-plant
"As Russians fight for Ukraine, Kyiv is faced with a new dilemma","As a Russian Volunteer Corps fighter is remembered as a ‘brave warrior’, analysts explain why Ukraine is distancing itself from armed groups.","Kyiv, Ukraine –Standing next to the coffin with the body of Daniil Maznik, many of his camouflage-clad, battle-tested brothers-in-arms wept. “He was a brave warrior, a pious Christian, a trustworthy comrade,” Denis Kapustin, Maznik’s commanding officer, said through tears during a farewell ceremony last weekend at the historic Baikove cemetery in Kyiv. Maznik, a bearded and burly 29-year-old, was killed duringone ofthe most audacious and brazen military operations of the continuing Russia-Ukraine war. On June 1, he was part of four small military units that crossed into the western Russian region of Belgorod to attack Shebekino, a city of 40,000, and seize the village of Novaya Tavolzhanka. They clashed with border guards and servicemen and were backed by Ukrainian drone attacks and heavy, indiscriminate artillery fire that included banned cluster munitions, Russian officials claimed. As they moved forward, tens of thousands of civilians fled Belgorod in panic, and Novaya Tavolzhanka briefly became Russia’s first and only area Moscow did not control. Maznik led the takeover of a border checkpoint, hijacked an armoured vehicle and captured a serviceman before being mowed down by gunfire on June 3, Kapustin said. The farewell ceremony held inside a cavernous funeral parlour would have resembled thousands of similar rituals held throughout Ukraine in the past 16 months. But some things made it look ominously different. Some of the stern, gloomy men in uniforms wore carefully adjusted masks, hats and sunglasses to avoid being recognised. None agreed to be interviewed by Al Jazeera, saying they had been “instructed” not to talk to the media. And not a single Ukrainian official showed up to deliver a eulogy or put flowers on the coffin. Because Maznik, whose nickname was Shaiba (Puck), was a Russian national and part of theRussian Volunteer Corps (RVC), a small military unit founded by fugitive ultranationalists. They said they were backed by The Freedom of Russia Legion made up of Russian prisoners of war who switched sides, and groups of volunteers from neighbouring Poland and Belarus. In February 2022, the Kremlin planned a triumphant blitzkrieg to topple Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government. In the words of the Kremlin, the purpose of Russia’s “special military operation” was to “liberate” Ukraine from Zelenskyy’s “neo-Nazi junta”. Back then, the very idea that the RVC and its allies would bring the war home to Russia during three raids – in March, late May and early June – would have seemed improbable. By that measure, Kyiv could have used the raids to trumpet how faltering and feeble Moscow’s war effort is, and how Russian officials failed to protect border regions despite hefty defence budgets. But it did not. Instead, Kyiv considers the RVC an independent political force the Kremlin should negotiate with directly. “We’re observing the course of hostilities and once again urge the Moscow regime to cease fire in the Belgorod region, immediately start talks with the RVC and stop meaningless bloodshed,” Zelenskyy’s aide Mykhailo Podolyak tweeted on June 5. “This is a fight of the Russian Goliath against the Russian David,” he wrote, concluding that “Ukraine doesn’t take part in the conflict.” Analysts say that Ukraine prefers to keep its backing of the RVC with intelligence information, artillery fire and drone attacks a secret – albeit an open one. “Kyiv is distancing itself from the RVC’s raids into Russia because officially, Ukraine doesn’t wage any military offensive on Russian territory,” David Gendelman, an independent military analyst told Al Jazeera. “Although everyone understands that no one would let them conduct such operations on their territory during a war, and in reality they are coordinated with Ukrainian intelligence,” he said. To him, the controversial past of the RVC’s founders is not the reason why Ukraine is so reluctant to admit its backing of the unit. “Kyiv would equally distance itself from them even if their past was not ultra-right but anything else – red, white or striped,” he said. One of the reasons is Ukraine’s heavy reliance on Western aid; Western nations have repeatedly warned that the advanced weaponry they provide can only be used on Ukrainian territory. But the RVC had at least four tactical vehicles that can withstand explosives and were supplied by the United States and Poland, as well as rifles made in Belgium and the Czech Republic, the Washington Postreportedon June 3. Two days later, Belgium said it objects to their use on Russian territory. “There are extremely strict rules regarding Belgian and other European weapons,” Prime Minister Alexander De Croo told the Le Soir newspaper. “We asked the Ukrainians to explain the situation.” Killed RVC fighter Maznik spent years in the Russian military – and used his experience to “transform a small band of desperate Russian guys into a full-fledged military unit,” Kapustin said in his eulogy. “Shaiba gave six years of his life to the Russian army, knew all the injustices and rot of this machine from inside and passionately fought against it next to us,” Kapustin said. Russian media claimed that Maznik had been convicted of fraud in Moscow and fled to Ukraine, abandoning his wife and child. His commander Kapustin, a 39-year-old with bulging muscles and several tattoos who prefers to be called White Rex, is far more outspoken. Kapustin was born in Russia but spent his formative years in Germany, where he said he was a “street boy, a skinhead, smashed faces.” He took part in and organised bare-knuckle boxing fights, and German police characterised him as “one of the most influential” far-right activists in Europe. He moved back to Russia and then fled to Ukraine in 2017. Germany reportedly cancelled his residency permit. In Kyiv, he opened The White Rex clothing store that sells attire with “Slavic solar symbols” that resemble swastikas and other insignia used in Nazi Germany. These days, Kapustin is wanted in Russia for allegedly organising a failed assassination attempt on pro-Kremlin tycoon Konstantin Malofeev, whose Tsargrad television channel is one of the loudest pro-war media outlets. Russian authorities also blacklisted the RVC as a “terrorist organisation” and arrested several men who tried to join it. Earlier this month, Moscow police conducted three dozen searches of RVC’s alleged supporters, the SOTA news website reported. Kapustin fanned the flames by saying the RVC wants to topple Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government. “Russia’s collapse will allow us to return home,” he told a news conference in October. “We will facilitate the complete and absolute breakdown of Russia’s political order.” His words and actions could become perfect fodder for Russia’s vocal supporters. “I think it would be a sin [in Russia] not to use fully the far-right, radical background of the RVC’s creators,” Vyacheslav Likhachev, a Kyiv-based expert on far-right and ultranationalist groups, told Al Jazeera. However, pro-war Russian commentators opted not to play this card – because the success of the RVC and its allies only underpins how unprepared Moscow’s armed forces and regional authorities are in dealing with their incursions. “Most likely, it’s related to the unwillingness of Russian propagandists to attract attention to the fact that groups of Russian nationals don’t just wage a war against [the Kremlin] as part of Ukrainian armed forces, but are very successful in conducting independent operations on Russian territory,” Likhachev said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/15/as-russians-fight-for-ukraine-kyiv-is-faced-with-a-new-dilemma
Ukraine ‘Azov regiment’ prisoners of war go on trial in Russia,Eight women are among the 22 Ukrainian prisoners of war who are accused by Russia of membership in a ‘terrorist group’.,"More than 20Ukrainian soldiers who were taken prisonerduring the months-long battle to defend the port city of Mariupol from Moscow’s forces have gone on trial in southern Russia. The captured soldiers were members of the Azov regiment, an elite Ukrainian armed forces unit that fought against Russian troops for months in the Sea of Azov port of Mariupol. After a ferocious three-month battlethat reduced most of Mariupol to ruins, the remaining Ukrainian defenders – who had bunkered inside a giant steel mill – surrendered to Russian forces in May 2022. On Wednesday, the court in Russia’s southern Rostov-on-Don started hearings cases against the Azov personnel, a military unit which Russia had described as a “terrorist group”.    In August last year, Russia’s top court designated theAzov Regiment, a former volunteer battalion with far-right roots that was officially integrated into Ukraine’s army, a “terrorist” organisation. The ruling by Russia’s Supreme Courtallows for lengthy prison terms for the members of Azov, who Russian authorities have accused of harbouring neo-Nazi and white supremacist ideology. Of the 22 defendants facing trial, eight are women. Photographs taken inside the court on Wednesday showed the Ukrainian soldiers pale and very thin – the men with their heads shaved tight – seated behind a glass panel inside the courtroom. The defendants are facing charges of involvement in a terrorist organisation and taking part in action to overthrow the Russia-backed authorities in the Donetsk region. They face sentences ranging from 15 years to life in prison if convicted. The Red Cross said Wednesday that it had visited 1,500 prisoners of war on both sides of the conflict. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said such visits are vital for checking detention conditions, relaying information between prisoners and their loved ones, and providing hygiene items and other personal necessities. The ICRC and its partners have so far delivered around 2,500 personal messages between POWs and their families in the Ukraine conflict and helped provide around 5,500 families with information on the fate of their loved ones in the conflict. “For the prisoners of war and their families who have been able to share news, the impact is … immeasurable,” Ariane Bauer, ICRC’s regional director for Europe and Central Asia, told reporters. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused the Red Cross of not pushing hard enough to gain access to Ukrainian troops captured by Russian forces.

Australia blocks new Russian embassy near parliament in Canberra,Government fast-tracks legislation in parliament amid national security concerns over location.,"Australia’s parliament will pass legislation to stop Russia from building a new embassy in Canberra because of concerns about national security. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the legislation would cancel Russia’s lease on the site in the capital, based on the advice of security agencies. “The government has received very clear security advice as to the risk presented by a new Russian presence so close to Parliament House,” Albanese told reporters. “We are acting quickly to ensure the lease site does not become a formal diplomatic presence.” The move follows long-running litigation over the site after Australia’s federal court ruled last month that an eviction order made by the National Capital Authority (NCA) – a government body tasked with the planning of the city – was invalid. “To be clear, today’s decision is one taken in the national security interests of Australia, and I thank the coalition [opposition] and crossbenchers in the House and the Senate for their cooperation in this matter,” Albanese said. The Kremlin called the Australian move a hostile one which reflected what it said was the authorities’ anti-Russian sentiment. “Australia to our regret is continuing to zealously move forward as one of the authors of anti-Russian hysteria which is rippling across the collective West,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. “This is another hostile move from the Australian side which we will take into account, and if issues arise which require reciprocity from us, we will also behave accordingly.” Russia bought the lease in Canberra’s diplomatic quarter in 2008 and had plans for construction approved in 2011. Under the terms of the agreement, work was supposed to be completed within three years, but the embassy remains only partially built. The NCA then decided to terminate the Russian lease, citing that “ongoing unfinished works detract from the overall aesthetic, importance and dignity of the area reserved for diplomatic missions”. The termination of the lease has no impact on Russia’s existing embassy, which is in the former Soviet Union embassy in the suburb of Griffith, further away from Parliament House. Home Affairs Minister Clare O’Neil said the “principal problem” with the proposed second Russian embassy was its location because the site sits directly adjacent to parliament. No embassy would be allowed to be built there, she said. Albanese said his government anticipated a response from Russia over the decision and that they “will await what response occurs”. “We don’t expect that Russia is in a position to talk about international law, given their rejection of it so consistently and so brazenly with their invasion of Ukraine,” he said. Russia’s embassy has previously declared that it was committed to completing the construction, despite Australia’s objections. Australia is one of the largest non-NATO supporters of Ukraine and has been supplying aid, ammunition and defence equipment to the country since thefull-scale Russian invasion in February 2022. It has alsobannedexports of alumina and aluminium ores, including bauxite, to Russia, and sanctioned more than 1,000 Russian individuals and entities. Australia’s opposition defence spokesman Andrew Hastie said his party stood with the government on national security. “Russia has not acted in good faith towards its neighbours in recent times. It continues its campaign [in Ukraine] trashing the principles of territorial and political sovereignty,” Hastie said. “There is a trust deficit. There is a real risk to our national interest here, and the security advice is that this lease must be terminated.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/15/australia-blocks-new-russian-embassy-near-parliament-in-canberra

Germany agrees funds for Israel’s Arrow-3 missile defence: Media,The long-range Arrow-3 air defence system is designed to intercept ballistic missiles outside of the Earth’s atmosphere.,"Germany’s parliament is reported to have approved an advance payment for the acquisition of Israel’s sophisticated Arrow-3 air defence system in a deal worth almost four billion euros ($4.3bn). The long-range Arrow-3 system is designed to destroy ballistic missiles above the Earth’s atmosphere and is reported to be powerful enough to offer protective cover to Germany’s neighbouring European Union states. The budget committee in the lower house of the German parliament gave the green light on Wednesday for an initial payment of 560 million euros ($607m), news organisations reported, citing a member of the budget committee and sources. The announcement marksa major turnaround for Germany after years of under-investment in its armed forcesand comes amid Russia’s war in Ukraine, which has exposed a shortage in Western nations of ground-based air defence systems to counter missile and drone attacks.    Funds for the purchase of the Arrow-3 system will come from a landmark 100-billion-euro ($108bn) fund unveiled by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz tobolster the country’s defences in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Berlin aims to strike a government-to-government deal with Israel on the purchase of the Arrow-3 system at the end of the year, according to procurement documents by the finance ministry that were prepared for parliament. But Germany could lose part or all of its advance payments should the deal fail, according to the papers, as the initial funds would be used to compensate Israel for costs incurred by then. If the deal goes ahead as planned, a contract will be signed by the end of 2023, and Berlin expects the Arrow-3 system to be delivered in the final quarter of 2025. The initial payment is intended to set up manufacturing and production in Israel. Scholz told a government press conference earlier on Wednesday the investment was “a big project that doesn’t just relate to Germany itself”.    Asked if he thought there was any risk in making the initial payment, Scholz said things were “progressing bit by bit and we believe that everything will also be approved”. According to a report in Germany’s Tagesspiegel newspaper, the federal audit office had warned against releasing funds before initial construction work for the system had been completed in Germany. Germany has led a push to bolster NATO’s air defences in Europeafter seeing Russia’s relentless missile strikes on Ukraine, urging allies to buy deterrence systems together. More than a dozen European countries have so far signed up to the so-called European Sky Shield Initiative.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/15/germany-agrees-funds-for-israels-arrow-3-missile-defence-media
Ukraine attacks the front line; Russia says big losses inflicted,"Ukraine says its forces recaptured 100 square kilometres, but Russia’s President Vladimir Putin says counteroffensive attacks have ‘catastrophically’ failed.","Ukraine says it has recaptured about 100 square kilometres (40sq miles) of its territory during the 68th week of Russia’s invasion as a long-planned counterattack gains momentum. But Russian President Vladimir Putin said Ukraine was suffering“catastrophic” lossesand Kyiv’s casualties were 10 times greater than Moscow’s. “All counteroffensive attempts made so far have failed, but the offensive potential of the troops of the Kyiv regime is still preserved,” said Putin. The counteroffensive is still in its early days, said Demetries Andrew Grimes, a former commander who spent two years retraining the Ukrainian military from 2015 to 2017. “All we’re seeing right now is softening of the [Russian] front lines with harassment fire with everything from small arms and rockets to drones and artillery,” Grimes told Al Jazeera. “The aim of that is to stretch out the opposition to thin their forces… they’re lengthening the conflict zone and forcing the Russians to expose their supply lines so those can be disrupted and [Ukrainian forces] can encircle smaller groups.” Ukraine stepped up attacks along much of the 1,200km (745-mile) front. Russia’s defence ministry said itrepelled four Ukrainian ground attacksin the Kreminna area of the eastern Donetsk region on June 9. Further south, eastern forces spokesman Serhiy Cherevatyisaid Ukrainian forces advanced by 1,200m (3,940 feet)around Bakhmut on June 9, and by 1,400 metres (4,600 feet) the following day. Russian military sources corroborated these advances. Ukrainian forces also launched a new front where Donetsk meets the Zaporizhia region on June 9. Russia’s defence ministry saidinitial attacks were repelled, but two days later the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said “geolocated footage and Russian sources indicated that Ukrainian forces liberated multiple settlements… [near] Velyka Novosilka in western Donetsk Oblast”. It is here that Ukraine made most of its territorial gains –90sq km (35sq miles)– said Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar.  Perhaps the boldest attack of the counteroffensive took place in western Zaporizhia, south of Orikhiv, where Russian lines were known to be heavily defended. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said a force of 1,500 Ukrainian soldiers with 150 armoured vehicles attempted to break through Russian lines overnight on June 8. “A preventive strike was delivered by artillery, aviation and anti-tank weapons. In all four directions, the enemy was stopped,” said the Russian defence ministry, reporting Ukrainian losses of 30 tanks and 350 men. According to Russian military reporters,a “high-intensity battle” took placein which “the enemy fires continuously from artillery and tanks”. The reporters said the Ukrainian assault had initial success. “The second wave by 5 in the morning led the enemy to a small success, they occupied one height,”said one. “Our soldiers of the heroic company of the 291st regiment, under strong pressure, withdrew from the front line of trenches to reserve positions, the enemy continuously hit these trenches 3 hours before the offensive from all types of weapons,” they reported, but “the 291st regiment repelled all enemy attacks and returned [to] ALL positions.” On June 12, Russian forceswent on the counteroffensiveon this front, said Russian military reporters. Ukraine’s general staff reported high Russian fatalities – 1,000 on June 8 and 900 on June 10. Al Jazeera was not able to independently verify the claims. Ukraine has won media attention for deftly destroying thousands of Russian heavy vehicles throughout the war. The Orikhiv offensive brought rare negative publicity anda separate probesouth of Mala Tokmachka also fared badly. Defence reporter Thomas Theiner pointed out the Mala Tokmachka column lacked air support and was vulnerable to being spotted. “At least three Russian drones and one helicopter flew above the Ukrainians and walked Russian artillery in,” he wrote on Twitter. Grimes said these are the lessons of a military relearning to fight regular mechanised warfare after years of successfully using guerrilla tactics. After Russia’s invasion of the Donbas and annexation of Crimea in 2014, “Ukrainians realised they might not have the resources they need to rebuild their army and navy and air force, and got to work right away building their special operations capabilities, their counterinsurgency capabilities, as well as training a resistance,” said Grimes. “The navy pretty much transformed into a marine and coastal defence force, and their army and other forces basically transitioned into special operations and asymmetric-type operations.” In addition to these operations by Ukraine’s forces, the country’s NATO allies provided more than 250 tanks and thousands of armoured vehicles, and retrained nine brigades to fight pitched battles. “When you transition into conventional warfare you lose some of that asymmetrical advantage,” said Grimes. “With the capabilities of larger military hardware you … have to dedicate forces to defend those assets. It makes you less flexible,” he said. The Institute for the Study of War said: “Ukraine’s counteroffensive will likely consist of many undertakings of varied size … and the smaller efforts do not represent the maximum capacity of Ukrainian numbers or effectiveness.” The ISW said Ukraine had prepared 12 offensive brigades and had committed “only a portion of the large reserve forces available” to western Zaporizhia. The only region where Ukraine didn’t launch an attack was Kherson, which was flooded after the Nova Kakhovska dam was destroyed on June 6. Ukraine’s environment ministry said more than 14 cubic kilometres of water, almost three-quarters of the Nova Kakhovska dam’s reservoir, had spilled out, flooding 600sq km (232sq miles) of Kherson. It is still unclear which side targeted the dam with Russia and Ukraineaccusing each other of blowing it up.    Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Oleksandr Pavlyuk said it was a defensive tactic. “I think the enemy wanted to ensure the security of their left flank. Having blown up the dam, they created a barrier line and thereby prevented our offensive from this side,” he said. Grimes said Russian forces learned the tactic from Ukrainian forces defending Kyiv in the early weeks of the war. “The Ukrainians on the outskirts of Kyiv flooded a lot of the fields with water so that they forced the Russians’ heavy armour and trucks to manoeuvre on higher and more solid ground and targeted them more effectively,” he said. Ukraine’s southern forces spokesperson Natalia Humenyuk said flooding had obliged Russian forces to withdraw 5km-15km (3-9 miles) from their forward positions, leaving behind equipment. As a result, Russian shelling had almost halved. The flooding led to minefields being washed away and mines were being found in the Black Sea. Russian forces also abandoned the Dnipro Delta. Despite the setback in Kherson, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he was satisfied with progress in other regions. “The battles are fierce but we are moving forward, and this is very important. The enemy’s losses are exactly what we need,” said Zelenskyy in a video address.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/14/ukraine-attacks-the-front-line-russia-says-big-losses-inflicted
Top Russian officer reported killed in Ukraine counteroffensive,"Major-General Sergei Goryachev, chief of staff of Russia’s 35th Army, reported killed in missile strike in Zaporizhia region.","A top Russian officer has been reported killed in a Ukrainian missile strike duringKyiv’s counteroffensiveagainst Russian forces, a Russian-backed official in Ukraine has said, offering his condolences. Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-installed official in a part of the southern Zaporizhia region under Moscow’s control, said on Tuesday that Russian Major-General Sergei Goryachev, Chief of Staff of Russia’s 35th Army, had been killed a day earlier on the Zaporizhia front where Ukrainian forces have been retaking some territory. There was no immediate confirmation of the news of Goryachev’s death from the Russian Defence Ministry. Goryachev, 52, was a highly-decorated officer. During his career, he fought in the Second Chechen War, commanded a tank brigade, oversaw a Russian military base in Tajikistan and led Russian forces in Moldova’s breakaway pro-Russian region of Transdniestria, according to the Reuters news agency.    If confirmed, the death of Goryachev marks the first Russian senior officer killed in Ukraine in almost a year. His death was first reported by “Voenkor Z”, a Russian war correspondent and military blogger. Rogov, writing on his official channel on the Telegram messaging application, said: “The army has lost one of its brightest and most effective military commanders, who combined the highest professionalism with personal courage. Deepest and most sincere condolences to the family and friends of the deceased!” RussianPresident Vladimir Putin metwith 18 prominent Russian military bloggers and war correspondents on Tuesday in a bid to bolster his narrative regarding the positive progress of the war in Ukraine. The meeting, in which Putin said Ukraine had suffered “catastrophic” losses in its counteroffensive, comes amid “widespread discontent in the Russian information space” following drone attacks on Russian territory and border incursions by pro-Ukrainian but Russian armed groups, a leading war monitor said on Wednesday. Russian “milbloggers” who have been more critical of Putin’s war efforts were not invited to the discussion, the Washington, DC-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said in a daily briefing paper on the war in Ukraine.    “Putin is likely setting information conditions to prevent potential lines of attack against the Kremlin in the event of Russian failure” in Ukraine, the ISW said, adding that the Russian president may be aware “that committed pro-war figures” and the influence of military blogging are “his key constituency as he calls on the Russian public to prepare for a protracted war in Ukraine”. “Putin’s engagement with these milbloggers may suggest that the Kremlin will increasingly rely on the wider ultranationalist community to maintain support for the war effort,” the ISW said. The ISW also noted Russian reports of Major-General Goryachev’s death in the Zaporizhia region and said that his reported death means that “some Russian senior military commander officials continue to operate close to the front line and remain exposed to accurate Ukrainian strikes”. 6/#Putinis likely continuing to publicly engage with, and platform, select pro-#Kremlinmilbloggers to further leverage the community to expand his support among Russian ultranationalists.https://t.co/8JcQioF3T2pic.twitter.com/UrMvjy7XKL — ISW (@TheStudyofWar)June 14, 2023  ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/14/top-russian-officer-reported-killed-in-ukraine-counteroffensive

NATO chief offers Vilnius summit preview at White House,Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg vowed to ‘sustain and step up’ support for Ukraine as it faces Russian invasion.,"Outgoing NATO Secretary-GeneralJens Stoltenberghas met with top United States officials at the White House, offering a preview of topics for an upcoming alliance summit in Vilnius, Lithuania. Stoltenberg, who is set to step down as secretary-general in September, said the NATO alliance would work “to sustain and step up support for Ukraine” and “further strengthen our deterrence on defence” at the Vilnius meeting. He also underscored the need to send astrong messageto Russian PresidentVladimir Putin, who has championed his country’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine since its launch in February 2022. “It was not only an attack on Ukraine but also on our core values and on free people everywhere,” Stoltenberg said on Tuesday as he sat across from US President Joe Biden. “And therefore President Putin must not win this war because that will not only be a tragedy for Ukrainians but also make the world more dangerous. It will send a message to authoritarian leaders all over the world, also in China, that when they use military force, they get what they want.” Other priorities for the Vilnius summit, set for July 11 and 12, include a stronger partnership with countries in the Indo-Pacific region. In his comments on Tuesday, Stoltenberg also said he would push NATO allies to fulfil a 2006 pledge to committwo percentof their gross domestic products (GDPs) to defence spending — a pledge that many of the 31 member nations have fallen short of in the years since. “I expect allies to agree that two percent of GDP for defence should be a minimum that we should all invest in our defence, in our collective security,” Stoltenberg said. Tuesday’s meeting came a day later than scheduled, after Biden had an unexpected root canal on Monday, forcing the 80-year-old president to postpone several White House appointments. It is Biden’s fourth meeting with the NATO chief, a Norwegian politician and former prime minister who assumed the role in 2014. Anticipating Stoltenberg’s departure, Biden congratulated him on his tenure with the military alliance, which the NATO member states extended three times. “I think you’ve done an incredible job,” Biden told Stoltenberg. “NATO allies have never been more united. We both worked like hell to make sure that happened. And so far, so good.” “We’ve strengthened NATO’s eastern flank, made it clear that we will defend every inch of NATO territory,” Biden continued. He also referenced a key tenet of the North Atlantic Treaty, NATO’s founding document: Article 5, which establishes that, if one NATO ally is attacked, it will be considered an assault on the alliance as a whole. Biden emphasised that provision is ironclad. “I say it again,” Biden said. “The commitment of the United States to NATO with Article 5 is rock-solid.”    Earlier in the day, the Biden administration announced a newsecurity assistance packagefor Ukraine, its 40th use of presidential “drawdown” authority to garner equipment from the US Department of Defense. The package, worth $325m, included arms and equipment like artillery rounds, anti-tank weapons and ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS). Tuesday’s assistance coincided with anewly-launched counteroffensive effortby Ukrainian forces as they attempt to expel Russian military members from their territory. So far,gains have been modest, but Stoltenberg voiced optimism towards the efforts in his remarks from the White House. “The offensive is launched and Ukrainians are making progress, making advances,” Stoltenberg said. “It’s still early days, but what we do know is the more land that Ukrainians are able to liberate, the stronger hand they will have at the negotiating table. And also the more likely it will be that President Putin, at some stage, will understand that he will never win this war of aggression on the battlefield.”    The war in Ukraine has also increased pressure to boost NATO’s membership, with both Biden and Stoltenberg indicating their support on Tuesday for welcoming Sweden into the military alliance. Sweden is one of only five European Union members that are not a part of the NATO alliance. A bastion of military neutrality for nearly 200 years, Sweden has moved to join NATO amid rising fears of Russian aggression in the wake of the Ukraine invasion. Sweden’s Nordic neighbour, Finland, became the 31st member of NATO in April, overcoming objections from Turkey and Hungary. ThoughSweden submitted its applicationto the alliance at the same time as Finland, it has faced more entrenched opposition from Turkey, which has accused the northern European country of harbouring “terrorists” from the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party. Negotiations further stalled when, in January, protesters in the Swedish capital Stockholm burned a copy of the Quran and hanged an effigy of Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Turkey slammed the incident as evidence of Islamophobia. Swedish officials, meanwhile, have denounced the protests but said they were shielded under the country’s free-speech protections. Nevertheless,Stoltenberg struck a positive notewhen addressing Sweden’s possible accession to NATO on Tuesday. He has previously pushed Turkey to overcome its objections. “We’ll all look forward to welcoming Sweden as a full-fledged member of the alliance as soon as possible,” Stoltenberg said. Biden echoed that assessment, taking the opportunity to also criticise his Russian counterpart. “Putin is making a mistake even looking for the Finlandisation of NATO,” Biden said, referring to efforts to make the NATO allies neutral on military matters, like Finland once was. He added: “You’ve got the NATO-isation of Finland and hopefully Sweden shortly.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/13/nato-chief-offers-vilnius-summit-preview-at-white-house
Putin: Ukraine losses ‘catastrophic’; Russia eyes ‘sanitary zone’,Russian leader says no need for new round of mobilisation – for now – claims Ukraine has suffered ‘catastrophic’ losses in its counteroffensive.,"Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested he could order his troops to try to seize more land in Ukraine to protect Russian territory on the border, while asserting Ukrainian forces have suffered “catastrophic” losses in a new counteroffensive. The Russian leader made some of his most detailed remarks in months on Tuesday about the war in an open meeting with military journalists and bloggers, just as Ukrainian officialsclaim they have captureda handful of villages in the early stages of its counterstrike. He asserted Ukraine lost 160 tanks and more than 360 other armoured vehicles in recent days of heavy fighting, while Russia only lost 54 tanks since Kyiv began the new assault. Those claims could not be immediately verified. Referring to Ukrainian incursions and shelling of Russia’sBelgorod and other border regions, Putin said his military would take moves to stop such attacks, and if Kyiv persists, “We will have to consider creating a sanitary zone in Ukraine to prevent it from striking our territory.” In recent weeks, Russia’s border areas have come under increasing attack, with the Kremlin blaming Ukrainian forces forraids and drone attacks. Local leaders in Russia have pleaded with the Kremlin to do more to protect their residents, some of whom have been evacuated to safer areas. Putin said there is no need for an additionalmobilisationof men to fight in Ukraine for now, but said any further troop call-ups would depend on what Russia wanted to achieve there. “There is no such need today.” Last year, some 300,000 reservists were called up in what the Russian president cast as a “partial mobilisation”. “Some public figures say we need to get one million or two million,” Putin said. “It depends on what we want.” Discussing Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, which Russian troops failed to take in the early stages of the war, Putin asked, “Should we return there? Why am I asking such a rhetorical question? It is clear there is simply no answer to this – I can only answer it myself.” Putin said there was also no need to follow Ukraine’s example and declare martial law. “There is no reason to introduce some kind of special regime or martial law in the country.” Ukraine’s large-scalecounteroffensivebegan on June 4 and has not been successful in any area, Putin said. He said Ukraine was suffering massive losses and Kyiv’s casualties were 10 times greater than Moscow’s. His assessment came hours after Russia claimed it captured Western armoured vehicles from Kyiv’s forces on the battlefield and following deadly Russian missile attacks on Ukrainian President Voldoymyr Zelenskyy’s hometown. Zelenskyy on Tuesday hailed advances by Ukraine’s troops near thelong-besieged city of Bakhmutin the east and on the war’s southern front. “Thanks to everyone who is now fighting, who protects and advances our positions,” Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address. “For example, the Bakhmut sector … there is forward movement in various areas.” He also praised units on the southern front, saying in “conditions of aviation and artillery superiority of the occupiers, there is movement forward. Thank you soldiers! Thank you for every step and every metre freed from Russian evil.” The head of Ukraine’s ground troops, Oleksandr Syrskyi, wrote on Telegram that Russian forces are “losing positions on the flanks”. It was not possible to independently verify the assertions. The Russian leader declined to say whether Moscow would launch a new offensive in Ukraine in response to Kyiv’s own counteroffensive, saying its plans would depend on military potential. Speaking about weaponry, Putin said the quality of Russian arms was improving, but the country lacked high-precision ammunition and drones. “During the course of the special military operation, it became clear that many things were lacking,” Putin said. “High-precision ammunition, communications equipment, drones … We have them but, unfortunately, there is not enough.” Putin said Russia increased its production of key weapons by 2.7 times over the past year, and he also accused the West of pumping weapons into Ukraine. He added Russia was open to peace talks but the only way to stop the conflict was for Western countries to end their arms supplies to Kyiv. The comments came shortly before the US announced a new $325m military aid package for Ukraine that will include munitions for air defence systems, ammunition and vehicles. The Russian leader also said he backed a defence ministry order for private military companies to sign contracts with it before July 1, something the high-profile Wagner Group has refused to do. Earlier on Tuesday, Wagner founderYevgeny Prigozhinsaid he was not sure if his men would continue to fight in Ukraine amid the bitter standoff with the defence ministry with which he has long been at loggerheads.    Meanwhile, Russia was considering exiting the landmarkBlack Sea grain dealthat has allowed grain from Ukraine to reach the global market, Putin said, adding that Moscow had been “cheated” over the implementation of the parts of the accord that concerned its own exports. “We are now thinking about whether to leave the grain deal,” Putin said. Putin said the deal was intended to help “friendly” countries in Africa and Latin America, but that Europe was the largest importer of Ukrainian grain and this was providing a key source of foreign currency to Kyiv. He accused Kyiv of using sea corridors that are meant to provide safe passage for ships carrying grain “to launch maritime drones”. Putin said he would discuss the future of the grain deal with some African leaders who were expected to visit Russia, adding that Moscow was ready to supply grain for free to the world’s poorest countries. The deal was brokered last July by the United Nations and Turkey and allows for the safe export of grain from several Ukrainian ports on the Black Sea. The West has not imposed sanctions on Russian grain and other food exports but they have been hampered by other restrictions on insurance and other areas.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/13/ukraines-losses-catastrophic-no-need-for-martial-law-putin
US lawmaker group wants S Africa punished over Russia ties,US lawmakers urge Biden to move a US-Africa trade summit over ‘deepening military relationship’ with Russia.,"A group of US lawmakers has called for a US-Africa trade summit planned for later this year to be moved from South Africa in response to what they said was the country’s “deepening military relationship” with Russia. In a letter to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and other senior officials, they also suggested South Africa is in danger of losing its benefits under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) – Washington’s flagship trade programme. South Africa is due to host the AGOA Forum in Johannesburg, a meeting of African leaders and US officials, to discuss the future of the programme, which is slated to expire in 2025. South Africa’s exports to the US under AGOA reached nearly $1bn in the first three months of this year, making it the second-biggest beneficiary of the programme after Nigeria. African nations are seeking to extend AGOA, which grants qualifying countries’ exports preferential access to the US. “We are seriously concerned that hosting the 2023 AGOA Forum in South Africa would serve as an implicit endorsement of South Africa’s damaging support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,” the letter, dated June 9, stated. Referring to the letter, South African foreign ministry spokesman Clayson Monyela said on Twitter, “There is no decision by the State Department/White House to move the AGOA Forum from SA.” I've received calls asking for a comment on this. This letter by the four US Congress members to Secretary Blinken is noted. There is no decision by the State department/Whitehouse to move the AGOA Forum from SA🇿🇦. President Cyril Ramaphosa 'special envoys recently visited the US…pic.twitter.com/bQnvLxA7Ds — Clayson Monyela (@ClaysonMonyela)June 13, 2023  South Africa’s Department of Trade and Industry, which manages the country’s trade relations with the United States, said it was not planning to respond publicly to the letter. Judd Devermont, a special assistant to President Joe Biden focusing on Africa, said the White House shared Congress’s concern over South Africa’s “potential security partnership with Russia”. However, he declined to say whether the administration was considering a change of venue for the AGOA Forum. “I’m not going to get into the specifics of private conversations with the South Africans, but be sure we are having these conversations,” he told an online media briefing. South Africa’s government has declared its neutrality in the war in Ukraine, and President Cyril Ramaphosa is participating in an effort by African leaders to mediate in the conflict. However, the lawmakers voiced frustration with South Africa’s hosting of joint naval operations with China and Russia in February, as well as plans to hold a summit of BRICS leaders to which Russian President Vladimir Putin is invited despite being charged with war crimes by the International Criminal Court. The lawmakers also appeared to back up an accusation by the US ambassador to South Africa that a sanctioned Russian vessel collected weapons at a South African naval base last year. South African officials say they are not aware of such an arms transfer and have launched an independent inquiry into the incident. Herman Mashaba, the former mayor of Johannesburg said on Twitter he will write a letter to the US lawmakers asking them to “give South Africa a chance until after the 2024 Provincial and National government [elections]”. “South Africans should not be punished as a result of ANC government choosing to be on the wrong side of history,” he said.

Belarus will not hesitate to use nukes if aggressed: Lukashenko,"Minsk is set to host Russian tactical nuclear weapons in several days, says the Belarusian leader.","Russian tactical nuclear weapons will be deployed inBelarusin “several days”, said President Alexander Lukashenko, according to Belarusian state media. Lukashenko said on Tuesday that Minsk was ready to host the arms, days after Russian President Vladimir Putin said the weapons would be deployed July 7-8. “Everything is ready. I think we will have what we asked for in a few days, and even a little bit more,” he said in comments cited by the Belta news agency on Tuesday. Lukashenko warned he would not hesitate to use the weapons in response to potential aggressors. “Why do we need them? To make sure not a single foreign soldier sets their foot on the Belarusian land again,” he said. “God forbid that I have to make a decision to use these weapons. But there will be no hesitation in the event of an aggression against us.” This marks the first time since the fall of the Soviet Union that Moscow has moved warheads outside of the country. Putin has cast the war in Ukraine as a battle between Russia’s safety and the expanding NATO alliance and has said that the West is pumping weapons to Ukraine in a proxy war with Moscow. In March, he announced the decision to move the weapons to Belarus, a launching pad for Moscow’s “special military operation”, pointing to the deployment of US weapons in European countries as a justification. While the United States condemned the plan, it says it has no intention of changing its stance on strategic nuclear weapons and has not seen any signs that Russia is preparing to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine. Lukashenko said Minsk was also working to ensure Belarusian facilities could host longer-range strategic weapons. However, there was no urgent need as Moscow had yet to speak of supplying the weapons, he said. “What do I need strategic [missiles] like the Topols for? Although we are now preparing sites for these weapons as well. They [the Soviet-era sites] are all alive and well, except for one. So if we need to, we can at any moment [house them],” Belta cited Lukashenko as saying. “But the Topol is an intercontinental missile. Am I planning to go to war with America? No. that’s why this [tactical nuclear weapons] are enough for me now,” he said. The war in Ukraine has led to what both Russia and the US say is their most tense relationship since the Cold War.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/13/russian-tactical-weapons-to-be-deployed-to-minsk-in-days
Ukraine’s counteroffensive begins: What do we know so far?,Al Jazeera’s Defence Editor Alex Gatopoulos explains the dynamics of a new phase in the 16-month war.,"Ukrainian forces have proved highly adept at masking their strategic aims with feints, disinformation and by shuffling troops from one area to another, keeping Russian military planners guessing as to their next move. Having promised to begin their counteroffensive in the summer, Kyiv’s forces are now stepping up attacks, and with some success. Late on Monday, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked troops for liberating territory from Russian occupiers. But so far, the gains are marginal; at leastseven villageshave been retaken, Ukrainian officials say. As a potentially long and bloody series of battles begins, Ukraine is expected to struggle with all its might to retake territory lost in the opening months of the invasion. Much of Ukraine’s new weaponry is Western and Kyiv’s forces are well on the offensive, while in some areas, Russia appears to be strengthening defensive positions. Here’s what you should know about the apparent beginnings of Ukraine’s push. Ukraine has launched multiple attacks and gained ground in several places along its vast front line with Russia. To the north, Ukrainian forces have pushed out east towards the country’s border with Russia’s Belgorod region. In late May, Russia transferred troops toBelgorodafter pro-Ukrainian forces launched raids all along that part of the border, attacking Russian towns and supply hubs. In Ukraine’s east, around Bakhmut, fighting is raging near the city, now a burned-out shell. Russiatook Bakhmutin Ukraine’s Donetsk region last month after both sides lost thousands of soldiers in the battle. Ukrainian forces are now pressing Russian defensive positions to the north and south of the city, with the possible aim of surrounding it and trapping Russian units there. But the main focus so far has been in the south, in Zaporizhia, the scene of intense fighting. Russian attacks were also recently repelled around the town of Vuhledar in Donetsk, with some highly trained Russian units utterly destroyed.  Now, with Ukraine on the offensive, there is a concerted push along a broad front, with several villages having been retaken in the last few days. The fighting has been bloody. Ukrainian troops have had to force their way through extensive and well-prepared Russian defensive lines and minefields while being shelled by carefully placed Russian artillery batteries. ​Ukraine’s long-range fire has been far more effective than that of its Russian counterparts, but Russian forces have learned hard lessons. Moscow’s drone and counter-drone operations are now much more efficient. They are far quicker at bringing their artillery to bear as both sides can now survey the battlefield more accurately, making tactical surprise that much harder.​​ This adds up to hard, positional fighting with smaller territorial gains before Ukraine makes a breakthrough it can exploit. Accurate Ukrainian long-range fire from United States-suppliedHIMARS batteriesandStorm Shadowcruise missiles, sent by the United Kingdom, means that Russian forces will have a tough time keeping their front-line troops supplied, a key factor in any offensive. Thedestructionof the Nova Kakhovka dam on June 6 has been a significant setback for Ukraine, and the humanitarian and economic toll is painful. Kherson now faces an ecological catastrophe, having already suffered the brunt of war and occupation. As they strive to help and evacuate large numbers of residents, while providing food and shelter, Ukrainian authorities are rapidly expending resources.​ Water levels for the upstream reservoir have lowered dramatically, making it increasingly difficult for water to be used to cool the reactors at Zaporizhzhia’s nuclear power plant at Enerhodar. The dam’s collapse also affects Russian-held territory; the canal supplying most of Crimea’s freshwater has now been cut off. The restoration of this water supply, initially cut by Ukraine in 2014 when Moscow annexed the peninsula, was a strategic Russian war aim.​ The loss of its supply will make life for Russians in Crimea much harder as local reservoirs run low, despite Moscow’s attempts at digging wells and diverting water. Tactically, it is also a setback for any potential Ukrainian assault across the river. The shape of the downstream part of the Dnipro river has altered significantly, while floodwater currents complicate any potential crossings by Ukrainian forces, making them less likely in the near future. Russian forces were reportedly moved east from the far bank of the river, to reinforce defensive positions around the Zaporizhzhia front. ​Some of Russia’s best-trained units from the airborne and naval infantry, along with units from the well-equipped 49th Combined Arms Army, have now been moved away from the river and sent to plug any gaps the Ukrainians might make in the coming days.​ Observers have beensurprisedat the lack of movement so far by Ukrainian units in this counteroffensive. Gains have been small as Ukrainian troops probe their way forward, knowing full well the Russian units opposite them have had months to prepare. At the same time, thiscounteroffensiveis being compared with Ukraine’s push last September, when Kyiv’s forces excelled in tough fighting and strategic deception to take swaths of territory back in a matter of days. Russian occupiers were set fleeing before advancing Ukrainian armoured columns, during the most kinetic and visible phase of an assault that had been planned for months. Ukraine ground down Russian forces in last summer’s battles of attrition in the northeast, followed by a feint in Kherson, tricking Russia into sending tens of thousands of Russian troops to the region. They were then neatly cut off from supplies by Ukrainian long-range fire, the Russian forces left stranded and ineffective, while counterattacks punched through Russian lines that had been denuded of reinforcements. Ukraine has always been tactically nimbler, controlling the nature of the battles its forces fight while the Russians have mostly reacted to situations not of their choosing. Where Ukrainian forces will strike their main blows and in what sequence is not known, but their knack for strategic thinking shows that this counteroffensive has barely begun. When it does in earnest, it could very well catch the Russians by surprise.   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/13/ukraines-counteroffensive-begins-what-do-we-know-so-far

NATO’s largest air force drill prepares for ‘crisis situation’,"Some 250 aircraft from 25 NATO and partner countries with 10,000 military personnel are participating in ‘Air Defender 23’.","NATO has started the largest-ever air forcedeployment exercisein the Western military alliance’s history, a drill being presented as a display of unity among members and partners of the bloc as tensions with Russia have escalated following Moscow’s full-scaleinvasion of Ukrainein February 2022. The German Air Force-led “Air Defender 23” exercises, which began on Monday, involve approximately 250 military aircraft from 25 NATO and partner countries including Japan and NATO applicant Sweden, according to theGerman Air Force. Up to 10,000 service members are participating in the drills, which run until June 23 and are designed to boost interoperability and preparedness of NATO “air forces in a crisis situation”, including protecting against drones and cruise missiles in the case of an attack within NATO territory. “The significant message we’re sending is that we can defend ourselves,” Lieutenant General Ingo Gerhartz of the German Luftwaffe told public television on Monday. The following 2️⃣5️⃣ nations are participating in#AirDefender23from 12 to 23 June: 🇧🇪, 🇧🇬, 🇭🇷, 🇨🇿, 🇩🇰, 🇪🇪, 🇫🇮, 🇫🇷, 🇩🇪, 🇬🇷, 🇭🇺, 🇮🇹, 🇯🇵, 🇱🇻, 🇱🇹, 🇳🇱, 🇳🇴, 🇵🇱, 🇷🇴, 🇸🇮, 🇪🇸, 🇸🇪, 🇹🇷, 🇬🇧, 🇺🇸 with 1️⃣0️⃣ 0️⃣0️⃣0️⃣ Personnel and 2️⃣5️⃣0️⃣ aircraft! More info👇https://t.co/InhUbft8YEpic.twitter.com/ls2Q6lckwW — Germany at NATO (@GermanyNATO)June 12, 2023  The “Air Defender 23” exercise was conceived in 2018 in part as a response to Russia’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine four years earlier, though Gerhartz insisted the drill was “not targeted at anyone” in particular. He said the exercise would not “send any flights, for example, in the direction of Kaliningrad”, the Russian enclave bordering NATO member states Poland and Lithuania. “We are a defensive alliance and that is how this exercise is planned,” he said. Russia’s war on Ukraine has galvanised NATO, the Western military alliance set up almost 75 years ago to face off against threats from the then-Soviet Union.    Finland and Sweden, who had long kept an official veneer of neutrality to avoid conflict with Moscow, both sought membership in NATO following Moscow’s February 2022 invasion. Finland has sincebecome the 31st memberof the world’s biggest military alliance, while Sweden’s membership bid is being stalled by objections from NATO members Turkey and Hungary. Under NATO’s Article Five, an attack on one member is considered an attack on all and membership bids have to be agreed upon by all members. Germany’s Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said on Monday that NATO’s air forces were “of central importance in the event of an attack because they are first responders to secure the population and also their own armed forces”. The exercise has “the goal of making it clear that NATO and the German Air Force are ready to defend themselves”, Pistorius said. This applied to Russian President Vladimir Putin and to anyone “who threatens our freedom and our security”, he added in comments aired on national television. According to the German Air Force, of the 250 aircraft involved, 100 have been deployed to Europe from 42 US states.    General Michael Loh, director of the US Air National Guard, said NATO’s duties were at an “inflexion point”. “A great deal has changed on the strategic landscape throughout the world, especially here in Europe,” he said. The exercise will focus on “supplementing the permanent United States presence in Europe” as well as providing training “on a larger scale than what was usually accomplished on the continent”, Loh added. He said many of the alliance pilots were working together for the first time. “This is about now establishing what it means to go against a great power in a great power competition.” The exercise comes as NATO officials said on Monday that alliance fighter jets scrambled on numerous missions last week to investigate unidentified Russian military aircraft over the Baltic Sea. A total of 15 flights were launched to investigate possible threats last week – the largest number of aircraft to launch in one week so far this year. Most of the Russian military aircraft were reportedly operating in international airspace without a pre-filed flight plan, transponder signal or radio contact, according to military officials in NATO member Lithuania. The increased presence of Russian aircraft was attributed to the annual US-led naval military exercise, BALTOPS, which is taking place in the Baltic Sea and involves 50 ships and boats from 19 NATO states and Sweden. The Russian Baltic Fleet is also conducting military exercises, Lithuania’s defence ministry told the Baltic News Service.

‘Massive’ Russian missile attack on Ukraine’s Kryvyi Rih city,At least six people have been killed and more than 30 wounded in Russian missile attack on Kryvyi Rih city in central Ukraine.,"At least six people have been killed and more than 30 wounded in a “massive missile attack” by Russia on civilian buildings in the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih, according to local officials. A multistorey residential building was among the civilian infrastructure hit in the early morning attack on Tuesday, said Serhiy Lisak, governor of the Dnipropetrovsk region where Kryvyi Rih is located. “A five-storey building got destroyed. According to initial reports, three of its residents died. 25 people were injured,” Lisak said on the Telegram messaging app early on Tuesday morning. “A massive missile attack on Kryvyi Rih,” he said The city’s mayor, Oleksandr Vilkul, later updated the death toll to six dead after warning earlier that people were likely trapped beneath the rubble of buildings hit in the attack. “Unfortunately, there are already six dead. The rescue operation continues,” Vilkul said on the Telegram messaging app. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy offered his condolences to the families of those killed in Kryvyi Rih, promising that Russian “terrorists will never be forgiven” and would be “held accountable for every missile they launch”. “Unfortunately, there are dead and wounded. The rescue operation in Kryvyi Rih continues. My condolences to all those who have lost their loved ones,” he wrote in a tweet.

Video footage shared on social media on Tuesday showed residential apartments damaged, and rubble and fires in other areas. The capital, Kyiv, also came under missile and drone attacks early on Tuesday morning but air defence systems destroyed all objects heading towards the city, military officials said. “According to initial reports, the enemy used Kh-101/555 cruise missiles,” Kyiv city military administration said. “All enemy targets in the airspace around Kyiv were detected and successfully destroyed by the forces and means of air defence,” the administration said, adding there was no immediate information on any casualties or damage.    Ukraine’s top military command said air forces destroyed 10 of 14 cruise missiles Russia launched against Ukraine on Tuesday and one of four Iranian-made drones. It was not immediately clear how many missiles hit Kryvyi Rih and where the drones struck their targets. In Kharkiv, civilian infrastructure was hit by a drone, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. “According to initial reports, a utility company in the Kyivskyi district, as well as a warehouse in Saltivskyi district got damaged.

New Zealand’s RNZ apologises for ‘pro-Kremlin garbage’ on Ukraine,Public radio broadcaster undertaking an audit after stories on Ukraine published on its website found to have been edited.,"The editor-in-chief of New Zealand’s national public service radio broadcaster has apologised for publishing “pro-Kremlin garbage” after changes were found to have been made to more than a dozen wire agency articles covering Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Appearing on RNZ’s Nine to Noon programme, Paul Thompson, who is also the station’s chief executive, apologised for the “serious breach” of editorial standards. “It’s very disappointing that this pro-Kremlin garbage has ended up in our stories,” he said. “It’s inexcusable.” Thompson announced an independent investigation on Saturday after it emerged that a story attributed to the Reuters news agency had been changed to reflect the Russian narrative on Ukraine. The article in question was found to have been edited on RNZ’s website to read that in 2014 “a pro-Russian elected government was toppled during Ukraine’s violentMaidan colour revolution“, the agency said, and continued, inaccurately, that “Russia annexed Crimea after a referendum, as the new pro-Western government suppressed ethnic Russians in eastern and southern Ukraine”. Pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovich was forced out of office in 2014 in what became known as theMaidan Revolutionfollowing months of protests that began after he rejected a European Union trade deal in favour of closer ties with Russia. More than 100 protesters were shot dead by security forces and Yanukovich eventually fled to Moscow. Russia invaded Crimea in 2014 andannexedit following a referendum that has not been recognised by the international community. The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution declaring the referendum invalid. Amid an ongoing forensic audit of articles published on its website, RNZ said it had so far corrected17 published storiesbecause of what it said was “inappropriate editing”. The articles, nearly all of them from the Reuters news agency, some of which appeared with the bylines of the agency reporters, were republished with corrections and editors’ notes. The earliest pieces date from April 2022. “Reuters has addressed the issue with RNZ, which has initiated an investigation,” Reuters quoted a spokesperson as saying. “As stated in our terms and conditions, Reuters content cannot be altered without prior written consent. Reuters is fully committed to covering the war in Ukraine impartially and accurately, in keeping with the Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.” A digital journalist has been placed on leave. They told a separate RNZ programme, Checkpoint, that they had been editing stories in the same way for five years and “nobody has tapped me on the shoulder and told me what I was doing was anything wrong”. Thompson admitted that RNZ’s editorial systems had been insufficiently robust and said all copy from wire agencies was now required to go through a second edit. “I’m gutted,” he told Nine to Noon when asked how what amounted to “outright propaganda” could have been published. “It’s painful. It’s shocking and we need to get to the bottom of how it happened.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/13/new-zealands-rnz-apologises-for-pro-kremlin-garbage-on-ukraine
‘Extraordinarily difficult operation’: All eyes on Ukraine attack,"Small territorial gains underscored the difficulty of the battle ahead for Ukrainian units, which will have to fight metre by metre to regain the roughly one-fifth of their country under Russian occupation.","Ukraine says it is continuing to make advances against Russian troops occupying its south and east as the early stages of its much-hyped counteroffensive take shape. Kyiv said on Monday it wrested away seven villages since the weekend and made small gains nearthe eastern city of Bakhmut. “Seven settlements were liberated,” Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said on Telegram, naming the villages as Lobkovo, Levadne, and Novodarivka in the southern Zaporizhia region. Storozheve village in the eastern Donetsk region – near three others recaptured on Sunday – was also reportedly taken on Monday. Soldiers were seen in a verified video holding the Ukrainian flag in Storozheve along the Mokri Yaly River. “At first the enemy resisted, trying to repel our attack with artillery. We managed to regain the initiative and slowly – house by house – began to recapture the village,” said one unidentified Ukraine fighter in the video. Maliar said in total an area spanning 90 square kilometres (35 sq miles) along the front line had been retaken by Ukraine forces in recent days. But the gains amounted to only small bits of territory and underscored the difficulty of the battle ahead for Ukrainian units, which will have to fight metre by metre to regain the roughly one-fifth of their country under Russian occupation. Russia, meanwhile, said on Monday that it repelled Ukrainian attacks in various areas. Vladimir Rogov, an official with the Moscow-installed administration of the Zaporizhia region at the western end of the front line, said “heavy battles” raged in the area, involving Russian artillery, mortars and air power. Alexander Kots, a military correspondent for Russian daily Komsomolskaya Pravda, said Ukrainian forces were attempting to advance – despite heavy losses – towards the town of Staromlinovka, which sits on a strategic highway leading to the port city of Mariupol. Russian forces captured the city a year ago after Ukrainian forces held out for several months in agruelling and desperate defence. The various claims of territorial gains could not be independently verified and could be reversed in the to-and-fro of ground warfare. The military push is already Ukraine’s most rapid advance for seven months, though still far short of a major breakthrough. The task of ending Moscow’s occupation of southern and eastern Ukraine is daunting, given Russia’s numerical superiority in men, ammunition and air power as well as the many months it has had to build deep defensive fortifications. “The battles are tough but our movement is there – and that is very important,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address. “The enemy’s losses are exactly what we need.” He added that rainy weather is challenging his troops and that he has discussed with his military commanders, “which points of the front we need to strengthen and what actions we can take to break more Russian positions”.    Some Western military analysts said it was too early to draw conclusions about the counteroffensive and the skirmishes so far may show that Ukraine is still just testing Russian defences. The United States-based Institute for the Study of War said Ukraine was attempting “an extraordinarily difficult tactical operation – a frontal assault against prepared defensive positions, further complicated by a lack of air superiority”. Initial assault results should not be over-interpreted, it added. Ben Hodges, a former commander of US forces in Europe, said the main strike – when it comes – would feature several hundred tanks and infantry fighting vehicles. “The offensive has clearly started, but not I think the main attack,” he wrote in an article for the Washington, DC-based Center for European Policy Analysis. Russia has yet to face this kind of onslaught but its unconvincing battlefield performance in the 15 months since its full-scale invasion has led to frequent changes of command and public arguments withprivate militias summoned to fightalongside the army. President Vladimir Putin marked Russia’s national day on Monday with an award ceremony in the Kremlin but made only a glancing mention in his speech of the war he unleashed in February 2022. “Today, at a difficult time for Russia, [feelings of patriotism and pride] unite our society even more strongly … and serve as a reliable support for our heroes taking part in the special military operation,” said Putin.

Chechen forces sign contract with Russia after Wagner’s refusal,The move comes as the Kremlin attempts to control private armies fighting on its behalf in Ukraine.,"Russia’s defence ministry has signed a contract with the Akhmat group ofChechen special forces,a paramilitary group waging the Kremlin’s offensive near the town of Mariinka in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine. The announcement came on Monday, a day after Yevgeny Prigozhin, the chief of Russia’s Wagner group of private mercenaries,refusedto sign such a contract. The deals are part of a new Russian law aimed at controlling private armies fighting on Moscow’s behalf in Ukraine. The order requires all “volunteer units” to sign contracts by July 1, bringing them under the control of the country’s Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu. The Kremlin says volunteer fighters would receive the same benefits as regular troops if they agree to the rules of the defence contract. “I think this is a very good thing,” Akhmat commander Apty Alaudinov said after the group’s leader Ramzan Kadyrov accepted the offer. He added that his group has “prepared and sent tens of thousands of volunteers” to Ukraine in the past 15 months. So far, according to a report by the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington, DC-based think tank, Chechen fighters have operated in areas behind the front line following their involvement in bloody battles in Ukrainian cities, including Mariupol, Severodonetsk and Lysychanak. But after fighting in Russia’s Belgorod intensified earlier this month, Kadyrov’s troops have likely been ordered to take a leading role in the fighting in Ukraine, ISW said. Over the weekend, Prigozhin said his units “will not sign any contracts with Shoigu”. “Shoigu can’t properly control military formations,” Prigozhin said in an audio message, published by his press service on Saturday. The Wagner chiefhas repeatedly criticisedRussia’s defence ministry, arguing that it does not provide enough support to his troops in Ukraine. The Putin ally often unleashes foul-mouthed video tirades, in which he vehemently scoffs at Moscow’s military leadership. Kadyrov has refrained from criticising the defence ministry. Russia’s deputy chief of the general staff, Colonel General Alexei Kim, said after signing the agreement with the Chechens that he hoped other volunteer units would follow suit.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/12/chechen-forces-sign-contract-with-russia-after-wagners-refusal

Soldiers hoisted the Ukrainian flag at a bombed-out building in an unverified video published on Sunday by Ukraine’s 68th Jaeger Brigade, which identified the settlement as Blahodatne in the Donetsk region. “We’re seeing the first results of the counteroffensive actions, localised results,” Valeriy Shershen, spokesperson for Ukraine’s “Tavria” military sector, said on television. Ukraine forces also retook Makarivka, the next village to the south, advancing between 300 and 1,500 metres (985-4,920 feet) along two directions on the southern front, according to a statement from Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar. A Ukrainian territorial defence unit also posted unverified footage on Telegram of its soldiers holding up their flag in Neskuchne, the village closest to Ukrainian positions in the area. “No positions were lost on the directions where our forces are on the defensive,” Maliar added. In his nightly video address, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, praised his troops, but made no reference to the specific areas where the fighting was reported. “Of course, I am thankful to our soldiers for this day,” Zelenskyy said, referring only to the two main sectors of the fighting in the east and the south. “Each one of our combat brigades, each of our units.” In Blahodatne, on the edge of the Donetsk and Zaporizhia regions, Myroslav Semeniuk, a spokesman for the Jaeger Brigade, told The Associated Press that an assault team captured six Russian troops after entering several buildings where some 60 soldiers were holed up. “The enemy keeps shelling us but this won’t stop us,” Semeniuk said. “The next village we plan to reclaim is Urozhayne. After that, [we’ll proceed] further south.” Russian military bloggers close to the Kremlin wrote that Blahodatne was abandoned because Moscow’s fighters feared encirclement.  The Russian defence ministry on Sunday continued to insist it was repelling Ukrainian attacks in the area. It said in a statement that Ukrainian attempts at offensive operations on the southern Donetsk and Zaporizhia axes of the front line over the past 24 hours had been “unsuccessful”. Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-installed official in the Zaporizhia region, insisted Blahodatne and two other villages in the region were a “grey area” in terms of control. With so little information and scant independent reporting from the front lines, it has been almost impossible to assess the battlefield situation. “We’re kicking the enemy out from our native lands. It’s the warmest feeling there is. Ukraine is going to win, Ukraine above everything,” an unidentified soldier said in the video from Blahodatne. The occupied southeast is seen as a probable priority for Kyiv’s forces because recapturing territory there would position Ukraine to threaten Russia’s land bridge to theannexed Crimean Peninsulaand split Russian forces in half. Makarivka is about 90km (300 miles) northwest of the city of Mariupol, which lies on the Sea of Azov on the southern rim of the land bridge. Russia captured the major city last year after besieging and bombarding it for weeks.    Russia has built vast fortifications across occupied territory to prepare for a Ukrainian counterattack using thousands of troops trained and equipped by the West. In her statement, Maliar also said Ukrainian forces were continuing assault operations in the east near the devastated city of Bakhmut, and advanced 250m (820 feet) near the Berkhivka Reservoir. Russia said it captured the city ofBakhmutlast month after the bloodiest and longest battle since Russia’s February 2022 full-scale invasion, but Kyiv says it is regaining ground on the flanks of the city. Meanwhile, Zelenskyy’s top adviser said six people were wounded after Russian troops opened fire on a boat evacuating people from areas flooded after theKakhovka damwas breached last week to Ukrainian-held territory. The dam explosioninundatedswathes of southern Ukraine in the latest upheaval following Russia’s full scale invasion of Ukraine 16 months ago. Andriy Yermak, the president’s chief of staff, wrote on his Telegram account that the injured were rushed to hospital in the southern city of Kherson. An AP team on site saw three ambulances drop off injured evacuees at a hospital, one of whom was splattered with blood and whisked by stretcher into the emergency room. Also on Sunday, the Russian military accused Ukrainian forces of attacking – albeit unsuccessfully – one of its ships in the Black Sea. According to Russia’s defence ministry, the attempted attack took place when six unmanned speedboats targeted Russia’s Priazovye reconnaissance vessel that was “monitoring the situation and ensuring security along the routes of the TurkStream and Blue Stream gas pipelines in the southeastern part of the Black Sea”. All the speedboats were destroyed by the Russian military, and the ship did not sustain any damage, the ministry said. The claim could not be independently verified, and Ukrainian officials made no immediate comment. Ukraine and Russia reported exchanging dozens of prisoners of war on Sunday. Russia said 94 of its soldiers were freed and Yermak said 95 Ukrainians were released.   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/11/ukraine-hails-first-territory-recaptured-in-counteroffensive
Wagner mercenary boss brushes off Russian order to sign contracts,Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu gave the directive saying all ‘volunteer detachments’ must sign military contracts by the end of the month.,"Wagner Group soldiers will not sign any contracts with Russia’s defence ministry after it issued orders for all independent forces to do so by the end of June. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu gave the directive on Saturday saying all “volunteer detachments” must sign contracts with his ministry by the end of the month – a step intended to increase the effectiveness of the Russian army fighting in Ukraine. Though the ministry did not mention Wagner in its public statement, the Russian media reported it was an attempt by Shoigu to bring the mercenaries to heel after a series of public outbursts by its controversial leader. “Wagner will not sign any contracts with Shoigu,”Yevgeny Prigozhin, founder of the Wagner Group, said on Sunday. The order, he said, did not apply to Wagner. Prigozhin has repeatedly attacked President Vladimir Putin’s top military brass for what he casts as “treachery” for failing tofight the war in Ukraineproperly.  Neither Shoigu nor Russia’sChief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimovhave commented in public on the insults from Prigozhin, whose forces in May took the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut after a battle in which tens of thousands perished over 10 months of grueling warfare. Prigozhin and his Wagner mercenaries gained renown for what the United States has called destabilising countries across Africa while plundering natural resources. He said the US has destabilised so many countries across the world that Washington has no moral authority to lecture anyone. Prigozhin said Wagner was completely subordinate to the interests of Russia, but its highly efficient command structure would be damaged by reporting to Shoigu. “Shoigu cannot properly manage military formations,” Prigozhin said, adding that Wagner coordinated its actions in Ukraine with General Sergei Surovikin,nicknamed “General Armageddon”by the Russian media. The defence ministry said that in the interest of increasing effectiveness all “volunteer detachments” would have to sign a contract with the defence ministry by July 1. “This will give the volunteer formations the necessary legal status, [and] create unified approaches to the organisation of comprehensive provision and fulfilment of their tasks,” the ministry said. “These measures will increase the combat capabilities and effectiveness of the armed forces and their volunteer detachments,” Deputy Defence Minister Nikolai Pankov said. Prigozhin said the ministry might use the failure to comply with the order as a reason todeprive Wagner of supplies– an accusation he has repeatedly made. “What could happen after this order is that they will not give us weapons and ammunition. We will figure it out, as they say,” Prigozhin said. “But when the thunder breaks, they will come running and bring weapons and ammunition with a request to help.”   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/11/wagner-mercenary-boss-brushes-off-russian-order-to-sign-contracts
Zelenskyy says counteroffensive actions under way against Russia,"Ukraine’s president says his generals are ‘positive’ about the ‘counteroffensive, defensive actions’ taking place against invading Russian troops.","Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that counteroffensive actions were under way against invading Russian forces in his country but declined to divulge additional details. The Ukrainian leader made the comment on Saturday at a news conference in Kyiv, while standing alongside visiting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. He was responding to a question about Russian President Vladimir Putin’s statement a day earlier thatUkraine’s counteroffensive had startedand that Ukrainian forces were taking “significant losses”. Zelenskyy said that “counteroffensive, defensive actions are taking place in Ukraine. I will not speak about which stage or phase they are in.” “I am in touch with our commanders of different directions every day,” he added, citing the names of five of Ukraine’s top military leaders. “Everyone is positive. Pass this on to Putin.” Top Ukrainian authorities have stopped short of announcing a full-blown counteroffensive was under way, though some Western analysts have saidfiercer fightingand reported use of reserve troops suggests it was. In his nightly video address, Zelenskyy provided few details while urging troops to keep fighting. “Thank you to all those who hold their positions and those who advance,” he said, citing the eastern and southern fronts, where fighting is heaviest. Ukraine’s general staff said its forces hadrepelled enemy attacksaround Bakhmut and Marinka, sites of heavy clashes in the east. Russian forces, it said, “continue to suffer heavy losses which they are trying to conceal”.    Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar made it plain on Telegram that the military would issue no statements until battlefield positions became clear. “Ask yourself this… am I prepared to receive information about the liberation of this or that town not when our troops enter it, but once they establish a stronghold?” she wrote. Ukraine has said for months it plans to conduct a significant counteroffensive to recapture land occupied by Russia in the south and east. But it is enforcing strict operational silence for now and has denied it has begun the main operation. With scant independent reporting from the front lines, it has been difficult to assess the state of the fighting. The United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defence, meanwhile, said Ukraine had conducted “significant” operations in several eastern and southern parts in the last 48 hours, with Russian defences breached in places. “In some areas, Ukrainian forces have likely made good progress and penetrated the first line of Russian defences. In others, Ukrainian progress has been slower,” it said, also characterising the Russian military’s performance as mixed. “Some [Russian] units are likely conducting credible manoeuvre defence operations while others have pulled back in some disorder, amid increased reports of Russian casualties as they withdraw through their own minefields,” it said. Ukraine’s counteroffensive is expected to use thousands of troops trained and equipped by the West but Russia has built huge fortifications in occupied territory to prepare, while Kyiv also lacks air supremacy. Patrick Bury, a defence and security expert at the University of Bath in the UK, told Al Jazeera that the counteroffensive was likely to be a “long game” and that its initial operations would “probably be the most bloody part for the Ukrainians”. “It’s highly unlikely that we’re going to see a rapid breakthrough like we saw in Kharkiv back in September, for example, where the Ukrainians were able to, with the help of allied intelligence, identify places where there were just exhausted and ruined Russian units and drove essentially past them and kept going. It’s not going to be like that,” he said. “The Russians have had months to prepare significant offences and these are … defensive positions with trenches, bunkers, minefields, in particular, which are designed to channel attackers into killing zones.” The Ukrainians were likely to take “a lot of casualties” while going on the attack. “It’s much easier to defend: You know the ground, you know what the plan is, you know ‘I’m going to hold this position until they get to here and then I’m going to fall back to here, and then that other position is going to support me’,” Bury said. “It’s significantly easier for the defenders as the Ukrainians found out when they were defending last year. It’s much more difficult for the attackers,” he added. “Yes, you have some intelligence preparation but you don’t know exactly where everything is; it’s all new to you, the terrain and you’re being fired on etc as you try to advance; so it’s much more difficult for them.”    The south is seen as a key strategic priority for a Ukrainian push that could aim to recapture Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant and cut the Russian land bridge to the occupied Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, dividing Russian forces. The fighting there has drawn renewed attention following the destruction of the Russian-controlled Kakhovka dam along the Dnipro River on Tuesday. The flooding from the breached dam has forced thousands to flee their homes and sparkedfears of humanitarian and environmental disasters. Ukraine says Russia blew up the dam. Moscow accuses Kyiv of firing on it. Trudeau, the first foreign leader to visit Ukraine since the dam’s breach, offered up monetary, military and moral support. He pledged 500 million Canadian dollars ($375m) in new military aid, on top of more than 8 billion Canadian dollars ($6bn) that Canada has already provided since the war began in February 2022, and announced 10 million Canadian dollars ($7.5m) for humanitarian assistance for the flood response. Trudeau said the dam’s collapse was “a direct consequence of Russia’s war”, but he did not blame Moscow directly. In other developments, the UK government also said it will give 16 million pounds ($20m) in humanitarian aid to those affected by the flooding. Most of the money is being channelled through international organisations such as the Red Cross and the United Nations. The UK is also sending boats, community water filters, water pumps and waders to Ukraine. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, meanwhile, said on Saturday that he wanted to continue speaking with Putin and plans to do so again “soon”. Scholz has spoken several times by phone with Putin since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year. The chancellor said the basis for a “fair peace” between Russia and Ukraine is the withdrawal of Russian troops. “That needs to be understood,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/11/zelenskyy-says-counteroffensive-actions-underway-in-ukraine
Nord Stream sabotage probe turns to clues in Poland: Report,"Investigators reconstructed the two-week voyage of a 15-metre yacht suspected of being involved in the gas pipeline sabotage, Wall Street Journal reports.","Investigators in Germany are examining evidence suggesting a sabotage team used Poland as an operating base to blow up theNord Stream pipelinesin the Baltic Sea, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported. The investigators reconstructed the two-week voyage of the Andromeda, a 50-foot (15-metre) yacht suspected of being involved in the sabotage of the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines,the newspaper said. The Journal on Saturday cited people familiar with the voyage as indicating the sabotage crew placed deep-sea explosives on Nord Stream 1, before they set the vessel on a course towards Poland. It added Germany was trying to match DNA samples found on the vessel “to at least one Ukrainian soldier”. The evidence included data from the Andromeda’s radio and navigation equipment, as well as satellite and mobile phones and Gmail accounts allegedly used by the perpetrators, WSJ reported. “Taken together, the details show that the boat sailed around each of the locations where the blasts later took place – evidence that fortified investigators’ belief that the Andromeda was instrumental in last year’s destruction of the pipeline,” it said. Investigators began looking at the vessel after a tip from a Western intelligence service, the newspaper said. Germany’s Federal Criminal Police Office and Poland’s government spokesman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. “Information about Polish or Ukrainian clues in the destruction of NS1 and NS2, repeated in the media space, is consistently used by the Russian apparatus of influence to create the impression/presumption among the recipients that Warsaw and Kiev were behind this incident,” Stanislaw Zaryn, deputy to Poland’s minister coordinator of special services, wrote on Twitter.  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 put Europe’s reliance on Russiannatural gasin the political spotlight. The destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines hastened the region’s switch to other energy suppliers. Earlier this week, the Washington Post reported the US government learned from a European intelligence agency of a secret plan by Ukraine’s military toattack the pipelinesusing divers, who reported directly to the commander-in-chief of the armed forces three months before the September 2022 explosions. On Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy denied his government’s involvement in the sabotage of the gas pipelines. “I am the president and I give orders accordingly. Nothing of the sort has been done by Ukraine. I would never act that way,” Zelenskyy said, asking for proof of Ukrainian involvement. German media in March identified the possible involvement of a yacht from a Poland-based company owned by Ukrainian citizens in the attack.

Putin claims Russian forces halting Ukrainian counteroffensive,"Claims by pro-Moscow commentators that Ukraine’s counteroffensive has failed are premature, says war monitor think tank.","Russian President Vladimir Putin said thatUkrainian troops have started a long-expected counteroffensiveand were suffering “significant” losses in their efforts to punch through Moscow’s defence lines in Ukraine. “We can clearly say the offensive has started, as indicated by the Ukrainian army’s use of strategic reserves,” Putin told reporters in Sochi on Friday, where he was meeting with heads of other states in the Eurasian Economic Union. “But the Ukrainian troops haven’t achieved their stated tasks in a single area of fighting,” he said. “We are seeing that the Ukrainian regime’s troops are suffering significant losses,” Putin said, without providing details. “It’s known that the offensive side suffers losses of 3 to 1 – it’s sort of classic – but in this case, the losses significantly exceed that classic level,” he added. With virtuallyno independent reporting from the front linesand Kyiv saying little on its military operations, it was impossible to assess Putin’s claims or whether Ukraine was penetrating Russian defences in its bid to drive out occupying forces. Authorities in Ukraine have either denied or declined to confirm if their counteroffensive has started, despite military analysts and sources in Ukraine stating that the campaign has begun to incrementally unfold amidreports of increased fighting in several regionsalong the front lines with Russian forces in the east and southeast of the country. “It’s a policy now not to give a running commentary of events and you see that in the words of President Zelenskyy, who has been praising the fighters in the east and talking about results but has given no indication as to what these results may be,” Al Jazeera’s Jonah Hull, reporting from Kyiv, said. Moscow claimed to have thwarted repeated attempts by the Ukrainians to breach Russian defences in the Zaporizhzhia region to potentially try and cut supply lines to the south. “Corroborating Russian reports are pictures on social media that show a Leopard 2 tank abandoned, certainly damaged, and in the company of it a number of Bradley Fighting Vehicles,” Hull said, referring to equipment donated by Germany and the US. “The presence of those vehicles on the battlefield would suggest the involvement of units of the Ukrainian army specifically trained and equipped for the summer counter-offensive.”    The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington, DC-based think tank, said on Friday that a “variety of indicators” suggested Ukraine’s counteroffensive had begun and warned that the early phase of the campaign “may also see the highest Ukrainian losses” as efforts are made to push through the front lines against defending Russian forces. According to the ISW, Putin directly addressing Ukraine’s counteroffensive was an important departure for the Russian president who has maintained a “distanced approach to discussing battlefield realities”. The Kremlin reportedly adopted a new information policy aimed at playing up the “Russian fight against Western-provided weapon systems” in Ukraine’s counteroffensive, the ISW said on Saturday. 2/ Russian President Vladimir#Putinacknowledged on June 9 that the Ukrainian#counteroffensiverecently began & noted that Ukrainian forces still have offensive potential, a departure from previous Kremlin efforts to downplay Ukrainian counteroffensives.https://t.co/ilySwoUjWw — ISW (@TheStudyofWar)June 10, 2023  Russian claims that the counteroffensive had been blunted – a point played up by pro-Moscow military bloggers focusing on destroyed and damaged Western military equipment donated to Ukraine – were premature, the ISW said. “Ukrainian officials directly acknowledged that Ukrainian forces expect to suffer equipment losses during counteroffensive operations,” the ISW said in its latest report. The ISW earlier said that the initial phase of Ukraine’s counteroffensive operations will likely be the most costly and difficult in terms of lives lost and equipment destroyed. “Militaries have long identified the penetration phase of a mechanised offensive as the most dangerous and costly. The success or failure of this phase may not be apparent for some time,” the ISW said.    In his nightly address on Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy again praised the heroism of his forces, “for all those who are in particularly tough battles these days”. “We see your heroism, and we are grateful to you for every minute of your life – a life that is truly the life of Ukraine,” he said. Earlier on Friday, Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said Russia was on the defensive in the southeastern Zaporizhzhia region, though theepicentre of fighting remained in the east, particularly in the Donetsk region. She described “heavy battles” in Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Marinka. Valerii Shershen, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s armed forces in Zaporizhzhia, told Radio Liberty that Ukrainian forces were searching for weaknesses in Russia’s defence, which Moscow was trying to strengthen by deploying mines, constructing fortifications and regrouping. A Ukrainian military success in the Zaporizhzhia region would enable its forces to break through the land bridge that connects Russia with the Moscow-annexed Crimean peninsula. That would be a significant reversal for Russia.    The main element of the Ukrainian counteroffensive, when it unfolds, is expected to involve thousands of Ukrainian troops trained and equipped by the West. In all, Kyiv has 12 brigades totalling 50,000-60,000 troops ready to deploy in the counteroffensive. Nine of the brigades have been armed and trained by the West. Ben Barry, senior fellow for land warfare at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said Ukraine’s priority in the initial stages of the counteroffensive would be trying to keep the Russians off balance and gain tactical surprise through deception and camouflage. The US Department of Defense also announced an additional $2.1bn in military assistance for Ukraine on Friday. The latest package includes additional munitions for Patriot air defence systems, Raytheon HAWK air defence systems and missiles, 105mm and 203mm artillery rounds, small AeroVironment drones that can be launched by hand, laser-guided rocket system munitions and support for training and maintenance, the defence department said.

US says Iran is helping Russia build drone manufacturing facility,US intelligence officials say Iran and Russia continue to strengthen their military cooperation and weapons assistance.,"The United States has accused the Iranian government of helping Russia to build a drone manufacturing plant near Moscow, in an escalation of theirdefence cooperation. In a statement on Friday, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby cited US intelligence findings that indicated Iran had provided material support for the plant, which could be operational by early next year. US officials also double-downed on claims that Iran has sent hundreds of drones — or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) — to Russia for use in Ukraine, where a full-scale invasion was launched in 2022. “Russia has been using Iranian UAVs in recent weeks to strike Kyiv and terrorize the Ukrainian population, and the Russia-Iran military partnership appears to be deepening,” Kirby said in Friday’s statement. “We are also concerned that Russia is working with Iran to produce Iranian UAVs from inside Russia.”    The administration of US President Joe Biden, Ukraine’s most important supporter, had previously alleged that Iran and Russia were discussing the possibility of setting up a drone assembly line inside of Russia. Kirby said that US intelligence officials now believe that the manufacturing plant is being set up in the Alabuga special economic zone, several hundred miles east of Moscow. Russia and Iran have indeed strengthened their partnership in recent years, stepping up weapons sales and exploring ways tooutmanoeuvreUS-led efforts to economically isolate the two countries. But Russia has denied usingIranian-made dronesin Ukraine. Iran, meanwhile,has acknowledgedsending drones to Russia but says it did so before Russia’s widely condemned invasion in February 2022. Nevertheless, the US has accused Iran of complicity in the Russian invasion, which has killed thousands of people and displaced nearly 14 million people, according to the United Nations. On Friday, Kirby said that Iran has continued to send drones to Russia, shipping them across the Caspian Sea to the Russian port of Makhachkala. The Biden administration haspreviously sanctionedIranian defence firms involved in drone production. “Iran’s well-documented proliferation of UAVs and conventional weapons to its proxies continues to undermine both regional security and global stability,” the US Treasury said in a March statement announcing further sanctions.    Last month, Ukraine approved a package ofsanctionsagainst Iran due to its close partnership with Russia. Ukraine has also alleged that Iranian-made drones have been used in Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities that have killed and maimed civilians. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asked Iranians if they wanted to be “accomplices in Russian terror”, a statement Tehran dismissed as “political show”. But Russia has also accused Ukraine of likewise using drones to launch attacks inside its borders. Earlier this week, Russia reported that a drone that crashed into a residential building in thecity of Voronezh, and it also blamed Ukraine for a series of drone attacks inMoscowin late May.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/9/us-says-iran-is-helping-russia-build-drone-manufacturing-facility
Drone crashes into building in Russia’s Voronezh city; 3 injured,Russia reports a drone attack in its southwestern city which partially borders Ukraine.,"Three people were lightly wounded after a drone crashed into a residential building in Russia’s Voronezh city, the regional governor said. The Voronezh oblast in southwest Russia partly borders Ukraine. The latest drone attack to target Russian cities in recent weeks comes as Ukraine has been intensifying its efforts to expel Russian forces from a vast swath of southern and eastern Ukraine that they invaded more than 15 months ago on orders from President Vladimir Putin. In a Telegram post, regional Governor Aleksandr Gusev said the three residents were hurt by shards of glass from broken windows and received help on the spot. Russian state media published photos showing a high-rise apartment building with some windows blown out and damage to the façade. Such drone strikes – which have previously hit residential areas in southern Krasnodar and even one at theKremlin– along with cross-border raids in southwestern Russia, have exposed glaring breaches in Russian air defences and porous border security. Kyiv withholds comment on reports of attacks inside Russia. Separately on Friday, the Ukrainian presidency’s website posted a video statement overnight from President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that alluded to the latest efforts of his country’s forces, along various parts of the more than 1,000-kilometre (about 620-mile) front line. Zelenskyy, speaking in what appeared to be a selfie video from inside a train carriage after visiting flood-hit southern Ukraine, said he was in touch with Ukrainian forces “in all the hottest areas” of the fight and praised an unspecified “result” from their efforts. Ukrainian authorities have kept quiet about their latest military moves, refusing to join in on rising commentary from Western military experts and others that along-anticipated counteroffensivewas under way. Zelenskyy echoed that government stance on Friday, saying it was “not time” yet to talk about the details of the fighting. “At our end, we hear that Ukraine’s armed forces have been striking in several parts of the front over the course of five days, and the Russian side says it is not possible for Ukraine to achieve any success,” journalist Yulia Shapovalova told Al Jazeera from Moscow. In Kyiv, Al Jazeera’s Jonah Hull said Ukrainian officials “will not confirm whether their summer offensive has begun. They will not confirm whether these are the preparatory stages to it. They simply say they will not be providing a running commentary.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/9/drone-crashes-into-building-in-russias-voronezh-city-3-injured
"In Russia-occupied Kherson, flood aid slow to come: Residents",Those in occupied areas are reportedly trapped in floodwaters as Ukrainians in Kyiv-controlled Kherson receive help.,"For days, a Ukrainian teenager has waited in the attic, just down the street from the cemetery of her flooded town, marking time with her 83-year-old grandfather and two other elderly people and hoping for help to escape the deluge of a catastrophicdam collapse. But help is slow in coming to Oleshky, a Russian-occupied town across the Dnipro river from the city of Kherson with a pre-war population of 24,000, according to those stranded and their desperate Ukrainian rescuers. Russian forces are taking rescuers’ boats, they say. Some say the soldiers will only help people with Russian passports. “Russian soldiers are standing at the checkpoints, preventing (rescuers) from approaching the most affected areas and taking away the boats,” said one volunteer, Yaroslav Vasiliev. “They are afraid of saboteurs, they suspect everyone.” So 19-year-old Yektarina But and the three elderly people with her simply wait, along with thousands of others believed to be trapped by floodwaters spread across 600 square kilometres (230 square miles) of the Kherson region. About two-thirds of the flooded areas are in territory occupied by Russia, officials said. The group in the attic have no electricity, no running water, no food. The battery on But’s mobile phone is dying. “We are afraid that no one will know about our deaths,” she said in a brief phone interview, her voice trembling. “Everything around us is flooded,” she said. “There is still no help.” Her grandfather, who had suffered a stroke, was running out of medicine, she said. One woman with her, a neighbour’s grandmother, could not move on her own. Others have been turned away from rescue.    Viktoria Mironova-Baka said she has been in touch from Germany with relatives stuck in the flooded region. “My relatives said that Russian soldiers were coming up to the house today by boat, but they said they would only take those with Russian passports,” she told The Associated Press. Her grandmother, aunt and more than a dozen other people are taking shelter in the attic of a two-storey house. Details of life in Russian-occupied Ukraine are often unclear. The AP could not independently verify reports of boat seizures or that only Russians were being evacuated, but the account is in line with reporting by independent Russian media. It is a sharp contrast to Ukrainian-controlled territory flooded by the dam collapse. Authorities there have aggressively evacuated civilians and brought in emergency supplies. On Thursday, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy travelled to the area to assess the damage. Russian President Vladimir Putin “has no plans at the current moment” to visit affected Moscow-occupied areas, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists. This region has suffered terribly since Russia invaded Ukraine early last year, enduring sometimes relentless artillery and missile attacks. The latest disaster began on Tuesday, when the Kakhovka hydroelectric dam, roughly 80km (50 miles) upstream from Oleshky, collapsed, sending torrents of water down the Dnipro river and across the war’s front lines. Officials say more than 6,000 people have been evacuated from dozens of inundated cities, towns and villages on both sides of the river. But the true scale of the disaster remains unclear for a region that was once home to tens of thousands of people. At least 14 people have died in the flooding, many are homeless, and tens of thousands are without drinking water. The floods ruined crops, displaced land mines, caused widespread environmental damage, and set the stage for long-term electricity shortages. Ukraine says Russia destroyed the dam with explosives. Russia accuses Ukraine of destroying it with a missile attack. A drone flown Wednesday by an AP team over the dam’s wreckage revealed none of the scorch marks or shrapnel scars typical of a bombardment. The bulk of the dam itself is now submerged, and The AP images offered a limited snapshot, making it difficult to rule out any scenario. The dam also had been weakened by Russian neglect and water had been washing over it for weeks. It had been under Russian control since the invasion in February 2022. Compounding the tragedy, Russia has been shelling areas hit by the flooding, including the front-line city of Kherson. On Thursday, Russian shelling echoed not far from a square in Kherson where emergency crews and volunteers were dispensing aid. Some evacuation points in the city were hit, wounding nine people, according to Ukrainian officials. The floodwaters have irrevocably changed the landscape downstream and shifted the dynamic of the 15-month-old war. Oleshky Mayor Yevhen Ryshchuk said that by Thursday afternoon water levels were beginning to fall, but roughly 90 percent of the city remained flooded. Ryshchuk fled after Russian forces tried to force him to collaborate, but he remains in close contact with people in and around the city. Russia says it is helping the region’s civilians. Moscow-appointed regional Governor Vladimir Saldo claimed at least 4,000 people had been evacuated from the flood zones. He shared a video showing empty beds in shelters prepared for evacuees. Ryshchuk dismisses such talk. He said some people trying to leave flooded areas were forced back by Russian soldiers who accused them of being “waiters” – people waiting for Ukraine to reclaim control of the region. Others, who called the Russian-controlled emergency services, were told they would have to wait for help, he said. “That’s it,” he said. “Yesterday, some Russians came in the morning, took a few people off the roofs, filmed a video, and left. That’s everything they have done as of today.” The help that made it through has been scattered. Ukrainian military footage, for instance, showed their forces dropping a bottle of water from a drone to a boy trapped with his mother and sister in the attic of their home near Oleshky. Ukrainian soldiers later evacuated the family and their pets to the city of Kherson, National Police reported. Much of the help is being organised by volunteers communicating on the encrypted app Telegram. Messages about stranded people, often trapped on the roofs of their houses, appear in these groups every few minutes. Most are posted by relatives in safer areas. Just one of these volunteer groups has a map showing more than 1,000 requests to locate and rescue people, mostly in Oleshky and the nearby town of Hola Prystan. A woman helping with one of the groups, who spoke on condition her name not be used for fear of reprisals from the Russian occupiers, shared a message with an AP journalist. “We were looking for a person named Serhii Borzov,” the message read. “He was found. Unfortunately, dead. Our condolences to the relatives.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/9/568
Ukraine counteroffensive against Russia under way: think tank,"Washington, DC-based Institute for the Study of War says Ukraine counteroffensive unlikely to unfold as ‘single grand operation’.","Kyiv’s counteroffensive against Russian forces has started, a Washington, DC-based think tank monitoring the war in Ukraine has said, though Ukrainian officials continue to deny or decline confirmation that their long-awaited campaign to retake territory occupied by Russian forces is under way. “The Ukrainian #counteroffensive has begun. Activity throughout #Ukraine is consistent with a variety of indicators that Ukrainian counteroffensive operations are underway across the theater,” the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said in a series of tweets late on Thursday. Ukrainian officials have confirmed that theirforces are on the offensive in the Bakhmut region– where they have reportedly gained territory – and the ISW said that it had “observed a general uptick in military activity across the entire front line, not all of it part of the Ukrainian counter-offensive effort”. The ISW said the counteroffensive “won’t likely unfold as a single grand operation”. “It will likely consist of many undertakings at numerous locations of varying size and intensity over many weeks.” The Ukrainian#counteroffensivehas begun. Activity throughout#Ukraineis consistent with a variety of indicators that Ukrainian counteroffensive operations are underway across the theater. 🧵on what we’re seeing & how to evaluate this  activity ⬇️https://t.co/hwgxTnU2Tr — ISW (@TheStudyofWar)June 8, 2023  With Ukrainian officials signalling that the start of the counteroffensive will not be officially announced, other experts have also concluded that the campaign has begun amid reports of fighting intensifying in areas along the more-than-1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line from Kherson on the Black Sea to Ukraine’s border with Russia. NBC News, citing a senior officer and a soldier near the front lines, also said the offensive had started, while The Washington Post, citing “four individuals” in the armed forces, reported the same information on Thursday. Asked about those reports, a spokesperson for the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine told the Reuters news agency: “We have no such information.” In his nightly address on Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hailed what he described as “results” in heavy fighting in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine. “I am in constant communication with our military. The commanders of Khortytsia, Tavria, [and] all those involved in the hottest areas. Donetsk region – very tough battles,”he said. “But there is a result, and I am grateful to everyone who ensures this result! Bakhmut – well done. Step by step. I thank each of our warriors!” Zelenskyy referenced other battlefield areas but said that now was not the time to discuss them. “The entire east, the situation in the south, the situation after theRussians blew up the dam of the native Kakhovka– we see every detail. But it’s not time to talk about it today.”    In a podcast on Wednesday, Michael Kofman of the Center for Naval Analyses, a US research group, said fighting had taken a “more qualitative turn” with Ukrainian forces appearing to mount offensive operations near the eastern town of Velyka Novosilka and other points in the southern part of the Donetsk region, as well as on its border withthe Zaporizhia region. “These attacks, I don’t believe [them] to be the main offensive effort, but they mark what I think is the beginning of the Ukrainian offensive,” he said. Al Jazeera’s Jonah Hull, reporting from Kyiv, said that Ukraine has made it clear it will not give “a running commentary on what is going on” as it appears to not “want to give up the element of surprise”. “What is or what may be going on now, well, military analysts have given their view, and their view is that Ukraine is engaged in a series of probing attacks, so-called shaping operations ahead of the counteroffensive,” Hull said. “Probing Russian weaknesses, looking for vulnerabilities and, at the same time, essentially keeping Russia guessing,” he said. Russia said its forces had fought a two-hour battle with Ukrainian troops in the early hours of Thursday in the Zaporizhia region. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said the Ukrainian offensive involved 1,500 soldiers and 150 armoured vehicles. “The enemy was stopped and retreated after heavy losses,” he said. Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said only that Russia was conducting “defensive actions” near the town of Orikhiv in the Zaporizhia region. According to the ISW, the initial phase of Ukraine’s counteroffensive operations will likely be the most costly and difficult in terms of lives lost and equipment destroyed as troops and armour attempt to penetrate Russia’s defensive positions. “Militaries have long identified the penetration phase of a mechanised offensive as the most dangerous and costly. The success or failure of this phase may not be apparent for some time,” the ISW said.   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/9/ukraine-counteroffensive-against-russia-under-way-think-tank

‘Enduring commitment’: Key takeaways from US-GCC joint statement,Communique by US and Gulf states backs two-state solution to Israeli-Palestinian conflict based on the 1967 borders.,"Washington, DC –The United States and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) have released a joint statement, spelling out shared priorities and finding common ground even on issues where the two do not often see eye to eye. The communique on Thursday came after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken attended a GCC meeting aspart of his visitthis week to Saudi Arabia. In the statement, the US underscored its “enduring commitment” to the Gulf region despite concerns about its waning influence in the Middle East in an increasingly multipolar world, where Washington is turning its foreign-policy focus tocompetition with China. Here Al Jazeera looks at key takeaways from the lengthy statement, which addresses an array of regional and global crises. The statement calls for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict “along 1967 borders with mutually agreed swaps consistent with internationally recognized parameters and the Arab Peace Initiative”. Those terms would ensure a Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank, including occupied East Jerusalem. The initiative, endorsed bythe Arab Leaguein 2002, makes the Arab states’ recognition of Israel conditional on ending the occupation of Arab territories and finding a “fair solution” to the plight of Palestinian refugees. This is not the first time the administration of US President Joe Biden has invoked the 1967 borders as a basis for resolving the conflict. We appreciate the Gulf Cooperation Council@GCC’s partnership, including our urgent work together on the situation in Sudan, seeking a durable solution to the conflict in Yemen, and countering Iran’s destabilizing behavior.pic.twitter.com/xaGQvV6HK3 — Secretary Antony Blinken (@SecBlinken)June 7, 2023  But the statement marks a rare written endorsement of that framework from a US administration that has repeatedly said it considers Jerusalem to be Israel’s capital. Former President Donald Trump moved the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in violation of international law — a decision that the current administration has pledgednot to reverse. Biden has also failed to fulfill a campaign promise toreopen a consulatefor Palestinians in the holy city amid Israeli opposition. The US provides at least $3.8bn in military aid to Israel annually. Blinken had made no secret of his intention to push for formal relations between Israel and Arab states —particularly Saudi Arabia— during his trip. In a speech earlier this week,he said Washingtonhas a “real national security interest in promoting normalisation” between Israel and the kingdom. Addressing the GCC on Wednesday, Blinken reiterated that the US is “collaborating with countries in the region to widen and deepen the normalisation of relations with Israel”. But the joint statement on Thursday made no mention of Arab-Israeli normalisation. The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain — two GCC members — as well as Morocco agreed to initiate diplomatic ties with Israel in 2020 as part of a push brokered by Trump. Sudan also agreed to join the normalisation pact, known as the so-called Abraham Accords. Saudi officials have said previously that they are committed to the Arab Peace Initiative, which links Arab-Israeli ties to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.    The US-GCC joint statement unambiguously welcomed the rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Past US statements had shown cautious backing at best forthe Chinese-brokereddeal that saw the two countries restore bilateral ties. “The Ministers welcomed the decision by Saudi Arabia and Iran toresume diplomatic relationsand stressed the importance of adherence to international law, including the UN Charter, by states of the region,” Thursday’s statement said. Earlier this week, US Department of State spokesperson Vedant Patel told reporters that the US “would certainly take issue with countries that are going to take steps to further normalise or deepen their collaboration with or cooperation with the Iranian regime”. In a subsequent email to Al Jazeera, a State Department spokesperson said Patel was simply referring to the US commitment with its allies “to confront the Iranian regime’s destabilizing behavior in the region and its human rights abuses at home”. “As we have been clear, we have long encouraged direct dialogue and diplomacy, including between Iran and regional governments,” the spokesperson said. Thursday’s joint statement voiced commitment to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and called on Iran to cooperate with theUnited Nations watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The Biden administration has previouslyopenly voicedopposition to its Arab allies’ drive to rekindle ties with the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad. But the sides appeared to find consensus on Thursday, saying that they support a political resolution to the crisis that preserves Syria’s unity, in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 2254, which calls for free elections in the country. “In that regard, the Ministers welcomed Arab efforts to resolve the crisis in a step-for-step manner,” the communique read. Notably, the statement also expressed support for the US military presence in Syria, which Washington says aims to ensure that ISIL (ISIS) does not reemerge, but which Damascuscalls illegal. “Ministers further condemned all actions that threaten the safety and security of these forces,” the statement read. The US and the GCC also reasserted support for ensuring conditions for the “safe, dignified and voluntary return of refugees” to Syria and called for a nationwide ceasefire in the country.    The communique stressed territorial integrity and international law without explicitly condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine. “The Ministers reaffirmed the importance of respecting the principle of sovereignty and international law, including the UN Charter and the obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state,” the statement said. Many Gulf states have taken aneutral approachto the conflict as Washington tried to unify its allies against Moscow. Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyaddressed an Arab League summit in Jeddah last month and urged support for his country. But Thursday’s statement remained general, emphasising the Gulf states’ focus on the humanitarian, though not political, dimensions of the conflict. “The Ministers urged all countries and the international community to intensify their efforts aimed at achieving a peaceful solution, ending the humanitarian crisis, and supporting refugees, displaced persons and others affected by the war in Ukraine, as well as facilitating the export of grain and otherfood supplies, and supporting food security in affected countries,” it said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/8/enduring-commitment-key-takeaways-from-us-gcc-joint-statement
Bodies found floating after Kakhovka dam collapse: Zelenskyy,The Ukrainian president paints a bleak picture of destruction and says Russian forces are shooting at rescuers.,"Dead bodies are floating in flooded areas after the Nova Kakhovka dam was destroyed, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The vast Soviet-era hydroelectric dam collapsed early on Tuesday, unleashing torrents of water into the Dnipro that have resulted in widespread flooding. Kyiv and Moscow have traded blame over the incident.    Speaking to the US-based news site Politico on Wednesday, Zelenskyy also accused Russian forces of shooting at Ukrainian rescuers as they attempted to reach people trapped in affected areas. “From the roofs of the flooded houses, people see drowned people floating by. You can see that on the other side. It’s very hard to get people out of the occupied part of [the] Kherson region. When our forces try to get them out, they are shot at by occupiers from a distance,” hesaid. The Kyiv Independent, quoting Yevhen Ryshchuk, the exiled mayor of the Russian-occupied city Oleshky, reported that at least three people have died due to the dam disaster. The Russian-installed mayor of Nova Kakhovka said on Thursday that five people had died, according to the Russian state-owned news agency RIA Novosti. However, Zelenskyy warned that it is not possible yet to know how many people have died. “We won’t be able to see all the consequences for a few days, when the water has trickled down a bit,” he told Politico. Ukrainian and Russian-controlled territories on each side of the Dnipro are affected. Ukraine’s regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin estimated that about 600 square kilometres (230 square miles) of the Kherson region was underwater on Thursday and that 68 percent of the flooded territory was on the Russian-controlled side.  The state emergency service of Ukraine said about 2,000 people had been evacuated from flooded areas, including 103 children. On the Russia-controlled bank, Vladimir Saldo, the Russia-backed regional governor, said up to 40,000 people remained in flooded areas. His deputy, Tatyana Kuzmich, said 1,274 people had been evacuated and that the emergency response would last at least 10 days. Meanwhile, the United Nations has warned of an environmental disaster that could have dire humanitarian consequences for hundreds of thousands of people. The UN humanitarian agency OCHA said emergency efforts were under way to provide assistance to more than 16,000 people, including water supplies. The UN said a team is in Kherson to coordinate relief efforts and that access to drinking water was a major concern, adding that 12,000 bottles of water and 10,000 purification tablets have been distributed so far. The World Bank will conduct a rapid assessment of the damage & needs caused by the russian terrorist attack. Talked to@bjerde_annaabout the consequences of the destruction of the Kakhovka HPP dam.

Ukraine accuses Russia of shelling rescuers amid dam evacuations,Russian President Vladimir Putin blames Kyiv and Western supporters in first comments on destroyed Kakhovka dam.,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyyhas accused Russian forces of shelling Ukrainian emergency workers who are trying to rescue people from floodwaters caused by thedestruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam. Speaking in his nightly address on Wednesday, Zelenskyy said that more than 2,000 people have been rescued so far from flooding in the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions which, he said, contrasted starkly with Russian-occupied regions where he accused Moscow’s forces of simply abandoning people to the flood. “Evacuation continues. Under fire!” Zelenskyy said. “Russian artillery continues to fire, no matter what. Savages,” he said. “Our military and special services are rescuing people as much as it is possible, despite the shelling.” Zelenskky describedconditions in Russian-occupied parts of the Kherson regionas “absolutely catastrophic” and called on international humanitarian organisations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, to immediately deploy to and help people abandoned in occupied areas now hit by flooding from the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam on Tuesday. “The occupiers simply abandoned people in these terrible conditions. Without rescue, without water, just on the rooftops in flooded communities,” Ukraine’s president said. “It is even impossible to establish for sure how many people in the temporarily occupied territory of Kherson region may die without rescue, without drinking water, without food, without medical care,” he added.    Reporters said on Wednesday that artillery booms could be heard as people scrambled to leave affected areas with the help of rescue workers. Earlier on Wednesday, Zelenskky said he was disappointed that the UN and the Red Cross had so far failed to respond rapidly to the dam disaster, according to comments published by media outlets. “Each person who dies there is a verdict on the existing international architecture and international organisations that have forgotten how to save lives,” he said later in his evening address. “If there is no international organisation in the area of this disaster now, it means that it does not exist at all, that it is incapable of functioning. All the relevant appeals from Ukraine and our government are in place,” he said. The situation in the occupied part of Kherson region is absolutely catastrophic. The occupiers simply abandoned people in these terrible conditions. Without rescue, without water, just on the rooftops in flooded communities. And this is another deliberate crime of Russia: after…pic.twitter.com/SPGzXyoCen — Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa)June 7, 2023  Commenting for the first time on the blowing up of the dam on Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin repeated Moscow’s line that Ukraine was to blame. In a call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Putin alleged that Kyiv authorities, encouraged by Western supporters, had destroyed the dam and were escalating “war crimes, openly using terrorist methods and staging acts of sabotage on Russian territory”, the Kremlin said in its account of the call. Erdogan has proposed a commission of inquiry into the dam’s destruction, the presidential office in Ankara said, following separate telephone conversations with Putin and Zelenskyy on Wednesday. It remains unclear how the dam disaster would affect the war and Ukraine’s planned counteroffensive against Russian forces, but Kyiv said on Wednesday that its troops had advanced more than 1km (just over half a mile) around the ruined city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine. Reports of the advance were the most explicit claim of battlefield progress by Ukraine since Russia said that the Ukrainian counteroffensive had begun – unannounced – earlier this week.    Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s national security council, said assaults under way were still localised, and the full-scale offensive has yet to begin, adding that the public would know when the counteroffensive starts. “Our troops have switched from defence to the offensive in the direction of Bakhmut,” Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said on Telegram. Russia’s defence ministry confirmed eight Ukrainian attempts to attack near Bakhmut but said that all had been repelled. Addressing the issue of the dam’s destruction as Kyiv and Moscow trade blame, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington, DC-based think tank, said Russia has “a greater and clearer interest in flooding the lower [Dnipro] despite the damage to their own prepared defensive positions”. Believing that Ukraine had already begun its counteroffensive, the ISW said, Russian forces may have thought breaching the dam could cover their possible retreat and delay Ukraine’s advance. However, the flooding is now heavily disrupting Russia’s prepared defensive positions along the occupied bank of the Dnipro river, the ISW said on Thursday. Near-infrared imagery captured at 0400 am ET on June 7 indicates that flooding is heavily disrupting prepared Russian defensive positions on the east bank of the#DniproRiver – especially affecting Russian first-line positions in Hola Prystan & Oleshky.https://t.co/W6mPtd0HgQhttps://t.co/ai9DXhGgrCpic.twitter.com/7A4tXHzqdb — ISW (@TheStudyofWar)June 8, 2023  “The flooding has destroyed many Russian first-line field fortifications that the Russian military intended to use to defend against Ukrainian attacks,” the ISW added. Authorities are now warning of the impact on global hunger and the environment due to the dam’s destruction with the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) warning that the flooding could destroy crops and lead to greater hunger worldwide. Ukraine’s agriculture ministry said that it expects about 10,000 hectares (38.6 square miles) of agricultural land on the northern bank of the Dnipro river in the Kherson region to be flooded, according to initial estimates. On the southern bank, in the Russian-occupied region, this area will be flooded many times, the ministry said on its website. Environmental organisation Greenpeace also warned of enormous damage to the country’s water supply and food security. “Due to the scale of the disaster […] there will be inevitable impacts on the water supply for millions of people and agriculture during the coming summer months and beyond,” Greenpeace said.

"Russia-Ukraine war: List of key events, day 470","As the war enters its 470th day, these are the main developments.","This is the situation as it stands on Thursday, June 8, 2023.     ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/8/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-470
Ukraine ramps up operations as dam destruction blame game unfolds,Kyiv’s long-planned counteroffensive appears to have begun as hostilities mount in Bakhmut and sabotage operations increase in occupied territories and Russia.,"A surge in Ukrainian military operations, a flurry of cross-border raids by drones and armed groups and a mystery over who blew up a dam that flooded swathes of land along the Dnipro River. Events are moving fast in Russia’s war on Ukraine, now in its 67th week. The commander of Ukraine’s ground forces, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said his soldiers were advancing in Bakhmut on Monday after a lull of a few days. “The Bakhmut direction remains the epicentre of hostilities. There we are moving along a fairly wide front,” Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar confirmed on Telegram. Maliar said Ukrainian troops advanced as much as 1,600 metres (5,250 feet) north of Bakhmut and as much as 700 metres (2,300 feet) to the south in a flanking manoeuvre. Russiaclaimed victory in Bakhmuton May 21, and nine days later, Ukraine admitted the city was in Russian hands after 10 months of bloody warfare. The Russian defence ministry said Ukrainian forces on Sunday launched a “large-scale offensive” across five sectors of the eastern front.Defence Minister Sergei Shoigusaid Russian forces repelled all the attacks and killed 3,175 Ukrainian soldiers in three days. “Russian sources have previously attempted to paint Ukrainian counteroffensive actions as immediate failures and Russian sources are likely attempting to do the same with what they view as the start of the announced Ukrainian counteroffensive,” said the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, a think tank. Ukraine did not announce its counterattack had begun, but Maliar posted a video on her Telegram channel on Sunday showing Ukrainian soldiers holding their fingers to their lips. Her caption read, “Plans love silence. There will be no announcement of the start.”  There were other signs of an imminent counterstrike. On Friday, The Washington Post reported Ukrainian armed forces were carving out corridors through their own minefields in the southern region of Zaporizhzhia to enable units to go on the offensive. And in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said “we are ready” for the counteroffensive. “We firmly believe that we will succeed. I don’t know how long this will take. To be honest, it could go in different ways, completely different. But we are going to do this,” Zelenskyy said. Asked what the counterattack would look like, US special forces commander Colonel Seth Krummrich told Al Jazeera, “I think you’ll get a spoiling attackor a distraction attack. And then you’ll get one or two major punches. “But I think we have to be careful not to oversell the counteroffensive. It is only 12 battalions. There’s only so much you can do with that. I think we’re going to see small to midsize gains.” Nine of Ukraine’s 12 mechanised battalions have been trained by NATO militaries and are expected to form the spearhead of the counterstrike.    An increase in sabotage operations may also have been a sign the counteroffensive was under way. The Russian Volunteer Corps, an anti-Putin Russian paramilitary group operating from Ukraine, said the “second phase” of its operations began on June 1. It posted footage apparently showing its fighters on the outskirts of Shebekino, a Russian town 6km (2.8 miles) from the Ukrainian border. It also claimed responsibility for a raid in Russia’s Belgorod region on May 24. The Freedom of Russia Legion published geolocated footage showing its soldiers striking Russian positions near Novaya Tavolzhanka, a settlement 3.5km (1.7 miles) from the Ukrainian border, also on June 1. Russia’s defence ministry claimed to have thwarted an “invasion”. Yevgeny Prigozhin, who heads Russia’s Wagner mercenary group and is famously critical of the Russian defence establishment, threatened his forces would “go to Belgorod” without permission if the military command did not “liberate” the region’s border areas from pro-Ukrainian groups. Ukrainian military intelligence spokesman Andriy Yusov indirectly claimed responsibility for drone attacks on the Moscow suburb of Ryubivka – where President Vladimir Putin lives – on May 30. Imagining civil unrest in Russia itself, he said, “We have to bomb and destroy the civilian houses of the Muscovites themselves with artillery. … It’s all happening live, live. The whole world is watching.” There were other smaller acts of sabotage. Ukraine may have shelled the Russian-held port of Berdyansk in Zaporizhzhia, according to the region’s occupation governor. Vladimir Rogov posted video on Telegram on Friday showing a plume of grey smoke rising from one of the port structures. That same day, a car bomb killed a Russian sympathiser in the town of Mykhailivka in the Zaporizhzhia region. Café owner Sergey Didovoduk had registered as a candidate for upcoming mayoral elections sponsored by the Russian occupation. Ivan Fedorov, the Ukrainian mayor-in-exile of the town, said he was a “supporter of the Kremlin”.    Russia responded to Ukraine’s counterattacks by intensifying its air attacksagainst the civilian population. Posted photographs suggested the headquarters of Ukraine’s military intelligence had been struck by several Iranian-madeShahed-136 dronesover several days in late May. Ukraine’s general staff said it destroyed all 10 Iskander ballistic missiles launched by Russian forces on June 1. Three days later, the general staff said its forces shot down four out of six Kh-101 and Kh-555 cruise missiles and six out of eight Shahed kamikaze drones. On Tuesday, Ukraine’s air force said it downed all 35 air-launched cruise missiles fired in the middle of the night. The Kh-101 and Kh-555 missiles were all headed for the capital, Kyiv, it said. Ukraine’s military intelligence said Russia is using up its most sophisticated missiles faster than it can replace them, but that seems to be changing. Maliar said Russia was transitioning its economy to a war footing and replenishing critical weapons. “They are now setting up production and, in fact, replenishing their stock of missiles. With that dynamic, they cannot replenish as much as they have already spent, but they replenish them,” Maliar said. The numbers appear to bear her out. Ukraine’s military said it destroyed 85 missiles and 169 drones over Kyiv in May – a record number. But biggest incident of the war in recent weeks came on Tuesday whenthe Nova Kakhovka hydroelectric damalong the Dnipro river, which Russian forces have occupied for a year, burst. Ukraine said occupation troops targeted the dam by placing explosives in its turbine room. “They blew up the internal structures of the Kakhov power plant,” Ukraine’s general staff said. About 60,000 people live in the flood zone and 3,000 havealready been evacuated. Maliar said Russia meant “to stop the process of de-occupation by the defence forces of Ukraine and shift the vector of public attention from the events taking placein the Belgorod region”. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov accused Ukraine fighters of sabotaging the dam because “Ukrainian armed forces are not achieving their goals” in large-scale offensive operations.  Zelenskyy said he received promises of F-16 jets from EU members meeting on the sidelines of the European Political Community summit. “I’ve already gotten some insight from some of our European partners about the number — it’s powerful. I am very happy with the information I have received from some states,” Zelenskyy said. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said a coalition comprising the Netherlands, Denmark, United Kingdom and Belgium would start training Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16s “as soon as possible”. German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said his country would decide whether to send UkraineF-16 fighter jetswithin two weeks. “We are just in the phase of reconsidering and checking what is possible and what we want and can do,” Deutsche Welle quoted Pistorius as saying. The Australian Financial Review said Australia was in talks with the United States about sending 41 Royal Australian Air Force F/A-18 Hornets to Ukraine following US approval. An announcement could come as early as July when Australia will unveil another military aid package for Ukraine, according to Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksiy Reznikov. Ukraine has said at least six months of pilot training is necessary, so F-16s will not play a role in the current counterattack, suggesting more heavy ground fighting lies ahead. US National Security Adviser Jake SullivantoldCNN’s Fareed Zakaria: “We do believe this counteroffensive will allow Ukraine to take strategically significant territory back,” but he did not suggest it would be a final blow to Russia. “We have a few more years of this,” Krummrich, now vice president at Global Guardian, a security consultancy, agreed. “All Ukraine has to do is keep the pressure on,” he said. “Don’t try tograb Crimea tomorrow. This Russian offensive will collapse under its own weight. It’s unsustainable.”   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/7/ukraine-ramps-up-operations-as-dam-destruction-blame-game-unfolds
‘It’s a nightmare’: Ukrainians decry the Kakhovka dam blast,Fears of a humanitarian catastrophe rise as Ukrainian and Russia-backed authorities race to evacuate locals amid war.,"Already at risk of the threat of an escalating war, Ukrainians in the south on either side of the Dnipro river are now facing flooded villages, homelessness and exposure to infections after a huge dam collapse. TheNova Kakhovka damblast on Tuesday caused widespread flooding. More than 30,000 cubic metres of water are reportedly gushing out of the reservoir every second. With humanitarian and ecological disasters still unfolding, it is already clear that tens of thousands of people have been deprived of drinking water, many are homeless, crops are ruined, land mines have been displaced, and the stage is set for long-term electricity shortages. Evacuation efforts are under way – about 3,000 have fled so far – amid a sense of despair as people try to wade through the rising floodwaters to safer locations. “If the water rises for another metre [3.3 feet], we will lose our house,” said Oleksandr Reva said, who was moving family belongings into the abandoned home of a neighbour on higher ground. “Our local school and stadium downtown were flooded. The stadium was completely underwater, and the floodwaters were reaching the school,” Lidia Zubova, another resident of the Kherson region, told Al Jazeera. About 60,000 people are at risk from flooding in Russian and Ukrainian-controlled areas along the Dniproafter the damwas destroyed. The dam and reservoir – essential for fresh water and irrigation for a huge area of southern Ukraine – lies in the Kherson region that Moscow illegally annexed in September and has occupied for the past year. The reservoir is also critical for water supplies to the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014.  Reva, who lives in Ukrainian-controlled territory, blamed Russia. “They hate us. They want to destroy a Ukrainian nation and Ukraine itself. And they don’t care by what means because nothing is sacred for them.” Inga, an evacuee who reached the capital Kyiv, told the Save the Children charity: “At around 7am [on Tuesday], our neighbours knocked at our door and told us to collect our belongings, evacuate, because the Kakhovka dam had been destroyed. “We were in a panic. We didn’t know what to do, what to grab and where to run. All people have been leaving en masse wherever they can. We want to return to our apartment – if there will be anywhere to return to.” Ukrainian officials accused Russian forces of a targeted attack. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stressed the evacuation of people and animals “is a priority” despite the difficulties of evacuating people amid Russian shelling. Ukraine’s defence ministry shared a video on Twitter of what appears to be rescue workers using drones to drop supplies to people trapped by flooding.

Russian President Vladimir Putin called the dam’s destruction an “environmental and humanitarian catastrophe”. He accused Ukraine of destroying it at the suggestion of the West in what he called a “barbaric” war crime that escalated the conflict with Moscow. The Russian-installed governor of the occupied areas of Kherson, Vladimir Saldo, said disinfectant procedures will begin in its flooded territories in the coming days to prevent the spread of disease. As the warring sides continue rescue efforts and trade blame, UN aid chief Martin Griffiths told the Security Council the “sheer magnitude of the catastrophe will only be realised in the coming days”. With the dam collapsed, some of the 18-cubic-kilometres (4.3 cubic miles) of water held in the reservoir is now flooding a swathe of southern Ukraine, including areas controlled by Russian forces. “It’s a nightmare,” said a woman who gave her name only as Tetyana, as she tried to climb onto a dry spot to rescue her dogs and belongings.

Nova Kakhovka dam blast: Is Russia trying to freeze the war?,"Russia could have blown up the dam in an effort to stall Ukraine’s counteroffensive, experts say.","Kyiv, Ukraine– Lilya Pshenichnaya’s old apartment building in Kherson has not been flooded. It stands high above the right bank of the Dnipro river in the administrative centre of the eponymous southern Ukrainian region that was occupied by Russia days after the war began more than a year ago. Russian forces withdrew from the city in November, but still control the river’s lower, left bank, which has been flooded after the giant Nova Kakhovka dam collapsed early on Tuesday. “There’s nothing but trouble, everything is flooded, villages and forests,” Pshenichnaya told Al Jazeera from the safety of Odesa, a Black Sea port 200km (124 miles) west of Kherson, where she relocated after months inRussian captivity. Some low-lying parts of her hometown are also underwater, but evacuation efforts are thwarted by Russian bombing from the left bank – as landmines planted by retreating Russians months ago float up. “Our guys move around on boats, but they are being bombed, mines pop up, all the mined areas are spontaneously being blown up,” Pshenichnaya said. Moscow and Kyiv have accused each other of destroying the dam, which held together Ukraine’s largest water reservoir and provided water to millions. The dam was “blasted from within”, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Tuesday. He called the dam’s collapse in the Russia-controlled part of the Kherson region an “environmental bomb of mass destruction”. Moscow claimed the destruction was a “pre-planned diversion of the Ukrainian side”. On Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin cast the alleged attack as a “barbaric” act. Germany has blamed Russia for blowing up the dam, unlike the United States and United Kingdom, which are said to be investigating the incident. As water contaminated by oil and industrial chemicals floods downstream communities, a question looms: If Russia was responsible, would such a disaster benefit the Kremlin? “The Kremlin’s logic is to demand a truce, among other things – either to save people on the left bank, or for nuclear blackmail,” Igar Tyshkevich, a Kyiv-based analyst, told Al Jazeera. The dam ensured water supply to the cooling ponds of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe’s largest, some 150km (93 miles) northeast. Russian servicemen seized the station more than a year ago, and Moscow often claims that Kyiv is shelling it – risking a new, much larger Chernobyl-like episode that could poison much of Eastern Europe with radiation. And amid Moscow’s faltering war effort, Putin desperately needs time to have more men mobilised and trained and more arms manufactured. “For Putin, a freeze of any shape or size is utterly important,” Tyshkevich said. The dam disaster has taken place in the south, an area where Ukrainian troops are expected to focus counterattacks, a military analyst said. The road above the dam – damaged by shelling but still passable – served as the only way of transporting Ukrainian troops and weaponry across the Dnipro, one of Europe’s largest and widest rivers. “From the viewpoint of planning military operations, everything looked logical,” Nikolay Mitrokhin of Germany’s Bremen University told Al Jazeera. Ukraine was aiming to regain control of the dam to begin moving armoured vehicles and heavy weaponry to the left bank – but now, floodwaters will make soil swampy for weeks to come. “Without armoured vehicles, Ukrainian forces will lose their main trump card – mobility in a deep breakthrough,” Mitrokhin said. So, by blowing up the dam, Russian forces secured their southern flank and can now concentrate on repelling Ukraine’s offensive in the Zaporizhia region, he said. “From the military viewpoint, it’s pretty smart and thwarts all the plans of Ukraine’s top brass,” he said. “Unsurprisingly, Ukraine took a time out in the offensive.” Seven decades ago, the emergence of the Nova Kakhovka dam and a sea of fresh water behind it was hailed as a “great construction project of Communism”. It inspired “A Poem of the Sea”, the last project by pioneering Ukrainian filmmaker Alexander Dovzhenko, whose works are studied in film schools worldwide. The dam elevated the Dnipro water by 16m (52 feet) – and made possible its redirection to the arid Crimean Peninsula, triggering the growth of urban centres and irrigated agriculture. Three more canals from the reservoir turned the steppes of southern Ukraine into the USSR’s breadbasket and were deep enough for an entire fleet of cargo ships. To ease the administrative and logistical hurdles of the gargantuan project, Communist Moscow decided to make Crimea part of Soviet Ukraine in a step that seemed purely bureaucratic at the time. But in 2014, Putin lambasted the decision as he announced the Black Sea peninsula’s annexation. In response, Ukraine cut off the Crimean canal, annihilating agriculture and complicating the lives of more than 2 million permanent residents and many more Russian tourists flocking to Crimea’s beaches and mountains. On February 25, 2022, the second day of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Moscowgained control of the damand promptly restored the canal. The dam’s collapse will bleed the canal dry – even though Crimea’s Moscow-appointed “head” Sergey Aksyonov claims “there’s more than enough drinking water” accumulated in several reservoirs. The long-term consequences for Ukraine’s agriculture and economy are going to be devastating. The dam’s destruction will lead to a “colossal water crisis in the south”, Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kushch told Al Jazeera. Farmland in the Zaporizhia and Kherson regions will turn back to desert, and Ukraine’s entire agriculture output will fall by some 15 percent, he predicted. Up to one million people will be left without drinking water, he said. Western pundits agree. United Nations aid chief Martin Griffiths said the dam’s collapse is possibly the “most significant incident of damage to civilian infrastructure” since the war began in February 2022.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/7/how-will-ukrainian-dams-collapse-benefit-russia
Ukraine says Nova Kakhovka dam blast will not stop military plans,Ukrainian president Zelenskyy called the destruction of the Kakhovka dam an act of ‘mass environmental destruction’ by Russia.,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called thecollapse of the Kakhovka damin southern Ukraine an act of “mass environmental destruction” and said the attack on such critical infrastructure would not alter Ukraine’s plans to retake territory from occupying Russian forces. Describing the explosion that destroyed the dam as a deliberate and chaotic act by Russia, Zelenskyy said on Tuesday that the dam was blown up in a bid to “use the flood as a weapon” to hamper Ukrainian forces. In his nightly address to the nation, Zelenskyy said Moscow was resigned to losing control of Russian-annexed Crimea and, therefore, haddestroyed the region’s water supply. “The fact that Russia deliberately destroyed the Kakhovka reservoir, which is critically important, in particular, for providing water to Crimea, indicates that the Russian occupiers have already realised that they will have to flee Crimea as well,” he said. “We will still liberate all our land,”Zelenskyy said,adding that the blowing up of the dam would not avert a Russian defeat but would add to the post-war reparation costs that Moscow will have to pay to Ukraine one day. The Kremlin blamed Ukraine for the dam’s collapse on Tuesday, saying Kyiv had destroyed the site to distract from the faltering launch of its counteroffensive that Moscow had already blunted.    Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said his forces had thwarted the first three days of Ukraine’s counteroffensive in battles that had left thousands of Ukrainian soldiers dead or wounded. The decision to destroy the dam was to slow the attacking Russian forces, he said. Neither Moscow nor Kyiv provided evidence for their claims regarding the dam’s destruction. The dam’s collapse presents a new humanitarian disaster in the centre of a war zone and as Ukraine prepares for its long-awaited counteroffensive. Al Jazeera’s Charles Stratford, reporting from the dam’s reservoir in Ukraine’s Zaporizhia region, said that before its destruction, the dam had provided electricity and drinking water for hundreds of thousands of people in Ukraine. “The locals that we’ve spoken to here say … that the water level today has dropped anywhere between a metre and two metres, and we expect in the coming hours and days for the level to continue dropping and on that basis, one can only imagine the kind of devastating effect that it is having on affected areas south of the dam,” Stratford said. Ihor Syrota, head of Ukraine’s hydroelectric power authority, told the United States-funded radio station Donbas Realii that flooding had caused waters to rise by 3.5 meters (11.5 feet) and that Ukrainian officials believe the flood waters would crest on Wednesday, then levels would begin to fall within three to four days.    The flooding has already submerged villages and towns around the city of Kherson and Russian officials warned that the main canal supplying water to the Russian-annexed Crimea peninsula is receiving drastically less water. Ukrainian authorities said 17,000 people were being evacuated from Ukrainian-held territory and a total of 24 villages had been flooded. “Over 40,000 people are in danger of being flooded,” Ukraine’s Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin said, adding that 25,000 more people should be evacuated in the most critical areas at risk on the Russian-occupied side of the Dnipro River. Vladimir Leontyev, the Moscow-installed mayor of Nova Kakhovka where the dam is located, said the city was underwater and hundreds of people had been evacuated. The United Nations said at least 16,000 people havealready lost their homesand that efforts were under way to provide clean water, money, and legal and emotional support to those affected. People on the Ukrainian-controlled side of the river were being evacuated by ferries to cities including Mykolaiv and Odesa to the west. UN Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Martin Griffiths told the Security Council on Tuesday that the full “magnitude of the catastrophe” will only become fully realised in the coming days. The damage caused by the Kakhovka dam destruction in#Ukrainemeans that life will become intolerably harder for those already suffering from the conflict. Our urgent humanitarian task is to continue to help them to survive, be safe and get a future. My remarks at the#UNSC: — Martin Griffiths (@UNReliefChief)June 6, 2023  “But it is already clear that it will have grave and far-reaching consequences for thousands of people in southern Ukraine – on both sides of the front line – through the loss of homes, food, safe water and livelihoods,” Griffiths said. Russia and Ukrainetraded blame for the disasterat an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council on Tuesday. James Bays, Al Jazeera’s diplomatic editor reporting from the UN’s headquarters in New York, said the Russian and Ukrainian ambassadors at the council meeting gave “completely different accounts of what’s happened” to the dam. The Russian ambassador made the point that there had been previous threats to the dam by Ukraine, Bays said, and Ukraine made the point that the dam was situated in territory controlled by Russian forces and that only mining the dam could have destroyed it, not an attack from afar. “Those are the clear positions of the two sides and really what you need is someone to properly investigate which of these two completely different stories is true. I don’t think that is very likely to happen anytime soon,” Bays said, noting that the dam remains a military front line.    Ukraine’s interior minister said on Tuesday that Russia was shelling areas from where people were being evacuated from the dam’s flood waters and that two police officers had been wounded. Ben Barry, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said flooding from the dam would be to Moscow’s advantage in the short term. “Bearing in mind Russia is on the strategic defensive and Ukraine on the strategic offensive, in the short term it’s an advantage to Russia, definitely,” Barry said. “It’ll help the Russians until the water subsides because it makes it more difficult for Ukraine to do assault river crossings,” he said. Flood water inundating the region will also prevent the use of heavy weaponry such as tanks for at least a month, said Maciej Matysiak, a security expert at the Stratpoints Foundation and ex-deputy chief of Polish military counter-intelligence. “(This) creates a very good defending position for Russians who expect Ukrainian offensive activity,” Matysiak said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/7/ukraines-zelenskyy-says-dam-blast-will-not-stop-military-plans

Oliver Stone: How he stopped worrying and learned to love nuclear,Film director says risk of nuclear contamination from Ukraine war is less threatening to the planet than fossil fuels.,"Hollywood director Oliver Stone believesnuclear poweris safe. Period. Full stop. And the war in Ukraine hasn’t changed his thinking. At a time when most scientists agree we need to drastically cut our fossil fuel use to avoid permanently damaging our ecosystems, he is all in. We need nuclear, Stone says. Nuclear Now. Nuclear Now is the name of his latest documentary. In it, he makes the case that the deadliest nuclear disaster – at theChernobyl power plantin 1986 in Ukraine when it was part of the Soviet Union – pales in comparison to the harms done by fossil fuels to human health and the environment on a daily basis. He argues, based on research first published in the book A Bright Future, that nuclear power is crucial to satisfying modern energy demands while reducing carbon emissions. “Russia had the biggest accident,” Stone said recently, referring to Chernobyl in an online briefing with the US Foreign Press Association. “America didn’t really have accidents. They have hysteria. We feel that hysteria led to the closing-down of the industry.” Yes, there was a partial meltdown of the reactor atThree Mile Islandin Pennsylvania that raised concerns in 1979, but his film blames Hollywood and the fossil fuel industry for fanning overblown fears of nuclear power. Movies like Silkwood and the China Syndrome raised the spectre of a doomsday scenario while Dr Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb highlighted the risks posed by unstable leaders with nuclear weapons. The Rockefeller Foundation, supported by oil money, promoted studies warning of the dangers of radioactivity, neglecting to mention that it occurs naturally in our environment, Stone’s film contends. Countries that include the United States, Germany and Japan have been backing away fromnuclear powerever since. France and Sweden, on the other hand, have invested in nuclear power – and Russia, Stone argues, has become an industry leader, exporting its power and its technology. Stone lamented that thewar in Ukraineand rising tensions between the US and Russia could further hinder the advancement of nuclear power and the fight against climate change. The same week he addressed the association of foreign correspondents in the US, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) appeared before theUnited Nations Security Council, warning of risks the war poses to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Enerhodar, Ukraine. The largest nuclear power plant in Europewas seized by Russia shortly after it invaded the country. Ukrainian staff continue to run the facility in what has been described as a tense situation. Amid signs that a much anticipated Ukrainian offensive is about to begin, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi described an increasingly dangerous and unpredictable situation at the plant. He called on both sides to agree to safety protocols – not shooting at or firing from the site, not storing weapons or troops there – to prevent a radiation leak at the facility. The plant’s six reactors have been in cold shutdown since September, but there are still tens of thousands of kilogrammes of radioactive material at the site, which relies on an external power source to keep them from overheating although there are onsite generators for use in emergencies.    Stone dismissed the concerns as overhyped, noting that the 2011 breach of Japan’sFukushimanuclear power plant did not kill anyone, but the earthquake and tsunami that caused it resulted in 18,000 deaths. Isuru Seneviratne, executive director of Nuclear New York a nuclear advocacy group, said chemical plants pose even greater risks to civilians.  “If Putin wanted to kill a large number of Ukrainians by attacking an industrial site, there are many to choose from,” Seneviratne pointed out in the briefing. “In fact, 14,000 people have already died in the Ukraine war. America’s nuclear industry rarely ever kills anybody, war most always does.” Stone acknowledged the Soviet Union initially lied about theChernobylaccident, which killed 50 people and released 400 times more radiation than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. But he criticized Germany’s call for the European Union to sanction Russian nuclear power as “stupid” and counterproductive, given the climate emergency, as well as Germany’sdecisionto shutter all of its nuclear plants. “Their economy is in the s***,” Stone said. “It’s dropped. The economy has fallen off completely, and it will fall further.” If anything, Stone believes the West should be looking to partner with Russia and China on nuclear power as a way to remove climate-warming carbon dioxide from the atmosphere before it is too late. He himself has worked in Russia. He had access to Chernobyl and Russian nuclear officials for the filming of Nuclear Now. In 2017, he interviewed President Vladimir Putin about American dissident-in-exile Edward Snowden, about whom he made a thriller. “You’ve got to hear the other side,”Stoneinsisted. “You can’t just jump to conclusions spawned by the Western press.” The idea that Russia and the US – much less Ukraine – could work constructively together on anything may sound idealistic and far from today’s reality, but Nuclear Now highlights a time when US leaders advocated a similar approach. It shows US President Dwight D Eisenhower giving his 1953 Atoms for Peace speech to the United Nations, which led to the creation ofthe IAEA. “It is not enough to take this weapon out of the hands of the soldiers,” Eisenhower said at the time. “It must be put into the hands of those who will know how to strip its military casing and adapt it to the arts of peace.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/6/oliver-stone-how-he-stopped-worrying-and-learned-to-love-nuclear
"French Open: ‘I don’t support war,’ Belarusian Sabalenka says","Sabalenka says she does not support President Alexander Lukashenko ‘right now’ after win over Ukraine’s Elina Svitolina, who refused to shake her hands.","World tennis number two Belarusian Aryna Sabalenka has said she does not support thewar in Ukraineand the stance of her country’s president on it, as she resumed her media duties at the French Open. Belarus is aclose allyof Russia that allowed Moscow’s forces to use its territory as a launching pad for the February 2022 invasion. After winning her quarterfinal (6-4, 6-4) in Paris against Ukraine’s Elina Svitolina on Tuesday, Sabalenka told reporters she is “not an expert in politics” in response to being questioned about the war. “I don’t want my country to be in any conflict; I don’t support the war,” Sabalenka said at the news conference. “I don’t support war, meaning I don’t support [Belarusian President] Alexander Lukashenko right now.” Sabalenka had not attended her two previous news conferences following her third and fourth round matches last week, citing mental health reasons and saying she did not feel safe after being grilled about the invasion. “I really felt bad not coming here. I couldn’t sleep. Like all those bad feelings was in my head, I couldn’t fall asleep,” Sabalenka explained, although she said she did not regret opting out of her media duties. “I don’t regret the decisions. I felt really disrespected, and I felt really bad. I mean, Grand Slam, it’s enough pressure to handle, and I just tried to focus on myself, on my game,” added the 25-year-old, who could clinch the women’s world number one spot at the French Open. “I really hope that you guys will understand me, my feelings. You know that I really respect all of you … You can ask whatever you want. You will get all the information. “But in the last press conference, I felt like my press conference became a political TV show, and I’m not expert in politics. I’m just a tennis player.” Earlier, Sabalenka was criticised by Svitolina for approaching the net in expectation of a post-match handshake that the Ukrainian had already insisted she was not going to offer. Ukrainian players typically refuse to shake hands with Russian and Belarusian rivals in protest at the war. As expected, Svitolina ignored Sabalenka, who was leaning on the net before calmly walking back to her chair. When asked if Sabalenka had inflamed the situation by standing at the net, Svitolina replied: “Yeah, I think so, unfortunately.” “I don’t know why she was waiting, because my statements were clear enough about the handshake,” she said. The 28-year-old Svitolina, however, was jeered by a Paris crowd who had taken her to their hearts following her marriage to French player Gael Monfils. “I was expecting that. Whoever in this situation loses, I guess, gets booed, so I was expecting that. It was not a surprise for me,” Svitolina said. Sabalenka had defeated another Ukrainian, Marta Kostyuk, in the first round. Kostyuk also refused to shake hands and she too was booed. “Maybe she’s [Sabalenka] not on social media during the tournament, but it is pretty clear. She played Marta as well the first round. So is quite simple,” Svitolina said. The Ukrainian added she and her compatriots will continue their stance. “I won’t sell my country for the likes of people,” she said. To win this war, we Ukrainians remain UNITED. On the battlefield and on the tennis court 🇺🇦✊🏼https://t.co/xH1GIMySWb — Elina Monfils (@ElinaSvitolina)June 2, 2023  Svitolina said Sabalenka should also be fined for refusing to attend the mandatory news conferences after her previous two matches. Two years ago, former world number one Naomi Osaka wasfined$15,000 for not honouring her French Open media commitments. “It should be equal for everyone. For example, Naomi got fined last time and this time there is no fine for the player, who also skips the press conference,” said Svitolina. “I faced difficulties, I faced difficulty also with the question about Novak [Djokovic], about his statement about Kosovo. So I’m not escaping.” Last week, Serbian tennis playerNovak Djokovicsparkeda controversy at the tournament after a gesture on therecent flare-upbetween Serbia and Kosovo. “Kosovo is the heart of Serbia. Stop the violence,” the world number three and winner of 22 Grand Slam titles wrote on a camera lens in Serbian, following his first-round victory against Aleksandar Kovacevic, from the United States.

Hundreds flee floods in Ukraine after Nova Kakhovka dam breached,"Thousands more villagers to be evacuated after towns flooded following damage to the Nova Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine, local authorities say.","Hundreds of people have been evacuated from settlements along the southern stretch of Ukraine’s Dnipro River afterwater burstthrough the breached Nova Kakhovka dam, submerging streets and town squares. The collapse of the structure at the southern tip of the vast Kakhovka Reservoir on Tuesday unleashed a torrent of water, adding to the misery of thousands of people who have been caught on the front lines of Russia’s war in Ukraine. Kyiv accused Russian forces of blowing up the dam and hydroelectric power station in an area of southern Ukraine that Moscow has controlled for more than a year while Russian officials blamed Ukrainian bombardment. It was not possible to verify the claims. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the dam breach is the “biggest man-made environmental disaster in Europe in decades”. “It is physically impossible to blow it up somehow from the outside with shelling,” he said in a video address to a summit of European countries in the Bucharest Nine group. “It was mined. It was mined by the Russian occupiers and blown up by them.” Footage posted on social media shows severe flooding in the Russian-controlled town of Nova Kakhovka, which is next to the dam. Its Russian-installed mayor, Vladimir Leontyev, said water levels had risen to more than 11 metres (36 feet) and some residents had been taken to hospital, Russia’s TASS news agency reported. He said 900 people had been evacuated. Leontyev added that 53 evacuation buses were being sent to take people from Nova Kakhovka and two nearby settlements to safety. “We are organising temporary accommodation centres with hot meals,” he said. Journalist Yulia Shapovalova said from Moscow that the machine room of the Kakhovka power station was “under water”. “We’re getting pictures of entire houses floating down the Dnipro River,” she said. According to Shapovalova, Russian authorities said the partial destruction of the dam has led to flooding and the “washing-away of entire agricultural fields” along the river.  The Russian-installed administration in the partially occupied Kherson region said it was preparing to evacuate three districts – Nova Kakhovka, Golo Pristan and Oleshky. The latter two lie across the mouth of the Dnipro River from the Ukrainian-held regional capital, also called Kherson. Water levels there had already risen by more than a metre (3.3 feet), residents said, and were expected to rise further. “The water flow in the Dnipro River and its tributaries is very powerful,” Kherson resident Oleksandr Syomyk said as he stood beside the swollen river. “The water level rose by one metre. We’ll see what happens next, but we hope for the best.” Ukrainian police released a video showing an officer carrying an elderly woman to safety and residents wading through knee-deep water in the Kherson region. Ukraine’s prosecutor general said thousands of people were being evacuated from flooded areas. “Over 40,000 people are in danger of being flooded. Ukrainian authorities are evacuating over 17,000 people,” Andriy Kostin said on social media, adding that 25,000 more people should be evacuated on the Russian-occupied side of the Dnipro River. Oleksandr Tolokonnikov, a senior official in Ukraine’s Kherson military administration, warned that worse was to come. “Tomorrow there will be a peak [of flooding]. Then there will be a decline,” he told an online media briefing earlier on Tuesday. “We already evacuated about 1,000 people. We have about 50 buses shuttling between Kherson and the affected villages. In Kherson, we have four evacuation sites prepared.” Ukraine’s interior ministry said 24 villages have flooded. “I was evacuated from the flooded village of Antonivka. Our local school and stadium downtown were flooded. … The road was completely flooded. Our bus got stuck,” Lidia Zubova, 67, told the Reuters news agency as she waited for a train to leave Kherson. The World Data Center for Geoinformatics and Sustainable Development, a Ukrainian nongovernmental organisation, estimated that nearly 100 villages and towns would be flooded and the water level would start dropping only after five to seven days. Both sides warned of a looming environmental disaster. Ukraine’s Presidential Office said about 150 tonnes of oil escaped from the dam machinery and that another 300 tonnes could still leak out. “The human and environmental cost of the destruction of the Kakhovka dam is a huge humanitarian disaster,” said Marie Struthers, Amnesty’s Eastern Europe and Central Asia director. “The destruction of the Kakhovka dam is a catastrophe that endangers the life, safety and well-being of tens if not hundreds of thousands of people living within range of the flood waters,” she said. “There must be a prompt, independent and impartial investigation into the destruction of the Kakhova dam.” The dam supplies water to farmland in southern Ukraine and the Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula. It also cools the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. The UN nuclear watchdog said Europe’s largest nuclear power plant should have enough water to cool its reactors for “some months” from a separate pond even as the reservoir drains out. It called for the pond to be spared. Damage to the dam creates a new humanitarian disaster just as Ukraine is unleashing a long-awaited counteroffensive to drive Russian troops from its territory. The Geneva Water Hub, a water research and policy institute, said it was “deeply concerned”. “The devastating consequences for civilians are likely to reverberate long after the flooding has stopped,” it said in a statement.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/6/hundreds-flee-floods-ukraine-after-nova-kakhovka-dam-destroyed
All to know about Ukraine’s Nova Kakhovka dam explosion,Widespread flooding is expected across swaths of southeastern Ukraine after a large dam was destroyed.,"A dam and hydroelectric power plant in a Russian-controlled part of southern Ukrainehave been destroyed, unleashing a torrent of water and prompting fears of wide-scale flooding in the area downstream on the Dnipro river. Ukrainian and Russian officials have urged local communities near the Nova Kakhovka dam to evacuate the area immediately. It is unclear what exactly destroyed the dam early on Tuesday, but from the images being broadcast from the scene, it appears that an explosion blew up a large part of the structure. Videos showed the buildings around the entrance of the dam being heavily damaged, while a large body of water was seen gushing through a hole in the structure. Ukrainian and Russian officials have accused each other of blowing up the dam, although conflicting reports have emerged from Moscow-installed officials. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused “Russian terrorists” of destroying the dam and said the outrage “confirms for the whole world that they must be expelled from every corner of Ukrainian land”. “Not a single meter should be left to them, because they use every meter for terror,” he wrote in a tweet. “The terrorists will not be able to stop Ukraine with water, missiles or anything else,” he said. Andriy Yermak, head of Zelenskyy’s office, also labelled the alleged act “ecocide“. The world must see and react to the consequences of Russian terrorism against civilian population of Ukraine, as well as ecocide.pic.twitter.com/PKBtLVXuwc — Andriy Yermak (@AndriyYermak)June 6, 2023  Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu accused Ukraine of blowing up the dam as part of a plan to redeploy units from the nearby Kherson region. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters said the incident was “deliberate sabotage by the Ukrainian side.” “Apparently, this sabotage is also connected with the fact that having started large-scale offensive actions two days ago, now the Ukrainian armed forces are not achieving their goals, these offensive actions are faltering,” he added.  Meanwhile, a Moscow-installed official in Nova Kakhovka, Vladimir Leontev, told Russian state television that the damage to the dam was the result of a series of Ukrainian attacks. However, Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-installed official in Zaporizhzhia, said the dam collapsed due to earlier damage and the pressure of the water. The dam is located in Russian-controlled territory near the major city of Kherson. Russian forces captured Kherson in March 2022, but a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive retook the city in November 2022, as Russian troops retreated to the southern bank of the Dnipro river. Russia still controls most of the territory on the southern banks downstream from the dam, while Ukraine controls the territories to the north of the river. The dam, 30 metres (98 feet) tall and 3.2km (2 miles) long, was built in 1956 on the Dnipro river as part of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. It supplies water to large swaths of southeastern Ukraine, as well as the Russian-annexed Crimean peninsula. The dam’s reservoir also provided water used for the essential cooling of the six reactors at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), the largest such facility in Europe, as well as for spent fuel and emergency diesel generators that have had to be used repeatedly when external power fails.    Both sides have made statements to quell fears that the plant is at risk. Ukraine’s state nuclear power agency, Energoatom, said although the recent events posed a risk to the plant, the situation was “under control”. For its part, Russia’s state nuclear energy company Rosatom said there was no threat to the ZNPP.

A main one is the large cooling pond next to the site that by design is kept above the height of the reservoir,” he said in a statement. River banks are already flooding as water pours over through the destroyed dam structure. The exact ecological consequences are yet to be clearly identified, but Ukrainian officials have warned they could be serious. Yermak wrote, “The Russians will be responsible for the possible deprivation of drinking water for people in the south of Kherson region and in Crimea, the possible destruction of some settlements and the biosphere.” Ukraine’s presidential office said in astatementthat “at least 150 tons of motor oil got into the Dnipro River, and there is a risk of further leakage of more than 300 tons”. The Russian-backed governor of Crimea said on Tuesday that there is a risk that water levels in the North Crimean canal, which carries fresh water to the peninsula from the Dnipro river, could fall as a consequence of the dam’s destruction. The Crimean peninsula is dependent on fresh water from the canal. Ukraine previously blocked water supplies to Crimea after Russia annexed the peninsula in 2014, causing water shortages in the region.

This shows that this is a new dimension,” Scholz said at a townhall organised by broadcaster RTL. He tweeted: “The destruction of the Kakhovka dam with the terrible consequences shows a new dimension. It fits with the way Russia is relentlessly waging war and fits in with the many crimes in Ukraine.

‘Wild fantasies’: Wagner boss tears into Russian success claims,Yevgeny Prigozhin scoffs at Russian defence ministry claim that its military inflicted heavy losses on Ukrainian forces.,"Yevgeny Prigozhin, the boss of the mercenary Wagner Group, has poured scorn on Russia’s defence ministry after it claimed it thwarted a “large-scale” offensive by Ukraine inflicting heavy losses. Prigozhin, whose forces spent months fighting in the eastern Ukrainian town of Bakhmut and who is afrequent criticof Russia’s military top brass, dismissed their latest claims as “wild fantasies” on his Telegram channel on Tuesday morning. Russia’s defence ministry said on Monday that its forces had repelled a major Ukraine offensive in the southern part of the Donetsk region, destroying military equipment and killing some 1,500 Ukrainian troops. There was no immediate comment from Kyiv about Russia’s assertions and it was not possible to verify the claims. Both countries have often made claims of inflicting heavy human losses on each other that could not be independently verified. “To destroy one and a half thousand people, it must be such a massacre, within one day, over 150 kilometres [90 miles], one hell of a massacre,” Prigozhin said in response to the claims. “Therefore, I think that these are just some wild fantasies.” Adding up the figures provided by the ministry would imply “we have already destroyed the entire planet five times over”, he added sarcastically. Prigozhinhas been embroiled in an increasingly public spat with Russia’s regular army, unleashing often foul-mouthed video tirades in which he has vehemently criticised Moscow’s military leadership. Wagner troops led the months-long assault on the now-ruined Bakhmut,claiming controlof the town last month.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/6/wild-fantasies-wagner-boss-tears-into-russian-success-claims
"Ukraine, Russia trade blame for destruction of Nova Kakhovka dam",Authorities are evacuating residents in several areas following the destruction of large Soviet-era dam.,"Kyiv has accused Russian forces of blowing up a large dam in southern Ukraine, while the Moscow-installed official in the city of Nova Kakhovka in the Russian-controlled portion of the Kherson region blamed the structure’s destruction on Ukrainian shelling. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused “Russian terrorists” ofdestroying the dam early on Tuesdayand said the outrage “confirms for the whole world that they must be expelled from every corner of Ukrainian land”. “Not a single meter should be left to them, because they use every meter for terror,” said Zelenskyy, who called an emergency meeting of the country’s national security council. “The terrorists will not be able to stop Ukraine with water, missiles or anything else,” he wrote on Twitter. But the Kremlin accused Kyiv of sabotaging the dam to distract attention from a purportedly faltering counteroffensive against Russian forces. “We can state unequivocally that we are talking about deliberate sabotage by the Ukrainian side,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. He added that Ukraine was also aiming to deprive Russian-annexed Crimea of the freshwater it receives from the reservoir via the North Crimean Canal. Commenting on allegations that Russia was responsible for the blast, Peskov said: “We can strongly reject this. We officially declare that here we are definitely talking about deliberate sabotage from the Ukrainian side.” The dam, 30 metres (some 98 feet) tall and 3.2km (2 miles) long, was built in 1956 on the Dnipro River as part of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Plant. The southern command of Ukrainian armed forces said the “scale of the destruction” was being assessed as Ukraine’s military administration for the Kherson region called on people to be ready to evacuate from villages on the right bank of theDnipro River before expected flooding. “The water level is rising and everyone who is in the danger zone must: Turn off all electrical appliances; take documents and essentials; take care of loved ones and pets; follow the instructions of rescuers and policemen,” the Kherson administration said on its Telegram channel. “About 16,000 people are in the critical zone on the right bank of the Kherson region,” said Oleksandr Prokudin, head of the Kherson military administration, adding that there was already flooding in eight areas along the Dnipro River. Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the Ukrainian presidential office, accused Russia of destroying the dam in “a panic” in order to slow down the Ukrainian counteroffensive, saying the consequences of Russia’s actions were “already catastrophic”. “On a vast territory, all life will be destroyed; many settlements will be ruined; colossal damage will be done to the environment,” he said. The office of the prosecutor general said Ukraine was investigating the incident as a possible war crime and as possible criminal environmental destruction, or “ecocide”. But RIA Novosti news agency quoted the Moscow-installed mayor of Nova Kakhovka, Vladimir Leontiev, as saying the dam had been hit by shelling which he blamed on Ukraine. “There were several hits” on the dam, he said, according to the Russian news agency. “This crime cannot be written off. This is a terrorist act directed against civilians, Ukrainians did it,” he said. Al Jazeera’s Charles Stratford, reporting from Kyiv, said analysts had long seen the dam as a potential target for both sides in the war. The dam is vital for water supply and irrigation in Russian-occupied Crimea, while Russia could see its destruction as a way of making it more difficult for Ukrainian forces to cross the Dnipro River and enter Crimea in a ground offensive, Stratford said, adding that the evacuation of settlements in the area had already begun. “We are also hearing from the Ukrainians that they believe … water levels will reach a critical point around five hours from now. We also know there are ongoing evacuations from some of the settlements that are going to be affected,” he said. The Soviet-era dam in the Russian-controlled part of the Kherson region could unleash a flood across the war zone, according to Ukrainian and Russian forces. Unverified videos on social media showed a series of intense explosions around the dam. Other videos showed water surging through its remains with bystanders expressing their shock, sometimes in strong language. Ukraine controls five of the six dams along the Dnipro, which runs from the country’s northern border with Belarus down to the Black Sea and is crucial for the entire country’s drinking water and power supply. The Nova Kakhovka dam – the one furthest downstream – is controlled by Russian forces and contains an 18-cubic-kilometre (4.3-cubic-mile) reservoir which supplies water to the Crimean Peninsula, which was annexed by Russia in 2014, and to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which is also under Russian control. Ukraine’s nuclear operator Energoatom said in a Telegram statement that the blowing up of the dam “could have negative consequences for the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant”, but the situation is “controllable” at the moment. The United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency wrote on Twitter that its experts were closely monitoring the situation at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant upstream, and there was “no immediate nuclear safety risk” at the facility. The IAEA is aware of reports of damage at#Ukraine’s Kakhovka dam; IAEA experts at#ZaporizhzhyaNuclear Power Plant are closely monitoring the situation; no immediate nuclear safety risk at plant.#ZNPP — IAEA – International Atomic Energy Agency ⚛️ (@iaeaorg)June 6, 2023  Europe’s largest nuclear facility uses water from the dam to cool six reactors as well as spent fuel and emergency diesel generators. IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said in a statement that alternative sources of water near the facility should be sufficient to guarantee its safety. “A main one is the large cooling pond next to the site that by design is kept above the height of the reservoir,” he said. “It is therefore vital that this cooling pond remains intact. Nothing must be done to potentially undermine its integrity. I call on all sides to ensure nothing is done to undermine that.” According to the Ukraine War Environmental Consequences Working Group, a total collapse in the dam would wash away much of the left bank and a severe drop in the reservoir has the potential to deprive the nuclear plant of crucial cooling, as well as dry up the water supply in northern Crimea. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg called the attack “outrageous” and said it highlighted the devastation wrought by Moscow’s invasion. “The destruction of the Kakhovka dam today puts thousands of civilians at risk and causes severe environmental damage. This is an outrageous act, which demonstrates once again the brutality of Russia’s war in Ukraine,” Stoltenberg wrote on Twitter. European Union chief Charles Michel pledged to hold Russia accountable for the “war crime” of destroying civilian infrastructure. “Shocked by the unprecedented attack of the Nova Kakhovka dam. The destruction of civilian infrastructure clearly qualifies as a war crime – and we will hold Russia and its proxies accountable,” Michel wrote on social media. Lithuania’s president and the foreign ministers of Latvia and Estonia also said the incident amounted to a war crime for which Russia must be held accountable. “Today we witness an unprecedented Russian attack against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure,” Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda tweeted. “The destruction of a major dam is a crime of war that directly threatens thousands of people. Russia must be held accountable for it,” he said. “And Ukraine must win this war to stay safe!”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/6/ukraine-says-russian-forces-blew-up-nova-kakhovka-dam-in-kherson
Russia to face Ukraine at UN court over downing of flight MH17,"Kyiv accuses Moscow of supporting pro-Russia forces in eastern Ukraine who shot down the Boeing 777 with a missile in 2014, killing all 298 passengers and crew.","Ukraine and Russia are scheduled to face off at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) – the top United Nations court – over Moscow’s support for pro-Russian forces blamed for “insurrection” against the Ukrainian state and armed violence that included the shooting down ofMalaysian Airlines Flight MH17in 2014, killing all 298 passengers and crew. Judges at the ICJ in The Hague will hear Ukraine’s claim on Tuesday that Moscow violated a UN anti-terrorism treaty by equipping and funding pro-Russian separatists, who international investigators concluded had used a Russian missile to shoot down the Malaysian jetliner over eastern Ukraine almost 10 years ago. Lawyers for Ukraine will speak on Tuesday from 10am local time (08:00 GMT), while Russia’s will address the court with a response on Thursday, the ICJ said in a statement. Ukraine will then reply on June 12, and Russia on June 14. Kyiv accuses Russia of supporting pro-Moscow forces in Ukraine’s Donbas with weapons and money and thereby violating the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism adopted by the UN.    Ukraine is seeking damages for the fighting, which began in 2014 and lead to approximately 13,000 people killed in the eight years that led up to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Ukraine claims that Russia “instigated and sustained an armed insurrection against the authority of the Ukrainian State in eastern Ukraine” and “created “a climate of violence and intimidation against non-Russian ethnic groups”, the ICJ said in the statement. Established in the aftermath of World War II, the ICJ deals with disputes between UN member states and though its rulings are legally binding, the court has no enforcement mechanism. Tuesday’s hearing will be the first time lawyers for Ukraine and Russia meet at the ICJ, also known as the World Court, since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion. Moscow has tried to get the ICJ case thrown out, arguing the court has no jurisdiction. Last November, aDutch court convictedtwo Russian men and a Ukrainian national in absentia of murder for their roles in the shooting down of MH17 and sentenced them to life in prison.    The three – former Russian intelligence agents Igor Girkin and Sergey Dubinsky as well as Ukrainian Leonid Kharchenko, a Ukrainian separatist leader – were sentenced in absentia to life imprisonment. The three remain at large. The court also found that Russia had “overall control” over forces in the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic in eastern Ukraine since mid-May 2014. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said at the time the ruling was an important decision and the masterminds of the attack also needed to be prosecuted. “Holding to account masterminds is crucial too, as the feeling of impunity leads to new crimes,” Zelenskyy wrote in a tweet. Important court decision in The Hague. First sentences for the perpetrators of#MH17downing. Holding to account masterminds is crucial too, as the feeling of impunity leads to new crimes. We must dispel this illusion. Punishment for all RF's atrocities then & now is inevitable. — Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa)November 17, 2022  A finding by the ICJ that Russia equipped and funded fighters in eastern Ukraine responsible for the MH17 disaster would be a defeat for Moscow, which has repeatedly denied sending troops or military equipment to eastern Ukraine in 2014. Such a ruling could boost legal claims for damages or reparations from not only Ukraine but also individual victims of the conflict. It is not yet known when an ICJ verdict will be reached. Russian President Vladimir Putin is also the subject of an arrest warrant by the International Criminal Court, also based in The Hague, on charges of war crimes over the deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia. The Kremlin denies those charges.   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/6/russia-to-face-ukraine-at-un-court-over-downing-of-flight-mh17
Zelenskyy lauds Ukraine advance amid counteroffensive speculation,Kyiv has kept silent on start of counteroffensive despite speculation by analysts that campaign is getting under way.,"Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has praised his troops after Ukrainian forces pressed forward in several sections of the front line with Russia amid speculation the increased combat activities may signal thatKyiv’s long-expected counteroffensiveis getting under way. In his nightly video address on Monday, Zelenskyy mocked what he described as Russia’s hysterical reaction to every operation undertaken by Ukrainian forces and singled out two Ukrainian units who “skilfully, decisively and effectively defend our positions, destroy the occupiers and, most importantly, move forward”. “I am grateful to each of our warriors, to all our defenders who gave us the news we expect. Bakhmut direction – well done, warriors!” Zelenskyy said in his address, which did not directly address whether the long-awaited counteroffensive had started. “We see how hysterically Russia perceives every step we take there, every position we take,” he said. “The enemy knows that Ukraine will win. They see it. They feel it thanks to your strikes, soldiers and in particular in Donetsk region. Thank you for that.” Although the global trend is clear – Russia will lose this war, Russia's rulers continue to deny reality. They continue to try to deceive the world, to circumvent sanctions, to produce more weapons, to ensure more resources and people are spent on this aggression… We are…pic.twitter.com/ymcYWrlo2F — Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa)June 5, 2023  The commander of Ukraine’s ground forces, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said earlier on Monday that his troops continued“moving forward” near Bakhmut. Russian fighters and officials said the situation there was “very difficult”, despite Moscow claiming to have captured the city late last month following what had become the war’s longest and bloodiest battle. Ukraine had insisted its forces retained a small foothold in the eastern city. Ukraine’s Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar also said Ukraine was “shifting to offensive actions” along parts of the front but dismissed suggestions this was part of a major operation. Countering those claims, Russia’s military said it thwarted two large-scale Ukrainian offensives against its forces in eastern Ukraine since Sunday and had inflicted major losses on Ukrainian forces in what appeared to be Moscow’s attempt to portray the military activity as the start of Ukraine’s counteroffensive that was failing early. “The enemy launched a large-scale offensive in five sectors of the front in the South Donetsk direction,” the Russian defence ministry said in a statement. “The enemy did not achieve its tasks, it had no success,” it said.    Russia’s defence ministry claimed early on Tuesday that eight of Ukraine’s Germany-made Leopard battle tanks were among 28 tanks destroyed in the fighting along with 109 armoured vehicles and hundreds of Ukrainian troops killed. But some pro-Kremlin military bloggers painted a different picture of the fighting, acknowledging that Kyiv’s troops had made some quick gains. Theboss of Russia’s Wagnermercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, also said on Monday that Ukraine’s troops had made gains near Bakhmut. Russian troops, he said, were “slowly” leaving the village of Berkhivka near Bakhmut, which he said was a “disgrace”. The Wagner boss again challenged Valery Gerasimov, chief of Russia’s General Staff, and Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu to come to the front line and force Russian troops to stand and fight. Kyiv is officially keeping silent regarding the start of any counteroffensive despite speculation by analysts that an offensive campaign against Russian forces has started. A video Ukraine released over the weekend shows several of its soldiers in full combat gear raising a finger to their lips. “Plans love silence. There will be no start announcement,” say the words flashing on the screen afterwards, followed by warplanes in flight. Al Jazeera’s Charles Stratford, reporting from Kyiv, said there was “increasing evidence of an intensification of fighting at various locations along the front line”. “Whether this represents the beginning of the long-awaited Ukrainian counteroffensive and efforts by Ukrainian forces to find weak spots in Russian defence or, indeed, these are small probing attacks ahead of a larger full-scale operation, well that will become clear in the coming days,” he said. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington, DC-based think tank, said on Tuesday that it too had observed increased fighting in different sectors of the front line amid signals from Russian and Ukrainian officials that the counteroffensive has started. “Ukrainian forces are making territorial gains despite Russian claims to the contrary”, the ISW said, noting that Moscow had a history of claiming Ukrainian battlefield defeats which later turned out to be successes for Kyiv. Russian and Ukrainian officials are signaling the start of the Ukrainian#counteroffensive. ISW has observed increased combat activity in different sectors of the frontline and assesses that Ukrainian forces are making territorial gains despite Russian claims to the contrary.🧵⬇️ — ISW (@TheStudyofWar)June 5, 2023  “Russian officials have historically immediately claimed that Ukrainian counter-offensives failed even when the counter-offensives ultimately succeed,” the ISW said. “A successful counteroffensive operation may take days, weeks, or even months before its outcome becomes fully clear, during which time Russian sources may falsely claim to have defeated it,” the institute said. Military analysts say Ukraine has tried to hide its strategic intentions by launching multiple attacks on several sectors of the front line over recent weeks to force Russia to scatter its resources and distract them from where the main strike would be launched. “Kyiv is looking for Russia’s weak spots and trying to spread the front” as wide “as possible”, Ukrainian military analyst Roman Svitan said. For months, tens of thousands of Russian troops have been digging in along a front line that stretches for approximately 1,000km (600 miles), bracing for a Ukrainian attack expected to try to cut Russia’s so-called land bridge to the Crimean Peninsula. Many military experts expect Ukraine to try to ram through Russian defences towards the Sea of Azov coast to break the land corridor to Russian-held Crimea.    The Washington Post reported that some officials in Washington thought the counteroffensive was under way but the US White House’s national security spokesperson, John Kirby, declined to say whether he thought this was the case. “I’m not going to be talking for the Ukrainian military. That’s for them to speak to,” he told a regular briefing, although he stressed the work the United States had done to ensure the Ukrainians were ready. “So whether it’s starting now, or starting soon, or whenever they decide to step up and whatever they decide to do, the president is confident that we did everything we could over the last six, eight months or more to make sure that they had all the equipment, the training, the capabilities to be successful.” Sir Richard Barrons, former Commander of the UK Joint Forces Command, said a counteroffensive would not unfold on a set time scale. “We need to understand that what we’re calling the Ukraine counteroffensive is not like a football match,” he said “It’s not going to be done and dusted in 90 minutes with a halftime on an appointed day. It’s been nine months at least in the preparation in the sense that they’ve had to gather weapons and ammunition from NATO. Not enough, I think, so far,” he said. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told Reuters on Monday that Ukraine now had enough weapons for a counteroffensive but declined to comment when asked whether it had begun.

Belgium probes alleged use of its weapons in attack on Russia,A report claimed military aid given to Ukraine by NATO countries was used by pro-Ukraine fighters to attack Russia.,"Prime Minister Alexander De Croo says Belgium will ask Ukraine to clarify whether Belgian rifles supplied to Kyiv were used by pro-Ukrainian troops to attack Russia’s western border. De Croo’s comments came on Monday after The Washington Postreportedover the weekend that anti-Kremlin fighters – Freedom of Russia Legion and Russian Volunteer Corps – who launched a cross-border attack from Ukraine inRussia’s Belgorod region last month, used tactical vehicles originally given to Ukraine by the United States and Poland and carried rifles made in Belgium and the Czech Republic. “Our defence ministry and its intelligence agencies have started an investigation and are asking for information to determine what has happened exactly,” De Croo told Belgium’s Radio 1. “European weapons are delivered to Ukraine under the condition that they are used on Ukrainian territory with the purpose of defending that territory. And we have strict controls in place to see that this is the case,” he said. He highlighted that Belgium would take this situation “very seriously”, but declined to comment on possible consequences if the reports were confirmed. Earlier, White House spokesperson John Kirby said Washington was also looking into reports that US vehicles and equipment “could have been involved” in the cross-border raids in Belgorod. In an interview with Al Jazeera last month, Ilya Ponomarev, a political representative for the Freedom of Russia Legion, said, “The basic military equipment like the rifles and machineguns, they obviously are part of the regular fighters in Ukraine because both of those groups are part of the international legion, which is a part of the Ukrainian armed forces.” “So just regular equipment is coming from there. The rest were captured during the fighting. Heavy equipment, for example, like tanks, they were captured during fights over Kharkiv region where Russian army was retreating. And we captured those tanks from there and now we’re using them in the Belgorod region,” he added.

Russia claims to have thwarted ‘large-scale’ Ukraine attack,Claim comes as Ukraine prepares for a major counteroffensive to retake territory occupied by Russia.,"Russia has said its forces thwarted a major Ukrainian offensive in the Ukrainian region of Donetsk, killing 250 Ukrainian troops and destroying tanks and armoured vehicles. “On the morning of June 4, the enemy launched a large-scale offensive in five sectors of the front in the South Donetsk direction,” the Russian defence ministry said on its Telegram channel early on Monday. There was no update from Ukraine on the alleged offensive. In its evening update on June 4, the General Staff of Ukraine’s Armed Forces said Moscow was focusing its military efforts on the full occupation of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions. Donetsk is one of four Ukrainian territories that Russiaannexedlast September, along with Luhansk, Zaporizhia and Kherson. “During the day, the occupiers made 23 attacks, but all of them were repulsed by units of the defence forces,” it said. It was not possible to immediately verify the Russian or Ukrainian claims. The Russian defence ministry said Ukraine had launched the attack using six mechanised and two tank battalions. “The enemy’s goal was to break through our defences in the most vulnerable, in its opinion, sector of the front,” the defence ministry said. “The enemy did not achieve its tasks, it had no success.” Ukraine has been preparing for a counteroffensive to take back territory occupied by Russia since it began itsfull-scale invasionof Ukraine in February 2022, as as well as the Crimean Peninsula it seized in 2014. But it has given mixed signals about what the counteroffensive would involve — preliminary, limited attacks to weaken Russian forces and military facilities, or a large scale simultaneous assault across the entire 1,100-kilometre (684-mile) front line. Russia said its forces killed 250 Ukraine soldiers and also destroyed 16 tanks, three infantry fighting vehicles and 21 armoured combat vehicles. The ministry added that Russian Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov “was at one of the forward command posts” at the time. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made no mention of the alleged assault in his evening video address on Sunday night. He said earlier that Kyiv was ready to act. Ukraine has in recent weeks sought to weaken Russian positions. Late last month, a senior official said preliminary operations such as destroying supply lines or blowing up depots had already begun. A drone attack set an energy facility on fire in Russia’s Belgorod region in the early hours of Monday, and regional Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov reportedmore incursionsby pro-Ukrainian, anti-KremlinRussian Volunteer Corpsand theFreedom of Russia Legionarmed groups. The fighters said they had also taken Russian troops captive and would hand them over to Ukraine. The Belgorod region borders Ukraine and has come under frequent shelling in recent weeks. Pavel Felgengauer, Russian defence analyst, believes that attacks in the bordering region are part of a plan to force Moscow to direct more troops away from the front lines. “Ukrainians hope that Russia will remove reinforcement … maybe the Wagner storm troops will be moved to Belgorod meaning that they will be removed away from the south, where most likely the real fighting is going to take place in the coming weeks or couple of months,” said Felgengauer. “These small troops cannot really achieve a strategic objective by their raids, their only real objective is to pester the Russian and to make them reinforce forces in Belgorod at the expenses of other places,” he added.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/5/russia-claims-to-have-thwarted-major-ukraine-attack

Pro-Ukraine fighters attack southern Russia; offer to trade POWs,Pro-Kyiv Russian Volunteer Corps and the Legion for Freedom of Russia called on Belgorod governor to meet and retrieve captive Russian soldiers.,"Fighting is ongoing in southern Russia after armed groups launched more cross-border attacks from Ukraine with Moscow saying it targeted the “terrorists” with artillery fire. The governor of the besieged Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said on Sunday that clashes again erupted on his side of the border, and acknowledged for the first time that pro-Ukrainian forces had taken Russian prisoners of war during incursions. He said he was ready for talks to retrieve “our guys” and told the armed groups he would meet them for the exchange. “A sabotage group came in. There is combat in [the] Novaya Tavolzhanka [border village],” Gladkov said. “I hope they will all be destroyed.” The pro-KyivRussian Volunteer Corpsand theFreedom of Russia Legioncalled on the Belgorod governor to meet and retrieve captive soldiers. “The only thing stopping me from negotiating with them is our guys that are in their hands, maybe they are already dead,” said Gladkov. Ukraine has intensively shelled Russian settlements on the border recently, forcing thousands to flee to the regional hub of Belgorod. Russia’s military later claimed it repelled a “sabotage group of Ukrainian terrorists” seeking to cross the frontier near the settlement. “The enemy was hit by artillery. The enemy scattered and retreated,” it said in a statement. Gladkov earlier asked residents of the Shebekino border district to leave their homes because of the shelling.    Fighting around Novaya Tavolzhanka follows last month’s dramatic armed incursion from Ukraine that forced Russia’s military to use artillery and air strikes on home soil. The border breach was claimed byanti-Kremlin nationalists. Earlier, the armed groups published a video addressing the governor. It claimed to show “prisoners” their captors called “simple soldiers sent by your leadership to this war”. The one minute and 26 second clip showed what appeared to be about a dozen Russian soldiers being held captive, with two lying on hospital beds.  A man identifying himself as the commander of the Russian Volunteer Corps said he would hand over the soldiers in exchange for a meeting with Governor Gladkov. He described the captives as “ordinary soldiers whom you and your political leadership sent to the slaughter”, said a statement posted with the video. Hours later, Gladkov appeared in a video message in which he agreed to meet the group if the soldiers were still alive. “Most likely they killed them, as hard as it is for me to say. But if they are alive, from 5-6pm – Shebekino checkpoint. I guarantee safety,” Gladkov said.  The fighter in the video said Gladkov did not turn up at the designated meeting place. “We have already decided the fate of these guys. They will be transferred to the Ukrainian side for the exchange procedure,” he said. Ukraine officials have predicted the rise of what they call forces opposed toRussian President Vladimir Putin. “These Russian men took up arms against their will. Soon they will understand the whole vileness and injustice of the war unleashed by Putin,” another Corps member, who did not identify himself, said in the video. Ukraine has consistently denied responsibility for attacks on Russian soil, but presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said on Sunday the situation in the border areas “should be viewed as the future of Russia”. Gladkov said on Sunday that Ukrainian forces continued to shell his region overnight after two people were killed the previous evening and hundreds of children were evacuated away from the border. The attacks on the Belgorod region come as Kyiv says it ispreparing a major counteroffensiveagainst Russian forces.

"Russian attack wounds 20, including children in Ukraine’s Dnipro",Regional governor says three of the five children wounded in Saturday’s attack were in ‘serious condition’.,"A Russian air raid on the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro has wounded 20 people, including five children, according to officials. Serhiy Lysak, the regional governor of Dnipropetrovsk, said on Saturday that three of the children were in “serious condition” following the attack on a residential district. A total of 17 people were being treated in hospital, he added on Telegram. Media reports said emergency teams had pulled four people from under rubble in the area known as Pidhorodnenska. Lysak said another child was likely still trapped. Reports on social media said a Russian missile caused the explosion and that an emergency services building was also hit. There was no confirmation of a missile strike from Ukrainian military officials. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, also writing on Telegram, said the explosion occurred between two residential buildings. “Unfortunately, there are people under the rubble,” Zelenskyy wrote. “Once again, Russia proves it is a terrorist state.” Moscow denies its military forces target civilians. Pictures posted on social media showed rescue teams working at a shattered, smouldering building amid piles of twisted building materials. Russian air raids over Ukraine haveratcheted upin recent weeks as haveincursions in the oppositedirection. Russian officials said on Saturday that Ukrainian shelling killed two people in Belgorod, a border region that has been hit by repeated attacks this week. The latest deaths bring the overall toll in Belgorod border villages to seven this week.

Wagner boss says Russian forces laid mines to harm his fighters,Mercenary force boss Yevgeny Prigozhin says Russian defence officials planted explosives on route of Wagner fighters withdrawal from Bakhmut city.,"The boss ofRussia’s Wagner mercenary force, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has continued his months-long war of words with the leadership of the Russian armed forces by accusing pro-Moscow forces of planting explosives to harm his fighters as they retreated from Bakhmut. Prigozhin made his claims on Friday as Wagner mercenaries had largely pulled back from the easternUkrainian town of Bakhmutafter months of bloody fighting and a huge death toll.Wagner positions in the destroyed townwere given over to the Russian army, he said. Writing on Telegram, Prigozhin said his men had discovered a dozen locations in rear areas where Russian defence ministry officials had planted various explosive devices, including hundreds of anti-tank mines. When asked why the mines had been laid and the explosives set, the defence ministry officials indicated it was an order from their superiors, Prigozhin said. “It was not necessary to plant these charges in order to deter the enemy, as it (the area in question) is in the rear area,” he said. “Therefore, we can assume that these charges were intended to meet the advancing units of Wagner,” Prigozhin said. None of the charges went off and no one was hurt, he added “We assume this was an attempt at a public flogging.”    Russia’s defence ministry was not immediately available for comment. Prigozhin complained for months that his men were not given enough ammunition by Russia’s top brass for the assault on Bakhmut and claimed that his fighters were being discriminated against. The Wagner boss’s often expletive-laden criticism of the Russian military leadership was criticised by another pro-Moscow commander who has fought in Ukraine – potentially signally growing fissures among the Kremlin’s allied forces in the war. Addressing Prigozhin in a video message on Thursday, and using the diminutive of “Zhenya” and the familiar Russian form of you (“ty”), Adam Delimkhanov,a close ally of Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov,cast the Wagner boss as a blogger who shouts all the time. “You have become a blogger who screams and shouts off to the whole world about all the problems,” Delimkhanov said. “Stop shouting, yelling and screaming,” he said. “If you don’t understand, then you can contact us and tell us the place and the time, I, we will, explain to you what you don’t understand,” Delimkhanov said in the message to Prigozhin.    The message then drew a swift rebuke from one of Wagner’s most senior fighters, Dmitry Utkin, a former special forces officer who served in Russian military intelligence. “Where did such familiarity come from: who gave you the right to use the address ‘ty’ and ‘Zhenya’?” Utkin said in a message which Prigozhin reposted on Telegram. “Certain citizens should be put against a wall for the SHAME that we have,” Utkin said. “We are always ready to talk man to man,” he said. Chechen leader Kadyrov had last year supported some of Prigozhin’s criticism of Russia’s top brass but their relations have distanced in recent months. Kadyrov is also a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and has recently refrained from echoing criticism of the defence ministry.

"‘Stop sending weapons, hold talks’ to end Russia-Ukraine war","China’s envoy Li Hui says in order to achieve peace, Kyiv’s allies must ‘stop sending weapons to the battlefield’.","Ukraine’s allies should stopsending weaponsto Kyiv and move towards negotiations to bring lasting peace, China’s envoy for Eurasian affairs has said. Li Hui’s appeal came as Washington and many European nations are ramping up supplies of missiles, tanks and other weapons to Ukrainian forces that are trying to take back territory occupied by Russia. “If we really want to stop the war, save lives and achieve peace, we should stop sending weapons to the battlefield,” Li told reporters in Beijing on Friday. “The painful lessons of how the Ukraine crisis developed to its current state merit deep reflection by all parties.” Li said there are currently “many difficulties” in sitting down and engaging in talks to end the war. He added that those fighting the war are “not without points of consensus”. “The two sides have not fully shut the door on peace talks,” Li insisted.  The Chinese envoy toured European capitals last month seeking to promote Ukraine peace talks. In May, Li completed a 12-day tour of Kyiv, Warsaw, Paris, Berlin, Brussels and Moscow in what China said was a bid to find common ground for an eventual political settlement. “The risk of escalation of the Russia-Ukraine war is still high,” Li said, adding that all sides must take concrete measures to “cool down the situation” and ensure the safety of nuclear facilities. Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s government says it is neutral and wants to serve as a mediator but has supported Moscow politically. In February, Beijing released a proposed peace plan but Ukraine’s allies insisted President Vladimir Putin must first withdraw Russian forces. Beijing has refused to criticise the invasion and used its status as one of five permanent United Nations Security Council members to deflect diplomatic attacks on Russia. The United States, which is the biggest supplier of weapons to Ukraine, has so far provided about $37bn in military aid since the invasion last year. The majority of that has been in weapons systems, millions of munitions and ammunition rounds, and an array of trucks, sensors, radars and other equipment pulled from Pentagon stockpiles and sent quickly to Ukraine. European nations have also stepped up their military aid to Kyiv amid calls from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskky to further bolster weapons. Last month, the United Kingdompromised Ukrainefurther arms for its fight against Russia. Britain said it would supply Ukraine with hundreds of additional air defence missiles, as well as “long-range attack drones”. French President Emmanuel Macron pledged his country would supply dozens of light tanks, armoured vehicles and more air defence systems. Despite its initial hesitance to provide Kyiv with lethal weapons, Germany has become one of the biggest suppliers of arms to Ukraine, including Leopard 1 and 2 battle tanks, and the sophisticated IRIS-T SLM air defence system.

US seeking TNT in Japan for Ukraine artillery shells: Report,Procurement could court controversy because export rules ban Japanese companies from selling lethal weaponry overseas.,"The United States is seeking to secure supplies of TNT in Japan for 155mm artillery shells, as Washington rushes weapons and ammunition to Ukraine for a planned counteroffensive against Russian forces. For pacifist Japan, any procurement could court controversy because export rules ban Japanese companies from selling lethal items overseas, such as the howitzer shells that Ukraine fires daily at Russian units occupying its southeastern regions. Nonetheless, the allies appear to have found a workaround to enable the TNT sale amid global shortages of munitions, two people familiar with the matter told the Reuters news agency. “There is a way for the United States to buy explosives from Japan,” one of the people with knowledge of discussions on the matter in Japan told Reuters on condition of anonymity, citing the issue’s sensitivity. Export restrictions for dual-use products or equipment sold commercially are less stringent than for items with a purely military purpose. Tokyo, which hosted US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin this week, has told the US government it will allow the sale of industrial TNT because the explosive is not a military-use-only product, the other source said. The US wants to add a Japanese company into a TNT supply chain to deliver explosives to US army-owned munitions plants that would pack them into 155mm shell cases, the person added. Japan’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Economy declined to say whether any Japanese company had approached it about exporting TNT. It added in an email that items not subject to military restrictions would be assessed under regular export rules that consider the buyer’s intent, including whether their use would impede international security. The Japanese defence ministry’s Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Agency declined to comment. The US state department did not directly address questions from Reuters about whether the US planned to buy TNT in Japan but said Washington was working with allies and partners “to provide Ukraine with the support it needs” to defend itself. Japan, it added, “has demonstrated leadership in supporting Ukraine’s defence”. Japan has already imposedsanctions on Russiaover its full-scale invasion of Ukraine and offered assistance in the form of non-lethal aid, such as body armour and food rations. Following Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s visit to Japan during theG7 leaders summitin Hiroshima last month, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida agreed to donate jeeps and trucks. Kishida wants to help Ukraine because his administration fears a Russian victory would embolden China to attack the self-ruled island of Taiwan and embroil his country in a regional war. Last year, he warned that Ukraine me be “East Asia tomorrow”, and his administration announced Japan’s biggest military build-up since World War II. There appears to be growing acceptance in Japan about providing military aid to Ukraine, but the degree of lethality is contentious, said Tsuneo Watanabe, a senior fellow at the Sasakawa Peace Foundation. “The fact that Japan has decided to give trucks to Ukraine shows that things are changing. However, there doesn’t yet appear to be any political consensus around the issue of sending lethal aid,” he said. Japan is one of the dozens of allies that Washington is asking to helparm Ukraineas it wrestles with stretched military supply chains. South Korea, which also uses 155mm shells, is among those the US has approached. A South Korean defence official told Reuters that Seoul’s stance against providing lethal aid to Kyiv had not changed. Asked in Tokyo this week about the possibility of a shift in Japanese policy on lethal aid, Austin said at a press briefing that any change would be a matter for Japan but “any bit of support” for Ukraine was “always welcome”. The sources who spoke to Reuters declined to identify the Japanese company that would supply explosives to the US government and did not say how much TNT Washington wanted to buy. Reuters contacted 22 explosives makers listed on the Japan Explosives Industry Association’s website. The only one that said it made industrial TNT was Chugoku Kayaku, a Hiroshima-based firm that supplies Japan’s military. “We have not received any direct inquiry from the US government or US military,” the company said in an email. Asked if it was discussing any TNT sales through an intermediary, the firm, which lists an industrial TNT product on its website, said it did not disclose the identity of customers or potential buyers.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/2/us-seeking-tnt-in-japan-for-ukraine-artillery-shells-report
"Russia thwarts more Belgorod attacks, blames Ukraine","Defence ministry says it repelled three attacks in the border area, which has come under intensified fire since last month.","Russia’s defence ministry has said it thwarted three cross-border attacks near the town of Shebekino, as it accused Ukraine of using what it said were “terrorist formations”. Shebekino lies in the Belgorod region, which has been targeted in a number of attacks since May. “Overall, the attack involved up to 70 militants, five tanks, four armoured vehicles, seven pick-up trucks and a Kamaz truck,” the Russian defence ministry said on Thursday evening, reporting at least three attempted crossings. It said it used air force and artillery to repel the attacks and killed more than 50 Ukrainian fighters. The Russian Volunteer Corps (RVC), a far-right paramilitary group of ethnic Russians that supports Ukraine, claimed to be fighting inside Russia. “The second phase promised by the RVC’s commander has begun!” it said on Telegram, referring to a previous incursion, alongside images of fighters firing weapons. Another anti-Kremlin group that calls itself the Freedom of Russia Legion also announced a plan to launch a cross-border raid. The Belgorod region saw an unprecedented two-day armed incursion last week and has come under intensified fire in the past days. Ukraine denies its military is involved in theincursionsand says they are conducted by Russian volunteer fighters. Vyacheslav Gladkov, the Belgorod region’s governor, accused Ukrainian armed forces of repeatedly shelling Shebekino with Soviet-designed grad 122mm rockets, setting alight a dormitory and damaging an administrative building. Gladkov said at least 12 people had been wounded in the previous 24 hours. Residents poured into centres for displaced people in Belgorod city. “There are many families with children, including infants and disabled people. We will try to provide them with as much care as possible,” said city mayor Valentin Demidov. Two people were wounded in the city when a drone crashed near a petrol station, he added. It was not possible to independently verify accounts from either side. The RVC and Freedom of Russia Legion claimed responsibility for last month’scross-border raidthat marked one of the most serious attacks on Russian territory since Moscow began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/2/russia-says-thwarts-more-belgorod-attacks-blames-ukraine
US cuts data sharing with Russia under New START nuclear deal,US says withholding information is retaliatory measure for Moscow’s suspension of New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty).,"The United States will stop providing Russia with some notifications requiredunder the New START nuclear arms control treaty, including updates on missile and launcher locations, in what Washington describes as a retaliatory “countermeasure” due to Moscow’s “violations” of the accord. The US state department said on Thursday that it had ceased providing the status and locations of its nuclear missiles and launchers but would continue to provide notification of the launch of intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Russian inspection activities on US territory have ceased and visas issued and pending for Russian New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) inspectors and their aircrews – as well as diplomatic clearance for Russian inspection aircraft – have been revoked, according toa state department fact sheet released on Thursday. The US will also not provide telemetric information to Russia on the launch of US intercontinental and submarine-launched ballistic missiles. Such data involves information that originates during a missile’s test flights and under the treaty, both Moscow and Washington were to exchange such information annually. “The United States has adopted lawful countermeasures in response to the Russian Federation’s ongoing violations of the New START treaty. The Russian Federation’s purported suspension of the New START treaty is legally invalid,” the state department said in the fact sheet released on Thursday.    “The United States notified Russia of the countermeasures in advance and conveyed the United States’ desire and readiness to reverse the countermeasures and fully implement the treaty if Russia returns to compliance,” it added. Russian President Vladimir Putin has not formally withdrawnfrom the New START treaty, but he announced in February that Moscow would suspend its participation in what is a key pillar of US-Russian nuclear arms control. Putin said Moscow could not accept US inspections of its nuclear sites under the agreement when Washington and its NATO allies had openly declared Moscow’s defeat in Ukraine as a primary goal. In March, Moscow emphasised that it had not withdrawnfrom the START pact altogether and would continue to respect the caps on nuclear weapons the treaty sets. Russia’s foreign ministry had also said that Moscow would continue to notify the US of planned test launches of its ballistic missiles – a key element of the agreement. Notices on ballistic launches are an essential element of nuclear strategic stability for decades, allowing Russia and the US to correctly interpret each other’s moves and make sure neither country mistakes a test launch for a preemptive nuclear missile attack. Moscow and Washington collectively control nearly 90 percent of the world’s nuclear warheads – enough to destroy the planet several times over.    The New START limits the number of strategic nuclear warheads countries deploy. Signed in 2010 and due to expire in 2026, the New START treaty caps the number of strategic nuclear warheads that the US and Russia can deploy to no more than 1,550 strategic nuclear warheads and 700 land- and submarine-based missiles and bombers to deliver them. A US administration official, quoted by the Reuters news agency on Thursday, said Washington “will continue to adhere to the [treaty’s] central limits … and expect that Russia will continue to do so as well”. Speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity, the official said the US’ steps were reversible and that the country was looking todraw Moscow back into arms control talks. “We’ve taken a stepwise approach,” he said, explaining that the US wanted to use its responses to Russia’s suspension to “present them with an opportunity to return to the table to talk about returning to compliance under a New START”. The New START agreement envisages sweeping on-site inspections by Russia and the US to verify compliance. But inspections went dormant in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Discussions on resuming inspections were supposed to have taken place in November 2022, but Russia abruptly called them off, citing US support for Ukraine following Moscow’s invasion.

"Sweden will join NATO soon, Joe Biden promises","‘It will happen,’ US president says as he underscores transatlantic alliance’s commitment to supporting Ukraine.","Washington, DC –US President Joe Biden has said he is confident that Sweden will join NATO “as soon as possible”, despite Turkey and Hungary continuing to block the northern European country’s accession to the alliance. Speaking at a United States Air Force Academy graduation ceremony on Thursday, Biden praised NATO’s unity amid the Russianinvasion of Ukraine. “NATO is more energised and more united than it’s been in decades. It’s now even stronger with the accession of our newest ally, Finland – and soon Sweden – to the alliance, as soon as possible. It will happen. I promise you,” the US president said. His remarks come just days after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged Turkey to approve Sweden’s bid to become a NATO member. “From the perspective of the United States, the time is now to finalise Sweden’s accession,”Blinken told reportersin the northern Swedish city of Lulea on Tuesday. The top US diplomat also voiced hope that the process would be completed before a NATO summit in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius in July. NATO countries need to ratify new members. The US-led bloc has a collective defence pact – known as Article 5 – that stipulates that an attack on one NATO member-state is an attack on the entire alliance. Sweden and neighbouring Finland began seekingNATO membershiplast year after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Finlandofficially joinedthe alliance in April, but Sweden’s application is still pending.    Hungary and Turkey have yet to approve Sweden’s accession, but Ankara is seen as the main obstacle. Turkey has accused Sweden of providing a safe haven to members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which it considers a “terrorist” group. Sweden says it is addressing Turkey’s concerns in accordance with atrilateral memorandumsigned by the two countries as well as Finland last year. On Thursday, as the foreign ministers of NATO member-states held talks in Norway, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu tweeted at his Swedish counterpart: “Fulfill your commitments arising from Trilateral Memorandum & take concrete steps in the fight against terrorism. The rest will follow.” Biden said earlier this week that he raised the issue in a phone call with newly re-elected Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. “I congratulated Erdogan. He still wants to work on something on the F-16s. I told him we wanted a deal with Sweden, so let’s get that done,”Biden told reporterson Monday, referring to a push by Ankara to finalise a $20bn deal for US-madeF-16 fighter jets. Biden did not mention Turkey when he raised Sweden’s NATO bid on Thursday. But he stressed that the alliance continues to stand together in response to the invasion of Ukraine, adding that Russian PresidentVladimir Putinthought NATO would “crack”. The US president also renewed a commitment to backing Ukraine against the invasion. Washington has provided billions of dollars in humanitarian and military aid to Kyiv since the war started last year. “The United States has rallied the world to stand strong with Ukraine and defend the values that the American people hold so dear – freedom, sovereignty, democracy, simple dignity,” Biden said. “The American people’s support for Ukraine will not waver.” A crystal clear message to our Swedish Friends!

NATO divided on Ukrainian membership as Zelenskyy renews call,Ukrainian president appeals to dozens of European leaders as divisions among NATO members meeting in Norway become apparent.,"President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has taken his quest for more arms and Ukrainian membership of powerful Western institutions to a sprawling summit of European leaders. But as Zelenskyy renewed his demands for NATO and EU membership at the European Political Community meeting in Moldova, held on Thursday, leaders of the military alliance gathered in Norway and were divided on Ukraine’s call. Zelenskyy said all countries bordering Russia should be full members of both organisations since Moscow “tries to swallow only those who are outside of the common security space”. He called for more European support on the ground, which he said is saving lives and “literally accelerating peace”. According to Al Jazeera’s Stefanie Dekker, reporting from the summit, Zelenskyy was the first foreign leader to arrive at the venue, a move unlikely “by chance”. The choice to hold the summit in Moldova, a former Soviet republic of approximately 2.6 million people near Ukraine, was seen as a message to the Kremlin from the EU and Moldova’s pro-Western government. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told the summit, “Our meeting today in Moldova speaks volumes. The country borders on Ukraine and here, the Russian threat is palpable.” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak also attended. Meanwhile in Norway, divisions among NATO allies about the speed of Kyiv’s accession became apparent, only weeks before a decisive mid-July summit in Vilnius. “All allies agree that Moscow does not have a veto against NATO enlargement,” NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg told reporters foreign ministers gathered in Oslo, seeking to dispel any signs of discord. NATO agreed in 2008 that Ukraine would eventually join the alliance but leaders have so far stopped short of taking steps, such as giving Kyiv a membership action plan, that would lay out a timetable for bringing Ukraine closer to the military pact. While Kyiv and its closest allies in Eastern Europe have called for concrete steps to bring Ukraine closer to membership, Western governments, such as the United States and Germany, have been wary of any move that might take the alliance closer to war with Russia. Lithuania’s Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said Kyiv had suffered two invasions while waiting for an answer from NATO for 14 years. “It is high time that we actually sit down and find a very concrete answer as to how Ukraine is going to move closer to NATO and when they become a member of the alliance,” he said, a call that was echoed by his Estonian counterpart. Other allies, such as Germany and Luxembourg, stressed the risks should NATO rush to let Kyiv join, while Hungary stated clearly Ukraine’s NATO accession could not be on the agenda at the upcoming summit. “NATO’s open door policy remains in place, but at the same time, it is clear that we cannot talk about accepting new members [who are] in the midst of a war,” German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/1/zelenskyy-renews-calls-for-nato-membership-at-moldova-summit
Chechen troops said to mobilise as Russian children flee border,"Russia’s Belgorod regional Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov says more than 1,000 children due for evacuation from border areas.","Fighters fromRussia’s Chechnya regionunder the command of leader Ramzan Kadyrov have likely been ordered to take a leading role in the fighting in Ukraine in a week when the governor of Russia’s Belgorod region announced theevacuation of childrenamid ongoing cross-border attacks from Ukraine. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington, DC-based think tank, said in its latest report on Thursday that Russian military commanders had likely ordered the Chechens into battle following the withdrawal of Wagner Group mercenary forces from the destroyed city of Bakhmut. According to the ISW, Kadyrov claimed on Wednesday that his forces had received new orders and would be deploying to “active combat activities” to “liberate” a series of settlements after assuming responsibility for the front line in Ukraine’s southeast Donetsk region, which includes the contested city of Bakhmut. Kadyrov said that Chechen special forces were preparing for offensive operations ahead of Ukraine’s expected counteroffensive to reclaim territory from Russian forces. “The claimed return of Chechen forces to offensive operations would break Kadyrovites from a nearly yearlong hiatus from participating in high-intensity combat operations” in Ukraine, the ISW said. 5/ The#Kremlinmay perceive Chechen units as an untapped assault force that can restore#Russia’s ability to sustain simultaneous offensive efforts on multiple axes of advance. — ISW (@TheStudyofWar)June 1, 2023  Chechen fighters have primarily operated in areas behind the front line following their involvement in the bloody battles in Ukraine’s cities of Mariupol, Severodonetsk and Lysychanak, the institute said. “The Kremlin may perceive Chechen units as an untapped assault force that can restore Russia’s ability to sustain simultaneous offensive efforts on multiple axes of advance,” the ISW added. However, the ISW also noted that if reports of 7,000 Chechen troops in Ukraine are correct, Kadyrov’s forces will not have the numbers “to mount multiple significant offensive operations successfully”. Describing himself as a “foot soldier” of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kadyrov had previously deployed his Chechen Republic forces in support of Russian military operations in Syria and Georgia. Reports of the possiblereturn of Chechen forcesto offensive operations come amid intensifying shelling of the border region of Russia’s Belgorod, where authorities have begun evacuating children from the districts of Shebekino and Graivoron.    Belgorod’s regional Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram on Wednesday that the first 300 evacuated children would be taken to Voronezh, a city about 250km (155 miles) further into Russia. Another 1,000 children will be removed to other provinces over the coming days, he said. “The question of children’s safety in the two districts… is very important,” Gladkov said. “All of us, adults, are very worried.” A correspondent for state-run agency RIA Novosti near Voronezh said buses had arrived with about 150 people on board on Wednesday. Gladkov said the situation was growing worse in the village of Shebekino, where he reported more shelling during the day that injured four people but did not cause any deaths. The governor also urged Russian forces on Wednesday to launch attacks and capture Ukraine’s Kharkiv region, including Kharkiv city, to create a buffer zone between Belgorod and Ukraine, according to the ISW.    Heavy shelling of Shebekino was reported early on Thursday morning by local news sources. On Tuesday, one person was reportedly killed and two others were wounded in a strike on a centre for displaced people in Belgorod. Several oil depots in the region have also been hit in recent weeks. The attacks on Russian soil have come as Kyiv says it is preparing for a major offensive against Moscow’s forces. “The situation is quite alarming,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday about the shelling of Belgorod. “We have not heard a single word of condemnation from the West so far,” Peskov said of the attacks which have affected Russian civilians in the region. More than a year into its Ukraine campaign, Russia has experienced intensifying attacks on its territory, with an unprecedented incursion by Russian anti-Putin fighters last week into Belgorod and adrone attack on Moscowon Tuesday.    The incursion into Russia from Ukraine by the Russian Volunteer Corps (RVC) and the allied Freedom of Russia Legion last week was the largest since the Russian full-scale invasion last year. The Kremlin also said on Wednesday that it was not considering the introduction of martial law in Russia despite the drone attacks on Moscow and the ongoing shelling of border regions. The Kremlin’s Peskov said the imposition of martial law in Russia was not currently being discussed. According to media reports, Peskov was reacting to Chechen leader Kadyrov’s demands for harsher attacks on Ukraine and the declaration of martial law after the drone attacks on Moscow. Peskov said such a decision was up to Moscow and not the regions. He also expressed concern about the ongoing shelling of Belgorod. “Measures are being taken,” Peskov said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/1/chechen-troops-said-to-mobilise-as-russian-children-flee-border

Iraqi man reported killed fighting for Russia’s Wagner in Ukraine,Abbas Abuthar Witwit is reported to have died in Ukraine in April after being injured in the battle for Bakhmut.,"An Iraqi citizen fighting with Russia’s Wagner mercenary force was killed in Ukraine in April, Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin has said, in what is believed to be the first confirmed case of a Middle East native to have died fighting in the war. Abbas Abuthar Witwit died on April 7, a day after arriving at a Wagner hospital in the Russian-occupied eastern Ukrainian city of Luhansk, according to the Russian-language RIA FAN news site. Prigozhin confirmed to the Reuters news agency on Wednesday that he had recruited Witwit from prison in Russia, adding that he was not the first native of an Arab country to have joined his mercenary unit from jail. He said the Iraqi national had fought well and “died heroically”. Much of the fighting for the destroyed Ukrainian city of Bakhmut has been undertaken by convicts recruited by Wagner from Russian prisons on the promise of a pardon if they survived six months at the front in Ukraine.    In February, the United States said the Wagner mercenary group had sufferedmore than 30,000 casualtiessince Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine last February and that 90 percent ofWagner fighterskilled in Ukraine since December 2022 were convicts. Prigozhin said last week thatapproximately 20,000of his mercenaries were killed in the months-long battle for control of Bakhmut. He also said he recruited about 50,000 prisoners tofight with Wagnerin Ukraine and that about 20 percent of them were now dead. RIA FAN news said that Witwit died after being wounded in Bakhmut. According to court papers seen by Reuters, Witwit was sentenced to four-and-a-half years in prison on drug charges in July 2021 by a court in the Russian city of Kazan. The documents said Witwit was a first-year student at a technical university in Russia at the time of his conviction. In a video published by RIA FAN, a man identified as Witwit’s father is shown receiving awards posthumously given to his son by Wagner and saying he had supported his son’s decision to enlist as a “volunteer” to fight in Ukraine. “Abbas always pursued his freedom and wanted to be a man who defends his freedom and himself and he told me he found his freedom in Russia,” the man identified as the father is shown saying.

Bakhmut falls silent as Russia and Ukraine trade air raids,"Silence proves worse than the noise of battle for Russian morale, as units desert and Ukraine appears to attack Russian soil at will.","After 10 months of warfare, ground assaults have largely come to a halt and the guns have mostly fallen silent in the city of Bakhmut. Russian troops pausedto rotate out the Wagner Group mercenaries who spearheaded the battle to capture the eastern Ukrainian city. Ukrainian forces paused a flanking manoeuvre that recently captured the high ground around Bakhmut “to perform other military tasks”. Only one combat clash was reported in the 66th week of the war – on Saturday. “There are no active battles there – neither in the city, nor on the flanks,” Ukraine’s Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said in a Telegram post. “Instead, the enemy is actively shelling the outskirts of the city and the approaches to it.” in a video interview he posted to his Telegram channel, Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin said he had lost 20,000 mercenaries in the battle for Bakhmut alone. The Russian defence ministry has not said how many supporting troops were killed from airborne and mechanised units. “The amount of killing that took place is really hard to imagine … there’s rotting bodies, I’m sure, everywhere still,” retired US Colonel Seth Krummrich told Al Jazeera on Tuesday. “They were talking about human waves … Prigozhin was becoming really frustrated shoving all these mercenaries in, trying to take 10 metres [32.8 feet] of ground,” said Krummrich, who has led special forces detachments in Afghanistan and the Middle East, and currently serves as vice president for Global Guardian, a security consultant. Russia claimed victory in Bakhmut on May 21, and nine days later Ukrainian eastern forces spokesman Serhiy Cherevaty admitted the city itself was in Russian hands. “The enemy fought for this district centre for 10 months, but did not manage to capture it until the end,” he said. He hinted at an anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive. “The Russians are well aware that, in addition to military losses, failure to hold the city can also cause them great reputational losses,” Cherevaty said. “I think the Russians are setting themselves up for an incredible failure,” Krummrich said. “With the imminent counteroffensive, they stand to lose Bakhmut and much, much more. If they’re going to claim a Russian victory to the Russian people now, they’re going to lose big-time if they get their supply lines cut off and they end up having to abandon the city.” Ukraine has said it has 12 trained and equipped battalions ready to throw into the counteroffensive, and Krummrich believed weather was now the only factor holding them up. “The units are trained, so I believe as soon as the ground dries, they’re going to go.” “The Russians are sitting in Bakhmut, they understand what’s coming next, they understand they’re going to get attacked,” he said. On May 28, Ukraine’s general staff said 80 Russian troops had deserted their positions in Lysychansk, the city in Luhansk province Russian forces seized last July. Another 30 Russian troops deserted in Bakhmut, taking military equipment with them, the staff said. Instead of continuing the attritional ground battle for Bakhmut, Russia and Ukraine turned to a largely psychological war in the air. On May 26, Ukraine’s air force said it had destroyed an airborne armada of 31 drones and 17 missiles overnight, including 10 Kh-101 and Kh-155 missiles fired from Russian planes over the Caspian Sea, seven S-300 and S-400 repurposed air defence missiles fired from occupied Zaporizhia, and 31 Iranian Shahed-131 and Shahed-136 drones. The targets were “critical infrastructure and infrastructure of the defence forces” in the east of the country, said the air force. Ukrainian military intelligence spokesman Andriy Yusov said the operation was chiefly of propaganda value. “The enemy would like to show that their ‘analogovnet’ weapons can do something to the Ukrainian army and Western weapons. But it turns out not,” he said. Two days later, Ukrainian air defences shot down at least 40 drones Russia launched at the capital, Kyiv, said the city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko. Falling debris killed a man and wounded a woman. The pre-dawn attacks came on the last Sunday of May, when the capital celebrates “Kyiv Day”, the anniversary of its official founding 1,541 years ago. And the following day, Ukraine’s commander of the military, General Valery Zaluzhny, said the armed forces had destroyed all 11 Iskander-K and Iskander-M cruise missiles launched north of the border into Ukraine. But on May 30, Ukraine seemed to have responded by sending eight drones to Moscow. Russia said it had jammed or shot down all eight drones. In a post on Telegram after the attack, Alexander Khinshtein, a prominent member of Russia’s parliament from the governing United Russia bloc, said three of the eight drones had been downed over Rublyovka, a suburb west of Moscow where much of Russia’s political and business elite live. “This is clearly a sign of terrorist activity,” Russian President Vladimir Putin said. Ukrainian Colonel Petro Chernyk commented, “If drones of unknown origin break through multi-layered defences and practically fly to the capital of a country that considers itself a superpower, do their weapons have any value?” Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin blamed the defence ministry for a weak defence. “You, the defence ministry, have done nothing to launch an offensive,” Prigozhin said. “How dare you allow the drones to reach Moscow?” Ukraine denied responsibility. “We have nothing directly to do with this,” Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said. Russia’s ambassador to Washington blamed the US for encouraging the attack, and mocked the Biden administration’s statement that it was gathering information on the incident. “What are these attempts to hide behind the phrase they are ‘gathering information’?” Anatoly Antonov said in remarks published on Telegram. “This is an encouragement for Ukrainian terrorists.” On May 29, another attack by two drones caused an explosion in Russia’s Pskov region near the border with Belarus that left an oil pipeline’s administrative building damaged, local Governor Mikhail Vedernikov said. Ukraine has sometimes initially denied responsibility for attacks it later claimed. The New York Times reported unnamed US sources as saying Ukrainian special forces or military intelligence were behind a similar drone attack on the Kremlin on May 3. On May 27, the leader of Ukraine’s intelligence service confirmed Kyiv’s involvement in an explosion that badly damaged the Kerch Bridge, connecting Russia to Russian-occupied Crimea, seven months after it happened.  Ukraine has also denied involvement in a May 22 incursion onto Russian territory by anti-Putin Russian nationalists. The Russian commander of that raid said his group would soon return. “I think you will see us again on that side,” said Denis Kapustin at a news conference in Ukraine, describing himself as the commander of the Russian Volunteer Corps. “Every operation that takes place on the territory of Russia forces the military leadership to move a large amount of forces precisely to that quadrant, therefore laying bare some parts of the front, parts of the border,” he said. “The shaping of the battlefield is happening now for the counteroffensive,” Krummrich said. “We see the attacks behind enemy lines, we see the attacks in Russia by those militias. We see the drone attacks in Moscow. That is all shaping what is coming next,” he said, adding that the complexity was aggravating Russian decision-makers, already politically divided over a war that is not going well. “Russia now has to defend all the way back to their capital. They’re already spread thin. So, they’re going to have a lot of complex decisions to make about where to put their forces. If the last 15 months are any indicator, they will absolutely put their forces in the wrong place, and they’re going to lose,” Krummrich said. “We need to prepare for an arduous war,” Wagner boss Prigozhin said in his interview. “We are in such a condition that we could f***ing lose Russia – that is the main problem … We need to impose martial law.” Russian former President Dmitry Medvedev also sought to prepare public opinion for a long fight. “This conflict will last a very long time, most likely decades,” the RIA news agency cited Medvedev as saying during a visit to Vietnam. US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Mark Milley said Ukraine could liberate all of its territories by military means, “but probably not in the near future”, adding that such a war would be “bloody and difficult”. “Russia will not win this war militarily,” Milley said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/31/bakhmut-falls-silent-as-russia-and-ukraine-trade-air-strikes
Russia accuses US of ‘encouraging terrorists’ after Moscow strike,President Putin casts the attack as a Ukrainian attempt to intimidate Moscow residents and says the capital’s air defences will be ‘beefed up’.,"The United States is encouraging Ukraine to launch cross-border “terrorist” attacks, a Russian official alleged, after Moscow was hit by a series of drone strikes. The White House, meanwhile, said on Tuesday it did not support attacks inside Russia, and that it is still gathering information on the incident. “What are these attempts to hide behind the phrase they are ‘gathering information’?” Anatoly Antonov, Russia’s ambassador to the US, said in remarks published on the Telegram messaging channel. “This is an encouragement for Ukrainian terrorists.” Russia has long accused what it calls the “collective West” ofstaging a proxy war against Moscowby supporting Ukraine with military and financial aid. President Vladimir Putin also cast the assault, which brought the 15-month war in Ukraine to the heart of Russia, as a “terrorist act”. Ukraine, on the other hand, has accused Russia of “terrorism” for its bombing of Ukrainian civilians, allegations Moscow denies. A Ukrainian presidential aide denied Kyiv was directly involved in the drone attack on Moscow, but said Ukraine was enjoying watching events and forecast more to come.    The drone attack on Moscow exposed glaring breaches in its air defences and underlined the capital’s vulnerability, analysts said. Mark Cancian, a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, noted part of the reason why drones could make it all the way to Moscow undetected was because Russian air defences are mostly focused on fending off more sophisticated weapons. “They are oriented on missiles, ballistic missiles, regional missiles, aircraft, bombers, but not short-range drones, you know, which might be flying very low over the ground,” Cancian said. “The Russian air defence was just not designed to do this.” The Russian military will likely move some of its air assets away from the front line to help protect Moscow, Cancian said, a move that would weaken Russian troops in the face ofa Ukrainian counteroffensive. “That’s good for the Ukrainians in the sense that they’re pulling these systems away from other areas where they could be used maybe from front-line units,” he said. The attack, which lightly damaged three apartment buildings and wounded two people, angered Russia’s hardliners who scathingly criticised the military brass for failing to protect the capital – more than 500km (310 miles) from the front line in Ukraine. Putin cast the attack on Moscow as a Ukrainian attempt to intimidate its residents. He said Moscow’s air defences worked as expected, but admitted protecting a huge city is a daunting task. “It’s clear what needs to be done to beef up air defences – and we will do it,” the Russian leader said. Military watchers said the drones used in the attack were relatively crude and cheap, but could have a range of up to 1,000km (620 miles). They predicted more could follow.  Some Kremlin watchers noted Putin’s calm reaction that contrasted withangry statements from Russian hawksreflects his belief the public will not be unsettled by the attack. “Putin has talked repeatedly about the Russian people’s remarkable patience and tenacity,” Tatiana Stanovaya of the Carnegie Endowment said in a commentary. “No matter how defiant another Ukrainian attack is, Putin doesn’t think that it could provoke public discontent with the government.” James Nixey, director of the Russia and Eurasia programme at Chatham House, said the drone strikes signalled a growing Ukrainian determination to launch attacks deep inside Russia and he predicted more will come. “This is not the first and it’s not the last,” said Nixey. “The Ukrainians are in various respects flexing their muscles, seeing what they’re capable of hitting back. It is one more part of the Ukrainian play to ensure they are not just playing defence, but they can play some offence as well.” Despite loud calls for revenge, the Russian military cannot do much more than what it has done since starting the war in February 2022, Nixey noted. “The reality is that Russia does have limits in what it can do. It’s got limits on manpower, limits on its finances, limits on its artillery munitions, missiles, drones, everything,” he said. “They’re already expending all their efforts, all their monies, all their treasure, all their blood, if you like, on prosecuting their war in Ukraine.” Last week, the Russian borderregion of Belgorod was the targetof one of the most serious cross-border raids since the war began, with two pro-Ukrainian paramilitary groups claiming responsibility. The attacks also drew calls for bolstering Russia’s borders.   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/31/russia-accuses-us-of-encouraging-terrorists-after-moscow-strike
Wagner boss blasts Russia’s elite following Moscow drone attack,Russian mercenary force boss Yevgeny Prigozhin issued expletive-laden statement criticising failure to protect Moscow.,"The head ofRussia’s Wagner mercenaryforce has again criticised the Russian military and political elite following the drone attack on Moscow that injured two people, damaged property and left some furious the Kremlin had not better protected the capital city. In an expletive-drenched statement posted on Telegram by his press service on Tuesday,Yevgeny Prigozhin– whose mercenary fighters have played a key role in the war in Ukraine – blamed the drone attack on out-of-touch officials living in Moscow’s affluent suburb of Rublyovka. “You, the Defence Ministry, have done nothing to launch an offensive,” Prigozhin said. “How dare you allow the drones to reach Moscow?” “And what do ordinary people do when drones with explosives crash into their windows?” Focusing his ire on powerful residents of the upmarket Rublyovka area in Moscow’s western suburbs, Prigozhin spoke of the “scum” and “swine” who sat quietly while Moscow was attacked. In a post on Telegram after the attack on Tuesday, Alexander Khinshtein, a prominent member of Russia’s parliament from the ruling United Russia bloc, said three of the eight drones had been downed over three Rublyovka villages, one of which is located just 10 minutes drive from Russian President Vladimir Putin’s residence at Novo-Ogaryovo. Rublyovka, a patchwork of elite gated communities in the forests west of Moscow, which once boasted some of the world’s highest real-estate prices, is home to much of Russia’s political, business and cultural elite. Former President Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin have been reported to own homes in Rublyovka, alongside many of Russia’s richest business figures. A post shared by Al Jazeera English (@aljazeeraenglish) Wagner boss Prigozhin, known for his blunt and often foul language, has repeatedly cast Rublyovka’s residents as an out-of-touch elite insufficiently committed to the war in Ukraine and has blamed the top brass for Russian failures on the battlefield. Russian military blogger Igor Girkin – whom a Dutch court found guilty of the murder of 298 people who were killed when flight MH17 was shot down over Russian-controlled eastern Ukraine in 2014 – also criticised Rublyovka residents on Tuesday who, he said, had “never thought about the country”. He also chided Putin for continuing to state the war in Ukraine was a “special military operation”, despite drone attacks on the Russian capital, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW)wroteon Wednesday. Following the drone attacks,Ramzan Kadyrov,the strongman leader of the Russian province of Chechnya, urged the Kremlin to declare martial law nationwide and use all its resources in Ukraine “to sweep away that terrorist gang”. The ISW, a Washington, DC-based think tank, said that Kadyrov also warned European countries over supplying Ukraine with weapons, stating that “if they continue to supply Ukraine with weapons, they will not have the weapons needed to defend themselves when Russia ‘knocks on their doors'”. Some Kremlin watchers noted that Putin’s calm reaction to the drone attack contrasted starkly with angry statements from Russian hawks and appears to reflect his belief that the Russian public will not be unsettled by the attack. Putin said it was clear that Moscow’s air defences need to be improved against what he described as Ukrainian “terrorism”. Russia’s envoy to the United States said on Wednesday that Washington was encouraging Kyiv to carry out such attacks by not speaking out against the drone raid on Moscow. The White House said it did not support attacks inside of Russia and that it was still gathering information on the incident. “What are these attempts to hide behind the phrase that they are ‘gathering information’?” Russian ambassador to Washington Anatoly Antonov said in remarks published on the Telegram messaging channel. “This is an encouragement for Ukrainian terrorists,” he said. Though not commenting specifically on the Moscow drone attacks, the United Kingdom’s Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said on Tuesday that Ukraine had the right to attack targets on Russian territory for the purpose of self-defence. “Ukraine does have the legitimate right to defend itself,” Cleverly said during a press conference with his Estonian counterpart Margus Tsahkna in Estonia’s capital Tallinn.    “It has the legitimate right to do so within its own borders, of course, but it does also have the right to project force beyond its borders to undermine Russia’s ability to project force into Ukraine itself,” he said. “So legitimate military targets beyond its own border are part of Ukraine’s self-defence. And we should recognise that,” he added. Ukrainian forces shelled a Russian town close to the border for the third time in a week on Wednesday, damaging buildings and setting vehicles on fire, the governor of the region said on Wednesday. At least one person was injured during the artillery strike on Shebekino, Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said. A Ukrainian drone also sparked a fire at the Afipsky oil refinery in southern Russia on Wednesday, the governor of Russia’s Krasnodar region said. The fire was soon extinguished and there were no casualties, Governor Veniamin Kondratyev said on the Telegram messaging app. The Afipsky refinery is not far from the Black Sea port of Novorossiisk, near another refinery that has been attacked several times this month.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/31/wagner-boss-blasts-russias-elite-following-moscow-drone-attack
"NATO launches Arctic exercises, pledges protection of Finland","NATO aircraft and troops from Norway, the UK, US and Sweden are participating in Arctic exercises","NATO countries have kicked off military exercises with a pledge to defend theirnewest member, Finland, which is hosting its first joint training in the Arctic region since becoming part of the Western alliance in April. Nearly 1,000 allied forces from Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States – as well as NATO applicant Sweden – joined approximately 6,500 Finnish troops and some 1,000 vehicles for exercises this week, which mark Finland’s biggest modern-time land-force drill above the Arctic Circle. Overseeing NATO exercises just a two-hour drive from the Russian border at one of Europe’s largest artillery training grounds in Rovajarvi, northern Finland, US Army Major-General Gregory Anderson from the 10th Mountain Division said his country stood ready to defend Finland. “We are here, we are committed. The US Army is here training with our newest NATO ally to build that capability, to help defend Finland if anything happened,” Anderson said on Tuesday. Some 150 aircraft from 14 NATO members and partner countries are also participating in Arctic Challenge 2023 exercises, according to NATO Air Command. The objective of#ACE23is to train participating forces to conduct dissimilar aircraft combat in large composite air operations safely and effectively.The 🇺🇸 48th Fighter Wing heritage F-15E Strike Eagle is also part of the ACE23 fighting force.@HQUSAFEAFAF@NATO_AIRCOMpic.twitter.com/QmSB9LDrYJ — Ilmavoimat (@FinnishAirForce)May 30, 2023  Theaddition of Finlandto the NATO bloc has more than doubled the length of the border the military alliance shares with Russia amid increasing tension between Moscow and the West following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. “It’s of no question at all. We have prepared plans on what to do if we are to be part of the defence of Finland,” said Major-General Karl Engelbrektson, commander of the Swedish land forces. Sweden is Finland’s closest military partner and it was Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that convinced Sweden and Finland last year to ditch long-held policies of military non-alignment and seek the security of NATO’s collective defence commitment. Finland formally joined NATO on April 4, drawing a threat from Moscow of “counter-measures”. Sweden hopes to be a NATO member by the time of the alliance’s summit in Vilnius, Lithuania in July.    Sweden has been what NATO describes as an “official invitee” since 2022, which allows attendance at meetings and the coordinating of activities with other NATO allies. Full membership will take place once all NATO allies haveratified Sweden’s accessionapplication, the bloc has said. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg voiced guarded optimism on Tuesday that Sweden’s accession by the July 11-12 NATO summit was “within reach”. “There are no guarantees but it’s absolutely possible to reach a solution and enable the decision on full membership for Sweden by then,” Stoltenberg told reporters in Oslo on the eve of a NATO foreign ministers’ meeting to prepare for the summit. Turkeyratified Finland’s NATO membershipbut has yet to do so for Sweden. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says Sweden has not yet met all of his country’s demands on securing his support for membership, particularly because of what he sees as Sweden providing safe haven to members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and the Democratic Union Party (PYD) in Syria, both of which Ankara considers “terrorists”.    Ilmari Laukkanen, a 20-year-old Finnish conscript who operated a field gun in the exercise but in his civilian life works looking after a family farm near the Russian border, said he would be ready to fight for Finland’s new allies if needs be. “Of course, I would. If we are given something good then we give in return,” Laukkanen told the Reuters news agency.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/31/nato-launches-arctic-exercises-pledges-protection-of-finland

"‘Time is now’ for Sweden to join NATO, Blinken says","Top US diplomat urges Turkey to approve Sweden accession to alliance, says Washington committed to Stockholm’s security.","The United States has urged Turkey to approve Sweden’s accession into NATO, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken saying that “the time is now” for the northern European country to join the alliance. Speaking alongside Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson on Tuesday, the top US diplomat said Sweden has been qualified to join NATO “from day one” and has taken significant steps to address Turkey’s “legitimate” security concerns. “From the perspective of the United States, the time is now to finalise Sweden’s accession,” Blinken told reporters in the northern Swedish city of Lulea. Sweden and neighbouring Finland started seekingNATO membershiplast year after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The US-led alliance has a collective defence pact, meaning an attack on one member is considered an attack on all. All members of NATO have to agree to allow new countries into the bloc. Finlandofficially joinedthe alliance last month, but Sweden’s application is still pending.    Hungary and Turkey have not ratified Sweden’s accession, though Ankara is seen as the main hurdle. Turkey has accused Sweden of providing a safe haven to members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which it considers a “terrorist” group. In June of last year, Turkey, Sweden and Finland signed a so-called trilateral memorandum to address Ankara’s grievances about banned armed groups. Turkey, however, says Sweden has not fulfilled all of its commitments in the agreement. An IslamophobicQuran-burning protestin Stockholm in January — which the government condemned — further strained ties between the two countries. “Turkey has raised important and legitimate concerns. Sweden and Finland both addressed those concerns. And so, the time to move forward is now. We’d like to see that happen before the Vilnius summit,” Blinken said on Tuesday, referring to a NATO meeting in the Lithuanian capital in July. Earlier this week, US President Joe Biden said he discussed Sweden’s NATO bid with his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan,who won re-electionon Sunday. They also spoke about Turkey’s push to buy F-16s, a model of US fighter jet. “I congratulated Erdogan. He still wants to work on something on the F-16s. I told him we wanted a deal with Sweden, so let’s get that done,”Biden told reporterson Monday. On Tuesday, Blinken said the Biden administration does not see the $20bn F-16 deal and Sweden’s NATO bid as connected, but he warned that some US lawmakers do. “Some members of Congress … are linking Sweden’s accession to NATO to the moving forwardon the F-16s. Congress is a fully equal and independent branch of government,” he said.  “Their voice and their vote in any such decisions, of course, is critical.” Congress can veto arms deals approved by the administration, though it has never successfully blocked weapon sales to foreign countries.    Regardless of Sweden’s NATO status, Blinken added on Tuesday, the US will back its security. “We and our allies are both committed to and well-positioned tohelp Swedenaddress its security needs, irrespective of whether accession happens tomorrow or in two weeks or in a few weeks after that,” he said. For his part, Kristersson, the Swedish prime minister, said his country is moving forward with fulfilling its pledges to its “Turkish friends” in accordance with the trilateral memorandum. “We have always recognised the fact that every NATO ally has to make its own decision, and only Turkey can make Turkey’s decisions, and we fully respect that,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/30/time-is-now-for-sweden-to-join-nato-blinken-says
Opposition sues South Africa government to force Putin arrest,The ICC warrant to arrest Putin has launched a debate in South Africa which now faces a diplomatic dilemma ahead of the BRICS summit.,"South Africa’s leading opposition party said on Tuesday it had taken legal action to force the government to arrest Russian President Vladimir Putin if he were to attend a planned summit in the country. In March, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant against Putin – over accusations that Russia unlawfully deported Ukrainian children – who is to visit Cape Town for a Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) bloc meeting in August. On Tuesday, the Democratic Alliance (DA) party said it launched a court application to ensure the government detains the Russian leader and hands him over to the ICC “should President Putin set foot in South Africa.” “This pre-emptory court action aims to ensure that South Africa upholds its obligations,” DA shadow justice minister Glynnis Breytenbach said in a statement. An ICC member, South Africa, which has close diplomatic ties with Moscow, is now in a diplomatic dilemma. “We will explore various options with regard to how the Rome Statute was domesticated in our country including the option to look at extending customary diplomatic immunity to visiting heads of state in our country,” justice minister Ronald Lamola said in May. Breytenbach said the DA was seeking a “declaratory order” to avoid a repeat of 2015 when Pretoria failed to arrest then-Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, who was similarly wanted by the ICC. South Africa threatened to pull out of the ICC at the time but ended proceedings to do so due to legal barriers. Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov on Tuesday declined to say whether Putin will travel to South Africa for the summit. “Russia will be duly represented,” Peskov said, adding Moscow expected its BRICS partners “not be guided” by “illegitimate decisions” such as the ICC arrest warrant. The DA’s legal action comes as the government granted diplomatic immunity to officials attending a BRICS foreign ministers meeting this week and the grouping’s heads of state summit in August. Some read the move as a preparatory step to provide legal cover for Putin’s visit — something Pretoria has denied. “These immunities do not override any warrant that may have been issued by any international tribunal against any attendee of the conference,” South Africa’s foreign affairs department said in a statement. Their issuing was “standard” procedure for the hosting of international conferences, it said. South Africa has refused to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, saying it wants to stay neutral and prefers dialogue to end the war. Earlier this month, President Cyril Ramaphosa said his country has been under “extraordinary pressure” to pick sides in the  conflict, following accusations it has tilted towards the Kremlin.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/30/opposition-sues-south-africa-government-to-force-putin-arrest
"After drone attack, fears, anger and a sense of calm in Moscow",Russians reel from a rare drone attack which Putin says was aimed at civilian targets.,"On Tuesday morning, at least eight attackdrones entered Moscow’sairspace before being shot down by the city’s air defences, a few hitting residential buildings on the way down. The Russian government accused Ukraine of a “terrorist attack”, which Kyiv officials wryly denied. “You know, we are being drawn into the era of artificial intelligence. Perhaps not all drones are ready to attack Ukraine and want to return to their creators and ask them questions like: ‘Why are you sending us [to hit] the children of Ukraine? In Kyiv?’” Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said on the YouTube breakfast show of exiled Russian journalist Alexander Plushev. President Vladimir Putin said the attack was aimed at “civilian targets” with the goal of frightening Russians. But some Muscovites are unfazed, even though Tuesday’s assault came after a recent incursion intoBelgorod, a Russian region bordering Ukraine, and a drone attack aimed at theKremlin. “Yep, those are Ukrainian UFOs buzzing around us,” a banker in his 30s in the Russian capital, who requested anonymity, told Al Jazeera. “It’s still pretty calm here; there’s no fuss, but don’t forget how they gracefully landed by theKremlinas well. So the ‘great plan’ [for the invasion of Ukraine] turned out to be so-so – I wonder how the public will react further.” On his Telegram feed, Moscow mayor Sergey Sobyanin said two people were injured but “nobody needed hospitalisation”. After targeted buildings were inspected, residents who had fled began returning to their homes. “It sounded like a motorbike,” a witness said, in comments carried by the popular Russian channel Shot on the Telegram messaging app. “Then there were two claps, and the smell of kerosene,” said the woman. “We live on the fourth floor and felt some heavy object hitting the building, which forced us to get up and have a look.” As some in the capital reeled, questions are being asked about security. “Stinking beasts, what are you doing?” Yevgeny Prigozhin, the chief of Russia’s force of Wagner mercenaries, raged on his Telegram channel, blaming Russian officials, with whom he has had frequent public disagreements, for failing to stop the attack. “You are the Department of Defence. You didn’t do a damn thing to step up. Why the f*** are you allowing these drones to fly to Moscow? The fact that they are flying to your homes in Rublyovka [a posh neighbourhood] … to hell with it! Let your houses burn. What will ordinary people do when explosive drones crash through their windows?” Parliamentary deputy Maxim Ivanov described it as the most serious attack on the nation’s capital since World War II. “The morning attack on Moscow is the most serious since the time when the Nazi invader in 1941 trampled our land on the outskirts of the capital,” Ivanov wrote on Telegram, although Moscow has suffered several deadly bombings and hostage incidents since then. The bloodiest example is the 1999 apartment bombings, in which at least 300 people were killed in attacks blamed on Chechen rebels. “You will either defeat the enemy as a single fist with our Motherland, or the indelible shame of cowardice, collaboration and betrayal will engulf your family,” said Ivanov.    Other politicians were less melodramatic. Lawmaker Alexander Khinshtein said that “a new reality … needs to be realised.” “Undoubtedly, the sabotage and terrorist attacks of Ukraine will only increase,” he wrote on Telegram, “and it is necessary to radically strengthen defence and security measures, especially in terms of countering drones.” That eight drones were shot down was “remarkable”, he said. “But this should not reassure anyone. Don’t underestimate the enemy!” The influential military analysis channel Rybar, which has more than a million subscribers on Telegram, speculated that Ukraine was behind the attack, that it was aided by the United Kingdom, and that it was an attempted attack on military installations. “We do not believe the Ukrainians intentionally launch UAVs at residential buildings in Moscow. Not because Ukrainians are so innocent and cuddly, it’s quite the opposite – give them free rein, they will turn all of Russia into dust. But because the decision on such strikes is made not by the Ukrainians, but by the British. There are enough objects in Moscow that Ukrainian formations could aim at. Residential buildings as a target, to put it mildly, are not militarily justified,” it said. Andrey Medvedev, a journalist and official of the local Moscow parliament, suggested the attack was aimed at boosting morale among Ukrainians – and among Kyiv’s Western partners. “The UAV raid on Moscow was quite predictable. But it seems that this time the Armed Forces of Ukraine prepared it in a hurry … The urgency was due to the need to somehow change the information agenda in Ukraine. Does this seriously affect the course of the war? Absolutely not,” he said on Telegram. “But yes, the enemy’s PR campaign turned out quite well. True, I repeat, for internal use and for the collective CNN. There, all the Western media, lining up like a pig, go on the attack and write about chaos and panic in the Russian capital and the Moscow region. In general, it should be understood that a UAV PR attack will now, in principle, be accompanied by disinformation on social networks and online chats. [They will say] that in fact, another 10 UAVs ended up, say, in a military hospital, but the authorities are hiding it, and so on. Information hygiene is such [an important] thing.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/30/drone-attack-on-moscow-raises-questions-about-security-in-russia
"Ukrainians can’t sleep as Russia hits Kyiv, but morale stays high","Wartime noise from wailing drones to exploding missiles keeps Ukrainians up, and united against Moscow.","Kyiv, Ukraine– A smoking piece of a Russian cruise missile fell just metres away from Lyudmila Lopashchenko near a book market in northern Kyiv. The fragment belonged to an Iskander, one of the 11 hypersonic ballistic missiles Moscowlaunchedon the Ukrainian capital on Monday morning, in a rare daytime attack. Lopashchenko did not flinch, did not rush to the cool, breezy safety of a nearby subway station that has served as a bomb shelter since the Russia-Ukraine war began. “We got used to it all,” the 57-year-old told Al Jazeera, as she waited for a bus in central Kyiv on Tuesday. “No one is hiding anymore.” To her – and many others in the city whose pre-war population stood at 3.6 million – Tuesday was business as usual, even after Kyiv woke up to a fourth attack in just three days. It was the 17th barrage this month in the Ukrainian capital as Moscow keeps changing tactics by varying the direction of attacks, the timing, and the number of cruise missiles and drones. According to Ukrainian officials, some were fired from Russia’s Black Sea fleet in annexed Crimea, some from bombers and fighter jets that flow up in western Russia without entering Ukraine’s airspace and send their missiles low to avoid detection. Moscow wants to “confuse and mislead our air defence”, air force spokesman Yurii Ihnat said in televised remarks on Sunday. The results were painful. A 33-year-old woman was killed on Tuesday morning – only because she came out to the balcony of her apartment in a high-rise building to watch the attack, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said. Thirteen more people were wounded, and the debris from shot-down drones and missiles caused fires in several apartment buildings and private houses, officials said.  To many Kyivans, the most harrowing sound that keeps them awake and horrified at night is the wailing ofIranian-made Shahed drones– that are mockingly dubbed “mopeds” here. “It is so scary,” Olena Tkachenko, a nurse who lives on the 16th floor of a tall building in the Holosiivskyi distriсt in southwestern Kyiv, where destroyed Shaheds often fall, told Al Jazeera. “I am much calmer at work” because her office is in central Kyiv, she said. But then the wailing is drowned out by the louder, faster bangs of Kyiv’s air defence systems. Their most precious part is a handful of advanced, United States-made surface-to-air Patriot missile systems. They can target planes, cruise missiles and shorter-ranger ballistic missiles such as Iskanders – and their whereabouts are top secret. The White Houseagreedto supply Patriots to Ukraine in October, and Germany and the Netherlands soon followed suit by sending their slightly older systems to Ukraine. Their collective decision maddened Moscow – especially after Patriots showed overwhelming success. On May 4, they managed to shoot down a Kinzhal (“Dagger”), Russia’s newest hypersonic air-launched ballistic missile. Russian President Vladimir Putin unveiled them with much pomp in 2018, calling them “super weapons” whose speed exceeds that of sound 10 times. “Their power can be enormous, and their speed makes them invulnerable to today’s missile defence and air defence systems,” Putin said at the time. In the hands of the Ukrainian military, the Patriots proved Putin utterly wrong, defence analysts say. “Putin personally presented them as an invulnerable weapon that can’t be shot down and hits the target 100 percent of the time,” Lieutenant General Ihor Romanenko, former deputy chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, told Al Jazeera. “Both claims were disavowed,” he said. To many Ukrainians, the late-night bangs of Patriots symbolise the imminent victory over Moscow. “They wanted to seize us, but they can’t overpower us,” Pavel Vichenskiy, a businessman from the town of Bila Tserkva some 80km (50 miles) south of Kyiv, told Al Jazeera. The 38-year-old didn’t always think that way. When he woke up to the sound of explosions on February 24, 2022, the war’s first day, he thought Russia would seize Ukraine – because of Ukraine’s endemic “corruption” that weakened its armed forces and defence capabilities, he said. But by late March, Moscow withdrew its badly battered troops from around Kyiv and all of northern Ukraine – and he understood Ukraine would not fall. More than a year later, an observer compares today’s stoicism to the final, fifth stage of the Kubler-Ross model of overcoming grief. “During the war’s first stage, there was denial. Then anger. Every shelling caused anger: ‘How can they do it!’” Aleksey Kushch, a Kyiv-based analyst, told Al Jazeera. “Then came bargaining: if we don’t respond, maybe they will bomb us less. Then there were depression and apathy. Now, there is acceptance. Just like the coronavirus, ageing, cold, heat – an external factor one has to co-exist with,” he said. Tuesday brought news about Ukraine’s possible response to the question Kyiv’s mayor asked a day earlier. “If the Russians can make Kyiv a nightmare, why do the people of Moscow rest?” Mayor Klitschko asked rhetorically. A day later, at least eight attack drones struckresidential areas in Moscow, damaging buildings along the central Leninsky Avenue. The Kremlin sugar-coated the news. “We’re talking about the response of Kyiv’s regime to our very effective strikes on one of their decision-making centres,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. But to the founder and owner of the Wagner Group private military force, the development was catastrophic. “You stinking critters, what are you doing?” Yevgeny Prigozhin asked on Telegram in an expletive-ridden rant addressing the Russian Defence Ministry. And Ukrainian officials habitually denied their role in the attacks – and trolled the Kremlin. “Perhaps, not all drones are ready to attack Ukraine and want to return to their creators and, correspondingly, ask questions [such as] ‘Why are you sending us on Ukrainian children, on Kyiv and so on?'” President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s aide Mykhailo Podolyak said in televised remarks.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/30/they-cant-overpower-us-kyivans-on-russian-shellings
"Drone attacks hit Moscow, sparking fury at the Kremlin","Two are injured in a rare attack on Moscow as more heavy Russian raids target Kyiv, killing at least one person.","Drones struck Moscow on Tuesday but were neutralised, Russia said, in what one politician called the worst attack on the capital since World War II, while Kyiv was also hit from the air for the third time in 24 hours. Since Russia invaded its neighbour in February last year, the war has largely been fought inside Ukraine, though Moscow has reported some attacks on its territory and blamed them on Ukraine, including an alleged assassination attempt against President Vladimir Putin. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said two people were injured, but not seriously, while some residents in two lightly damaged apartment blocks were briefly evacuated. Russia’s defence ministry said eight drones sent by Kyiv were shot down or diverted, though Baza, a Telegram channel with links to the security services, said more than 25 were involved. Residents in southwestern Moscow said they heard loud bangs followed by the smell of petrol at about 5am to 6am local time [02:00 to 03:00 GMT]. Some filmed a drone being shot down and a plume of smoke rising over the Moscow skyline. Politician Maxim Ivanov termed it the most serious assault on Moscow since the Nazis, saying no citizen could now avoid “the new reality”. “You will either defeat the enemy as a single fist with our Motherland, or the indelible shame of cowardice, collaboration and betrayal will engulf your family,” he said. Two weeks ago, two drones exploded over theKremlinin an attack Russia also blamed on Kyiv and said was aimed at Putin. Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak denied Kyiv was directly involved in targeting Moscow on Tuesday, though he said “we are pleased to watch” and forecast more to come. Russia’s defence ministry cast the assault as a “terrorist drone attack” launched by the “Kyiv regime”. In Kyiv, Ukrainian defence forces said they shot down more than 20 Iranian-made Shahed drones on Tuesday. One person died – reportedly a 30-year-old woman, and four were injured when debris from a destroyed Russian projectile hit a high-rise apartment building causing a fire, Ukrainian officials said. Two upper floors were destroyed with people possibly still under rubble. Photos from Kyiv officials showed flames engulfing the top of the building. “The attack was massive, came from different directions, in several waves,” said Serhiy Popko, head of Kyiv’s military administration. Russia has attacked Kyiv 17 times in May with drones or missiles, mostly at night, in an apparent attempt to undermine Ukrainians’ will to fight after more than 15 months of war. Al Jazeera’s Natacha Butler, reporting from Kyiv, said: “Where I am right now is an apartment block that was hit, the top two floors pretty much nearly destroyed. “At the foot of this apartment block is a cleanup process. People are inspecting their cars that are damaged, trying to absorb what has happened. They are looking up at the top of the building, the windows are nearly blown up. A lot of [residents] are going to have to leave this building with their suitcases, their pets. Some of them are saying they don’t want to leave, they’re happy they have survived. “This is the worst nightmare for people here in Kyiv. These attacks have been going on night after night now. This is the third consecutive attack now. People are not sleeping. But every night, when they do go to sleep, they hear those sirens, they hear the explosions and they just don’t know what will happen.” In Moscow, journalist Yulia Shapovalova, said there was a sense of “calm” in the capital despite the attacks. “Moscow is buzzing as usual now. People are going to work, public transport is functioning normally, it seems like nothing happened. “People on the street are very calm, but I should tell you many people in Russia sincerely believe the information they regularly hear on TV, that the conflicts between Russia and Ukraine have been inevitable and that President [Vladimir] Putin, as a great strategist, began it first on foreign soil.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/30/drone-attack-on-moscow-causes-minor-damage-no-casualties-mayor
Ukraine-Russia border ‘demilitarised zone’ floated for peace deal,Adviser to Ukraine’s presidential office Mykhailo Podolyak said the demilitarised zone should be between 100-120km wide.,"A demilitarised zone between 100 and 120 kilometres wide (62 to 75 miles) should be established in Russian border territory with Ukraine as part of any post-war settlement, an adviser to Ukraine’s presidential office has said. Mykhailo Podolyak, the adviser to the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, said the demilitarised zone should cover the Russian regions of Belgorod, Bryansk, Kursk and Rostov in order to protect adjacent territories in Ukraine. “To ensure real security for residents of Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Luhansk, and Donetsk regions and protect them from shelling, it will be necessary to introduce a demilitarisation zone of 100-120km,” Podolyak wrote in a tweet on Monday. Such a zone,which cannot be used or occupied by military forces, would likely require “a mandatory international control contingent at the first stage”, Podolyak said. A demilitarised zone should be a “key topic” of a post-war settlement, said the presidential adviser, who has 1.2 million Twitter followers, adding that such a buffer would “prevent the recurrence of aggression in the future”. The key topic of the post-war settlement should be the establishment of safeguards to prevent a recurrence of aggression in the future.

An aide to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also said on Monday that Ukraine had no interest in any ceasefire that locks in Russian territorial gains. Chief diplomatic adviser Ihor Zhovkva also pushed back against international peace initiatives from China, Brazil, the Vatican and South Africa, saying that the time for mediation with Moscow had passed. “In this period of open war, we don’t need any mediators. It’s too late for mediation,” he said. “There cannot be a Brazilian peace plan, a Chinese peace plan, a South African peace plan when you are talking about the war in Ukraine,” Zhovkva said in an interview with the Reuters news agency. Russia has said it is open to peace talks with Kyiv, which stalled a few months into the invasion. But Moscow also insists that any talks be based on “new realities”, meaning recognition of the annexation of five Ukrainian provinces it fully or partly controls – a condition Kyiv will not accept.    China has touted a 12-point vision for peace, which calls for a ceasefire but does not condemn the invasion or oblige Russia to withdraw from occupied territories. Beijing, which has close ties with Russia’s leadership,sent top envoy Li Hui to Kyiv and Moscowthis month to encourage peace talks. Zhovkva said the envoy was briefed in detail on the situation on the battlefield, at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, the power grid and the transfer of Ukrainian children to Russia, which Kyiv says is a Russian war crime. “He listened very attentively. There was no immediate response … we will see. China is a wise country, which understands its role in international affairs,” Zhovkva said.    The Institute for the Study of War, a think tank based in Washington, DC, said on Monday that China’s foreign ministry had denied a report in the Wall Street Journal newspaper that China’s special representative on Eurasian affairs had urged European officials to attempt to end the war in Ukraine before it escalated or consider recognising  Russian annexed territory in Ukraine. China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning denied the report, adding that Ukraine was now at a “critical juncture” and China would continue to work with all parties to resolve the crisis, the institute reported.

"Kyiv fends off latest Russian air attack, Zelenskyy lauds defence",Latest attack comes just hours after President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praises Ukraine’s air defence units for saving lives.,"Russia has launched a wave of air attacks on Kyiv just hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked the country’s air defence units for saving hundreds of lives byshooting down a barrage of Russian drones and missilesaimed at the capital and other locations. In the early hours of Tuesday morning, air defence systems in Kyiv were engaged in shooting down incoming targets, city officials said, as air raid sirens blared in several regions. “A massive attack!” Kyiv’s Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on the Telegram messaging app. “Do not leave shelters.” Klitschko said that a 27-year-old woman was taken to hospital after sustaining injuries in southwestern Holosiivskyi district. He later reported that one person had been killed in the latest Russian air attack. Kyiv’s military administration officials said that air defence systems were engaging and destroying the incoming projectiles and falling debris had hit several districts of the capital, including the historic Podil and Pecherskyi neighbourhoods.     Residents of a high-rise apartment building were being evacuated early on Tuesday after falling debris sparked a fire, Klitschko said. Calling it a “massive” attack launched in several waves, Serhii Popko, the head of Kyiv’s military administration, said on the Telegram messaging app that Russia conducted the assault using Iranian-made Shahed drones and that more than 20 had been shot down. Tuesday’s attack – the third in 24 hours – marks Russia’s 17th aerial assaulton the capital this month, following two attacks on Monday, which included a rare daytime strike that had forced people to seek shelter underground and sent schoolchildren fleeing Kyiv’s streets for safety. Kyiv. Morning after sleepless night under fire. Anxiety once again…Children running and screaming for shelter to the sounds of explosions. But it should not be like this – anywhere and never. Fear cannot be turned off – but we do not stop, we act. Ukraine continues to fight 🇺🇦pic.twitter.com/wTKS3sv6qi — Олена Зеленська (@ZelenskaUA)May 29, 2023  In his nightly address on Monday, Zelenskyy said that while some of the Russian aerial attacks, which he branded “evil”, had managed to get through Ukraine’s defences, most of the drones and missiles had been shot down. “The world must see that terror is losing,” the Ukrainian leader said, calling for more help to further improve the country’s defences. “There is no greater humiliation for a terrorist state than the success of our warriors,” he added on a day that saw 11 ballistic and cruise missiles fired by Russia at Kyiv shot down by Ukraine’s air defences, according to Ukraine’s commander-in-chief of armed forces, Valerii Zaluzhnyi. The Institute for the Study of War, a think tank based in Washington, DC, said overnight on Sunday and Monday, and during the daytime attack on Monday, Russia had launched 11 Iskander ballistic missiles, 38 Shahed drones, and 40 cruise missiles. The air attack campaign signals that Russia is attempting to weaken Ukraine’s ability to launch an anticipated offensive to reclaim territory lost to Russia, but the “prioritisation of targeting Kyiv is likely further limiting the campaign’s ability to meaningfully constrain potential Ukrainian counteroffensive actions,” the institute said. Yuriy Ihnat, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s air force, suggested that US-provided Patriot anti-missile systems were behind the successful interception of incoming Iskander ballistic missiles and other weapons.    “I think you can guess,” Ihnat told Ukrainian television. “If Iskander-M missiles are intercepted, you can draw conclusions about the means that specifically targeted the objectives – ballistic targets.” Zelenskyy also singled out the Patriot system in his Monday night message, saying that with such defences, “terror will be defeated”. The world needs to see that terror is losing. When Patriots in the hands of Ukrainians ensure one hundred percent downing of any Russian missiles, terror is losing.

Ukraine’s parliament approves sanctions against Russia ally Iran,"Package imposes trade, financial and technology sanctions against Iran and stops Tehran from using Ukraine’s airspace.","The Ukrainian parliament has approved a sanctions package against Iran, a Russian ally it accuses of sending weapons to Moscow during its more than year-long invasion of Ukraine. The measures were approved on Monday, a day after Ukraine saidRussia usedIranian-made Shahed drones in the largest such attack on the capital, Kyiv, since the beginning of the invasion. “The resolution synchronises Ukrainian sanctions with the actions of the entire civilised world on the path to the complete isolation of Iran,” the Ukrainian parliament said on its website. The new regulations include a ban on exports of “military and dual-use goods” to Iran and the “suspension of economic and financial obligations in favour of residents of Iran”. The package would also stop Iranian goods transiting through Ukraine and it planes through Ukraine’s airspace as well as imposing trade, financial and technology sanctions against Iran and its citizens. The legislation still needs to be signed into law by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which is a formality because the Ukrainian leader submitted the bill himself. Zelenskyy last week appealed directly to Iranians, asking: “Why do you want to be accomplices in Russian terror?” Tehran struck back, calling Zelensky’s comments a “political show” that had no value. “This repeat of empty claims by the Ukrainian president against the Islamic Republic of Iran means going along with the anti-Iranian media war that is done with the goal of receiving more arms and financial help from Western countries,” foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani said on Saturday. In November, the Iranian governmentconfirmedfor the first time that it had sold drones to Russia but said this was “months” before the start of the war in Ukraine in February 2022. Ukraine said on Sunday that Moscow had staged the largest drone attack to date on Ukraine overnight, using 54 Iranian-made drones.

Lavrov in surprise Kenya visit after Ukraine FM trip to Africa,The visits come as global powers continue to tussle for influence on the continent of 1.3 billion people.,"Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met Kenyan leaders on Monday on a surprise visit to Nairobi, as Moscow and Kyiv both seek to bolster support from African nations over the war in Ukraine. “During our visit, we will discuss our cooperation in the trade, investment and economic spheres, humanitarian and cultural questions, education, cooperation in the UN and many other issues,” Lavrov told Kenyan lawmakers, according to the Russian foreign ministry. The trip was not announced in advance. The Russian official has visited Africa several times in the past year, as global powerstussle for influenceon the continent of 1.3 billion people. Lavrov’s trip to Kenya comes on the heels of a trip to the continent last week by his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba. Foreign Minister Kuleba visited Ethiopia, Morocco and Rwanda, but also met with current African Union (AU) Chair and Comoros President Azali Assoumani as well as AU Commission Chairman Moussa Faki Mahamat. The Ukrainian official called for certain African nations to end their neutral stances over the 15-month-old war in Ukraine and announced a push by Kyiv to intensify its ties with the continent. “We speak with our African friends, trying to explain to them that neutrality is not the answer,” Kuleba said at a press conference on Wednesday in Addis Ababa, home of the African Union. He also announced in a statement the following day that Ukraine planned to open more embassies in Africa and stage a summit with the continent’s leaders. Meanwhile, a Russia-Africa summit, the second in a series, is to be held in Saint Petersburg from July 26 to 29. Russia has ties with African countries that can be traced to the Cold War, when the Soviet Union rendered support in the form of arms and funding to liberation movements on the continent. In February, 22 of the AU’s 54 member states abstained or did not vote on a United Nations General Assembly resolution that called for Russia to withdraw from Ukraine. Two of them – Eritrea and Mali – even voted against the resolution.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/29/lavrov-in-shock-kenya-visit-days-after-ukraine-fm-trip-to-africa
US Senator Lindsey Graham on Russia wanted list after war remarks,Russia’s Investigative Committee says it is opening a criminal investigation into comments made by Republican senator.,"Russia has put United States Senator Lindsey Graham on a wanted list, according to Russian media reports citing the interior ministry’s database. Ukraine’s presidential office on Friday released an edited video of a meeting between Graham and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy which first showed the senator saying, “The Russians are dying”, and then that US support was the “best money we’ve ever spent”. After Russia criticised the comments, Ukraine released a full video of the interaction, showing that the two remarks were not linked. On Sunday, Russia’s Investigative Committee said it was opening a criminal investigation into Graham’s comments, without specifying what crime he was accused of. Russia has previously sanctioned dozens of US officials and politicians but has rarely sought the arrest of senior officeholders. Graham disputed Russia’s criticism of his support for Ukraine by saying he had praised the spirit of Ukrainians in resisting Russia’s invasion with US assistance. He struck a more defiant tone on Twitter, writing that he would wear the “arrest warrant” as a “badge of honor”. “To know that my commitment to Ukraine has drawn the ire of [President Vladimir] Putin’s regime brings me immense joy,” Graham posted. He also challenged Russian authorities to pursue their case at the International Criminal Court, which has previously issued anarrest warrantfor Putin. “Come and make your best case,” he quipped. “See you in The Hague!” I will wear the arrest warrant issued by Putin’s corrupt and immoral government as a Badge of Honor. 🏅https://t.co/0L2I5PfuoM — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC)May 29, 2023  Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev called the 67-year-old Republican an “old fool”. “The old fool Senator Lindsey Graham said that the United States has never spent money so successfully as on the murder of Russians,” Medvedev said. “He shouldn’t have done that.” In an emailed statement to the Reuters news agency, Graham responded to Medvedev’s comments and said, “As usual, the Russian propaganda machine is hard at work.” He added: “Mr. Medvedev, if you want Russians to stop dying in Ukraine, withdraw. Stop the invasion. Stop the war crimes. The truth is that you and Putin could care less about Russian soldiers.” During his visit to Kyiv on Friday, Graham told Zelenskyy that Ukraine’s resistance reminded him of “our better selves in America. There was a time in America that we were this way, fighting to the last person, we were going to be free or die.” “Now you are free,” Zelenskyy responded, to which Graham replied: “And the Russians are dying.” “Yes, but they came to our territory. We are not fighting on their territory,” Zelenskyy said. The US has given Ukraine military assistance valued at a total of $38bn since the war began in February 2022. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov suggested that Graham’s praise of US financial backing was linked to his comments that Russians were dying. “It is difficult to imagine a greater shame for a country than having such senators,” Peskov said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/29/us-senator-lindsey-graham-on-russia-wanted-list-after-war-remarks
Explosions as Russia launches 15th air assault on Kyiv in May,Overnight missile attack comes a day after Russia unleashed its largest ever drone assault on the Ukrainian capital.,"Several explosions have rocked the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, according to officials, in the 15th Russian air attack on the city this month and the second overnight attack in a row. “A missile shot down near Kyiv,” Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on the Telegram messaging channel in the early hours of Monday. “Air defence working!” He added that blasts were heard in several districts of the city, including Kyiv’s historic neighbourhood of Podil, where falling debris damaged the roof of a house. According to preliminary information from the mayor and the city’s military administration, there were no casualties in the overnight attacks. The attack on Monday, appearing to be a combination of missiles and drones, followsthe largest drone barrage launched on Kyivthe previous night, which killed one person and wounded several more. Officials said the city’s air defences shot down 40 drones in and around the capital in the early hours of Sunday. Most of the drones were Iranian-made Shahed loitering munitions, the Kyiv Independent news website reported. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked the country’s air defence forces for protecting the country and asked its parliament to impose sanctions against Iran for supplying Russia with weapons, including the Shahed drones. Waves of Russian attacks against Ukraine now come several times a week. The full scale of Monday’s attack is not immediately known. The Reuters news agency reported several loud blasts when the city and the rest of Ukraine were under air raid alerts in the early hours of Monday. With a long-promisedUkrainian counteroffensive loomingto recapture territory taken by Russia since it began its full-scale invasion 15 months ago, Moscow has intensified its attacks, targeting military infrastructure and supplies.

The attack is massive!” the mayor said on Telegram. The pre-dawn attacks came on the last Sunday of May when the capital celebrates Kyiv Day, the anniversary of its official founding 1,541 years ago. The day is typically marked by street fairs, live concerts and special museum exhibitions – plans which have been made for this year as well, but on a smaller scale. “The history of Ukraine is a longstanding irritant for the insecure Russians,” Andriy Yermak, the head of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s office, said on his Telegram channel. Several districts of Kyiv, the largest Ukrainian city with a population of nearly three million, suffered in the overnight attacks, officials said, including the historical Pecherskyi neighbourhood.    As the air raid alerts started soon after midnight, many people stood on their balconies, the Reuters news agency reported, with some screaming offensives directed at Russia’s President Vladimir Putin and “Glory to air defence” slogans. With aUkrainian counteroffensive looming15 months into the war, Moscow has intensified its missile and drone attacks this month after a lull of nearly two months, targeting military facilities and supplies. Waves of attacks now come several times a week. In the leafy Holosiivskyi district in the southwestern part of Kyiv, falling debris on Sunday set a three-storey warehouse on fire, destroying about 1,000 square metres (10,800 square feet) of building structures, according to the mayor. A fire broke out after falling drone debris hit a seven-storey non-residential building in the Solomyanskyi district west of the city. The district is a busy rail and air transport hub. In the Pecherskyi district, a fire broke out on the roof of a nine-storey building due to falling drone debris, Kyiv’s military administration officials said on Telegram. Over the past few weeks,reports of drone attacks in Russia have also multiplied, mostly in regions bordering Ukraine. On Saturday, shelling in those areas killed two people, regional authorities said. Moscow has blamed Kyiv – and its Western supporters – for the escalating number of attacks and sabotage operations, including on the Kremlin, but Ukraine has denied involvement.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/28/russia-unleashes-massive-air-raids-on-ukraines-kyiv
Ukraine says Russia eases attacks on Bakhmut to regroup,Ukrainian defence minister says Russian attacks have decreased as Moscow troops are being ‘replaced and regrouped’.,"Russian forces have temporarily eased their attacks on the besieged eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut to regroup and strengthen their capabilities, a senior Kyiv official has said. Separately, senior Ukrainian officials on Saturday indicated their forces were ready to launch a long-promised counteroffensive to recapture territory taken by Russia since the start of the war. Russia’s Wagner private army began handing over positions to regular troops this week after declaring full control of Bakhmut following the longest and bloodiest battle of the war. In a statement on Telegram, Ukraine Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said Russian forces were continuing to attack but that overall offensive activity had decreased. “Yesterday and today there have not been any active battles – neither in the city nor on the flanks,” she wrote on Saturday, adding that Moscow’s troops were instead shelling the outskirts and approaches to Bakhmut. “The decrease in the enemy’s offensive activity is due to the fact that troops are being replaced and regrouped,” Maliar said. “The enemy is trying to strengthen its own capabilities.” Kyiv is expected to soon launch a highly anticipated counteroffensive to retake Russian-occupied territory. Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council, told the BBC that the push could begin “tomorrow, the day after tomorrow or in a week”. Presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak, speaking to the UK’s Guardian newspaper, said preliminary operations such as destroying supply lines or blowing up depots had already begun. Ukraine’s top general, Valerii Zaluzhny, posted a sleekly produced video on Saturday showing Ukrainian troops swearing an oath and preparing for battle. “The time has come to return what is ours,” he wrote. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s military intelligence has claimed, without offering evidence, that Russia is plotting a“large-scale provocation” at a nuclear power plantit occupies in the southeast of the country with the aim of disrupting a looming Ukrainian counteroffensive. A statement released Friday by the intelligence directorate of Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence claimed that Russian forces would attack the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the biggest in Europe, and then report a radioactive leak in order to trigger an international probe that would pause the hostilities and give the Russian forces the respite they need to regroup ahead of the counter-offensive. In order to make that happen, Russia “disrupted the rotation of personnel of the permanent monitoring mission” of the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency that was scheduled for Saturday, the statement said. It did not offer evidence to back up any of the claims. There was no immediate comment from the IAEA or Russian officials on the allegations.    The White House said it is watching the situation closely and has seen no indication that radioactive material has been leaked. The claims mirrored similar statements Moscow regularly makes, alleging without evidence that Kyiv is plotting provocations involving various dangerous weapons or substances in order to then accuse Russia of war crimes. The Zaporizhzhia power plant is one of the 10 biggest nuclear plants in the world. It is located in the partially occupied Zaporizhzhia region in southeastern Ukraine. The plant’s six reactors have been shut down for months, but it still needs power and qualified staff to operate crucial cooling systems and other safety features. Fighting near it repeatedly disrupted power supplies and has fueled fears of a potential catastrophe like the one at Chernobyl, in northern Ukraine, where a reactor exploded in 1986 and spewed deadly radiation, contaminating a vast area in the world’s worst nuclear disaster.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/27/ukraine-says-russia-eases-attacks-on-bakhmut-to-regroup
Russia to US: No lectures on nuclear weapon deployments,"Russian embassy calls US criticism of Moscow’s tactical nuclear weapon deployment to Belarus hypocritical, saying ‘before blaming others Washington could use some introspection’.","Russia has dismissed criticism from US President Joe Biden over Moscow’s deployment of tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, saying Washington for decades has done the same  throughout Europe. Russia said on Thursday it was pushing ahead with the first deployment of such weapons outside its borders since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said the arms were already on the move. Biden said on Friday he had an “extremely negative” reaction to reports that Russia moved ahead with the deployment in Belarus. “It is the sovereign right of Russia and Belarus to ensure their security by means we deem necessary amid a large-scale hybrid war unleashed by Washington against us,” Russia’s embassy in the United States said in a statement. “The measures we undertake are fully consistent with our international legal obligations.” Tactical nuclear weapons are used for tactical gains on the battlefield and are usually smaller in yield than the strategic nuclear weapons designed to destroy American, European or Russian cities. The Russian embassy called the US criticism of Moscow’s deployment hypocritical, saying “before blaming others, Washington could use some introspection”. “The United States has been for decades maintaining a large arsenal of its nuclear weapons in Europe. Together with its NATO allies it participates in nuclear sharing arrangements and trains for scenarios of nuclear weapons use against our country.” The United States has said the world faces the gravest nuclear danger since the 1962Cuban Missile Crisisbecause of remarks by President Vladimir Putin during the Ukraine conflict, but Moscow says its position has been misinterpreted. Putin, who has cast the Ukraine war as a battle for the survival of Russia against an aggressive West, has repeatedly warned that Russia, which has more nuclear weapons than any other country, will use all means to defend itself. The United States has deployed nuclear weapons in Western Europe since US President Dwight D Eisenhower authorised their deployment in the Cold War as a counter to the perceived threat from the Soviet Union. The first US nuclear weapons in Europe were deployed in Britain in 1954. Much of the detail about the current American deployment is classified, though the Federation of American Scientists says the US has 100 B61 tactical nuclear weapons deployed in Europe – in Italy, Germany, Turkey, Belgium and the Netherlands.

Ukraine claims Russia planning ‘massive’ incident at nuclear site,Ukraine’s defence intelligence directorate warns Russia will simulate an attack at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.,"Ukraine’s defence ministry has warned that Russia plans to simulate a major accident at theZaporizhzhia nuclear power station, which is under the control of Russian forces, in a bid to thwart the expected counteroffensive by Ukraine to retake its territory captured by Moscow. The Zaporizhzhia plant, which lies in an area of Russian-occupied southern Ukraine, is Europe’s biggest nuclear power station and the area has been repeatedly hit by shelling with both sides blaming each other for the dangerous attacks. Ahead of Ukraine’s expected counteroffensive, fears have increased that a nuclear disaster could occur amid rising military activity around Zaporizhzhia. “Russians are preparing massive provocation and imitation of the accident at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in the nearest hours,” the Ukrainian defence ministry’s intelligence directorate said on Friday.    “They are planning to attack the territory of the ZNPP [Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant]. After that, they will announce the leakage of the radioactive substances,” the intelligence directorate said in a statement and later on social media channels. Reports of radioactive material leaking from the plant would cause a global incident and force an investigation by international authorities, during which all hostilities would be stopped, the directorate said. Russia would then use that pause in fighting to regroup its forces and better prepare to stop the Ukrainian counteroffensive, the intelligence service said. “They obviously will blame Ukraine,” the directorate said, adding that the attack’s aim would be to “provoke the international community” into investigating the incident and forcing a pause in fighting. ‼️ Russians are preparing massive provocation and imitation of the accident at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in the nearest hours.They are planning to attack the territory of the ZNPP. After that, they will announce the leakage of the radioactive substances.pic.twitter.com/Vk6hRDD26v — Defence intelligence of Ukraine (@DI_Ukraine)May 26, 2023   Experts say that reports of a radiation leak at the plant would be followed by immediate evacuations, which could be extremely complex in a war zone. According to experts, for many people, the fear of being contaminated by radiation could also be more dangerous than the radiation itself. Last week, witnesses said Russian military forces were enhancing defensive positions in and around the nuclear power plant ahead of Ukraine’s much-anticipated counteroffensive. In preparation for the planned radioactive incident, Russia had disrupted the scheduled rotation of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), who are based at the plant, Ukraine’s intelligence directorate said. The report of a planned incident at Zaporizhzhia was repeated in a tweet by Ukraine’s representative to the United Nations in New York, Sergiy Kyslytsya, who said the events could unfold “in the coming hours”. Moscow is preparing a large-scale provocation to create a center of radiation danger, according to@DI_UkraineIn the coming hours, the russians are preparing a large-scale provocation to simulate an accident at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.https://t.co/KuxZEGRB2i — Sergiy Kyslytsya 🇺🇦 (@SergiyKyslytsya)May 26, 2023  The directorate statement did not provide any proof to support its claims and the Vienna-based IAEA, which frequently posts updates on the situation at the power plant, has made no mention of any disruption to its timetable. Kyiv and Moscow have repeatedly accused each other of attacking the plant. In February, Russia said Ukraine was planning to stage a nuclear incident on its territory and pin the blame on Moscow. Moscow has also repeatedly accused Kyiv of planning “false-flag” operations with non-conventional weapons, using biological or radioactive materials. No such attacks have taken place so far.    The IAEA’s Director General Rafael Grossi will brief the UN Security Council next week on the security situation at Zaporizhzhia and his plan for safeguards at the site. Grossi, who last visited the plant in March, has upped his efforts to reach an agreement with Ukraine and Russia to ensure the plant’s protection during the fighting. In a statement last week, Grossi said: “It is very simple: don’t shoot at the plant and don’t use the plant as a military base”. “It should be in the interest of everyone to agree on a set of principles to protect the plant during the conflict,” he added. Zaporizhzhia once supplied approximately 20 percent of Ukraine’s electricity and continued to function in the early months of Russia’s invasion, despite frequent shelling, before halting power production entirely in September. None of Ukraine’s six Soviet-era reactors has since generated electricity but the Zaporizhzhia facility remains connected to the Ukrainian power grid for its own needs, notably to cool the plant’s nuclear reactors.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/27/ukraine-claims-russia-planning-massive-incident-at-nuclear-site
"Russia’s Belgorod, Ukraine’s Dnipro attacked as war escalates","Russian officials say the border region came under attack on Friday, days after a daring incursion, as two are reported killed in Dnipro.","Russia’s southern Belgorod region came under attack from Ukrainian artillery fire, mortar shells and drones on Friday, authorities said,days afterone of the most daring cross-border attacks since the war began. Hours earlier, two drones attacked a Russian city in a region next to the annexed Crimea Peninsula, officials said. The Kremlin’s forces, meanwhile, attacked a medical clinic in Dnipro, in central Ukraine, killing a 69-year-old passer-by and another civilian. More than 20 others were wounded, including two children, Ukrainian officials said. Also, a Russian S-300 missile hit a dam in the Karlivka district of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk province, placing nearby settlements under threat of severeflooding. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the blast in Dnipro as a war crime. “Another Russian missile attack, another crime against humanity,” he wrote on Twitter. “The buildings of a psychological clinic and a veterinary clinic in the city of Dnipro were destroyed.” Al Jazeera’s Natacha Butler, in Kyiv, reported other missile and drone strikes across Ukraine overnight. “We certainly heard at least two very loud explosions at about four in the morning,” she said, adding that Ukraine’s armed forced claimed to have intercepted several missiles over the capital. “We’ve been seeing intensified strikes on Ukraine,” she said. “Many say this is because Russia is looking very closely atUkraine’s anticipated counteroffensive.” The Belgorod town of Grayvoron, about seven kilometres (more than four miles) from the Ukrainian border, was under fire for several hours, with four houses, a store, a car, a gas pipeline and a power line damaged, Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov reported. Closer to the border, a recreation centre, a shop and an uninhabited house sustained damage in the village of Glotovo. There were no casualties, according to Gladkov. Earlier this week, the Belgorod region was the target of one of the most serious cross-border attacks from Ukraine since the war began 15 months ago. Details of that raid, which began Monday and ended Tuesday, were murky. Russia blamed the Ukrainian armed forces, but two Russian groups said they were involved, with the aim ofbringing downPresident Vladimir Putin. Officials in Russia’s southern city of Krasnodar, in the region of the same name bordering Crimea, said that two drones hit there. Witnesses told local media they heard something like the sound of a moped and then two explosions. “There is damage to buildings, but essential infrastructure was not damaged. And most importantly, there were no casualties,” Krasnodar governor Veniamin Kondratyev wrote on Telegram. Krasnodar Mayor Yevgeny Naumov said there were no casualties. Drone attacks against Russian regions on the border with Ukraine have been a regular occurrence since the start of the war, which began in February last year, with attacks stepping up last month. Earlier this month, an oil refinery in Krasnodar was attacked by drones on two consecutive days In another apparent incident of Kyiv’s forces harassing Russia, Ukraine’s defence ministry on Thursday published footage that appeared to show an unmanned drone boat attacking Russia’s Ivan Khurs reconnaissance ship in the Black Sea. The video did not show the drone hitting the ship. The video followed reports by Russia’s Ministry of Defence on Wednesday that Ukraine had launched an “unsuccessful” attack on the Ivan Khurs using three unmanned speedboats, with all three boats attacked and destroyed prior to reaching the ship. Moscow released footage allegedly showing the destruction of one of the un-crewed boats. After this week’s attack, the governors of Belgorod and Kursk said they favoured changing the law to allow local volunteer self-defence units to be armed when necessary. “We have them [local self-defence units]. We have nearly 3,000 people in seven battalions along the border,” said Belgorod’s Gladkov. Arming such forces could save the defence ministry from being forced to divert some of the troops it needs on the front line to respond to similar raids in future. Roman Starovoit, governor of the Kursk region which also borders Ukraine, said he favoured the idea, too. Last month, Andrei Turchak, first deputy speaker of the upper house of parliament, told President Vladimir Putin in a Kremlin meeting, “The legal status of these formations is now extremely restricted, and most importantly they do not have the right to carry and use weapons. We propose that this anomaly be eliminated at the legislative level.” Colonel-General Andrei Kartapolov, an influential lawmaker who chairs the lower house of parliament’s defence committee, has also called for bigger structural changes to secure the border.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/26/russias-belgorod-ukraines-dnipro-attacked-as-war-escalates
Japan tightens Russian sanctions in line with G7,"Japan will freeze the assets of 78 groups and 17 individuals, including army officers in Russia and ban exports to 80 Russian entities.","Japan has announced additional sanctions on Russia after the Group of Seven (G7) summit the country hosted last week agreed to step up measures to punish Moscow over itsfull-scale invasion of Ukraine. In coordination with other G7 members, Japan will freeze the assets of 78 groups and 17 individuals, including army officers in Russia and ban exports to 80 Russian entities such as military-affiliated research labs, according to a foreign ministry statement released on Friday. Japan will also ban providing construction and engineering services to Russia, although the details of the measure will be announced at a later date, a trade ministry statement said.

"US says Russia cannot win in Ukraine, Moscow sees long war ahead",Russia’s former President Dmitry Medvedev said the war in Ukraine is likely to last decades with bouts of fighting and truces.,"Russia will not achieve a military victory in Ukraine and Kyiv’s forces are unlikely to push back allRussian troopsfrom their territory any time soon, the United States’s highest-ranking military official has said. “This war, militarily, is not going to be won by Russia. It’s just not,” General Mark Milley, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on Thursday. Russia’s original strategic objectives, including toppling the government in Kyiv, “are not achievable militarily”, Milley told journalists after the conclusion of a virtual meeting of dozens of countries that are members of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, which is also known as the Ramstein group. There are also hundreds of thousands of Russian soldiers in Ukraine, which would make Kyiv’s objective of recapturing allterritory lostto Moscow’s forces unlikely “in the near term”, Milley said. “That means fighting is going to continue, it’s going to be bloody, it’s going to be hard. And at some point, both sides will either negotiate a settlement or they’ll come to a military conclusion,” he said. Milly’s assessment adds to a number of forecasts that the war in Ukraine appears set to drag on, with neither side positioned to win a clear-cut victory and no negotiations currently taking place.    Russia’s former President Dmitry Medvedev, a key ally of President Vladimir Putin, also said Moscow’s war in Ukraine could continue for decades. According to comments published by Russia’s RIA news agency on Thursday, Medvedev described an ongoing conflict involving years of fighting with Ukraine, interspersed with multiple years of truces before fighting renewed. “This conflict will last a very long time, most likely decades,” the RIA news agency cited Medvedev as saying during a visit to Vietnam. “As long as there is such a power in place [in Kyiv], there will be, say, three years of truce, two years of conflict, and everything will be repeated,” said Medvedev, now the deputy chairman of Putin’s powerful Security Council. Known for regularlymaking hardline commentson Ukraine and those considered Moscow’s enemies, Medvedev said earlier this year that a Russian defeat could trigger a nuclear war. Tensions between Moscow and Washington continues to grow as the US spearheads the push for international support and military aid for Ukraine, including coordinating arms supplies from dozens of countries. In an apparent policy U-turn, the US last week announced it would support giving Ukraine advancedUS-made F-16 warplanes. In total, Ukraine’s supporters have provided nearly $65bn in security assistance to the country, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said at the press conference on Thursday.    On Thursday, Kyiv’s supporters “discussed plans for training Ukrainian pilots on fourth-generation fighter aircraft, including the F-16,” Austin said, speaking alongside Milley, noting that “planning and executing this training will be a significant undertaking”. Austin said the Dutch and Danish defence ministers are working with the US on jet fighter training for Ukraine and that Norway, Belgium, Portugal and Poland have already offered to contribute to the initiative. In addition, he said the allies would set up a fund so other nations could contribute to the overall effort. Commenting on the F-16 fighters, Milley cautioned that they were not going to be “the magic weapon”. “There are no magic weapons” – not the F-16s or other weapons, he said, noting that 10 F-16s could cost $2bn, including maintenance. “The Russians have a thousand fourth and fifth-generation fighters, so if you’re going to contest Russia in the air, you’re going to need a substantial amount of fourth and fifth-generation fighters,” he said. F-16s have a future role as part of Ukraine’s air capabilities but it is “going to take a considerable length of time to build up an air force that’s the size and scope and scale that would be necessary”. Air defence systems are still the weapons that Ukraine needs most in the broader effort to control the airspace, he said. The US is poised to announce up to $300m more in military aid for Ukraine comprised mainly of ammunition, two officials told the Reuters news agency. The package is expected to contain more Guided Multiple Launch Rockets (GMLRS) for HIMARS launchers as well as other ammunition.     The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington DC-based think tank, said that“a long war” is not a Russian goalbut a means of adapting to the situation in Ukraine after its plan for a swift victory failed. Russia’s ability to sustain an extended military campaign in Ukraine is not assured, while a “long war” would allow Russia the time and space needed to rebuild its military forces, the institute said. “Ukrainian counteroffensives will deny the Kremlin a breather to replenish its resources, will further deplete Russia’s offensive potential, and eventually enable Ukrainian forces to expel Russia from Ukraine,” the ISW said. “The Kremlin’s ‘long war’ narrative reflects Putin’s intent to rebuild Russia’s large-scale warfighting capability. But it is also an information operation aimed to peel the West away from Ukraine. This information operation builds on previous Russian efforts, such as ceasefire narratives and nuclear blackmail,” the ISW added.

US accuses Wagner Group of supplying missiles to Sudan’s RSF,Washington warns that the Russian mercenary group is prolonging the conflict and causing ‘further chaos’ in Sudan.,"Washington, DC –The United States has accused Russia’sWagner Groupof providing surface-to-air missiles to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), one side in Sudan’s ongoing conflict that has displaced nearly 1.3 million people. Thursday’s allegation against the mercenary group came as the US Treasury Department also imposed sanctions on Wagner’s leader in Mali, accusing him of trying to obtain weapons for Russia’s war in Ukraine. The surface-to-air missiles in Sudan have contributed to “a prolonged armed conflict that only results in further chaos in the region”, the Treasury said in a statement. The RSF and the Sudanese military — led by two rival generals — have been locked in a fight to control the state and its resources since mid-April, one that has killed hundreds of people. Washington, meanwhile, has helped broker several ceasefire deals since the violence broke out. On Monday, the warring sides agreed to aweeklong truce, but as with previous ceasefire agreements, residents have reported continued clashes. The US says its primary aim in Sudan is toreduce the violencebefore working towards a permanent end to the fighting and returning the country to civilian rule. Rights groups have cautioned of ahumanitarian catastropheif the conflict continues. Last month, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken voiced concern about the prospect of Wagner’s involvement in Sudan, saying the group “simply brings more death and destruction” with it. “It’s very important that we not see its further engagement in Sudan. And I know a number of countries are very concerned with that prospect,” he said.    On Thursday, the Treasury also said Russian President Vladimir Putin has “resorted to relying onthe Wagner Groupto continue his war of choice” in Ukraine, which has been under a full-scale invasion since February 2022. As part of the announcement, the US imposed sanctions on Ivan Aleksandrovich Maslov, the head of Wagner in Mali, a landlocked country in western Africa. “The Wagner Group may be attempting to obscure its efforts to acquire military equipment for use in Ukraine, including by working through Mali and other countries where it has a foothold,” the Treasury said. “The United States opposes efforts by any country to assist Russia through the Wagner Group.” Early in 2023, the USlabelled Wagnera “transnational criminal organisation” and imposed sanctions on its top leaders. The State Department also accused Wagner earlier this week ofseeking to smuggle“material acquisitions to aid Russia’s war” in Ukraine through Mali using false paperwork. “In fact, there are indications that Wagner has been attempting to purchase military systems from foreign suppliers and route these weapons through Mali as a third party,” spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters on Monday. “We have not seen, as of yet, any indications that these acquisitions have been finalised or executed, but we are monitoring the situation closely.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/25/us-accuses-wagner-group-of-supplying-missiles-to-sudans-rsf
Russia signs deal to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus,"Moscow says it will maintain control of the weapons, but Ukraine accuses Russia of taking Minsk ‘hostage’.","Moscow and Minsk have signed a deal to formalisethe deploymentof Russian tactical nuclear missiles on Belarusian territory. Russia on Thursday said the step was driven by rising tensions with the West. “In the context of an extremely sharp escalation of threats on the western borders of Russia and Belarus, a decision was made to take countermeasures in the military-nuclear sphere,” Russia’s state-owned TASS news agency quoted Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu as saying. The deployment of the missiles was first announced by President Vladimir Putin in March. Since invading Ukraine last year, Putin has said repeatedly that Russia would be ready to use nuclear weapons if needed to defend its “territorial integrity”. NATO said at the time it did not see any need to adjust its own nuclear posture, although the military alliance cast Putin’s nuclear rhetoric as “dangerous and irresponsible”. But Richard Weitz, a Washington, DC-based foreign policy and defence analyst, told Al Jazeera that Russia was unlikely to benefit “in the purely military sense”.“Russia already has thousands of nuclear weapons, and some of them are already deployed on the ground or on aeroplanes, near where the Belarusian facilities are likely to be located. So, it adds a couple more locations to what Russia already has,” he said. “It’s political signalling … The Russian government at the highest levels will issue statements warning on the risk of nuclear war if NATO does give Patriots to Ukraine, give F-16s to Ukraine. “It’s a way of just reminding the West that Russia is this great nuclear power and that the West better be careful, or we could stumble into a nuclear war. “[It also] helps them strengthen ties or control over Belarus in the sense that the weapons are there. That’s another reason why Belarus’s security is tied to Russia but I think the main reason is part of this intimidation campaign.” Ukraine has said Russia’s ally Belarus had been “taken hostage” by Moscow. In March, Oleksiy Danilov, head of Ukraine’s national security and defence council, called the deal “a step towards internal destabilisation” of Belarus, and said it maximised what he termed the level of “negative perception and public rejection” of Russia and Putin in Belarusian society. “The Kremlin took Belarus as a nuclear hostage,” he wrote on Twitter. Moscow will retain control over the weapons and any decisions on their use, Shoigu said. TASS quoted him as saying that Iskander-M missiles, which can carry conventional or nuclear warheads, had been handed to the Belarusian armed forces, and some Su-25 aircraft had been converted for the possible use of nuclear weapons. “Belarusian servicemen have received the necessary training in Russian training centres,” Shoigu was quoted as saying. He added that the agreements signed with his Belarusian counterpart covered the procedure for establishing a “special storage facility for nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory”. Tactical nuclear weapons refer to lower-yield weapons designed for battlefield use, as opposed to strategic ones capable of wiping out entire cities. Russia has not disclosed how many tactical nuclear weapons it has.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/25/russia-signs-deal-to-deploy-tactical-nuclear-weapons-in-belarus
UN conference pledges fall short of $7bn goal for Horn of Africa,The $2.4bn raised is considerably less than the $7bn the UN says is needed to provide help to millions affected by drought and conflict in the region.,"A United Nations-backed conference raised $2.4bn on Wednesday to prevent famine in the Horn of Africa, which is reeling from its worst drought in decades as global temperatures rise. The money will provide life-saving assistance for nearly 32 million people across Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia, the world body’s humanitarian agency OCHA said in a statement. “Famine has been averted, thanks in part to the tremendous efforts of local communities, humanitarian organizations and authorities, as well as the support of donors,” OCHA said. But the sum is considerably less than the $7bn the United Nations says is needed to provide help to people affected by drought and conflict in the region. “The emergency is far from over, and additional resources are urgently required to prevent a return to the worst-case scenario,” OCHA added. Since late 2020, countries in the Horn of Africa – Djibouti, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan — have been suffering the region’s worst drought in 40 years. Five failed rainy seasons have left millions of people in need, decimated crops and killed millions of livestock. More than 23.5 million people are enduring high levels of acute food insecurity in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia, according to OCHA. In Somalia alone, where armed groups are spearheading conflict, 3.8 million people have been displaced from their homes by conflict, drought or floods and double that number are struggling to find food, according to figures from the UN and the Norwegian Refugee Council. More than half a million children are severely malnourished, the two organisations added. Deaths from hunger are on the rise in Africa because of droughts worsened by climate change and conflict, UN officials and scientists say. The devastating drought in the Horn of Africa could not have occurred without the effects of greenhouse gas emissions, the World Weather Attribution group, an international team of climate scientists, said ina reportreleased in April. But aid organisations like the Norwegian Refugee Councilhave also saida focus on the Ukraine crisis has drastically reduced the funding available for work in the Horn of Africa. “The war in Ukraine has demonstrated the immense gap between what is possible when the international community rallies behind a crisis, and the daily reality for millions of people suffering in silence within these crises on the African continent that the world has chosen to ignore,” the aid group’s chief Jan Egeland said last June. Earlier this week, a group of NGOs, including Islamic Relief Worldwide and Save the Children, called on donors to fully fund the humanitarian response required for “one of the biggest climate injustices of our time”. Citing UN numbers, the organisations pointed out that despite funding mobilised aid to the region last year, an estimated 43,000 people died from the drought in Somalia alone in 2022. At the opening of the donors’ conference organised in conjunction with Italy, Qatar, the United Kingdom and the horn of Africa states, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres appealed for “an immediate and major injection of funding” to stop people from dying. “We must act now to prevent crisis from turning into catastrophe,” he added, recalling that last year donor countries delivered vital help to 20 million people in the region and helped avert a famine. Guterres said people in the region, which he described as “the epicentre of one of the world’s worst climate emergencies”, were “paying an unconscionable price for a climate crisis they did nothing to cause”. OCHA said the funds pledged on Wednesday would allow humanitarian agencies to sustain aid pipelines of food, water, healthcare, nutrition and protection services. Joyce Msuya, the UN’s deputy emergency relief coordinator, welcomed the pledge but added: “We must persist in pushing for stepped-up investments, especially to bolster the resilience of people already bearing the brunt of climate change.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/25/un-conference-pledges-fall-short-of-7bn-goal-for-horn-of-africa
War comes home to Russia: Pro-Kyiv fighters seek Putin’s downfall,"Russia has been jolted by one of the most daring incursions, allegedly carried out by groups including Russian nationals.","Kyiv, Ukraine –This week, a man with yellow and blue plastic bands on his helmet and camouflage uniform was filmed riding atop an armoured vehicle. The colours are unmistakably those of the Ukrainian national flag, but the man – seen in the video posted on his military unit’s Telegram channel on Tuesday – is aRussiannational. He chose to fight for Ukraine, and brought the war home on Monday, to the western Russian region of Belgorod that hadalreadybeen shelled and attacked, apparently by Ukrainian drones, for months. The unidentified man in the video is part of theRussian Volunteer Corps, a military unit formed by fugitive far-right nationalists forced out of Russia. The group only accepts Russian nationals as members. Some of the Corps’ fighters volunteered to join Ukrainian forces in 2014, after Moscow annexed Crimea and incited separatist revolts in the southeastern Donbas region, and some joined after the latest war began in February 2022. The Corps consists of “dozens of fighters”, Fortuna, as one of the group’s founders calls himself, told a news conference in October. Two months earlier, they became part of the International Legion of Ukraine, a group of volunteers from all over the world that reports to Ukraine’s defence ministry. Moscow, which is reluctant to publicly admit Russian nationals are fighting for Ukraine, blamed Kyiv for the incursion, a claim which was quickly denied. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, questioned if the attackers were ethnic Russians, said, they are “Ukrainian fighters from Ukraine. There are many ethnic Russians living in Ukraine. But they are still Ukrainian militants”. The Ukrainian defence ministry – along with other officials in Kyiv – initially distanced themselves from the Corps. Its first confirmed raid on Russia took place on March 2, after they entered two villages in the border region of Bryansk. The Corps then released a video of its fighters standing outside a village hospital and urging Russians “to riot and fight”. Bryansk Governor Aleksander Bogomaz said they killed a civilian and wounded a 10-year-old. Russian President Vladimir Putin cast the raid as a “terrorist act”. Mykhailo Podolyak, an aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, called those claims a “classic deliberate provocation”. But Ukraine’s defence ministry denied a role in organising the raid. “These are the people who fight with arms against Putin’s regime and supporters. Perhaps, Russians are beginning to wake up,” military intelligence spokesman Andriy Yusov said. On Monday, the Corps started its second, far more daring incursion in Russia. Along with The Freedom of Russia Legion – also known as the Liberty of Russia Legion, a military unit which includes ex-Russian prisoners of war who have switched sides, they stormed a border checkpoint and spilled into the Grayvoron district in Belgorod. The district is surrounded by Ukrainian territory on three sides, but its administration failed to protect it with trenches, artillery and anti-tank installations. The invaders had two tanks and 10 armoured vehicles and were backed by light drones. They killed a border guard, one of the fighters told the Novaya Gazeta daily on condition of anonymity, reportedly captured one more and reached three villages, where they started building fortifications and clashed with Russian forces. The incursion highlighted the vulnerabilities of Russia’s border regions, military analysts say. “It showed that Russia has no reserves in border regions and weak reserves in the operational depth, which means that the residents of all districts bordering Ukraine are in immediate danger and must be evacuated,” Nikolay Mitrokin of Germany’s Bremen University told Al Jazeera. The Corps claimed to have occupied a “piece” of Russia. “The situation in a small yet our own piece of Motherland is so far alarming, and there’s a need to clean up,” said the caption under a video showing a Corps fighter. By Monday night, they had attacked the local headquarters of the interior ministry and the FSB, Russia’s main intelligence agency. On Tuesday, Russia claimed to have killed “70 Ukrainian terrorists”, roughly the number of all Corps fighters. The group responded with a video showing several fighters with blurred faces and three armoured vehicles. This time, Kyiv did not deny ties to the group. Their goal is “to push the enemy in order to create a strip of safe land to protect Ukrainian civilian population”, intelligence spokesman Andriy Yusov said on Monday. A more immediate and important goal is to force the Kremlin to deploy forces to the border regions of Belgorod, Bryansk and Kursk. The deployment will surelydecreaseRussia’s military might in Ukraine before the long-awaited counteroffensive, observers say. “This is a risk for Russia to get a good screw-up on the front line,” Kyiv-based analyst Igar Tyshkevich told Al Jazeera. Far-right, ultranationalist and white supremacist groups mushroomed in Russia in the early 2000s, creating a decentralised movement that involved tens of thousands. Theymarchedin urban centres, killed and wounded hundreds of migrant workers from Central Asia and the Caucasus, and even hatched plans to topple Putin’s government and create a neo-Nazi “Fourth Reich”. Ukrainian far-right groups developed in parallel, but their ideology was different, Tyshkevich said – anti-imperialistic “in principle”, less racist and xenophobic. However, in terms of organisation, the Russian influence was formative. Before 2014, the movements in both nations were “amorphous” youth subcultures that formed a “system of connected vessels”, Vyacheslav Likhachev, a Kyiv-based expert on ultranationalism, told Al Jazeera. When the Kremlin cracked down on the far right, many activists moved to Ukraine “to hide in the familiar linguistic and cultural environment and to keep indoctrinating and passing their experience to their Ukrainian brethren”, he said. After 2014, the flight became a flood. Most of the refugees quit politics, but some kept positioning themselves as “the most right Russians” who were against Putin and European liberalism, he said. The founders of the Corps were among them – and they still want to topple Putin. “Russia’s collapse will allow us to return home,” Denis Kapustin, the Corps founder, told the news conference in October. “We will facilitate the complete and absolute breakdown of the political order in Russia.” The burly 39-year-old calls himself a seasoned skinhead, football fan and organiser of mixed martial arts fights. He lived in Germany, where police described him as “one of the most influential activists” of the far-right movement. After returning to Russia he moved to Ukraine in 2017, where he developed ties withAzov, a regiment known for defending the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol last spring. Some of the Azov members – including fugitive Russians – espoused far-right views. The US Congress banned the regiment in 2018 from using Washington-supplied military aid. The Ukrainian far-right groups and their newly-recruited Russian members were highly visible before the war. They organised rallies, assaulted Roma encampments, beat up pro-Russian politicians and LGBTQ activists, clashed with police – and almost always walked awayscot-free. But since the war began, their influence waned. “The [Ukrainian] society tilted to the right, but on the other hand, the extreme shifted towards the public in terms of reduced radicalism,” analyst Tyshkevich said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/25/war-comes-home-to-russia-pro-kyiv-fighters-seek-putins-downfall
"Russia-Ukraine war: List of key events, day 456","As the war enters its 456th day, we take a look at the main developments.","Here is the situation as it stands on Thursday, May 25, 2023.      ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/25/russia-ukraine-war-list-of-key-events-day-456
Leader of anti-Putin force says expect more Russian border raids,"Denis Kapustin, self-described commander of the Russian Volunteer Corps, said his unit will raid Russian territory again.","The Russian commander of fighters thatconducted a raidon a Russian border region this week said his group would soon launch more incursions into Russian territory from Ukraine. Denis Kapustin, who described himself as the commander of the Russian Volunteer Corps (RVC), spoke to reporters on Wednesday on the Ukrainian side of the border with Russia a day after Moscow said it had repelled an attack on Russia’s Belgorod region that lasted almost 24 hours. “I think you will see us again on that side,” said Kapustin, who is known as an extreme right-wing Russian nationalist who introduced himself to reporters by his call-sign White Rex. “The operation is ongoing,” the Moscow-born Kapustin said, flanked by some 30 fighters in camouflage. “Every operation that takes place on the territory of Russia forces the military leadership to move a large amount of forces precisely to that quadrant, therefore laying bare some parts of the front, parts of the border,” he said. “Our future plans are new territories of the Russian Federation, which we will definitely enter… You should be just a little bit patient and wait just a couple of days.” Two armed groups operating in Ukraine – Kapustin’s RVC and the allied Freedom of Russia Legion – claimed responsibility for the incursion on Monday and Tuesday. Kyiv said it was not involved in the attack, indicating that it was carried out by Russian anti-Putin forces against the Russian military. Kapustin described his mission as a fight against “injustice” and “torture” under Russian President Vladimir Putin that was aimed at spurring other Russians to act. “I want to prove to them [Russians] that you can fight against tyrants and that Putin’s power is not boundless,” he said. Ukrainian authorities “did encourage us” but did not provide weapons or equipment or instructions for this mission, Kapustin added. Belgorod regional Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov reported that two women died and at least 12 people were wounded in the cross-border attack. Local Russian media also reported on Thursday that an estimated 500 houses were damaged in the attack, including 200 that were destroyed. Residents who had fled their homes in Belgorod have not yet returned in some areas, according to the media reports, as authorities are working to identify and make safe mines that were left on the streets and in buildings in the region’s Grayvoron district.    The Russian military said that it routed the raiders with artillery and air attacks that killed more than 70 of what it described as “Ukrainian nationalists” on asabotage missiondesigned to deflect attention from Russia’s gains in the bombed-outcity of Bakhmut. Kapustin said the total losses on his side were two killed and 10 wounded. “And, of course, the Ukrainian military took our wounded. But anything more than this would make things difficult,” he said referring to Ukrainian involvement in his operations. “Every decision we make … beyond the state border is our own decision. Obviously, we can ask our [Ukrainian] comrades, friends for their assistance in planning,” he said. Described by the United States-based Anti-Defamation League as “a Russian neo-Nazi”, Kapustin’s audacious cross-border raid has embarrassed the Kremlin but also raises questions about the involvement of far-right Russian nationalists in Ukraine and how this might affect Western allies’ readiness to supply Kyiv with weapons. Kapustin admitted his group was right-wing. He was also asked if he minded being labelled a Nazi. “I have my set of views, it’s a patriotic set of views, it’s a traditionalist set of views, it’s a right-wing set of views. You know, you’ll never find me waving a flag with a swastika, you’ll never find me raising my hand in a Hitler sign. So why would you call me that?”    Asked repeatedly about media reports that his fighters had used US military equipment in the raid on Russian territory – equipment provided to allow Ukraine to defend itself against Russia’s invasion – Kapustin declined to answer directly. “I know exactly where I got my weapons from. Unfortunately, not from the Western partners,” he said. He suggested that Western military equipment had been captured by Russia in the battle for Bakhmut and that such equipment could be bought on the black market. “I think I explained that the Western military aid unfortunately goes back and forth, being raided. In Bakhmut, for instance, I know that a lot of armoured vehicles, American armoured vehicles, got raided by the Russian forces,” he said. US officials said on Wednesday that they were looking into reports that US vehicles were used inside Russian territory. The Kremlin said the use of US military hardware in the cross-border attack proved the West’s growing involvement in the war. “It is no secret that this equipment is being used against our own military. And it is no secret for us that the direct and indirect involvement of Western countries in this conflict is growing by the day. We are drawing the appropriate conclusions,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu promised on Wednesday that Moscow would respond to any more cross-border raids “extremely harshly”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/25/russian-leader-of-anti-putin-force-says-expect-more-border-raids
"Wagner chief says 20,000 of its troops killed in Bakhmut battle",Yevgeny Prigozhin repeats criticism of Russia’s top brass and warns high number of fatalities is a risk to the country.,"Some 20,000 troops from Russia’s Wagner mercenary group were killed in the months-long battle for control of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, its founder has said. Yevgeny Prigozhin said he had recruited about 50,000 prisoners tofight with Wagnerin Russia’s war in Ukraine and that about 20 percent of them had been killed. A similar number of his contract soldiers had also perished in the battle for the city, he told Russian political strategist Konstantin Dolgov in a video interview posted on his Telegram channel on Wednesday. This weekend, Wagner and the Russian military claimed to have takencontrol of Bakhmut, which has been left in ruins by the prolonged fighting, with Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulating the armed forces. But Kyiv has said its forces continue to fight for the city. Prigozhin, a businessman whose influence has deepened since Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than a year ago, has scathingly criticised the country’s military leadership, accusing Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov of incompetence. If ordinary Russians continued getting their children back in coffins while the children of the elite “shook their arses” in the sun, he warned in his latest video, Russia would face turmoil along the lines of 1917 that brought the Bolsheviks to power. “This divide can end as in 1917 with a revolution,” he said. “First, the soldiers will stand up and after that, their loved ones will rise up,” he said. “There are already tens of thousands of them – relatives of those killed. And there will probably be hundreds of thousands – we cannot avoid that.”    Last year, Prigozhin touredRussian prisonsin a bid to convince inmates to fight with Wagner in Ukraine in exchange for an amnesty if they survived to return home. Russia’s most powerful mercenary leader said Ukraine was preparing a counteroffensive aimed at pushing Russian troops back to its borders before 2014, when Moscow invaded and then annexed Crimea. Ukraine would try to encircle Bakhmut, the focus of intense fighting in the east, and attack Crimea, he added. “Most likely of all, this scenario will not be good for Russia so we need to prepare for an arduous war,” Prigozhin said in the interview. “We are in such a condition that we could f***ing lose Russia – that is the main problem … We need to impose martial law.” The attacks in Russia’sBelgorod region, which Moscow has blamed on Ukraine, was a further example of the failures of the military leadership, he said, warning that Ukraine would seek to strike deeper into Russia. Russia needed to mobilise more men and gear its economy exclusively to war, the Wagner chief said. Prigozhin is known for hisexpletive-laden outburstsdirected at Shoigu and Gerasimov. Earlier this month, he accused the Russian defence chief of failing to provide his soldiers with enough ammunition and threatened to pull out of Bakhmut. He filmed the video in front of rows of corpses he said were dead Wagner fighters as he unleashed a wave of invective at Shoigu and Gerasimov.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/25/wagner-chief-says-20000-of-its-troops-killed-in-bakhmut-battle
US elections 2024: Who is the Republican contender Ron DeSantis?,"A look at the rise of Florida’s governor, who is seen as Donald Trump’s most serious challenger for the party’s presidential nomination.","Washington, DC –In a 2018 campaign ad when he was running for governor of Florida,Ron DeSantistells his daughter — a toddler — to “build the wall” as she puts together boxes that resemble bricks. The structure was a reference to then-President Donald Trump’s promise to build a border wall between the United States and Mexico as part of an aggressive platform to stem irregular migration. Endorsed by the Republican president at that time, DeSantis would fully embrace Trumpism and go on to win the Florida governorship in a tightly-contested and closely-watched race. Now he wants to replace Trump as the standard-bearer of the Republican Party. DeSantis filed paperwork confirming his candidacy for president on Wednesday,throwing his hatin the ring alongside a growing list of hopefuls challenging Trump for the 2024 Republican nomination. He is widely seen as the former president’s most serious primary rival. The Florida governor has been making headlines by enacting right-wing policies on a wide range of social issues – infuriating liberals, earning the praise of conservatives and cementing his prominent status and name recognition in US politics. “There has always been space within the Republican Party for someone who is not Trump,” said Seth Masket, director of the Center on American Politics at the University of Denver. “DeSantis was kind of a natural, at least early on, for that position simply because of how well-known he has been among Republicans.”    DeSantis, who was comfortably re-elected last year, is one of more than two dozen Republican governors. Yet, analysts say he has distinguished himself by taking on what he calls left-wing “wokeism”, staunchly opposing COVID-19 restrictions and successfully movinghis agenda forwardwith the help of a willing majority in the Florida legislature. A graduate of Yale University and Harvard Law School, a military veteran and a former Congress member, DeSantis has amassed a resume that checks many boxes for a presidential candidate. But he made his name nationally in 2018 when he first won the Florida governorship, emerging from a crowded field of Republican candidates to snag a triumph in the tightly-contested state. During the race, he frequently appeared on Fox News to defend Trump, making himself known to the network’s conservative viewers along the way. More recently, in 2022, DeSantis sailed to re-election with historic margins not seen since 1982. His decisive victory helped strengthen Florida’s status as an increasingly red state. As governor, he championed conservative causes, especially in the education system, where he signed bills to limit discussions ofgender and sexualityin schools and block funding for diversity programmes at universities. The more DeSantis attracted the spotlight with his conservative approach, the more he was attacked by Democrats — a dynamic the governor welcomed, according to Masket. “People in conservative circles were cheering him on, but also Democrats were noticing,” Masket told Al Jazeera. “And they started highlighting him as one of the major threats to democracy in the US. And that just egged him on. That was perfect for him. The fact that liberals hated him was – as far as he was concerned – another feather in his cap.”  Under his leadership in 2020, Florida was one of the first large states to roll back and then fully lift itsCOVID-19 lockdownsagainst the warnings of federal health officials at that time. The following year, DeSantis pushed back against coronavirus vaccine mandates, again advancing the right-wing cause of prioritising individual choice when it came topublic healthduring the pandemic. DeSantis also pushed for restrictions on abortion even before theUS Supreme Courtoverturned the constitutional right to the procedure last year. And this year, he signed a six-weekabortion baninto law. Moreover, he waded into the immigration policy debate. Last year, DeSantis chartered flights to transport dozens of migrants and asylum seekers from Texas to Martha’s Vineyard, a wealthy community in the largely Democratic state of Massachusetts. The migrants arrived without advance notice, local authorities said, sparking anger and questions from rights groupsabout the legalityof the transfer. The White House condemned the incident at that time as cruel “political theatre”. In short, DeSantis successfully translated his right-wing rhetoric into policy, analysts said. “Whenever you’re different, whenever you break with your party, you’re out there on your own. And if there are no drastic consequences, then it can make you look like you’re ahead of the curve,” said David Ramsey, who teaches constitutional law and political philosophy at the University of West Florida. He added that the governor helped rebuild the Republican Party in Florida, a traditional swing state that is now increasingly looking like a conservative stronghold. “He’s put a lot of points on the board for his party,” Ramsey told Al Jazeera. Meanwhile, Trump, also a Florida resident, stands between DeSantis and the Republican presidential nomination, as they both seek to take on Democratic President Joe Biden in 2024. Several otherRepublican candidateshave launched presidential bids, but if public opinion polls are to be believed, the primaries will be a two-horse race between Trump and DeSantis. With his combative attitude and unconventional policymaking, DeSantis evokes comparisons with Trump. But the governor can distinguish himself from the former president through his younger age, “more polished” style, military service and family life, political observers said. DeSantis is 44 years old. Trump is 76. And unlike Trump, DeSantis’s personal life has been largely free of scandals. “He contrasts well with the previous president. He’s young. He’s on his first wife. He actually served in the military,” said Gregory Koger, a political science professor at the University of Miami. After the Republicans’lackluster performancesin the 2022 midterm elections, which were largely blamed on Trump, many thought DeSantis would become the unofficial captain of the party. “I think the question is: Who is the current leader of the Republican Party? Oh, I know who it is: Ron DeSantis,” Republican SenatorCynthia Lummissaid last November. The governor, however, lost some momentum in 2023, with recent national polls showing him behind Trump by as many as 36 percentage points. Koger outlined three reasons for that decline. First, he said, Trump is actively campaigning while DeSantis only launched his official campaign this week. A second reason is that Trump has been incessantly attacking DeSantis on his Truth Social platform, and for the most part, the governor has stayed mum. And then there’s the question ofTrump’s indictment, the first for a former or current US president. In April, Trump wascriminally chargedin New York in relation to a hush-money payment to a porn star. Republicans, including DeSantis, almost unanimously defended Trump against the prosecution. “A combination of voters feeling like he’s being attacked and Republican politicians coming out and criticising the indictment led to a boost for Trump,” Koger told Al Jazeera. With the first caucus in Iowa months away andlegal troublemounting for Trump, DeSantis will be hoping to bounce back and close the gap, especially as he starts to officially campaign for the nomination.    Koger cited DeSantis’s fight with the Walt Disney Company to show how the governor aimed to consolidate power and intimidate critics. DeSantis went on the offensiveagainst Disneylast year and tried to strip it of its status as a special tax district after the company’s leaders criticised a piece of Florida legislation dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill by critics. The legislation aimed to restrict instructions on sexuality and gender identity in public schools. The attack on Disney, which turned into a protracted legaland political battle, was a risky one. Disney is an iconic American company that is one of Florida’s largest employers. “What kind of Florida politician picks a fight with Disney World in the state and a country where that’s a revered brand?” Koger asked. “But it makes sense if the purpose is really to scare any business or organisation that would stand up to him, to keep people from criticising what he’s doing and create a climate of fear.” While DeSantis has demonstrated his right-wing credentials on domestic issues as governor, he has not engaged in many discussions on foreign policy. But in March, he drew criticism from Democrats and some Republicans when he called the conflict in Ukraine a “territorial dispute”. “While the US has many vital national interests, … becoming further entangled in a territorial dispute between Ukraine and Russia is not one of them,”DeSantis saidin a statement to then-Fox News host Tucker Carlson, a staunch critic of US support to Ukraine. “The Biden administration’s virtual ‘blank check’funding of this conflictfor ‘as long as it takes’, without any defined objectives or accountability, distracts from our country’s most pressing challenges,” the governor argued. That position placed him closer to Trump’s stance on the conflict than to that of the mainstream Republican Party. Many GOP lawmakers, with the exception of a few vocal far-right members, have overwhelmingly voted in favour of providing billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine. Masket, the University of Denver professor, said that siding with sceptics of US support for Ukraine did not go over well for DeSantis. “I don’t think that did him any favours,” Masket told Al Jazeera. “My impression was that it would make more sense for DeSantis to come out strongly in favour of Ukraine because he’s not going to win over the Trump wing of the party.”    One foreign policy area where DeSantis made his views abundantly known is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He has said the Palestinian West Bank is “disputed”, not occupied territory, a view that contradicts international law and numerous United Nations resolutions. When he was in Congress, DeSantis also pushed Trump early on to move the USembassy to Jerusalem. Last month, the governor visited Israel and hit out atBiden’s criticismof the Israeli government’s judicial overhaul plan, saying the US should not “butt into” Israel’s affairs. In 2019, he moved to penalise Airbnb for suspending its listings in illegal Israeli West Bank settlements, part of a campaign that pressured the lodging company toreverse its decision. He also threatened to divestfrom Ben & Jerry’sparent firm after the ice-cream maker decided to end its operations in the West Bank. Rasha Mubarak, a Palestinian-American organiser in Florida, said DeSantis’s policies have been “dangerous” not only for Palestinians but also for Americans’ free speech rights. “He uses fear and false narrative when he is pushing anti-Black, anti-immigrant, anti-Palestinian, xenophobic legislation and rhetoric that bring out his base and his support,” Mubarak told Al Jazeera. While in the US Navy, DeSantis served at the Guantanamo Bay detention facility, a prisonwidely decriedby rights group that he has said should remain open. One former inmate accused the governor of being present while prison officials were force-feeding detainees during a hunger strike. “He was watching me struggle. He was smiling and laughing with other officers as I screamed in pain,” Mansoor Adayfi wrotein a columnfor Al Jazeera earlier this year. DeSantis vehemently denies that account.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/24/us-elections-2024-who-is-the-republican-contender-ron-desantis
Ukraine and Russia trade places in battle for Bakhmut,What happened in the 65th week of Russia’s war in Ukraine?,"Russia’s Wagner Group claims to have captured Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine this week, but the government in Kyiv says it intends to recapture theruined cityafter surrounding it. “We continue to advance on the flanks in the suburbs of Bakhmut and are actually approaching the capture of the city in a tactical encirclement,” overall ground forces commander Oleksandr Syrskyi said as Ukrainian forces added that they had recaptured 4sq km (1.5sq miles) of territory The battle for Bakhmut has increasingly been thefocal point of the war, now in its 65th week, as Russian President Vladimir Putin prioritised capturing the region of Donetsk, in which the city with a pre-war population of 70,000 is situated, and neighbouring Luhansk. Ukraine says it has used attritional street warfare in Bakhmut to draw in Russian forces from other parts of the front and to inflict high casualties. Over the past two weeks, its forces also launched a number of flanking operations around the city to reclaim land. “Ukrainian counterattacks near Bakhmut have notably likely eliminated the threat of a Russian encirclement of Ukrainian forces in Bakhmut and forced Russian troops to allocate scarce military resources to defend against a limited and localized offensive effort, as Ukrainian command likely intended,” the Washington-based Institute of the Study of War said on Friday. The following day, Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Wagner Group and its mercenary forces,said they had captured Bakhmut. Russia’s Ministry of Defence followed with an overnight announcement that it had conquered the city – competing, as they have done for months, for credit on the eastern front. The online news service Meduza also said Bakhmut, for all intents and purposes, had been captured. The “disputed” area consists only of “a dozen high-rise buildings, schools, a kindergarten and some garages at the end of Tchaikovsky Street”, it said. But Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said the defenders still held an area of “industrial and infrastructure facilities” in the southwestern outskirts of the city, known as the “airplane neighbourhood” because of a monument of a MiG-17 fighter plane there. Maliar said Ukrainian troops remained in the neighbourhood on Tuesday. A day earlier, eastern forces spokesman Serhii Cherevaty said Ukrainian soldiers carried out flanking manoeuvres to the city’s north and south and had pushed forward 200 to 400 metres (220 to 440 yards), indicating that the battle was anything but over.    Russia has committed enormous resources to the battle. On Saturday, Maliar said Moscow had sent several thousand reinforcements to Bakhmut. Cherevaty said they included airborne, motorised rifle and special forces. British military intelligence said it believed they could be several battalions, underlining the importance of the battle to the Kremlin. “Russia’s leadership likely continue to see capturing Bakhmut as the key immediate war aim, which would allow them to claim some degree of success in the conflict,” a British intelligence analysis said. Andriy Yusov, Ukraine’s military intelligence spokesman, said on Sunday, “The fact that the enemy is forced to transfer additional reserves in order to continue the operation on Bakhmut, in general, indicates the failure of their offensive actions.” The Wagner Group has done the brunt of the fighting in Bakhmut, and Prigozhin threatened to pull out earlier in May, an action the Ministry of Defence said would be dealt with as treason. But on Sunday, Prigozhin said his soldiers would evacuate the theatre beginning on Thursday. Farther to the northeast, meanwhile, two pro-Ukrainian and anti-Kremlin militias on Monday staged a rare incursion into Russian territory. Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of Russia’s Belgorod region bordering Ukraine, said the Federal Security Service, Border Service and National Guard were battling “a sabotage and reconnaissance group of the Armed Forces of Ukraine”. The Ukrainian government denied any involvement, but members of the two groups – identified as the Russian Volunteer Corps and the Freedom of Russia Legion – claimed responsibility. “Residents of Russia! We are Russians just like you,” said a video posted by the Freedom of Russia Legion. “The only difference between us is that we no longer wanted to justify the actions of criminals under the power of Russia and took up arms to defend our freedom and yours. Putin’s Russia has rotted from corruption, censorship and repression.”    Military reporters said the groups had captured the settlement of Kozinka near the border and attacked two others. Yusov identified the fighters as Russian partisans who had launched “an armed struggle against the criminal regime of Vladimir Putin.” He said they could create a “certain security zone in the border regions of Russia bordering Ukraine”, from which shelling has been directed at Ukrainian towns and settlements. It was not clear what role Ukraine had played, if any, in arming the groups. Russia’s Ministry of Defence also said nothing about the provenance of their weapons. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said Ukraine “observes the events in the Belgorod region of Russia with interest … but has no direct relation to it”. On Tuesday, Russia’s defence ministrysaidit had driven the forces back into Ukraine and said it had killed more than 70 of their fighters. Air raids, artillery fire and units covering the state border of the Western Military District were involved, the ministry said. Separately, Western arms supplies to Ukraine reached another inflection point this week as United States President Joe Biden backed the joint allied training of Ukrainian pilots on F-16 fighter jets, before a decision is taken on how to do the provision of the aircraft – a pressing request by Ukraine. Speaking on the sidelines of aG7 meetingin Hiroshima, Japan, Zelenskyy assured Biden that the planes would not be used to strike Russian territory. US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the F-16s were not part of an anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive that is expected to begin soon. “We’ve reached a moment where it is time to look down the road and say, ‘What is Ukraine going to need as part of a future force to be able to deter and defend against Russian aggression as we go forward?’ F-16 fourth-generation fighter aircraft are part of that mix,” Sullivan said at a White House briefing. The G7 signed off on new sanctions against Russia targeting its energy, metallurgical, technology and defence industries. They also targeted “an international network of organizations that procure components for the Russian company that produces Orlan drones”. Ukrainian intelligence pointed out months ago that Russia was procuring sensitive parts such as microchips from Western companies for its missile and drone industry by shipping them through intermediary countries.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/24/ukraine-russia-trade-places-in-battle-for-bakhmut
"‘Where is the logic?’: Georgia will not sanction Russia, says PM",Irakli Garibashvili says Georgian citizens and the nation’s economy would suffer if Tbilisi sanctioned one of its largest trading partners.,"Doha, Qatar– Georgia’s Prime Minister has said imposing sanctions on Russia would “destroy” Tbilisi’s economy and “damage the interests” of Georgian citizens. Russia is among Georgia’s top trading partners but the two countries have long shared a strained relationship. Georgia’s annual trade turnover with Russia is “less than $1bn”, Irakli Garibashvili said at the Qatar Economic Forum in Doha on Wednesday. “This is ridiculous, isn’t it? That $1bn could not affect the Russian economy.” “By comparison: The European Union trades with Russia in just four days, as much as we trade in a year. Where is the logic when we are called to introduce sanctions against Russia?” He also drew comparisons between the international response to the2008 Russo-Georgian warand the conflict in Ukraine, saying, “Did anyone impose sanctions on Russia because of our war? No one in the world made a formal reaction. “Where is the logic of, ‘Our war is not a war’ but in Ukraine it is.” The war in August 2008, which lasted a matter of days, saw Russia invade Ukraine and ultimately seize control of two breakaway regions – Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Since the conflict in Ukraine began, Georgia, an ex-Soviet nation, has played a balancing act between its neighbour and its desire to join the European Union. When Russia ordered a partial mobilisation last year, thousands of men reluctant to serve flocked to Georgia seeking shelter. Earlier this month, Tbilisi lifted a Russianflight banfollowing a decision by Moscow. But the two countries have not shared diplomatic relations since the 2008 war. “Georgia is extremely in a difficult situation because of our geography, because of the ongoing occupation,” Garibashvili said. While public support for Ukraine is strong in Georgia, critics of the prime minister and his governing Kartuli Otsneba party (Georgia Dream party) have suggested they are pro-Russian. Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili and the EU condemned the decision over flights, at a time when the bloc’s airspace remains closed to Russian planes in response to its invasion of Ukraine. “This step raises concerns in terms of Georgia’s EU path and its commitment to align with the EU in the foreign policy,” EU foreign affairs spokesman Peter Stano said. In Doha, Garibashvili defended the move to restart flights. “We didn’t say that we would stop economic relations with Russia … many countries do flights with Russia,” Garibashvili said. “This war affects all of us politically. We know that today approximately 20 percent of Ukrainian territory is occupied by Russia. This is the status quo today. “Unfortunately, we didn’t see any sign that this war is going to end soon. This is the problem.” With reporting byHafsa Adilin Doha.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/24/where-is-the-logic-georgia-will-not-sanction-russia-says-pm
"Russia, China sign new agreements, defying Western criticism",Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin is the highest ranking Russian official to visit Beijing since the Ukraine war began.,"Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin has said that “sensational pressure” from the West was taking Russia-China ties to an “unprecedented high” as officials from the two countries signed a set of agreements on trade and sports cooperation. Mishustin made the comments on Wednesday during talks with Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Beijing. The prime minister, who also met with Chinese President Xi Jinping, is thehighest-ranking Russian official to visit Beijingsince Moscow’s forces invaded Ukraine last year. His visit comes after Russia and Chinareacted furiouslyto the Group of Seven nations’ weekend declarations that singled both countries out on a range of issues including Ukraine. With the war in Ukraine in its second year and Russia increasingly feeling the weight ofWestern sanctions, Moscow is leaning on China for support. Trade between the nations reached a record $190bn last year, according to Chinese customs data. “Today, relations between Russia and China are at an unprecedented high level,” Mishustin told Li after a grand welcome in Beijing. “They are characterised by mutual respect of each other’s interests, the desire to jointly respond to challenges, which is associated with increased turbulence in the international arena and the pattern of sensational pressure from the collective West,” he said. Li, in turn, hailed the “comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership between China and Russia in the new era”.    He noted that bilateral trade had already reached $70bn so far this year, a figure that marks a year-on-year increase of more than 40 percent. “The scale of investment between the two countries is also continuously upgrading,” Li added. “Strategic large-scale projects are steadily advancing.” Following the talks, ministers from the two countries signed a series of agreements on service trade cooperation and sports, as well as on patents and Russian millet exports to China. Mishustin is accompanied by top officials, including Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, who handles energy policy. China last year becameRussia’s top energy customeras Moscow’s gas exports otherwise plummeted due to a flurry of Western sanctions over the war in Ukraine. According to Russian state media, Novak told Tuesday’s forum in Shanghai that Russian energy supplies to China would increase by 40 percent year on year in 2023. Analysts say China holds the upper hand in the relationship with Russia, and that its sway is growing as the world turns on Moscow over its war in Ukraine. China says it is a neutral party between Russia and Ukraine and wants to help broker an end to the conflict. It has rejected Western criticism of relations with Russia, insisting that their ties do not violate international norms. Earlier this month,Beijing’s special envoy for Eurasian affairsmet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other government officials for talks in Kyiv. The visit by Li Hui followed a phone call last month between Zelenskyy and Xi that the Ukrainian leader described as “long and meaningful”. The call marked the first known contact between the two since the Russian invasion began. Li Hui, the Beijing special envoy, is scheduled to visit Russia on Friday, Russian news agency TASS reported. China released a peace plan for Ukraine in February but Kyiv’s allies largely dismissed it, insisting that Putin must withdraw his forces. Zelenskyy’s own 10-point peace plan includes a tribunal to prosecute war crimes committed by Russia.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/24/on-beijing-visit-russian-pm-hails-unprecedented-china-ties
Raids into Russia’s Belgorod aim to stretch forces thin: Analysts,Security experts say incursions seek to pull Russian troops away from key battlegrounds as Ukraine plans to launch a major counterattack.,"Cross-border raids from Ukraine into Russia were launched to draw away Moscow’s troops ahead of a planned counteroffensive by Kyiv, and to let Russians know the fight has now entered their territory, analysts say. The two-day incursion took place far from the epicentre of fighting in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, and about 160km (100 miles) from the front lines in the northern Kharkiv region. Though Kyiv has denied any role, the biggest cross-border raid from Ukraine since Russia invaded 15 months ago was almost certainly coordinated with Ukraine’s armed forces as it prepares to attempt to recapture territory, security experts said. Patrick Bury, from the University of Bath, told Al Jazeera the border incursions in Russia’s western Belgorod region likely had three main objectives. “Firstly it is to tie down as many Russian forces in the area as possible so they can’t man areas where Ukraine might actually attack. Secondly, it’s to show Russians across their media that the war has actually come to Russia on their territory in a small way. And, finally, to embarrass [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,” Bury said. Ukraine says it plans to conduct a major counteroffensive to seize back occupied territory, but Russia has built sprawling fortifications in its neighbour’s east and south in readiness. “The Ukrainians are trying to pull the Russians in different directions to open up gaps. The Russians are forced to send reinforcements,” said Neil Melvin, an analyst at the Royal United Services Institute. “They’ll have to respond to this and put troops there and then have lots of troops all along the border area – even though that may not be the way the Ukrainians are coming.” Russia’s military said on Tuesday it routed fighters who attacked Belgorod with armoured vehicles, killing more than 70 “Ukrainian nationalists” and pushing the remainder back into Ukraine. Russians in the area expressed surprise at the severity of the attack. One woman was confirmed killed and nine civilians were wounded, some seriously, Belogrod’s Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said. “First guns, then mortars, and then machine guns. It was full-on fighting,” one unidentified resident told local media. Gladkov said on Wednesday the territory was targeted by numerous drone strikes following the incursions. “The night was not entirely calm. There were a large number of drone attacks. Air defence systems handled most of them,” Gladkov said on social media. “The most important thing is that there are no casualties.” Kyiv has said the attack was carried out by Russian citizens, casting it as home-grown, internal Russian strife.Two groups operating in Ukraine– the Russian Volunteer Corps (RVC) and Freedom of Russia Legion – have claimed responsibility. The groups were set up during Russia’s full-scale invasion and attracted Russian volunteer fighters wanting to fight against their own country alongside Ukraine and topple Putin. Mark Galeotti, head of the London-based Mayak Intelligence consultancy and author of several books on the Russian military, said the two groups comprised anti-Kremlin Russians ranging from liberals and anarchists to neo-Nazis. “They’re hoping that in some small way, they can contribute to the downfall of the Putin regime. But at the same time, we have to realise that these are not independent forces … They are controlled by Ukrainian military intelligence,” he said. Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak repeated Kyiv’s position that it had nothing to do with the operation. Several similar incursions into Russia have occurred in recent months, and although this week’s was the largest known so far, it is still tiny when compared with front-line battles.    Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday that Russia will achieve all its goals in Ukraine either through its “special military operation” or through “all other means”, the state-run TASS news agency reported. “Russia is taking under consideration only the completion of its special military operation: ensuring its interests, achieving Russia’s goals either through the special military operation or by other available means,” Peskov said. Peskov earlier told reporters the attackers were Ukrainian. “They are Ukrainian militants from Ukraine. There are many ethnic Russians living in Ukraine. But they are Ukrainian militants anyway,” he said. Alexei Baranovsky, a spokesperson for the political wing of the Freedom of Russia Legion, told Reuters news agency in Kyiv he could not disclose the number of troops involved in the operation, but that the legion had four battalions in total. Baranovsky denied there had been heavy losses, and he dismissed Russian reports of large casualties as disinformation. He said the unit was part of Ukraine’s International Legion and, therefore, part of its armed forces, but denied the incursion was coordinated with Ukrainian authorities. “These are the first steps in the main objective of overthrowing Putin’s regime through armed force. There are no other alternatives,” he said. Galeotti said the incursion looked like a Ukrainian battlefield “shaping” operation ahead of Kyiv’s planned counteroffensive. “This is really a chance to do two things: one is to rattle the Russians, make them worried about the possibility of risings amongst their own people. But secondly, force the Russians to disperse their troops,” he said. Melvin noted the operation also served to boost morale in Ukraine. Kyiv officials have mimicked the Kremlin’s rhetoric surrounding Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 when it initially denied the troops involved were Russian. Podolyak blamed the Belgorod incursion on “underground guerrilla groups” comprising Russian citizens. On social media, Ukrainians referred to what they called the “Belgorod People’s Republic” – a nod to events in eastern Ukraine in 2014 when Russia-backed militias declared “people’s republics” in Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Ukrainians also circulated a video of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy delivering his famous“I am here” video address from Kyivat the beginning of the invasion in February 2022. But instead of the presidential office in Kyiv, the background showed the welcome sign to the city of Belgorod.

Russia criticised at UN as more civilians killed in war zones,"The United Nations estimates nearly 17,000 civilians were killed last year in conflicts, an increase of 53% compared with year before.","The number of civilians killed in armed conflicts and their humanitarian aftershocks has skyrocketed, with the United Nations calculating nearly 17,000 recorded deaths last year in war zones – including almost 8,000 people killed in Ukraine alone – marking a steep 53 percent increase in civilian killings compared with 2021. Citing the number ofpeople killed in the war in UkraineandSudan, schools destroyed in Ethiopia and damage to water infrastructure in Syria, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Tuesday that “the world is failing” to protect civilians. “Civilians have suffered the deadly effects of armed conflict for too long,” Guterres said. “It is time we live up to our promise to protect them.” “Peace is the best form of protection,” he added. A UN report on the protection of civilians in conflicts in 2022 sets new highs with a 53 percent increase in UN-recorded civilian deaths and a surge in the number of people forcibly displaced by conflict. Worldwide, the number of refugees forced from their homes “due to conflict, violence, human rights violations and persecution” has reached 100 million, the UN chief added. The terrible truth is that the world is failing to live up to its commitments to protect civilians. Peace is the best form of protection. We must intensify our efforts to prevent conflict, protect civilians, preserve peace & find political solutions to war.pic.twitter.com/OZ0jBl8tdn — António Guterres (@antonioguterres)May 24, 2023   Guterres, sitting next to Russia’s Ambassador to the UN Vasily Nebenzya, said research by the world body into the treatment of civilians in war zones showed that more than 117 million people faced acute hunger primarily because of war and insecurity. In Ukraine alone, which has beenbattling Russia’s full-scale invasionfor more than a year, the UN recorded nearly 8,000 civilian deaths and more than 12,500 injuries, though the actual figures are likely far higher. The meeting of the UN Security Council saw condemnation traded between Ukraine’s Western supporters and Russia, a dynamic that has played out regularly at council sessions since Moscow’s invasion of its neighbour last year. French Ambassador to the UN Nicolas de Riviere singled out alleged rights violations committed by Russia in Ukraine as well as by the Russian mercenary Wagner force in the Central African Republic and Mali.    United States Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the increase in civilian deaths shows the human toll of the war in Ukraine. The ambassador also accused Russia of pushing millions of people in Africa and the Middle East into food insecurity by using “food as a weapon of war in Ukraine”, including blockingUkrainian grain shipmentsfor months. She said the agreement allowing the shipment of Ukrainian grain from Black Sea ports, which was extended for two months on May 17, was a “beacon of hope to the world”. Russia’s Ambassador Nebenzia claimed very little of the more than 30 million tonnes of grain shipped under the Black Sea deal had gone to developing countries and that the shipment from Russia of ammonia – a key fertiliser ingredient – that was supposed to be part of the July 2022 deal “has effectively not even begun”. Also speaking in front of the Security Council on Tuesday was Mirjana Spoljaric, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, who told members that “as we meet, countless civilians in conflicts around the world are experiencing a living hell”. “Any minute, the next missile can obliterate their home, their school, their clinic and everyone in it,” she said. “Any week, they might run out of food or medicine.”    Alain Berset, president of Switzerland – which took up the rotating presidency of the council in May – said all parties to a conflict must abide by international humanitarian law. “Conflicts are the main drivers of hunger,” he said. “More and more people are facing acute food insecurity,” with most concentrated in conflict zones like the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan and the Sahel, “or in other contexts where violence is endemic, such as Haiti”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/24/russia-criticised-at-un-as-more-civilians-killed-in-war-zones

Russia claims 70 attackers killed in cross-border Belgorod raid,"Anti-Kremlin groups, the Freedom of Russia Legion and Russian Volunteer Corps, claim responsibility for the incursion and attack on Russian territory.","Russia has said more than 70 attackers were killed in its operation to repel cross-border raiders who entered the country’s Belgorod region from Ukraine and battled with Russian forces for an estimated 24 hours before retreating from Russian territory. Russia said it had deployed jets and artillery on Tuesday to destroy the armed groups that penetrated the border region in the most audacious attack on Russian territory since Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine last year. Authorities said 13 people were injured by artillery and mortar fire during the fighting and that a woman died during evacuations on Monday. A second civilian was reported killed in the village of Kozinka. Nine border villages were evacuated during the fighting, according to Russian officials. “In total, more than 70 militants, four armoured vehicles and five pickups were destroyed. Today, the [counter-terrorist operation] has been cancelled in the Belgorod region,” Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported on Wednesday, referring to the attackers as a “Ukrainian sabotage and reconnaissance group”.    Russia’s defence ministry spokesman, Igor Konashenkov, said local troops, air strikes and artillery hadrouted the attackersand what remained of the force was pushed “back to the territory of Ukraine, where they continued to be hit by fire until they were completely eliminated”. Members of two anti-Kremlin groups, the Freedom of Russia Legion and the Russian Volunteer Corps (RVC), claimed responsibility while Kyiv denied any involvement with the raid. “We are not waging war on foreign territories,” Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Ganna Malyar said on Tuesday. In a video purportedly released by the Freedom of Russia Legion on Monday, a camouflaged spokesman, surrounded by armed men in fatigues, said: “Russia will be free!” – a slogan frequently used by Russian opposition activists.    Little is known about the two groups or their ties with the Ukrainian military. The RVC was founded last August and reportedly consists mostly of anti-Putin far-right Russian fighters who have links with Ukrainian far-right groups. Moscow-based journalist Yulia Shapovalova told Al Jazeera that the Kremlin believe all the attackers were “Ukrainian militants”. Belgorod in southwest Russia is located about 80km (45 miles) north of the city of Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine. The region is known for hosting Russian military assets, including fuel and ammunition depots. Belgorod was included in Russian President Vladimir Putin’s order last year to increase the state of readiness for attacks and improve defences. Similar to Russia’s neighbouring Bryansk region and other border areas, Belgorod haswitnessed sporadic spilloverfrom the war in Ukraine. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov refused to say on Tuesday how many attackers were involved in the assault or comment on why efforts to put down the attackers took so long. The governor of the Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said the raid targeted the rural area around Graivoron, a town about 5km (3 miles) from the border. The regional governor complained in a video late on Tuesday that federal authorities’ claims for the past year that “everything is under control” did not ring true in light of the cross-border incursion and earlier attacks. He appealed again to the Kremlin to strengthen defences in the region. Russia’s military reaction to the raid – described by the Institute for the Study of War as a “very small and localised undertaking” – was “highly disproportionate” to the scale of the attack, the Washington DC-based think tank said. “Russian forces should not have required significant reinforcements – or the involvement of a colonel general – to repulse a raid conducted by reportedly 13 armoured vehicles,” the ISW said on Wednesday. The#Russianreaction to the raid in the information space and in the reported military activities appears to be a highly disproportionate response to a very small and localized undertaking. 2/2https://t.co/ujMqJTaBZipic.twitter.com/BTbqLfYPAq — ISW (@TheStudyofWar)May 24, 2023  On Wednesday, Gladkov reported on his Telegram channel that a drone had dropped an explosive device on a road in Belgorod damaging a car, though no one was injured in the attack, according to initial information. A Russian bomb squad and emergency workers were at the scene of the attack, Russia TASS news agency reported, citing the governor’s Telegram channel. In a separate post, the governor reported that a drone had been shot down over Belgorod, though it was unknown if that drone was responsible for the attack on the road or if it was a different drone, TASS reported. The Russian news portal RBK, quoting unidentified sources in Russia’s regional interior ministry and territorial police, said that during the cross-border incursion, Graivoron came under heavy shelling that lasted about five hours early on Monday. After that, tanks fired at the Graivoron border checkpoint while the adjacent village of Kozinka came under mortar and rocket fire, RBK said, citing the same sources. The attacking force was made up of 10 armoured vehicles and an unspecified number of troops, RBK said. Gladkov also reported that fire from the Ukrainian side of the border on Tuesday hit the Borisovka area, about 20km (20 miles) northeast of Graivoron. No casualties were reported, he said without elaborating on the incident. The attack on Russia’s Belgorod comes ahead of a widely expected Ukrainian offensive and Russia reinforcing hundreds of kilometres of front lines with tank barriers, trenches and troops. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited Ukrainian troops on the front line in the eastern region of Donetsk on Tuesday, where Russian forces have concentrated their efforts to capture territory. “Every day on the battlefield, Ukrainian marines prove that they are a powerful force that destroys the enemy, liberates Ukrainian land and performs the most difficult tasks in the most difficult conditions,” Zelenskyy said, announcing the creation of a Ukrainian marine corps.

Russia says Su-27 jet sent to prevent US planes violating border,Russia says it sent a fighter jet to intercept two US B-1B bombers flying over the Baltic Sea in international airspace.,"Russia said it scrambled an Su-27 fighter jet to “prevent violations of the state border” by two United States Air Force strategic bombers flying over the Baltic Sea. Russia’s Defence Ministry said in a statement on Tuesday that the military had prevented any border violation by the US planes and “the flight of the Russian fighter was carried out in strict accordance with international rules for the use of airspace”. “After removing the foreign military aircraft from the Russian state border, the Russian fighter went back to its air base,” the defence ministry said. “The crew of the Russian fighter classified the aerial targets as two US Air Force B-1B strategic bombers,” it said. Pentagon spokesman Brigadier General Pat Ryder confirmed on Tuesday that US aircraft were intercepted by Russia, saying the B-1 bombers were taking part in a planned exercise in Europe and the Russian fighter’s interaction with the US planes was “safe and professional”. “So we do have two B-1 bombers that are part of a bomber task force… that we fly regularly around the world in various countries. This is a long-planned exercise in Europe and my understanding is that it was a safe and professional interaction with Russian aircraft. So nothing significant to report on that front,” he toldreporters. The Russian interception of the US bombers is the latest in a series of aerial interactions involving Russian, US and NATO military aircraft amid tension in relations following Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year. In March, a US surveillance drone crashed into the Black Sea after it was intercepted by Russian jets in international airspace.    The US military said it was forced to ditch the MQ-9 Reaper drone in the sea after one of the Russian jets struck the drone’s propeller. Russia denied that its jets caused any physical harm to the US drone, alleging it crashed while making a sharp manoeuvre. TheUS military soon after releaseda declassified 42-second video clip showing the Russian Su-27 fighter jets making close passes while dumping fuel in an apparent bid to damage the drone’s optical and other hi-tech instruments. In later April, fighter jets from the United Kingdom werescrambled to intercepta Russian military aircraft operating north of Scotland. Typhoon fighters intercepted the Russian Tu-142 maritime patrol aircraft as it approached UK airspace from the North Atlantic Ocean after flying in international airspace over the Norwegian Sea. Aspart of a joint NATO response, Norway had earlier scrambled its air force’s F-35A fighter planes to intercept the Russian aircraft. A week earlier, German and UK fighter planes, operating as part of NATO’s air defence in northeastern Europe, intercepted three Russian reconnaissance aircraft in international airspace over the Baltic Sea. The two Russian Su-27 fighter planes and an Ilyushin IL-20 aircraft were flying without transmitting transponder signals in international airspace, the German air force said at the time. Earlier this month, Russia said that two aircraft, one German and one French, were intercepted attempting to “violate” its airspace and in mid-April, a Russian fighter jet was scrambled to escort a German naval aircraft over the Baltic Sea.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/24/russia-says-su-27-jet-sent-to-prevent-us-planes-violating-border
Attacks in Russia’s Belgorod: What we know so far,Ukraine has denied any involvement in a daring cross-border assault that threatens to further escalate the war.,"Fifteen months after Moscow’s troops invaded Ukraine, one of the largest and most daring cross-border attacks since the war began has been carried out in Russia. On Monday, two anti-Kremlin groups – the Russian Volunteer Corps (RVC) and Freedom of Russia Legion – claimed responsibility for the incursion in the Belgorod region. Fighting continued for a second day early on Tuesday. A dozen people are reportedly wounded and some residents have been evacuated. Later on Tuesday, Russia’s Defence Ministry said that the units it blamed had been forced back into Ukrainian territory. More than 70 attackers have been killed, the ministry said, a figure that was not possible to verify. After accusing Ukraine, Russia opened a “terrorism” investigation. Officials in Kyiv say they had nothing to do with the attacks. Here is what we know so far: Russia’s Belgorod provincebordersUkraine’s Luhansk, Sumy and Kharkiv regions. It is about 600km (373 miles) from the Russian capital, Moscow, and has been a front-line region, serving as a vital base for the Kremlin’s armed forces to launch attacks towards Ukraine. But Belgorod has also exposed Russian vulnerabilities. Moscow accidentally bombed Belgorod citylast month, while fuel and ammunition stores in the region have been rocked by explosions since the start of the war. Early on Monday, Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov raised an alarm with the Kremlin, saying a Ukrainian “sabotage group” had entered Russian territory in the Grayvoron district. According to Russia, the raiders opened fire with mortars and artillery on residential and administrative buildings and civilian infrastructure. Russian air-defence forces reportedly shot down drones over the region. Moscow later said it was carrying out a counterterrorism operation. Gladkov said one elderly lady had died while being evacuated, but that no civilians were killed in the clashes. He described the situation as “extremely tense”. Social media users said air raid sirens rang out and that checkpoints had been targeted. Fighting continued for a second day. At midday on Tuesday, Russia said it had pushed back the attackers and that 70 had been killed. On Tuesday, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington, DC-based based think-tank, said that two “all-Russian pro-Ukrainian” groups had crossed the border with tanks, armoured personnel carriers and other weaponised vehicles, citing Russian sources. Russia accused Ukraine of launching the attacks, but Kyiv has denied involvement. Throughout the war, Ukraine has not taken responsibility for any attacks against Russia, saying its fight is purely defensive. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, as quoted by Russia’s state news agency RIA Novosti, said the purpose of the alleged Ukrainian mission in Belgorod was “to divert attention from the direction of Bakhmut”. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said on Twitter that Kyiv had “nothing to do with it” and suggested that an “armed guerrilla movement” had emerged to oppose “a totalitarian country”. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev accused the United States, European Union and United Kingdom, which he referred to as “the sponsors of the Kyiv regime”, of being responsible for “sabotage”. Kyiv’s denial was “an absolute lie”, he said. Ukrainian news broadcaster Hromadske, citing Ukrainian military intelligence sources, said that two armed Russian opposition groups, the Freedom of Russia Legion and the Russian Volunteer Corps (RVC), consisting of Russian citizens, were responsible for the attack on the Belgorod region. Asked about reports that the attackers were ethnic Russians, Peskov said: “They are Ukrainian fighters from Ukraine. There are many ethnic Russians living in Ukraine. But they are still Ukrainian militants.” The RVC was founded by a far-right Russian national last August and is comprised ofRussianswho have been fighting in and for Ukraine against their own country. The group has also been active over the border in Russian territory, and claimed responsibility for a raid there in March. The Ukrainian military intelligence agency says the RVC is an independent underground group inside Russia that also has a unit in the Ukrainian Foreign Legion. The Foreign Legion says it has nothing to do with the RVC. Late Monday, the RVC published video footage on its Telegram feed appearing to show fighters operating an armoured vehicle on a country road inside Russia. The Reuters news agency was able to identify one of the men as Ilya Bogdanov, a Russian national who received Ukrainian citizenship in 2015 after fighting for Kyiv against Russian-backed forces in Ukraine’s east. The Legion and the RVC completely liberated n/a Kozinka, Belgorod Oblast. Forward units have entered Graivoron. Moving on. Russia will be free! — ""Liberty of Russia"" Legion (@legion_svoboda)May 22, 2023  The Freedom of Russia Legion – also known as the Liberty of Russia Legion – says it was formed in spring 2022 “out of the wish of Russians to fight in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine against Putin’s armed gang”. It says it cooperates with the Ukrainian armed forces and operates under Ukrainian command. It has claimed responsibility for the attack in Belgorod and says it has been fighting in eastern Ukraine. The Ukrainian military intelligence agency’s spokesperson said on Monday that the attacks in Belgorod only involved Russian citizens and that they were creating a “security zone” to protect Ukrainian civilians. He did not confirm or deny that the forces operating there are a Ukrainian unit. The Freedom of Russia Legion said on Twitter that it had “completely liberated” the border town of Kozinka in the Belgorod region and its forward units had reached the district centre of Grayvoron, further east. “Moving on. Russia will be free!” the group wrote. The attack on Russia has upped the ante and comes just as Moscowannouncedthe capture of Bakhmut, the eastern Ukrainian city levelled by months of fighting. Kremlin spokesman Peskov cast the attack as an “invasion” of “serious concern”, promising “great efforts in response”. On Monday, according to Russia’s RIA Novosti, Peskov also said that work was under way to “squeeze out Ukrainian saboteurs from Russian territory”. According to the UK, the attacks highlight Moscow’s struggles in the war. “Russia is facing an increasingly serious multi-domain security threat in its border regions with losses of combat aircraft, improvised explosive device attacks on rail lines, and now direct partisan action,” the British defence ministry said. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s Podolyak has said that Kyiv is continuing to monitor reports “with interest” and is “studying the situation.”   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/23/attacks-in-russias-belgorod-what-we-know-so-far
Hungary’s Orban says ‘poor Ukrainians’ cannot win against Russia,"Orban addresses a forum in Qatar, saying peace can only be achieved through diplomacy.","Doha, Qatar –Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who isoftenout of step with his Western allies regarding Ukraine, has said Kyiv’s troops are unlikely to win the war against Russia. Speaking at the Qatar Economic Forum in Doha on Tuesday, he said the conflict which started 15 months ago can only be resolved by diplomacy. “Looking at the reality, the figures, the surroundings, the fact that NATO is not ready to send troops, it is obvious that there is no victory for the poor Ukrainians on the battlefield. That’s my position,” he said, offering an outlook few European leaders would publicly agree with, given their solidarity with Kyiv. “The war can be stopped only if the Russians can make an agreement with the US. In Europe, we are not happy with that, but it’s the only way out.” Hungary, which is an EU and NATO member, has been playing abalancing actsince the war in Ukraine began. Budapest has refused to break ties with Moscow and has opposed NATO enlargement. Like Turkey, Hungary has not yet ratified Sweden’s membership of the military alliance and Orban has laid out specific concerns on Ukraine’s NATO hopes. A populist, the 59-year-old often heats up debates in Brussels whenever the bloc is tasked with making unanimous decisions on tougher sanctions against Russia or more financial and military aid to Ukraine. Last week, Orban opposed sending more EU military aid to Ukraine after authorities in Kyiv put Hungary’s OTP Bank on a list of “war sponsors” and blacklisted the bank. In Doha, Orban said that if Ukraine needs more money, Kyiv should respect Hungary and not sanction Hungarian companies. He added that Budapest “does not belong to the mainstream European approach”. “Hungary is in a unique position as Ukraine is not far away. We have ethnic minorities living in Ukraine and they are part of the war. They are conscripted, they are soldiers in the Ukrainian army and they die. So we lose lives – Hungarian lives – as well,” he said, referring to ethnic Hungarians within Ukraine. “Our hearts are with the Ukrainians. We understand how much has happened,” he said. “But I am speaking here as a politician and the solution is to save lives.” With reporting by Al Jazeera’sHafsa Adilin Doha.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/23/hungarys-orban-says-poor-ukrainians-cannot-win-the-war
"Why Saudi Arabia, Arab League invited Zelenskyy to their summit","Ukraine’s president and Arab nations might not seem like a natural fit, but they both had their reasons for extending and accepting invitation.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been on a whirlwind of foreign visits in recent weeks to shore up diplomatic support for Kyiv’s fight against Russia’s invasion. Last week, helanded in the Saudi city of Jeddahin a previously unannounced visit to attend an Arab League summit and try to broaden support beyond his Western partners. Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine 15 months ago, Kyiv has failed to garner substantial backing from Arab states, which have largely remained neutral. Saudi Arabia and other oil-producing Gulf nations have maintained warm ties with the Kremlin. Although most Arab governments have voted to condemn Moscow’s invasion at the United Nations, these states, in line with much of the Global South, have generally avoided taking sides. Most Arab League members have called for a diplomatic settlement, and none has taken any action against Russia, such as economic sanctions, that might antagonise Moscow. For the most part, Arab officials have viewed this war as a European crisis to be handled by Western nations and Russia. Conflicts and turmoil within the Arab world – such as in Sudan, Syria, Yemen, Libya, and Israel and Palestine – are of much greater concern to Saudi Arabia and other Arab states than the Ukraine war. In Zelenskyy’s address to the Arab League, he accused some of its members of deciding to “turn a blind eye” to Russia’s war against Ukraine while also expressing his belief that “we can all be united in saving people from the cages of Russian prisons.” Joseph A Kéchichian, a senior fellow at the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies in Riyadh, told Al Jazeera that “independent Arab commentators were impressed by the Ukrainian president’s bold statements, especially when he called on Arabs to ‘reflect on their ties with Russia’.” Kéchichian called it a “rare tour de force” in which Zelenskyy promised higher levels of Arab-Ukrainian cooperation in the future. For years, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and other Gulf states have maintainedimportant tieswith Ukraine across multiple fields, such as wheat imports, energy, non-oil trade and tourism.    This year, Saudi Arabia announced $400m in aid for Ukraine, including a $300m grant in oil derivatives. Zelenskyy took the opportunity to thank Riyadh for its role in arranging the exchange of political prisoners with Russia in September. The Ukrainian head of state also invited Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, also known as MBS, to Kyiv. Zelenskyy appealed to his audience at the Arab League summit in ways that were like his address at theDoha Forum in March 2022when he talked about the plight of the Muslim minority in Russian-occupied Crimea. He again focused on the Ukrainian Muslims in Crimea, seeking to connect his nation’s struggle to wider Islamic sensitivities. The Crimean Peninsula is the ancestral homeland of the Crimean Tatars, a Turkic group of Sunni Muslims. By describing Ukraine’s resistance to Russian aggression as being about fighting “occupation” and “colonisers” in pursuit of “justice”, Zelenskyy used language that sits well with Arabs and audiences across the Global South more broadly. However, some commentators on social media were quick to criticise Zelenskyy for not mentioning the Israeli occupation of Palestine in his address at the Arab League summit. It is not clear if Zelenskyy’s speech will do anything to shift any of the Arab states’ stances towards the conflict in Ukraine. Some experts argue that a change in tack is somewhat doubtful given geopolitical realities of a more multipolar world in which Riyadh and other Arab capitals increasingly value their expanding partnerships with Moscow. “I think that for Zelenskyy this was a really great opportunity to try and spotlight Ukraine’s ongoing struggle against Russian intervention,” said Caroline Rose, a senior analyst and head of the power vacuums programme at the New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy. “Whether that will be successful, I’m not necessarily sure, particularly given Saudi Arabia’s proclivity recently to aligning with other great powers outside the West, particularly with China and Russia,” she said. Experts say the hosting of the Ukrainian leader was also aimed at warding off Western criticism of Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states. Some officials in the United States have accused Riyadh of helping fund Russia’s war against Ukraine due to its crude production cut that sent oil prices soaring. Saudi-led OPEC’s cooperation with Russia has received harsh criticism from many in Washington. Having Zelenskyy address the Arab League must be understood as part of a Saudi and Gulf Cooperation Council effort to reinforce that the Arab states are balanced between Moscow and Kyiv. On May 19, MBS renewed an offer to mediate between Ukraine and Russia. “We reaffirm the kingdom’s readiness to continue mediating efforts between Russia and Ukraine and to support all international efforts aimed at resolving the crisis politically in a way that contributes to achieving security,” the crown prince said. There’s also the Syrian factor, experts said. “Inviting Zelenskyy helped mitigate some of the other controversial elements of the summit – for example, the invitation of [Syrian President] Bashar al-Assad, which was of course extremely sensitive given the context of normalisation,” Rose said. Citing human rights abuses and the lack of a political solution to Syria’s conflict, the West has voiced its opposition to Arab governments’ rapprochements with Damascus. With MBS at the helm, Saudi Arabia is increasingly keen to position Riyadh as the leader of the Arab world and a diplomatic heavyweight on the international stage. By entering a new era of détente with arch foe Iran this year, moving towards a peace deal with Yemen’s Houthi rebels and reconciling with the Syrian government, Saudi Arabia has opted for more diplomatic engagement and less confrontation in the kingdom’s foreign policy. Riyadh has also played a leading diplomatic role in the conflict in Sudan that erupted last month. Although MBS’s alleged role in the 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul made him relatively isolated on the international stage, he entered his post-Khashoggi rehabilitation period last year. The situation in Ukrainehas enabledthe Saudi leader to stress Riyadh’s role in helping European nations cope with energy challenges by diverting more crude oil to those countries. In the process, MBS has gained significantly higher levels of confidence, reflected by his increasingly assertive foreign policy decisions on regional and international levels. The extent to which MBS has been fostering closer ties with Washington’s top geopolitical rivals and foes – China and Russia – while taking steps to bring Syria’s government in from the diplomatic wilderness speaks to this assertive foreign policy. This month’s Arab League summit should strengthen the de facto Saudi ruler’s “clout in the region” and “burnish MBS’s credentials” as a leader in the Arab world, Patrick Theros, the former US ambassador to Qatar, told Al Jazeera.

"Russian PM arrives in China for business forum, talks with Xi",China’s deepening economic and political relationship with Russia has not been derailed by Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.,"Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin is in China for a visit in which he will meet President Xi Jinping and sign a series of deals on infrastructure and trade. Mishustin arrived late on Monday in Shanghai where he was greeted at the airport by Moscow’s Ambassador to China Igor Morgulov and Beijing’s top diplomat to Russia Zhang Hanhui. He will take part in a Russian-Chinese Business Forum and visit a petrochemical research institute in Shanghai, the Kremlin said, as well as hold talks with “representatives of Russian business circles”. That forum has invited a number of sanctioned Russian tycoons — including from the key fertiliser, steel and mining sectors — as well as Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, who handles energy issues, according to Bloomberg News. China last year became the top energy customer for Russia, whose gas exports had otherwise plummeted after Western countries imposed severe sanctions overMoscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Mishustin will then travel to Beijing where he will meet Xi and Premier Li Qiang, Russian state media TASS reported. Li said the country is willing to further expand economic and trade exchanges with Russia, state media reported on Tuesday. China and Russia have in recent years ramped up economic cooperation and diplomatic contacts with their strategic partnership growing closer since Moscow launched its invasion. While China says it is a neutral party in that war, it has not condemned Russian actions. Mishustin said Russia hoped to sell more agricultural products to China. “Russian agriculturalists are ready to significantly expand the export of their production to the Chinese market and broaden the range of plant and animal products supplied,” Mishustin said, adding forthis to happen, however, barriers would have to be dismantled. Mishustin also talked about closer ties with China in the high-tech industry, according to TASS. A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman backed Russia on Tuesday, condemning what she called “unilateral sanctions” that are based neither on international law nor on a UN Security Council mandate. Cooperation between China and Russia is not directed against other states, she said. In February, Beijing released a12-point papercalling for a “political settlement” to the conflict, which Western countries said could enable Russia to hold onto much of the territory it has seized in Ukraine. During a March summit in Moscow, Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed an agreement to bring ties into a“new era”of cooperation. Xi also invited Putin, who had days earlier been the target of an International Criminal Courtarrest warrantover alleged war crimes in Ukraine, to visit Beijing. Analysts say China holds the upper hand in the relationship with Russia and its sway is growing as Moscow’s international isolation deepens.

US says Russia’s Wagner force eyes Mali as route for war supplies,Russian mercenary force said to be willing to falsify paperwork to use Mali as transit point for Ukraine war equipment.,"Russia’s Wagner mercenary forcehas attempted to hide efforts to obtain military equipment internationally for use in the war in Ukraine and is seeking to transit such supplies through Mali, the United States State Department said. The private mercenary force, which is fighting alongside Russian troops in Ukraine, is willing to use false paperwork to ship military equipment through Mali, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters at a news briefing on Monday. “We have been informed that Wagner is seeking to transit material acquisitions to aid Russia’s war through Mali and is willing to use false paperwork for these transactions,” Miller said. “In fact, there are indications that Wagner has been attempting to purchase military systems from foreign suppliers, and route these weapons through Mali as a third party,” he said. “We have not seen, as of yet, any indications that these acquisitions have been finalised or executed, but we are monitoring the situation closely.” Miller added thatthe US has imposed sanctions on people and entities“across multiple continents” who have been found to “support Wagner’s military operations”, and Washington would have more to say soon on the attempt to ship equipment through Mali.    Earlier this month, the French parliament adopted a resolution calling on the European Union to formally declare the Wagner mercenary force a “terror group”, a move that followed after the US declared Wagner a “transnational criminal organisation” in January. Wagner and its entrepreneur owner Yevgeny Prigozhin have beenrepeatedly sanctioned by the US and EU for human rights abusesin Africa and for participating in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Western countries have also raised concerns over the activities of Wagner mercenaries in Mali. Earlier this month,the UN Human Rights Office announcedthat a fact-finding report had concluded that there were “strong indications” that more than 500 people were killed in Mali by Malian troops and foreign military personnel — believed to be from Wagner — during an operation in March 2022 that took place over five days in Moura village in the country’s central Mopti region.  Most of those killed were executed, the UN said. “Witnesses reported seeing ‘armed white men’ who spoke an unknown language operating alongside the Malian forces and at times appearing to supervise operations,” the UN said in a statement. “According to witnesses, Malian troops were rotated in and out of Moura daily, but the foreign personnel remained for the duration of the operation,” the UN said.    The UN said that at least 58 women and girls were raped or subjected to other forms of sexual violence during the operation. “These are extremely disturbing findings,” UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said in the statement. “Summary executions, rape and torture during armed conflict amount to war crimes and could, depending on the circumstances, amount to crimes against humanity,” Turk said. Mali’s military rulers and Russia have previously maintained that Wagner personnel in Mali are no mercenaries but trainers helping local troops with military equipment purchased from Russia.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/23/us-says-russias-wagner-force-eyes-mali-as-route-for-war-supplies

Russian ‘clean up’ operation after raid on Belgorod from Ukraine,The Liberty of Russia Legion and Russian Volunteer Corps said to be involved in cross-border incursion in Russia’s Belgorod region.,"Moscow’s forces are continuing to engage in operations againstcross-border raiders– described alternatively as either armed Russian opposition groups or Ukrainian saboteurs – who entered Russia from Ukraine in one of the most daring attacks on Russian territory since the Kremlin’s war on Kyiv began 15 months ago. The governor of Russia’s Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said on Tuesday that a “counterterrorism operation” was continuing against what he had earlier described as a Ukrainian “sabotage group” which had entered Russian territory in the Graivoron district bordering Ukraine. The governor told residents who fled Graivoron that it was “not possible to return yet” to their homes. “On the situation in the Graivoron district: the cleaning of the territory by the Ministry of Defence together with law enforcement agencies continues,” he said on the Telegram messaging app. One woman has been killed and two people wounded but Russian forces have been unable to reach them, he added. Ukrainian news broadcaster Hromadske, citing Ukrainian military intelligence sources, said on Monday that two armed Russian opposition groups, the Liberty of Russia Legion and the Russian Volunteer Corps (RVC), consisting of Russian citizens, were responsible for the attack on the Belgorod region. Little is known about the groups or their ties with the Ukrainian military. The RVC was founded last August and reportedly consists mostly of anti-Putin far-right Russian fighters who have links with Ukrainian far-right groups. Ukraine intelligence representative Andrii Cherniak also said Russian citizens were behind the cross-border assault. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said on Twitter that Ukraine had “nothing to do with it” and suggested that an “armed guerrilla movement” had emerged to oppose “a totalitarian country”. “Ukraine is watching the events in the #Belgorod region of #Russia with interest and studying the situation,” he said. The only driving political force in a totalitarian country of tightened screws is always an armed guerrilla movement.#Ukraineis watching the events in the#Belgorodregion of#Russiawith interest and studying the situation, but it has nothing to do with it.

The RVC published video footage late on Monday on their Telegram social media channel which showed what the group said was a fighter inspecting a captured Russian armoured vehicle. Another video showed what it said were fighters operating an armoured vehicle on a country road inside Russian territory.

The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington, DC-based based think tank, said on Tuesday that two “all-Russian pro-Ukrainian” groups had crossed the border with tanks, armoured personnel carriers and other armoured vehicles, according to Russian sources. Some military bloggers fixated on the fact that the invading units were comprised mostly of Russians, leading some to label them “traitors to Russia”, according to the ISW, while Wagner mercenary force boss Yevgeny Prigozhin blamed Russia’s defence ministry for being unable to defend the country’s borders. 2/ Russian sources reported on the morning of May 22 that a detachment of the RDK & LSR consisting of several armored vehicles crossed the international border & captured Kozinka, a settlement in the Grayvoron region of#BelgorodOblast within 600m of the border with Sumy Oblast. — ISW (@TheStudyofWar)May 23, 2023  News of the cross-border attack saw the Russian information space respond “with a similar degree of panic, factionalism, and incoherency as it tends to display when it experiences significant informational shocks”, the ISW said. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Monday that Russian President Vladimir Putin had been informed and that work was under way to drive out the “saboteurs”, the state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported. An effort to “push them out from the Russian territory and liquidate them” was under way, he said. Peskov described the action as an attempt by Ukraine todivert attention from the eastern city of Bakhmut, which Moscow claimed to have captured after months of battle butwhere Kyiv says it is still fighting. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s minister of internal affairs, posted several video clips from social media about the attacks and the groups involved in the incursion, including a video purportedly showing a Freedom of Russia Legion flag attached to balloons and reportedly flying in Moscow.

The RVC was founded last August by Denis Kapustin, a Ukraine-based Russian nationalist, and announced on May 17 that it was joining forces with the Liberty of Russia Legion, which calls itself the Freedom of Russia Legion in English.

Fall of Bakhmut would signal ‘a Pyrrhic victory for Wagner’,"We speak to a Ukrainian military expert, serviceman and analysts on what the possible capture of Bakhmut means.","Kyiv, Ukraine– According to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Bakhmut resembles Hiroshima after the 1945 nuclear bombing. The ravaged southeastern city, home to about 70,000 people before the war broke out, has been reduced to ruins after a 10-month-long siege. “Nothing alive left. All of the buildings have been ruined,” Zelenskyy told a meeting of the Group of Seven (G7) nations in Hiroshima on Sunday. Hours earlier, Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Wagner mercenary group, announced a complete takeover of Bakhmut while Kyiv said it still had toeholds on the outskirts of the mining and university city. If confirmed, Bakhmut’s capture would be Russia’s first military gain since the fall ofSoledar, a much smaller town northeast of Bakhmut, in January. However, the gain is more symbolic than strategic – especially given Russian President Vladimir Putin’s hopes for a triumphant blitzkrieg in Ukraine in February 2022. Bakhmut was seized mostly by Wagner’s forces, a group that largely consists of untrained inmates recruited from Russian prisons after regular Russian servicemen proved too disorganised, disheartened and poorly trained. Wagner started human-wave assaults, called “meat marches”, in December. They were backed by massive, nearly round-the-clock artillery and mortar fire as well as air strikes. A top Ukrainian military expert said Wagner has been bled dry by colossal losses of manpower and equipment in their slow, street-by-street advance. “This is a Pyrrhic victory for Wagner,” Lieutenant General Ihor Romanenko, former deputy chief of the General Staff of Ukraine’s armed forces, told Al Jazeera. “Prigozhin understands it too,” he said. “He just had to report a military-political result [to Putin], something apart from Soledar.” Prigozhin reportedly made a personal pledge to Putin to seize Bakhmut, even though the city had lost its transport and logistical importance for Ukraine’s forces, which rerouted their supply lines last year. Romanenko said Kyiv’s troops still control the hills near Bakhmut, preventing Russia’s advance towards the heavily fortified cities and towns of Chasiv Yar, Konstantinivka, Kramatorsk and Sloviansk. United States President Joe Biden told the G7 that Russians had lost 100,000 servicemen there since the siege began in July – more than Bakhmut’s entire pre-war civilian population. Russia lost five servicemen to Ukraine’s every one, a NATO source told CNN on Sunday. Prigozhin said his mercenaries willretreatfrom Bakhmut in days. They will hand over the city to regular Russian servicemen, he said, something that could prove problematic because they largely consist of recently mobilised men with poor training and low morale. Ukraine has never divulged its military losses, but they were so severe that the White House urged Kyiv to leave Bakhmut in February, according to leaked US documents. Some Ukrainian servicemen expressed doubts about their commanders and said they were forced to return to defending Bakhmut despite severe wounds. “A bomb went off just metres away from me,” a Ukrainian serviceman who said he arrived in Kyiv for a “quick patch-up” and the christening of his son told Al Jazeera. “I see double, I had five contusions, but they want me back,” he said on the condition of anonymity. To his wife, his return to the front lines seems like an absolutely unnecessary sacrifice. “Do they have to finish him off there? Why can’t they find someone younger, someone who hasn’t been wounded that many times?” she told Al Jazeera. The takeover of Bakhmut seemed especially bitter after Ukraine started a surprising and successful counterattack there this month. But the counterattack was apparently aimed at saving the remaining Ukrainian servicemen, a military analyst said.    “The goal has been achieved,” Nikolay Mitrokhin of Germany’s Bremen University told Al Jazeera. “The [city] has been abandoned.” Bakhmut’s fall may delay a much bigger counteroffensive in the south, especially in the Zaporizhia region, where Kyiv had been amassing forces in recent weeks, he said. The delay also has to do with the arrival of new Western weaponry, especially advanced German-made Leopard A1 tanks, he said. Ukrainian forces “mostly likely won’t start an offensive in the south or elsewhere until they receive and test 80 Leopard A1 tanks that were pledged to them by June 1,” Mitrokhin said. The delay may prove detrimental to the restoration of Ukraine’s economy, which shrank by almost a third last year and has barely started recovering, observers said. Western governments and millions of refugees await the war’s end to pour aid in and return home. “Naturally, if the [victory] date is delayed by years, there are almost no chances for development,” Kyiv-based analyst Aleksey Kushch told Al Jazeera. Despite what Zelenskyy said about the ruins of Bakhmut, to the Kremlin and its backers, it was not a Hiroshima. It is not even Bakhmut because they persistently use the town’s Soviet-era name, Artyomovsk. The Kremlin released a statement promising state awards to “all those who distinguished themselves”, andpro-war Russianscompeted to praise the “triumph”. “Artyomovsk has been liberated. It’s a historic event,” a news host on Kremlin-controlled Channel One announced on Sunday. “The myth that Artyomovsk is an impregnable fortress has been destroyed.” “The takeover opens a direct and short way towards” the eastern city of Dnipro,” the Russia 1 channel reported. A few figures on Moscow’s side who dare contradict the Kremlin’s viewpoint do not consider Bakhmut’s takeover as a major event. “The efforts wasted on Bakhmut’s takeover are incalculable,” Aleksandr Khodarovsky, a commander in the separatist-controlled “People’s Republic of Donetsk” wrote on Telegram on Sunday. “Bakhmut is no Berlin, and its fall doesn’t signify the war’s end.” Another rebel warlord echoed Romanenko’s words about Russia’s “Pyrrhic” victory. “It wasn’t even approximately worth the forces and funds spent on it,” Igor Girkin, a former defence minister in separatist-occupied Donetsk, said in a Telegram post.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/22/as-russia-claims-victory-how-important-is-bakhmut
"Ukraine still has a foothold inside Bakhmut, says official","The deputy defence minister says Ukrainian troops are advancing near the city, over which Russia claimed victory.","Ukrainian troops are still advancing on the flanks of Bakhmut and have a small foothold inside the eastern city, a defence official in Kyiv has said, again raising doubts on Russia’s claims. Over the weekend, the Wagner Group and Russian military chiefs announced the capture of Bakhmut after months of heavy fighting. But on Monday, Ukraine’s Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said in televised comments: “We are still advancing, but the intensity is somewhat reduced. “If we talk about the north, there is much less active action there. If we talk about the south, we are advancing and the defence of Bakhmut as a city has completely fulfilled its military objective.”  On Saturday, Russia announced it had taken control of Bakhmut after a bloody 15-month battle, which, if confirmed, would be a significant success for Moscow after facing setbacks on the front lines. The fight for the city has been the longest and bloodiest of the war so far. Mercenary forces, who have spearheaded the fight, posted videos on Telegram waving Wagner and Russian flags in the destroyed city.    Russian President Vladimir Putincongratulatedhis army and Wagner on the alleged capture. To Moscow, seizing Bakhmut would be a stepping stone towards advancing deeper into the Donbas region and towards the city of Sloviansk. However, since making the announcement, officials from Russia and Ukraine have given contrasting status updates about who has won the city or whether fighting was still ongoing. On Sunday, Ukrainian General Oleksandr Syrskyi said on Telegram that Kyiv’s troops were continuing to advance on Russian forces in the suburbs and getting closer to a “tactical encirclement” of the city. Maliar echoed Syrskyi’s observations on Sunday, saying a “semi-encirclement” could allow Ukraine to “destroy the enemy … the enemy has to defend himself in the part of the city he controls”. At a meeting of Group of Seven (G7) countries in Japan, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Bakhmut had not fallen and likened the city to the destruction of Hiroshima. Responding to a reporter’s question about the city’s status, he said: “Bakhmut is not occupied by the Russian Federation as of today.” Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Wagner forces, responded to Zelenskyy’s comments, saying: “There is not a single Ukrainian soldier in the village of Bakhmut, for the reason that we have stopped taking prisoners. “There are a huge number of corpses of the Ukrainian military. Bakhmut is taken completely along all its legal boundaries, to the last centimetre. [Zelenskyy] is disingenuous, or he, like our military leaders, is simply not aware of what is happening on the ground.” On Monday, Prigozhin said his troops would leave Bakhmut later this week after taking the city as promised and transfer control of Bakhmut to the Russian military.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/22/ukraine-deny-fall-of-bakhmut-wagner-group-announce-retreat

Russia says F-16 transfer to Ukraine would raise NATO question,Latest Russian warning comes after US President Joe Biden agreed to provide training to Ukrainian pilots on fighter jets.,"The transfer of F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine would raise the question of NATO’s involvement in the conflict, Russia’s Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov has said. “There is no infrastructure for the operation of the F-16 in Ukraine and the needed number of pilots and maintenance personnel is not there either,” Antonov said in remarks published on the embassy’s Telegram messaging channel on Monday. “What will happen if the American fighters take off from NATO airfields, controlled by foreign ‘volunteers’?” Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has for months been calling on the country’s Western allies to supply advanced fighter jets amid concerns such a move would be met with an escalation by Russian President Vladimir Putin. But amid a flurry of diplomacy by Zelenskyy ahead of the just-concludedG7 summitin Hiroshima, Japan, United Kingdom Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte announced last week they had agreed to build an “international coalition” to provide fighter jet support for Ukraine. Then on Friday, US President Joe Biden endorsed training programmes for Ukrainian pilots on F-16 fighter jets, with Zelenskyy assuring Biden that the aircraft would not be used to go into Russian territory. Over the weekend, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko warned Western countries would be running “colossal risks” if they went ahead with the supply of the F-16s. Antonov said that any Ukrainian attack on Crimea, which Moscowinvaded and annexed in 2014, would be considered an attack on Russia. “It is important that the United States be fully aware of the Russian response,” Antonov said. The international community does not recognise Russian sovereignty over Crimea. Air defence experts say US-built F-16 fighter jets wouldoffer Ukraine an edgeover the Russian air force, but only if combined with powerful missiles and targeting information, which the West would also have to provide and which would risk drawing Ukraine’s Western allies more actively into the war.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/22/russia-says-f-16-transfer-to-ukraine-would-raise-nato-question
Russians celebrate reports that ‘fortress Bakhmut’ has fallen,Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is denying claims that the eastern city is under Russian control after months of heavy battle.,"On Saturday, mercenaries from the Russian private military contractor the Wagner Groupclaimed victoryin the east Ukrainian town of Bakhmut after a gruelling battle that lasted for eight months. For the most part, the pro-Moscow camp has been elated at finally dislodging the stubborn Ukrainian defenders. Although Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hasdenied on Sunday that Bakhmut has fallen, Russian businessman andWagnerboss Yevgeny Prigozhin claimed otherwise in a voice memo to his 420,000 Telegram followers. “There is not a single Ukrainian soldier in the village of Bakhmut, for the reason that we have stopped taking prisoners,” he declared. “There are a huge number of corpses of the Ukrainian military. Bakhmut is taken completely along all its legal boundaries, to the last centimetre. Vladimir Alexandrovich [Zelenskyy] is disingenuous, or he, like our military leaders, is simply not aware of what is happening on the ground.” Through a statement on the Kremlin’s official press service, Russia’s President VladimirPutin congratulated the Russian army and Wagnermercenary group on the capture of Artemovsk, as the city was known in Soviet times and until 2016. Footage on both Russian TV and Telegram channels showed the Russian flag waving from the rooftop of an apartment building still standing among the ruins of Bakhmut. “Without exaggeration, a historical moment – the Wagner fighters are hoisting the Russian flag, and the flag of their company, on the last street of Artemovsk,” Amir Yusupov, a correspondent embedded on the front line, reported for the state-owned Channel One. “The city has been cleared …  Many could have left at the end of their contract, but every single one stayed.” One masked mercenary interviewed on camera compared the experience to World War II. “How could I leave the lads?” he asked. “I had to see this moment. These are probably the same emotions as our grandfathers felt in Berlin.”    The Wagner Orchestra, a Telegram channel describing themselves as “fans” of the mercenary outfit, published a video of bearded commander Alexander “Ratibor” Kuznetsov raising the Russian and Wagner flags over the ruined city and yelling ethnic slurs at Ukrainians, telling them to “go f*** themselves!” Another video on the channel shows a group of Wagner fighters triumphantly firing their weapons into the air as a Wagner flag waves in the background. An article by the state-owned news agency RIA Novosti on the “liberation of Artemovsk” blames Ukrainian forces for any civilian casualties. “Before the conflict began, more than seventy thousand people lived here,” it read. “Most have left the city. According to the refugees, Ukrainian soldiers deliberately fired on civilians.” The article assured that, despite Ukrainian propaganda, “fortress Bakhmut” had indeed fallen, which will allow Russian forces to move on to the nearby town of Chasiv Yar. “This is a victory, one of those that bring the main victory closer,” Andrey Medvedev, former journalist and Moscow politician, wrote on Telegram. “The path we still have to go is long and difficult, and we still have a lot to go through. There will be failures and disappointments. There will be days of dark despair and unbelief. But on such days we can remember just Bakhmut … Glory to the Russian soldier!” Despite Moscow’s claims of victory, Igor Girkin, nom de guerre Strelkov, a former Russian soldier and intelligence officer who led the original 2014-15 uprising of east Ukrainian separatists, painted a bleaker picture to his nearly 800,000 Telegram subscribers. He describes the capture of Bakhmut as not a victory in any tactical sense, but part of the Kremlin’s policy of “freezing the conflict through a compromise agreement”, and as such, only intending to wear the enemy down until Kyiv and its Western allies agree to let Russia keep Crimea and the Donbas. Strelkov is a hardline Russian nationalist who believes Moscow is not taking the conquest of Ukraine seriously enough. “On the whole, the operation ended in a strategic failure of our troops,” wrote Strelkov. “The enemy has NOT been ousted from the Donbas in all the main directions, in most directions – not moved at all.” He added that the Russian military had exhausted weapon stockpiles, ammunition and manpower that will be “necessary for further offensive operations”. “That’s why Bakhmut was given increased attention for the last two months – it was necessary to achieve at least some result ‘for propaganda’ in order to ‘take a breath’ afterwards. And so we won, sort of,” Strelkov said. Strelkov also warned that the resources spent on Bakhmut, an “unnecessary” and “Pyrrhic” victory that was “not worth the effort and money spent on it”, will leave the Russian side vulnerable to the Ukrainian counteroffensive.

Why is Bakhmut important in the Russia-Ukraine war?,The symbolic importance of the small city in Ukraine’s east now far outweighs any strategic value for either side.,"Russia claims it has fully captured Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine, but Kyiv says it still controls part of the city. Bakhmut, which once had a population of about 70,000 people, has seen eight months of fierce fighting in the bloodiest battle since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Russian President Vladimir Putincongratulated his troops and the Wagner Group private armyfor “liberating” the city on Saturday, but Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that although Russian troops are in Bakhmut, the city is “not occupied”. Colonel General Oleksandr Syrsky, commander of the Ground Forces of Ukraine, said on Sunday that Ukrainian troops are approaching the capture of the city in a tactical encirclement. Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Malyar said Ukrainian troops are advancing “in the suburbs on the flanks” and have “semi-encircled the city”.  But why has Bakhmut, a previously sleepy, nondescript city nestled away in the salt-mining region of eastern Ukraine, become so significant in the Russia-Ukraine war? Here is what you need to know: In order for Russia to advance further into Ukraine and achieve Putin’s aim of “liberating the Donbas”, Russia needs to capture Bakhmut. However, the huge amount of emphasis that both sides have placed on the city goes far beyond any strategic value. If either side were to completely capture Bakhmut, they would then face a series of defensive lines positioned around it. The city’s importance instead lies in the symbolic weight it has garnered over months of bitter, entrenched fighting. For Ukraine, it has become an example of dogged, determined resistance. The city has seen some of the most intense fighting since Russia’s invasion. Images of blood-soaked trench warfare are shared on the messaging app Telegram, and “Bakhmut holds!” is a popular slogan on social media. Russia, on the other hand, needs a victory. After its initial advances in the first months of its full-scale invasion, a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive reclaimed swathes of territory in a series of humiliating defeats for Russian forces.    As the Russian military lost face, the Wagner Group, a mercenary outfit hardened by years of deployments in Syria and various African nations, took on the fight for Bakhmut late last year. Since then, the Russian offensive in Bakhmut has become synonymous with the group, and its abrasive chiefYevgeny Prigozhinhas called out senior Russian military leaders and publicly berated them for not providing his forces with enough ammunition. A victory for Russia in Bakhmut could also be seen a victory for Prigozhin and potentially raise his standing with the Kremlin. Speaking on Sunday at the Group of Seven (G7) summit in Hiroshima, Japan, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the city has been “completely destroyed”, suggesting that a potential defeat would be cast by Kyiv as a pyrrhic victory for Russia. The loss of the city could inflict a blow to morale for Ukraine after so many months of bitter fighting. It is not known exactly how many troops on both sides have died in the conflict, but Moscow and Kyiv have both claimed to have killed hundreds in a single day. It would come at a time when Ukraine is expected to launch a highly anticipated counteroffensive, which could raise concerns amongst Ukraine’s allies. In March, Zelenskyy said if Bakhmut fell it could allow Russia to garner international support for a deal that might force Ukraine to make unacceptable compromises. The fall of the city could be a huge morale boost for Russia, which is in need of its first major victory in more than 10 months. Since the latter half of 2022, reports from the front lines of the war have tended to reflect Ukrainian advances in some areas and a grinding stalemate in others. Russia has launched several waves of drone and missile strikes at Ukrainian cities but claimed no significant territorial gains. Putin congratulated both the Wagner private army and regular Russian forces in a statement, indicating that the leader is eager to close what has been a grinding, resource-draining chapter in Russia’s attempts to capture the Donbas region. Strategically, a victory in Bakhmut could open up a path further west, possibly to Kramatorsk, a city with roughly 150,000 inhabitants before the war. However, Ukraine has heavily fortified the areas around the city of Bakhmut.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/21/why-is-bakhmut-important-in-the-russia-ukraine-war
Zelenskyy calls on G7 to ensure Russia is ‘last aggressor’,Ukrainian leader’s visit to Japan highlighted significant divisions preventing the formation of a united front against Russia.,"Hiroshima, Japan –Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called on the world to prevent future wars by ensuring Russia is the “last aggressor”, capping avisit to Japanthat secured new sanctions against Moscow and weapons for Kyiv. In a speech marking the end of a week-long diplomatic blitz spanning Europe, the Middle East and Asia, Zelenskyy said Ukraine’s victory against Russia would deter future aggressors, casting his10-point peace planas the world’s “salvation from war”. Zelenskyy’s plan, first proposed in November, would restore Ukraine’s borders and see the withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukrainian territory, as well as provide guarantees for nuclear, energy and food security. “We will paralyse other potential aggressors,” Zelenskyy told a press conference on Sunday, the last day of the Group of Seven (G7) summit in Hiroshima. “When everyone who wants war sees how determined the world is when it wants peace, there will be no point to start a war.” Zelenskyy made his address after securing commitments from G7 countries to ramp up pressure on Russia and boost support for the defence of Ukraine. United States President Joe Biden earlier announced a$375m military aid packagethat includes more ammunition, artillery and armoured vehicles, on top of offering his support for the training of Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 fighter jets. On Friday, the G7 leaders pledged to tighten their sanctions against Russia and continue to support Ukraine for the long term. Washington separately imposed new sanctions on 22 Russians and 104 Russian entities, while United Kingdom Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced a ban on imports of Russian diamonds, copper, aluminium, tin and nickel. The European Union is currently negotiating an 11th package of sanctions that aims to close loopholes and tackle the evasion of existing measures.    In a speech against the backdrop of the Atomic Bomb Dome earlier on Sunday, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, the G7 host, cast Zelenskyy’s attendance as evidence of his country’s “unwavering solidarity” with Ukraine and condemned Moscow’s invasion as striking at the “very foundation of the international order”. Even so, Zelenskyy’s visit highlighted significant divisions preventing the formation of a united front against Russia, and the Ukrainian leader did not get everything that he wanted in Hiroshima. While the G7 remains influential, its share of the global economy has plunged from about 70 percent during the 1980s to 44 percent today – meaning that choking the Russian economy increasingly requires buy-in from the wider international community. Kishida invited eight non-G7 members to the summit, including India, Indonesia, Australia and South Korea, as part of efforts to boost cooperation on global challenges, including the war in Ukraine. India, China and Turkey have ramped up imports of Russian energy since the invasion, blunting the impact of sanctions on Russia’s economy, which shrank by a less-than-expected 2.1 percent last year. While Zelenskyy met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who pledged to do “whatever we can” to resolve the Ukraine crisis, there were no indications that New Delhi would impose sanctions or curtail its purchases of Russian energy. “Nothing has changed fundamentally since the war began,” Alka Acharya, a professor at the Centre for East Asian Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, told Al Jazeera. “In terms of Indian interests and as he [Modi] has indicated, he would be championing the cause of the Global South at the summit. He would, in my view, stick to that brief – apart from making general observations about desiring a quick end to the war.” Zelenskyy did not meet with Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, commonly known as Lula, who last month said it was “no use now in saying who is right” in the conflict. The Ukrainian leader played down the lack of talks, suggesting that it was a simple matter of scheduling. “I think it disappointed him,” Zelenskyy said when asked if he was disappointed the two men did not meet, prompting laughter among the assembled media. Zelenskyy also admitted he would like to see Japan and South Korea provide weapons to Ukraine, along with all other countries capable of doing so, but acknowledged that “legislative and constitutional complications” made such moves difficult for some governments. Zelenskyy expressed confidence that his country would receive F-16 fighter jets from Western countries, although Kyiv has yet to secure commitments for the delivery of the planes. Yet even among the G7 members, gaps in the sanctions regime against Russia persist. Philipp Lausberg, a policy analyst at the European Policy Centre in Brussels, described the G7’s measures against Russia’s diamond trade, for example, as “meagre”. “The UK is the only country that went ahead and put in place an embargo on Russian diamonds, but all the other countries have only expressed their intent to at some point restrict the trade of Russian diamonds,” Lausberg told Al Jazeera. Still, Zelenskyy was defiant on Sunday evening as the curtain closed on his visit to Japan, expressing his belief that Russia “cannot win” its war and that “international law will never again apply” if Moscow is not stopped. “I believe war has no place in the world,” he said.

Tens of thousands rally in Moldova for EU membership,Demonstrators called on political leaders to amend the constitution to specifically mention the country’s European orientation.,"Tens of thousands of Moldovans rallied in the capital Chisinau to support their pro-Western government’s drive towards Europe amid what officials have said areRussian effortsto destabilise their country. More than 75,000 people participated on Sunday in the demonstration in the centre of the capital, according to initial police estimates. They waved European Union flags and chanted pro-European slogans. “We came to say loudly, confidently and proudly that Moldovans are Europeans!” President Maia Sandu, who had called for the rally, told the crowd. She said her country wanted to join the 27-nation EU by 2030. “This is the chance for our people to live in peace and prosperity,” she said. Moldova has been badly hit by the impact of Moscow’s invasion of neighbouring Ukraine, which Chisinau has repeatedly condemned, andapplied to join the EU. Sandu has accused Russia of seeking to sabotage its European integration by fuelling anti-government protests and propaganda. Moscow denies meddling in Moldova’s affairs. “Moldova does not want to be blackmailed by the Kremlin,” Sandu said at the rally that packed a central square. Police said more than 75,000 demonstrators were present. “We don’t want to be on the outskirts of Europe anymore,” she said. On a visit to Chisinau, European Parliament President Roberta Metsola also addressed the rally, saying Europe would welcome Moldova “with open arms and open hearts”. “This is about the both of us: You will bring a piece of Moldova to Europe, and you will make Europe stronger,” she said. Demonstrators called on Moldova’s political leaders to amend the constitution to specifically mention the country’s European orientation. The leader of the pro-Russian opposition Shor Party, exiled businessman Ilan Shor, told his supporters at rival protests in several cities via video link that he would seek a referendum on Moldova’s foreign policy. Shor, sanctioned by the United States as an agent of Russian influence in Moldova, was handed a 15-year jail sentence in absentia last month for his role in the 2014 theft of $1bn from Moldovan banks.

Russians ‘destroyed everything’ in Bakhmut: Ukraine’s Zelenskyy,His spokesman denied earlier reports attributed to the Ukrainian president that the besieged city was captured by the Russian forces.,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said the city of Bakhmut has been “completely destroyed” by Moscow’s Wagner private army, backed by Russian troops, after a bloody eight-month battle. “They destroyed everything,” Zelenskyy said on Sunday, speaking at the G7 summit in the Japanese city of Hiroshima. “For today, Bakhmut is only in our hearts,” he said. “There is nothing in this place.”  However, his spokesman earlier on Sunday denied reports attributed to the Ukrainian president that the besieged eastern Ukrainian city was captured by the Russian forces. “Reporter’s question: Russians said they have taken Bakhmut,” Sergii Nykyforov wrote on Facebook. “President’s reply: I think no.” He added in Ukrainian: “In this way, the president denied the capture of Bakhmut.”    Russia claims to havefully captured the cityin what would mark its first major victory in more than 10 months. “As a result of offensive actions of the Wagner assault units, with the support of artillery and aviation of the ‘Southern’ unit, the liberation of the city of Artemovsk was completed,” Russia’s defence ministry said in a statement on Sunday. In a Kremlin statement, Russian President Vladimir Putin is said to have congratulated the assault units and support servicemen of units involved in the battle for the city. Wagner’s boss Yevgeny Prigozhin had posted a video earlier on the messaging app Telegram that showed Russian fighters in front of a ruined cityscape. “Today on May 20, around midday, Bakhmut was taken in its entirety,” Prigozhin said in the video, adding that Wagner fighters would search the captured city before handing it over to the Russian army. “By May 25, we will completely examine [Bakhmut], create the necessary lines of defence and hand it to the military,” Prigozhin said. “We ourselves will go into field camps.” Fighting was audible in the background as he spoke.

"Putin congratulates Russia troops, Wagner for ‘capturing Bakhmut’",Russian claims of capturing Bakhmut came hours after Ukraine said the battle for the eastern city was continuing.,"Russia has claimed to have fully captured Ukraine’s Bakhmut, with President Vladimir Putin congratulating his troops and the mercenary Wagner Group for taking the largely levelled eastern city. The Russian announcement on Saturday came hours after Kyiv said the battle was still continuing whileadmitting the situation was “critical”. Bakhmut, a salt-mining town that once had a population of 70,000 people, has been the scene ofthe longest and bloodiest battlein Russia’s 15-month war in Ukraine. The fall of Bakhmut, where both Russia and Ukraine are believed to have suffered huge losses, would represent Moscow’s first big victory in the conflict in more than 10 months. “As a result of offensive actions of the Wagner assault units, with the support of artillery and aviation of the ‘Southern’ unit, the liberation of the city of Artemovsk was completed,” Russia’s defence ministry said in a statement, using the Soviet-era name of Bakhmut. “Vladimir Putin congratulated the assault units of Wagner as well as all servicemen of units of the Russian armed forces who provided them with the necessary support and flank cover, on the completion of the operation to liberate” the city, the TASS state news agency quoted a Kremlin statement as saying. The Russian president said those who had distinguished themselves would be given awards, the news agency added.    Wagner’s boss Yevgeny Prigozhin earlier claimed the city had fallen to his mercenaries in a video posted on Telegram, in which fighters held Russian flags against a backdrop of ruins. “Today on May 20, around midday, Bakhmut was taken in its entirety,” Prigozhin said in the video, adding that Wagner fighters would search the captured city before handing it over to the Russian army. “By May 25 we will completely examine [Bakhmut], create the necessary lines of defence and hand it to the military,” Prigozhin said. “We ourselves will go into field camps.” Artillery sound could be heard in the background of Prigozhin’s video. The claims came after a week in which Ukrainian forces have made their most rapid gains for six months on Bakhmut’s northern and southern flanks. Kyiv had denied Prigozhin’s claim earlier on Saturday but did not have an immediate response to the defence ministry’s statement. “Heavy fighting in Bakhmut. The situation is critical,” deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar posted on Telegram. She said Ukrainian troops were “holding the defence” in the city’s “Airplane area”. “As of now, our defenders control certain industrial and infrastructure facilities in the area,” she said. It was not possible for Al Jazeera to verify either claim. Whether the Ukrainian forces have left Bakhmut or not, they have been slowly pulling back inside it, to clusters of buildings on the city’s western edge. Meanwhile, to the north and south, they have seized swathes of territory from Russian troops. Russia has acknowledged losing some ground around Bakhmut in the past week, while denying assertions by Prigozhin that the flanks around the city guarded by regular troops have collapsed. Kyiv says its aim in Bakhmut has been to draw Russian forces from elsewhere on the front into the city, to inflict high casualties there and weaken Moscow’s defensive line elsewhere ahead of a planned major counteroffensive. Moscow has long claimed that capturing Bakhmut would be a stepping stone towards advancing deeper into the Donbas region it claims to have annexed from Ukraine. It has made it the principal target of a massive offensive that failed to capture any significant ground elsewhere. Prigozhin has acknowledged that Bakhmut has little strategic significance, despite its huge symbolic importance because of the scale of losses in Europe’s bloodiest ground battle since World War II.    The battle for Bakhmut has meanwhile revealed a deepening split between Wagner, a mercenary force that has recruited thousands of convicts from Russian prisons, and the regular Russian military. For two weeks, Prigozhin has been issuing daily video and audio messages denouncing Russia’s military leadership, often in expletive-laden rants. In Saturday’s video, he said that because of the “whims” of Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of Staff Valery Gerasimov, “five times more guys died than they should have”. He thanked Putin “that he gave us this chance and great honour to defend our motherland”. Russia’s announcement that the city had fallen came as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was set to meet with his American counterpart, Joe Biden, in Japan during the G7 summit. Biden, who has spearheaded Western backing of Ukraine with sanctions and supplies, “looks forward” to the meeting, a senior official in the United States said, adding that it is expected to take place after 2:00pm local time (0500 GMT) on Sunday. The Ukrainian president, who was flown in on a French government plane, was able to meet not just G7 leaders but those fromother key international playerssuch as unaligned powers Brazil and India. The fruits of his diplomatic efforts have already paid off, with the US announcing Friday that it would allow Kyiv to acquireF-16 fighter jets, the most sophisticated material yet supplied by the West. En route to Japan, Zelenskyy also stopped at anArab League summit in Saudi Arabia. The Vatican said on Saturday that Pope Francis had asked Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, head of the Italian bishops’ conference, to carry out a peace mission to try to help end the war.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/21/putin-congratulates-russia-troops-wagner-for-capturing-bakhmut

Kyiv says Bakhmut situation ‘critical’ as Wagner claims control,"Ukraine rejects claim, says heavy fighting continues in the city and describes the situation there as ‘critical’.","The head of the Russian private army Wagner has said his fighters have completed thecapture of Bakhmutin eastern Ukraine, but Kyiv immediately rejected the claim and said fighting was still going on. Yevgeny Prigozhin made the claim in a video on Saturday in which he appeared in combat fatigues in front of a line of fighters holding Russian flags and Wagner banners. “Today, at 12 noon, Bakhmut was completely taken,” Prigozhin said. “We completely took the whole city, from house to house. “The operation to capture Bakhmut – the Bakhmut meat grinder – lasted 224 days,” he said. But Ukraine said it retained some ground control in the eastern city of Bakhmut, with fighting continuing and the situation “critical”. “Heavy fighting in Bakhmut. The situation is critical,” Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar posted on Telegram. She said Ukrainian troops were “holding the defence” in the city’s “Airplane area”. “As of now, our defenders control certain industrial and infrastructure facilities in the area.”  Ukrainian military spokesperson Serhii Cherevatyi told the Reuters news agency: “Our units are fighting in Bakhmut.” Al Jazeera was not able to verify the claims. Journalist Yulia Shapovalova, reporting from Moscow, told Al Jazeera that this isn’t the first time Prigozhin has made a statement like this. “Earlier he repeatedly reported about the capture of Bakhmut but every time it turned out to be wrong. The Russian authorities have not commented on his statements,” she said. “Earlier the Russian defence ministry official representative said that they… continue operations to liberate the western part of this city. “A big question now – who’s going to hold the city if the Ukrainian forces are not withdrawing and according to Prigozhin, the city will be handed over the Ministry of Defence?” Bakhmut has been the focus of the longest and bloodiest battle of Russia’s war in Ukraine, which is nearly at the end of its 15th month. The battle has flattened the salt-mining centre that once had a population of approximately 70,000 people. Distant explosions could be heard in the background as Prigozhin spoke during the video, in which he said his forces would withdraw from Bakhmut from May 25 for rest and retraining, handing over control to the regular Russian army. Prigozhin taunted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and US President Joe Biden, who weretaking part in a G7 summit in Japanon Saturday where the Ukraine war was front of mind for world leaders. Addressing Zelenskyy, Prigozhin said, “Today, when you see Biden, kiss him on the top of his head, say hi to him from me.”    Al Jazeera’s Natacha Butler, reporting from Kyiv, said the timing of Prigozhin’s announcement is “significant” as his comments are “perhaps aimed to try and embarrass the Ukrainian president. “Let’s not forget that Russia used to be part of the G7 – then the G8 – before it was kicked out in 2014 after illegally annexing Crimea,” Butler said. “Here, Moscow is looking at these images of Zelenskyy talking to the world’s wealthiest nations, this elite club it was once part of … but also talking over the past few days and on the sidelines of this G7, with some of Russia’s allies. “Zelenskyy had meetings with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, but also with Narendra Modi of India, so no doubt, all of those optics are infuriating for Moscow.” In his video message, Prigozhin also repeated complaints he has frequently made in the past that his forces suffered far heavier losses than necessary because of inadequate support and ammunition supplies from Russia’s regular army. Earlier this month he hadthreatened to pull his forces outafter publishing a furious tirade against Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu while standing in a field of bloodied corpses. Because of Russian bureaucracy and the “whims” of Shoigu and Chief of Staff Valery Gerasimov, “five times more guys died than they should have”, he said in Saturday’s video. “One day in history, they will pay for their actions,” Prigozhin said. His victory claim followed fierce fighting around the city in the past week in which Ukraine said itpushed back some Russian forces. British defence intelligence said on Saturday it was “highly likely” that Russia had deployed up to several battalions to reinforce the Bakhmut sector, following Ukrainian tactical gains on the flanks of the town. It said this represented a “notable commitment by the Russian command”. “Russia’s leadership likely continue to see capturing Bakhmut as the key immediate war aim which would allow them to claim some degree of success in the conflict,” it said on Twitter. Prigozhin has acknowledged that Bakhmut had no strategic significance, but it took on huge symbolic importance for both sides because of the sheer intensity of the fighting and the scale of losses.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/20/russias-prigozhin-claims-complete-capture-of-bakhmut
Zelenskyy goes on diplomatic blitz to tighten screws on Russia,Ukraine leader’s visit to Hiroshima thrust the G7’s efforts to choke Russia’s economy to the top of a busy agenda.,"Hiroshima, Japan –Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has embarked on a flurry of diplomacywith international leaders in Japan, turning the focus of theGroup of Seven summitfirmly towards efforts to end Russia’s 15-month war in Ukraine. Zelenskyy’s surprise visit to Hiroshima on Saturday evening, following earlier reports that he would only attend online, immediately thrust theG7‘s efforts to choke Russia’s economy to the top of a busy agenda that has touched on issues ranging from China’s rise to the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence. Shortly after touching down in Japan in a French aircraft, fresh on the heels of whistlestop visits to Europe andSaudi Arabia, Zelenskyy said the summit would be an opportunity for “enhanced cooperation for our victory”. “Peace will become closer today,” he said on his official Twitter account. French President Emmanuel Macron late on Saturday hailed Zelenskyy’s attendance at the summit as a potential “game changer”. Within hours of his arrival in Hiroshima, Zelenskyy, who is seeking tougher sanctions against Russia and further aid and weapons for Ukraine, held bilateral talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, United Kingdom Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italy’s Giorgia Meloni and Macron. The Ukrainian leader’s talks with Modi held particular significance as the Indian leader is among a number of non-G7 leaders attending the summit that have been hesitant to join the pressure campaign against Moscow. Modi has not directly condemned Russia’s invasion and his country has ramped up imports of Russian oil, coal and gas since the outbreak of the war in February 2022, helping blunt the impact of sanctions on Russia’s economy, whichcontracted by a less-than-expected 2.1 percent last year. While the meeting between Zelenskyy and Modi did not seem to produce an immediate shift in New Delhi’s stance, the talks appeared to be cordial and productive. Zelenskyy thanked Modi for “supporting our country’s territorial integrity and sovereignty”, while his Indian counterpart pledged to do “whatever we can” to resolve the crisis in Ukraine. Still, Zelenskyy may struggle to convince Global South leaders such as Modi and Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who has said there is now “no use” assigning blame for the conflict, to take a more forceful stance against Moscow. “India’s stance on the war in Ukraine is backed by popular sentiment in India,” Archana Upadhyay, a professor at the Centre for Russian and Central Asian Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, told Al Jazeera. “The Western narratives have few takers here.”    Upadhyay said that while bringing all stakeholders to the negotiating table should be everybody’s responsibility, it did not follow that Russia “has been shunned or is likely to be shunned”. “The reasons for the war are much more complex than what the West is willing to acknowledge,” she said. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, the host of the G7 this year, has expanded the gathering’s guest list as he seeks the support of developing and middle-power countries to tackle global challenges, including the conflict in Ukraine. Kishida has adopted by far the region’s strongest stance against Russia, casting the conflict as a violation of the international rules-based order that upholds the peace and security of all countries, including his own. The Japanese leader, who is leading Tokyo to undertake its biggest military buildup since World World II, has repeatedly linked the plight of Ukraine to the fate of Taiwan, which China claims the right to “reunify” with the Chinese mainland, including by force if necessary. While the G7 is still influential, its share of the global economy has declined from about 70 percent during the 1980s to 44 percent today – meaning its ability to tighten the screws on Russia is limited without buy-in from the wider international community. On Sunday, the final day of the summit, Zelenskyy is scheduled to join G7 leaders and invited non-members, including India, Indonesia and Brazil, for talks on peace and global stability. Zelenskyy is also expected to hold more bilateral talks with world leaders,including US President Joe Bidenand Kishida.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/20/zelenskyy-goes-on-diplomatic-blitz-to-tighten-screws-on-russia
Russia: Giving F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine a ‘colossal risk’,"Western countries ‘are still adhering to the escalation scenario’ that risks widening the Ukraine war in Europe, says deputy foreign minister.","Western countries will be running “colossal risks” if they supply Ukraine with F-16 fighter jets, a Russian official says. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko was responding to a question on Saturday about the implications of providing the jets, which Ukraine has been requesting from NATO countries, the TASS news agency reported. Ukraine has not yet won commitments to deliver the planes, but US President Joe Bidentold G7 leaders on Fridaythat Washington supports joint allied training programmes for Ukrainian pilots on F-16s, senior United States officials said. “We see that Western countries are still adhering to the escalation scenario. It involves colossal risks for themselves,” Grushko was quoted as saying. “In any case, this will be taken into account in all our plans, and we have all the necessary means to achieve the goals we have set.” Alexandre Vautravers, editor-in-chief of the Swiss Military Review, said despite Russia’s warning Moscow was unlikely to escalate the situation. “Every time a new weapon system has been given to Ukraine, we have heard a lot of rhetoric – but very little in the way of action from Russia,” he told Al Jazeera from Geneva. “I think the rhetoric today is not a sufficient deterrence.” Vautravers added Kyiv is also facing important technical issues that needed to be addressed for the F-16 fighters. “It is rapidly running out of air defence missiles, and it is necessary to plug in the holes of Ukraine’s air defence with these aircraft,” he said.  Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has for months called for the supply of advanced fighter jets tosupport Ukraine’s defences against Russia’sinvasion. But the Ukrainian leader had faced rejection until now from his Western allies who feared providing Ukraine with advanced offensive weapons could be met with an escalation by Russian President Vladimir Putin and the spread of the war in Europe. Zelenskyy on Saturday thanked British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak at the G7 summit in Japan for hissupport in forming a coalition to deliver Western fighter jets. “It is necessary to improve [Ukraine’s] air defence capabilities, including the training of our pilots,” Zelenskyy wrote on his official Telegram channel. The green light on F-16 training is the latest shift by the Biden administration as it moves to arm Ukraine with more advanced and lethal weaponry, following earlier decisions to send rocket launcher systems and Abrams tanks. The United States has insisted it is sending weapons to Ukraine to defend itself and has discouraged attacks by Ukraine into Russian territory. Biden’s decisions on when, how many, and who will provide the fourth-generation F-16 fighter jets will be made in the months ahead while pilot training is under way, he said.

ICC war crimes prosecutor ‘wanted’ in Russia over Putin warrant,International Criminal Court member states ‘deeply concerned’ by Russian decision to put Karim Khan on a wanted list.,"Moscow has issued an arrest warrant for the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor who in Marchprepared a warrantfor the arrest of Russia’s President Vladimir Putin on war crimes charges, Russian media reported on Friday. Karim Khan, the prosecutor at the Hague-based war crimes court, was added to the Interior Ministry’s wanted list, Russia’s state-owned TASS news agency reported on Friday, citing the ministry’s database. A picture of the ICC prosecutor, who is a citizen of the United Kingdom, could be seen in the Russian interior ministry’s database on Friday,according to news reports. Russia’s Investigative Committee, which handles major crimes, said in March thatKhan was being probedfor the “criminal prosecution of a person known to be innocent” – in reference to the war crime charges against Putin. The ICC prosecutor was also being investigated for allegedly preparing “an attack on a representative of a foreign state enjoying international protection”, Russian investigators said at the time. The ICC member states on Saturday said they were “deeply concerned” by Russia’s decision. The Presidency of the Assembly of States Parties to the ICC, the court’s management oversight body, said in a statement it “regrets these acts of intimidation and unacceptable attempts to undermine the mandate of the International Criminal Court to investigate, sanction and prevent the commission of the gravest international crimes.” In a separate statement, the court said the measures were “unacceptable” and that it “will remain undeterred in the conduct of its lawful mandate to ensure accountability for the gravest crimes of concern to the international community as a whole.” The wanted notice described Khan as a man born on March 30, 1970 in Edinburgh, Scotland but did not specify his alleged offence. Russia opened the criminal probe into Khan after the ICC announced anarrest warranthad been issued for Putin over accusations he had committed war crimes by unlawfully deporting thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia.     Announcing the arrest warrants in March, the ICC said there were “reasonable grounds to believe that Mr Putin bears individual criminal responsibility” for the abductions of Ukrainian children, and “for having committed the acts directly, jointly with others and/or through others (and) for his failure to exercise control properly over civilian and military subordinates who committed the acts”. The ICC was later forced to issue astatementof concern after former Russian President Dmitry Medvedevthreatened to hitthe war crimes court in The Hague with hypersonic missiles. Earlier this month, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called the ICC “a puppet in the hands of the so-called collective West”, the Moscow Times reported. Russia, which is not a member of the ICC, has said the warrant is “void”. The international court also issued an arrest warrant against Maria Lvova-Belova, Russia’s presidential commissioner for children’s rights. Kyiv says more than 19,000 Ukrainian children have been deported to Russia since the beginning of Moscow’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, with more than 4,000 believed to be orphans. Many are allegedly placed in institutions and foster homes. Rights groups and the top US justice envoy on Saturday criticised a meeting between Virginia Gamba, the special representative of the UN secretary-general for children, and Lvova-Belova. Russia’s ombudsman for children’s rights said on her website on Friday that she held a working meeting with the top UN official. “The conversation turned out to be constructive and sincere – without politics,” she said. “After all, we are united by a sense of personal responsibility for the life and safety of children.” Balkees Jarrah, associate director in the International Justice Program at Human Rights Watch, said “Ukrainian victims deserve to see Lvova-Belova behind bars in The Hague, not meeting with high-level UN officials.” US Ambassador for Global Justice Beth van Schaack said on social media Friday night that such a meeting would be “deeply concerning.”   ",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/20/icc-war-crimes-prosecutor-wanted-in-russia-over-putin-warrant
"Zelenskyy attendance at G7 confirmed, set to meet Japan’s Kishida",Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will hold a bilateral meeting with Japanese PM Fumio Kishida at the G7 summit in Hiroshima.,"Hiroshima, Japan –Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will hold a bilateral meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida during his attendance at theGroup of Seven summit, Japan’s foreign ministry has announced. Zelenskyy will also join a meeting on peace and security with the G7 leaders and other country representatives during the summit in Hiroshima, Japan’s foreign ministry said on Saturday. The Ukrainian leader is expected to arrive in Hiroshima on Saturday after wrapping up a surprise visit to an Arab League summit in Saudi Arabia, where he called on Middle Eastern leaders to “help protect our people, including [the] Ukrainian Muslim community”. Earlier in the week, Zelenskyy conducted a whistle-stop trip to Italy, the Vatican, Germany, France and the United Kingdom, where political leaders pledged to help restock Ukraine’s depleted supplies of missiles, tanks and drones.    Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council, confirmed reports on Friday that Zelenskyy would attend the G7 summit in person after early indications the Ukrainian leader would only attend the gathering online. Zelenskyy’s trip to Japan will be his first visit to Asia since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Kishida, the host of the G7, has taken by far the strongest stand against Russia’s war in Ukraine among Asian leaders, imposing sanctions on hundreds of Russian entities and pledging billions of dollars in aid to Kyiv. Kishida is implementing Japan’sbiggest military buildupsince World War II and has repeatedly linked Ukraine’s plight to the fate of Taiwan, which China has threatened to “reunify” with the Chinese mainland by force if necessary. In March, Kishida visited Ukraine where Zelenskyy described the Japanese leader as a “powerful defender of the international order” and “a longtime friend of Ukraine”. Nick Bisley, a professor of international relations at La Trobe University in Melbourne, told Al Jazeera that Zelenskyy’s attendance would be a “big boost” for the summit and help to “mobilise a unity ticket on Russia”.     In Hiroshima, Zelenskyy is expected to rally the member nations of the G7 – Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the UK and the United States – to ramp up pressure on Moscow to end the war and increase their support for Ukraine. Zelenskyy is also expected to hold bilateral talks with G7 leaders, including US President Joe Biden. On Friday, the G7 leaders pledged to tighten sanctions on Russia further to degrade its ability to continue its “illegal aggression” against Ukraine. The club of rich economies is expected to unveil a range of coordinated measures targeting the Russian economy, although there are divisions among members about how far punitive measures should go. The US and the UK on Friday announced new unilateral sanctions, including a ban by London on imports of Russian diamonds.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/20/zelenskyy-attendance-at-g7-confirmed-set-to-meet-japans-kishida
Zelenskyy hails Biden’s decision on F-16 jet training for Ukraine,"Training Ukrainian pilots to fly US-made F-16 fighter jets will ‘greatly enhance our army in the sky’, President Zelenskyy said.","Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has welcomed United States President Joe Biden’s decision to support the training of Ukrainian pilots onUS-made F-16 fighter jets, saying it would “greatly enhance our army in the sky”. Describing the plans to train Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 jet fighters as a “historic decision”, Zelenskyy said he would discuss the details with Biden when they meet at the G7 Summit in Japan’s Hiroshima city – the latest international trip by the Ukrainian leader, which was confirmed on Saturday. “I count on discussing the practical implementation of this decision at the #G7 summit in Hiroshima,”Zelenskyy said in a tweet. Biden told G7 leaders on Friday that Washington supports joint allied training programmes for  Ukrainian pilots on US-made F-16 fighter jets, senior US officials told the Reuters news agency. I welcome the historic decision of the United States and@POTUSto support an international fighter jet coalition. This will greatly enhance our army in the sky. I count on discussing the practical implementation of this decision at the#G7summit in Hiroshima. — Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa)May 19, 2023   Zelenskyy has for months called for the supply of advanced fighter jets tosupport Ukraine’s defences against Russia’sinvasion. But the Ukrainian leader had faced rejection until now from his Western allies who feared providing Ukraine with advanced offensive weapons could be met with an escalation by Russian President Vladimir Putin and the spread of the war in Europe. Now, as Ukraine has improved its air defences with a host of Western-supplied anti-aircraft systems and prepares to launch a counteroffensive against Russian forces, officials believe the fighter jets could become useful in Ukraine’s battle with Moscow and essential for the country’s long-term security. Poland and Slovakia have handed over 27 older MiG-29s to Ukraine. Al Jazeera’s John Psaropoulosreports that air defence experts say US-built F-16 fighter jets wouldoffer Ukraine an edgeover the Russian air force but only if combined with powerful missiles and targeting information, which the West would also have to provide.  The United Kingdom’s Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said his country would work with the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark “to get Ukraine the combat air capability it needs”. Denmark also said it would help train Ukrainians to pilot F-16s, the country’s defence minister said after Washington announced it would back such an initiative. Denmark’s acting Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen said his country “will now be able to move forward for a collective contribution to train Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16s”. Denmark will make a priority of working with its allies to support the scheme, he said, hailing Biden’s decision to approve the plan. Lund Poulsen did not say if Denmark would be among those countries delivering the fighter jets to Ukraine. Denmark’s air force has some 40 F-16s, approximately 30 of which are operational. It recently began taking delivery of the more advanced F-35 fighters. Ukraine, which does not possess any Western-designed jets, says the F-16s are far more effective than the Soviet-era fighters it currently deploys.    Training on the fighters will take place in Europe and will require months to complete, US officials told the Reuters news agency. The US officials estimated the most expeditious timeframe needed for training and delivery of F-16s at approximately 18 months. Biden’s green-lighting of F-16 training is the latest shift by the US administration as it moves to arm Ukraine with more advanced and lethal weaponry, following earlier decisions to send HIMAR rocket launcher systems, Patriots air defence systems and Abrams tanks. The US has insisted it is sending weapons to Ukraine to defend itself and has discouraged attacks by Ukraine into Russian territory. The G7 leaders also used the first day of their summit on Friday to roll out a new wave of globalsanctions on Moscowas well as plans to enhance the effectiveness of existing financial penalties meant to constrain Putin’s war effort. “Our support for Ukraine will not waver,” the G7 leaders said in a statement released after closed-door meetings. They promised “to stand together against Russia’s illegal, unjustifiable and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine”. “Russia started this war and can end this war,” they said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/20/zelenskky-hails-bidens-decision-on-f-16-jet-training-for-ukraine

G7 tightens sanctions over Russia’s war on Ukraine,"On first day of G7 summit in Japan, US and partners announce new penalties aimed at punishing Russia.","Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) countries have pledged to tighten sanctions aimed at punishing Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, intensifying what is already one of the harshest sanctions efforts ever implemented. The move came on the first day of thethree-day G7 summit in Japanand marked the latest sanctions and export controls targeting Moscow, which have hit thousands of targets and imposed steep curbs on Russia over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year. “Our support for Ukraine will not waver,” the G7 leaders said in a statement released after closed-door meetings on Friday. They pledged “to stand together against Russia’s illegal, unjustifiable and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine”. “Russia started this war and can end this war,” they said. A statement issued by G7 leaders said restrictions would cover exports of industrial machinery, tools and technology useful to Russia’s war effort, while efforts would be pursued to limit Russian revenues from trade in metals and diamonds. Separately, United States Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said a raft of new US actions “will further tighten the vice on [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s ability to wage his barbaric invasion and will advance our global efforts to cut off Russian attempts to evade sanctions.” The actions targeted Russia’s sanctions evasion, future energy revenues and military-industrial supply chains, with sanctions imposed on more than 300 targets on Friday. The Treasury said it imposed sanctions on 22 people and 104 entities with touchpoints in more than 20 countries in jurisdictions, while the Department of State targeted almost 200 people, entities, vessels and aircraft. US sanctions authorities were also expanded to more sectors of the Russian economy, including architecture, manufacturing and construction, the Treasury said, allowing any person or entity operating in those sectors to be hit with sanctions. President Joe Biden’s administration also halted the export of a wide range of consumer goods to Russia on Friday and added 71 companies to the Department of Commerce’s “Entity List”, which bars suppliers from selling them US technology without a hard-to-obtain licence. The new curbs were aimed at items that can be used to help Russia’s military, including those used in daily life like clothes dryers, snowploughs and milking machines, which the US thinks could be repurposed to support Moscow’s war machine. “You can’t even ship contact lenses or sunglasses now,” said Washington lawyer Kevin Wolf, a former Commerce official, as he reviewed the new rules. Wolf said that “it would be simpler to describe the items that are not controlled for export to Russia”.    The blacklisted companies include 69 Russian entities, one from Armenia and one from Kyrgyzstan. The targeted companies include aircraft repair and parts production plants, gunpowder, tractor and car factories, shipyards and engineering centres in Russia. The US and Europe imposed financial penalties on Russia immediately following the start of the full-scale war and have steadily ratcheted up the pressure since, targeting Russia’s President Vladimir Putin and officials close to him as well as the financial sector and oligarchs. Experts have said Washington could still impose tougher penalties. While the sanctions have clearly damaged Russia’s economy, they have not stopped Putin from pursuing a war that has killed thousands and turned cities to rubble. Biden informed G7 leaders at their summit in Japan that Washington will support a joint effort with allies to train Ukrainian pilots on F-16 fighter jets, the Associated Press news agency and CNN reported on Friday, citing sources. Ukraine is requesting the US-made jets as it seeks to press on with its biggest advance for months against invading Russian troops before a planned counteroffensive. It says the F-16s are far more effective than the Soviet-era jets it currently has. Biden told G7 leaders that decisions on when, how many and who will provide the jets, built by Lockheed Martin, will be made in the coming months while training is under way, the AP reported, citing two people familiar with the matter. The training will be conducted in Europe, the AP reported. Meanwhile, G7 leaders also called for a “world without nuclear weapons”, urging Russia, Iran, China and North Korea to cease nuclear escalation and embrace non-proliferation, a statement released by the US White House showed on Friday. Russia’s nuclear rhetoric and stated intent to deploy nuclear weapons in Belarus “are dangerous and unacceptable” and Russia should return to full implementation of the New START treaty, the leaders said in the statement.

Ukraine’s Zelenskyy seeks Arab League support on Saudi visit,President Zelenskyy calls on the Arab League to help protect ‘our people’ and the Ukrainian Muslim community amid Russia’s war on Ukraine.,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has attended an Arab League summit in Saudi Arabia to seek support for his country in the face of Russia’s invasion, as Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman expressed his readiness to mediate in the war between Moscow and Kyiv. Speaking at the event on Friday, Zelenskyy, in his trademark green military-inspired outfit, told the audience that he hoped “most of us are here for the sake of peace and justice”. “We do not have missiles as our enemy has. We have less air power; we do not possess numerous killer drones that Iran supplies to Russia. We do not have that much artillery, but we do stay strong because we do have truth on our side,” he said. Zelenskyy then added that he wanted to leave “a noble call to all of you to help protect our people, including [the] Ukrainian Muslim community”. Mustafa Dzhemilev, the leader of the Crimean Tatar community, a Turkic group of Sunni Muslims indigenous to the Crimean Peninsula, was also in attendance.

KSA plays a… — Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa)May 19, 2023  The Ukrainian president has visited a number of countries since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country on February 24, 2022. However, his visits have been largely confined to staunch allies, including several European Union states, the United Kingdom and the United States. He will also travel to Japan over the weekend to attend the G7 meeting. His visit to Saudi Arabia marks a clear deviation from this strategy as Ukraine looks to drum up support among countries that have resisted public condemnation of Russia’s actions. Arab states have remained largely neutral over Russia’s war on Ukraine, with many maintaining close ties to Moscow. It was something that Zelenskyy appeared to briefly address when he said there were some among the audience who chose to “turn a blind eye” to Russia’s actions. He added that he was in Jeddah “so that everyone can take an honest look no matter how hard the Russians tried to influence”. Saudi Arabia has maintained good relations with Russia, and the two countries have co-operated on oil production cuts through OPEC+, the Saudi-led oil producers’ alliance. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman renewed an offer to mediate between Ukraine and Russia, following a prisoner exchange deal brokered by Riyadh last year. “We reaffirm the kingdom’s readiness to continue mediating efforts between Russia and Ukraine, and to support all international efforts aimed at resolving the crisis politically in a way that contributes to achieving security,” the crown prince said in his opening speech. Zelenskyy said, “We already have a positive experience with Saudi Arabia regarding the release of our people captured by Russia.” Saudi Arabia also pledged $400m in aid to Ukraine earlier this year and has voted in favour of United Nations resolutions calling on Russia to end its invasion and refrain from annexing Ukrainian territory. The Ukrainian president also mentioned the decision in 2021 to allow visa-free travel for nationals of several Arab nations as well as the thousands of Arab students enrolled in Ukrainian universities as examples of the close ties Ukraine has with the Arab world. As the speech reached its end, Zelenskyy highlighted several of Russia’s actions, including the occupation of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant “to blackmail the world” as he encouraged the leaders to consider Ukraine’s10-point peace plan. In his concluding remarks, he asked the Arab League to “listen to the Crimean Tatar people, listen to the Muslims of Ukraine. May the almighty protect our soldiers”.

Ukraine’s Zelenskyy to attend G7 as leaders up pressure on Russia,Presence of Ukrainian president is likely to bolster G7 and NATO resolve to continue supplying weapons.,"Hiroshima, Japan –Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will attend the Group of Seven summit in Japan in person as the club of rich democracies seeks to ramp up pressure on Russia to end its war in Ukraine. Zelenskyy’s attendance at the G7 leaders’ summit in Hiroshima is an unexpected development after the Japanese government earlier told local media that the Ukrainian leader would only attend Sunday’s talks via video link. Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, confirmed on national television on Friday that Zelenskyy would attend the summit. “We were sure that our president would be where Ukraine needed him, in any part of the world, to solve the issue of stability of our country,” Danilov said. “There will be very important matters decided there, so physical presence is a crucial thing to defend our interests.” Ukraine’s presidential office said it had told Japan’s Kyodo News a day earlier that Zelenskyy’s attendance had not been ruled out, but would depend on the “situation on the battlefield”. Nick Bisley, a professor of international relations at La Trobe University in Melbourne, described Zelenskyy’s confirmed attendance as a “big boost” for the summit. “Particularly in their efforts to mobilise a unity ticket on Russia,” Bisley told Al Jazeera. In Japan, G7 – the United States, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy, along with the European Union – are seeking to convey a united front as they weigh new punitive measures to punish Moscow over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which is now in its450th day. G7 leaders are expected to announce new coordinated measures targeting Russia’s economy, although there are reportedly divisions among members about how far sanctions should go. Zelenskyy has repeatedly called on the international community to increase its support for Kyiv and take stronger action to punish Moscow for its invasion of his country. Last week he made a whistle-stop tour of Berlin, Paris and London where he secured new weapons commitments. John Blaxland, a professor of international security and intelligence studies at Australian National University, said Zelenskyy’s visit to Japan was reflective of his charisma and would bolster momentum to supply further arms to Ukraine. “Zelenskyy will also be looking to meet with his South Korean and Australian counterparts – to push for additional Korean military supplies and for Australia to supply more Bushmasters and Hawkei protected mobility vehicles,” Blaxland told Al Jazeera. “He will also be eager to press for the F-16 fighter aircraft to be made available.” On Friday, a senior official with the administration of US President Joe Biden said Washington will roll out 300 new sanctions targeting 70 Russian entities and place more countries on a US blacklist. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak also announced that the UK will ban imports of Russian diamonds, copper, aluminium and nickel, and sanction 86 people and companies linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin. In a joint statement released on Friday evening, the G7 leaders said that additional sanctions would “starve Russia of G7 technology, industrial equipment and services that support its war machine” and restrict exports of goods “critical to Russia on the battlefield”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/19/ukraines-zelenskyy-to-attend-g7-in-hiroshima-to-pressure-russia
"Bakhmut battle rages as Ukraine claims advances, Russian retreat",The Institute for the Study of War says Ukrainian forces have seized the ‘tactical initiative’ and gained ground in Bakhmut counterattacks.,"The Ukrainian military and Russia’s mercenary Wagner forces have reported further Russian retreats around the city of Bakhmut, as Kyiv pressed on with itsbiggest advance in the city for monthsin advance of a long-awaited counteroffensive. Ukraine said it had repelled a day of Russian attacks in and around the ruined eastern city on Thursday and made gains of up to 1km (almost 3,300 feet) in some places. The head of the Wagner Group, which isspearheading the Russian attack on Bakhmut, said his forces had also advanced up to 400 metres (more than 1,300 feet) in parts of the city. “We’re pushing Bakhmut all the way to the end,” Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin said in an audio recording on his Telegram channel. Prigozhin has said Wagner fighters are on the cusp of pushing Ukrainian troops out of their last foothold in the built-up area on the city’s western outskirts. But he also accused Russia’s regular forces of abandoning ground north and south of the city, raising the risk of Russian troops inside being encircled. “Unfortunately, units of the Russian defence ministry have withdrawn up to 570 metres (1,880 feet) to the north of Bakhmut, exposing our flanks,” Prigozhin said in his latest voice message on Thursday.    “I am appealing to the top leadership of the Ministry of Defence – publicly – because my letters are not being read,” Prigozhin said, addressing Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov. “Please do not give up the flanks,” he said. Ukraine’s Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar, reporting on the advances in Bakhmut, said Ukrainian forces were meeting their “military objectives”. “As of now, we control the southwestern part of Bakhmut,” she said.  Russia attacked Bakhmut all day on Thursday having “significantly strengthened” its forces in the city by bringing in most of its reserves, but all “attacks were repelled”, she said. The Russian defence ministry has acknowledged some withdrawals from positions near Bakhmut over the past week butdenies Prigozhin’s assertions that flanks are crumbling, or that it has withheld ammunition from Wagner. Ukrainian forces have seized the “tactical initiative and made tactically significant gains around Bakhmut in counter-attack operations” on Thursday, the Institute for the Study of War said in its latest briefing on the conflict. “The limited nature of Wagner’s offensive operations in Bakhmut compared to the localized Ukrainian counterattacks underscores the loss of Russian initiative in the area,” the Washington, DC-based think tank said. 3/#Prigozhin’s efforts to blame the Russian military for failures around#Bakhmutare causing some ultranationalists to accuse him of using the Battle for Bakhmut to satisfy his personal ambitions.https://t.co/x4d8VUsgOm — ISW (@TheStudyofWar)May 19, 2023  Declaring victory in the blackened ruins of Bakhmut, described by both sides as a “meat grinder”, would be Moscow’s only prize for its huge winter offensive that failed elsewhere along the front. Kyiv says its tactic in Bakhmut is to draw Russian forces into the city’s urban warfare, so as to weaken Russia’s front-line defences elsewhere before Kyiv’s planned counterassault. The area around the city, once home to 70,000 people in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, has been the focus of fighting for months. Oleksander Syrskyi, commander of Ukraine’s ground forces, said in social media message this week that Wagner forces had “climbed into Bakhmut like rats into a mousetrap”. “The enemy has more resources, but we are destroying his plans,” he said.    On Thursday night, Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy praised his troops and the country’s air defences amid days of complex missile and drone attacks on Kyiv and other cities, which have been largely repelled resulting in the downing of the incoming Russian missiles. “First of all, the defence brigades did a good job, they fulfilled the main strategic tasks, but now is not the time to give details,” Zelenskyy said in his nightly address. “Secondly, the offensive brigades are doing a good job, we are preparing,” he said, adding that no details could be given. “Thirdly, on the protection of civilians, the Air Force is doing a great job … Our priorities for this week, next week, and for the near future are additional air defence systems, additional missiles, training and aircraft, and long-range weapons. And this will be fulfilled.” Secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council Oleksiy Danilov said Russia’s repeated missile attacks on Kyiv –there have been nine so far this month– was a sign of Moscow’s desperation.

Pentagon error said to overvalue Ukraine arms aid by $3bn,Accounting error could mean more funds are available for Ukraine military aid as a counteroffensive against Russian forces nears.,"The US Department of Defense overestimated the value ofweapons and other military equipment provided to Ukraineby approximately $3bn, officials said, an error in accounting that may lead the way for more arms being sent to Kyiv. In many of the military aid packages sent to Ukraine, the defence department opted to draw from existing US stockpiles of older, existing items because it should ship them more quickly, officials said. The accounting error was the result of assigning a higher than warranted value on older weaponry that was taken from those existing stocks. “During our regular oversight process of presidential drawdown packages, the Department discovered inconsistencies in equipment valuation for Ukraine. In some cases, ‘replacement cost’ rather than ‘net book value’ was used, therefore overestimating the value of the equipment drawn down from US stocks,” Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said on Thursday. A defence official told the Associated Press that the Pentagon is still trying to determine exactly how much the total value of the surplus will be. The Reuters news agency cited a US defence official who said the amount of overvalued weaponry could possibly grow beyond $3bn as the Pentagon examines the situation more thoroughly.    The result may mean that the defence department will have more available funds to send to Ukraine as amuch-anticipated offensive against Russian forces nears. Addressing the cost anomalies, a senior defence official explained to Reuters that in the case of 155mm ammunition for Howitzer artillery, of which more than 1.5 million shells have been sent to Ukraine, each cost about $800 at current prices. But the actual cost of each of the shells, which have been delivered to US military stockpiles each year over several decades, should be averaged out for a much lower price. To date, the US has provided Ukraine with nearly $37bn in military aid since Russia invaded in February 2022. The bulk of that has been in weapons systems, millions of munitions and ammunition rounds, and an array of trucks, sensors, radars and other equipment pulled from Pentagon stockpiles and sent quickly to Ukraine.    “The Department of Defense’s change in evaluating the costs of arms sent to Ukraine is a major mistake,” said US Senator Roger Wicker, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee. “Our priority should be a Ukrainian victory over Putin. Unilaterally altering military aid calculations is an attempt at deception and undermines this goal,” he said. Singh, the Pentagon spokeswoman, said the accounting error had not constrained US support to Ukraine or hampered the ability to send aid to the battlefield.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/19/us-defence-dept-error-said-to-overvalue-ukraine-arms-aid-by-3bn
"G7 Hiroshima summit: Who’s attending, what will be discussed?",Leaders of seven of the most powerful democracies will gather this weekend for the Group of Seven summit in Hiroshima,"Leaders of the Group of Seven are meeting in the southern Japanese city of Hiroshima for their annual summit from May 19-21. They are expected to discuss not only economics, but politics, and Russia’s February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. China, which has become increasingly assertive in its claims in the disputed South China Sea and over self-ruled Taiwan, is also likely to be an issue along with North Korea’s weapons testing. Here’s a look at the G7 and what to expect: The G7 is an informal group of leading industrialised democracies with no permanent secretariat or legal status. It consists of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. The group was founded – as the G6 – following the 1973 oil crisis as a forum for the richest nations to discuss global economic issues. Its countries have a combined annual gross domestic product (GDP) of $40 trillion – making up just under half the world economy. The founding members held their first summit in 1975 in France to discuss how to tackle the deep recession that followed the embargo imposed by the oil production cartel, OPEC. Canada became the seventh member a year later. Russia joined to form the G8 in 1998, but was expelled after Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea. The presidency of the summits revolves among the seven members, and this year it is Japan’s turn to host. In 2024, it will be Italy. Two representatives of the European Union (EU) also join, and it has become customary in recent years for leaders from some non-G7 countries and international organisations to take part in some sessions. The leaders discuss a wide range of issues, including economic policy, security, climate change, energy and gender. This year, the leaders of Australia, Brazil, Comoros (chair of the African Union), Cook Islands (chair of the Pacific Islands Forum), India (G20 president), Indonesia (chair of Association of Southeast Asian Nations), South Korea and Vietnam are invited, reflecting Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s stress on the importance of reaching out to developing countries, as well as US allies and partners. The invitations to leaders outside of the G7 are meant to extend cooperation to a broader range of countries. But the economic expansion of nations including Brazil, China and India (all members of the BRICS grouping which also includes Russia and South Africa) has raised questions about the G7′s relevance and its role in leading a world economy that is increasingly reliant on growth beyond the wealthiest nations. Leaders of the United Nations, the International Energy Agency, the International Monetary Fund, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, the World Bank, the World Health Organization and the World Trade Organization are also on the guest list.    The summit comes just days after Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyycompleted a whirlwind trip around Europe to meet a number of the G7 leaders. Zelenskyy’s tour was aimed at building political support ahead of a widely anticipatedcounteroffensiveto reclaim lands occupied by Moscow’s forces, and securing new weapons commitments. G7 leaders are expected tostrongly condemnRussia’s war on Ukraine while pledging their continuing support for Ukraine. Zelenskyy will join the session via the internet. “Support for Ukraine and sanctions against Russia will be the main topics of discussion,” Japan’s Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki told a news conference. “We will continue to closely coordinate with G7 and the international community to enhance the effect of sanctions to achieve the ultimate goal of prompting Russia to withdraw.” There will also be a focus on Beijing’s escalating threats against Taiwan, the self-governing democratic island Beijing claims as its own, and ways to reduce Western democracies’ economic and supply chain dependency on China. The seven leaders have also signalled that China’s use ofpunitive trade measureswill be high on the agenda of the three-day annual summit. China’s use of coercive economic moves has been an issue of growing concern in the Asia Pacific and Europe in recent years, with Japan, South Korea,AustraliaandLithuaniaall facing trade restrictions following disputes with Beijing on issues ranging from the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic to Taiwan. For developing nations, including many former colonies of Western powers with varied views on and ties to Russia and China, the G7 is set to offer more support in health, food security and infrastructure to help underpin closer ties. Developed countries promised in 2009 to transfer $100bn annually between 2020 and 2025 to vulnerable states hit by increasingly severe climate-linked impacts and disasters –but that target was never met. Rich G7 nations owe poor ones an estimated $13 trillion in unpaid development aid as well as support in the fight against climate change, according to the British NGO Oxfam. Not originally on the agenda, the rapid growth of generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot ChatGPT means G7 leaders can no longer ignore the issues it raises. In April, Kishida met the CEO of OpenAI, which developed the ChatGPT service, and EU legislators have urged G7 leaders to find ways to control its development. G7 digital ministers agreed in April they should adopt “risk-based” regulation on AI.    Hiroshima is Kishida’s hometown, and known throughout the world as the first city to be hit by a nuclear weapon. The 1945 bombing helped end World War II, butdevastated Hiroshima and Nagasaki,killing thousands of civilians. Kishida’s choice of venue reflects hisdeterminationto put nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation at the top of the summit’s agenda. A path to nuclear disarmament has appeared more difficult with Russia’s recent nuclear weapons threats in Ukraine, as well as North Korea’s repeated ballistic missile tests and Iran’s expansion of its nuclear programme. “I can’t say that the G7 will resolve these non-proliferation crises, but without a coherent position from the G7 we have no chance,” a senior G7 diplomat told the Reuters news agency. Kishida on Friday will welcome arriving leaders at the Hiroshima Peace Park, the city’s commercial and political heart at the time the bomb was dropped. He also plans to escort the leaders to the A-bomb museum, in the first group visit involving the heads of some of the world’s nuclear-armed states. There might also be a meeting with atomic bomb survivors. “I believe the first step toward any nuclear disarmament effort is to provide a firsthand experience of the consequences of the atomic bombing and to firmly convey the reality,” Kishida said last Saturday during a visit to Hiroshima to observe the summit preparations. Kishida, US President Joe Biden and South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol areexpected to holda trilateral meeting on the sidelines of the Hiroshima summit to discuss North Korea, China’s assertiveness and Russia’s war on Ukraine. Kishida and Yoon will pay their respects together at a Hiroshima memorial for Korean atomic bomb victims in a trust-building gesture as the two countries repair ties strained by disputes stemming from Japan’s 1910-1945 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula. Yoon was invited to the summit as one of eight outreach nations. Protests have also taken place in the run-up to the summit,",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/18/g7-hiroshima-summit-whos-attending-what-will-be-discussed
Ukraine battles Russia in Bakhmut as Zelenskyy secures more arms,What happened in the 64th week of Russia’s war in Ukraine?,"Ukrainian forces pushed back Russian occupiers north and south of Bakhmut in the 64th week of the war, successfully pressing a counterattack they had begun on May 9. As Russian troops fell back on the flanks of the city, Wagner Group mercenaries continued to push through the eastern city itself, claiming much of the last Ukrainian foothold in its western suburbs. “Our troops liberated about 20 square kilometres [7.7sq miles] from the enemy in the north and south of the suburbs of Bakhmut. At the same time, the enemy is making some progress in Bakhmut itself, completely destroying the city with artillery,” said Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar, on May 14. Russia’s defence ministry said Ukraine had launched an assault north of Bakhmut, with more than 1,000 troops and up to 40 tanks. If confirmed, that “would amount to the biggest Ukrainian offensive since November”, said the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War. The Ukrainian commander of ground forces, Oleksandr Syrskyi, confirmed a new phase had begun, calling it “the first success of offensive operations during the operation for the defence of Bakhmut.” “However, this is only a partial success. And that is how it should be perceived,” he wrote. Eastern forces spokesman Serhii CherevatysaidUkrainian troops had on May 11 advanced “into the depth of enemy positions from 250 metres [820 feet] to one and a half kilometres [0.93 miles].” Maliar put the advance at two kilometres (1.24 miles). Geolocated footage posted on May 12 showed Russian troops fleeing Ukrainian artillery fire on the southern bank of the Berkhivske Reservoir, about four kilometres (2.5 miles) northwest of Bakhmut, while Wagner Group financier Yevgeny Priogozhin claimed that Ukrainian soldiers were within 500 metres (1,640 feet) of Bakhmut’s northwestern city limits. At the same time, Russian sources claimed that Wagner mercenaries had advanced 220 metres (722 feet) within the city. May 13 followed a similar pattern – Prigozhin claimed his fighters advanced another 500 metres within the city, reducing Ukraine’s foothold from two square kilometres (0.77sq miles) to 1.78sq km (0.69sq miles), but Russian forces lost ground around the city. Cherevaty said that during May 13-14, Ukrainian units had advanced “from 350 meters [1,148] to two kilometres”. Maliar reported that Ukrainian forces captured more than 10 Russian positions on the northern and southern outskirts of the city on May 14. Moscowacknowledged that its forces had fallen back to “regroup”, a claim Prigozhin mocked. “What [Igor] Konashenkov described, unfortunately, is called ‘a rout’ and not a regrouping,” he said, referring to the defence ministry spokesman. “The enemy has completely freed up the Chasiv Yar-Bakhmut road [T0504] which we had blocked. The enemy is now able to use this road, and secondly, they have taken tactical high round under which Bakhmut is located.” On May 15, Prigozhin said his forces had advanced another 220 metres in the city, reducing the Ukrainian foothold to 1.59sq kilometres (0.6sq miles). By May 16, Russia had begun to reinforce its flanks around Bakhmut. A prominent Russian military reporter said four battalions had redeployed there from other parts of the front, something Maliar confirmed, saying Russia had brought in elite Russian Airbourne Forces (VDV). The Ukrainian advance around Bakhmut prompted questions about whether Ukraine’s anticipated counteroffensive had begun, which was denied by Ukrainian and Western officials. Maliar said Ukraine was still conducting defensive operations, which sometimes included counterattacks. An unnamed senior US official told CNN Ukraine was still conducting “shaping operations” ahead of the counteroffensive, which needed “a bit more time”. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy offered confirmation when he told the BBC that Ukraine was still waiting for much of the matériel allies had promised. Ukraine would suffer too many casualties if it launched prematurely, he said. This was almost certainly the motive behind Zelenskyy’s whirlwind tour of European capitals during the week, in which he garnered large new promises of weapons. Germany promised its biggest batch of weapons yet on May 14, priced at 2.7 billion euros ($3bn). Ukraine’s foreign intelligence service said that “the aid package includes in particular: 18 wheeled howitzers, artillery ammunition, guided missiles for air defence systems, four IRIS-T SLM anti-aircraft missile launchers and 12 IRIS-T SLS launchers, 30 Leopard 1A5 tanks and 20 Marder infantry fighting vehicles, more than 100 combat armoured vehicles and more than 200 reconnaissance drones.” That brought the number of main battle tanks publicly promised to Ukraine to 296. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on April 17 that 230 of those tanks had already been delivered. France, one of the first Western allies to promise Ukraine armoured fighting vehicles on January 4, told Zelenskyy that it would provide dozens more. “In the coming weeks, France will train and equip several battalions with tens of armoured vehicles and light tanks including AMX-10RC,” French President Emmanuel Macron and Zelenskyy said in a joint statement. The United Kingdomsaidit would supply Ukraine with hundreds of additional air defence missiles, as well as “long-range attack drones” with a range of more than 200km (124 miles). Days earlier, the UK became the first Western ally to supply Ukraine with long-range cruise missiles, when it said it would supply theStorm Shadowwith a range of more than 250km (155 miles). UK Prime Minister RishiSunakalso said the UK would start training Ukrainian pilots. “This summer, we will commence an elementary flying phase for cohorts of Ukrainian pilots to learn basic training. This will adapt the programme used by UK pilots to provide Ukrainians with piloting skills they can apply [to] a different kind of aircraft. This training goes hand in hand with UK efforts to work with other countries on providing F16 jets – Ukraine’s fighter jets of choice.” Ukraine’s armed forces chief, Valery Zaluzhny, last week said the country was only able to continue defending its air space because it had radically reconfigured the deployment of its existing resources. Ukraine has been asking for F-16 fighter jets, which Western allies have not yet agreed to give. The UK and the Netherlands had agreed to build acoalitionto provide Ukraine with F-16 jets, Sunak’s spokesman later said. “We cannot control the sky,” said Zelenskyy after meeting with Sunak. “We want to create a fighter coalition. We talked about it. I am extremely positive. And, I think, in the near future you will hear about important decisions,” said Zelenskyy. The UK later said the decision on sending F-16s depends on the White House. Despite its air defence shortfalls, Ukraine scored two remarkable successes. On May 16, Zaluzhny said Kyiv had successfullydefeateda Russian missile barrage described by one official as “exceptional in its density – the maximum number of attack missiles in the shortest period of time”. Zaluzhnysaid Russia had launched six Kinzhal ballistic missiles, nine Kalibr cruise missiles, and three Iskander land-based cruise missiles. Cruise missiles are notoriously difficult to shoot down because they travel extremely fast on unpredictable trajectories at below-radar altitudes. By 6pm (15:00 GMT), the general staff update reported 27 destroyed cruise missiles. On May 14, Russian business newspaperKommersantreported that a Russian Sukhoi-34, Sukhoi-35 and two Mi-8 military helicopters were shot down almost simultaneously in a Ukrainian ambush in the Bryansk region of Russia adjoining Ukraine. Ukraine did not claim the attack. “According to preliminary data … the fighters were supposed to deliver a missile and bomb attack on targets in the Chernihiv region of Ukraine, and the helicopters were there to back them up – among other things to pick up the ‘Su’ crews if they were shot down,” Kommersant reported.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/18/ukraine-battles-russia-in-bakhmut-as-zelenskyy-secures-more-arms
‘Pro-Russian neutrality’: How Ukraine sees China’s emerging role,"Russia’s ally signals a desire to broker peace, but few are convinced that Beijing has either power or pure motivations in Kyiv.","Kyiv, Ukraine –Volodymyr, a gaunt 44-year-old, recently returned from the front lines of eastern Ukraine and now needs psychological help for his post-traumatic stress disorder. A contusion makes him slightly stutter. He voraciously reads news from the cracked screen of his mobile phone – and has a firm opinion about recent headlines on the role of China, the only remaining heavy-weight partner in Russia’s corner, in the war. “China prefers to stay away from this mess,” Volodymyr tells Al Jazeera, withholding his last name because he is still on active duty. “They’ll never openly support Russia.” “Openly” is a keyword. As the Russian-Ukrainian war approaches its 15th month, China still considers President Vladimir Putin an irreplaceable, “strategic” ally. Chinese President Xi Jinping has remained the only global leader to maintain amicable ties with Putin – and has used China’s seat in the United Nations Security Council to repel diplomatic attacks on the Kremlin. Xi has never denounced the war, rather calling it a “crisis”. According to Ukrainian observers, Beijing’s position is full of ambivalence and omissions. According to some, Xi sees the conflict through the prism of Taiwan, as China has long threatened to forcibly “unify” the self-governing island with the Communist mainland in ways that may be similar to how Russia “returned” Crimea. While he now appears to be trying to add a peacekeeper’s feather to his cap, observers say he could in fact be attempting to freeze the war on Russia’s terms to let it replenish its arsenals, train more servicemen and switch its economy to wartime mode. “China doesn’t need a pompous truce,” Sinologist Petro Shevchenko, of the Jilin University in the Chinese city of Changchun, told Al Jazeera. “In principle, it will make do with a freeze of some kind, when Ukraine doesn’t declare the war’s end.” Beijing has said Ukraine’s “territorial integrity” should be maintained – and in February proposed a12-point peace planthat was met with scepticism by Western powers. While it called for dialogue and denounced the possibility of a nuclear escalation, the plan also lambasted Western sanctions on Moscow and did not urge Russia to withdraw troops. To convince Kyiv, Beijing “will resort to economic statecraft, economic tools” that may include a contribution to Ukraine’s post-war restoration and better access to China’s market for Ukrainian food producers, Shevchenko said. It could be easy. In 2017, China became Ukraine’s largest trading partner. It buys wheat, corn, jet engines and steel slabs – among other things. Beijing also wants Ukraine to become a hub of the mammoth Belt and Road infrastructure project that straddles Eurasia from Pakistan to Poland – a role Kyiv rejected after the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea. But if Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy brushes off China’s peace offering, Xi may start supplying Russia with weapons, including drones and microchips, Shevchenko said. The step could be especially detrimental given that many Chinese arms are based on Soviet prototypes. Beijing may also tacitly prod North Korea and Iran towards sending arms and ammunition to Moscow, he said. But Ukraine’s former top diplomat thinks that this is something Beijing will not dare do. “China should not cross the line, otherwise it will face many problems – not just economic, but political,” Volodymyr Ohryzko, Ukraine’s former foreign minister, told Al Jazeera. Xi is not prolifically trying to push both sides towards a truce, preferring to bide his time without getting too embroiled in the conflict. “Russia plays the role of an international hoodlum shaking the world order. The US and China benefit from the process – and will create a new [world order],” Kyiv-based analyst Igar Tyshkevich told Al Jazeera. China consumes Russia’s hydrocarbons, uses its territory as a springboard to European markets and craves theArcticriches Moscow cannot tap on its own. The existing status quo, when Western sanctions isolate Russia and the collective West is deeply invested in the war, is “generally comfortable for Beijing”, says Temur Umarov, a Sinologist and expert with Carnegie Politika, a Berlin-based think tank. “In this situation, the US doesn’t have the reach to start a conflict with China, to work out what’s happening in China, to confront it, while Russia has more and more to offer to Beijing because it has no other options,” he told Al Jazeera. China would not mind repeating thediplomatic successit had in March when it mediated a rapprochement between Iran and Saudi Arabia. But that happened because both sides wanted a settlement, Umarov said. “Using the same optics in Ukraine is very hard, because neither Kyiv nor Moscow are ready for talks of any kind,” he said. Oleksandra Kurenenko, who teaches physics at a private school in Kyiv, said if China backs Russia “openly” Russia will win the war. But so far, “we are winning”, she said. Beijing casts its position as “neutral”, but many in Kyiv doubt the term. “This is a pro-Russian neutrality, as China implements the vassalisation of Russia,” Alexander Merezhko, a top foreign policy official in the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine’s lower house of parliament, told journalists in mid-May. As Moscow faces spiralling economic isolation and diplomatic ostracism, its role as a global or even regional player is going downhill – and Beijingfills the void, even in Russia’s ex-Soviet stomping ground from Central Asia to Belarus. As the West decreases its reliance on Russian energy supplies and imposes draconian sanctions, Moscow is boosting oil, gas, coal and timber exports to China – at discounted prices. Russia’s diminished, “junior” part in the alliance with China looks especially ironic given it was Soviet Russia that played a key role in installing a Communist government in Beijing in 1949. Red Moscow also laid the foundation of China’s resurgence by providing key technologies from the construction of iron smelters to the development of a nuclear bomb. Xi visited Moscow in March, but cut the trip short. He also thwarted Putin’s expectations to sign deals on massive investments and the construction of a new natural gas pipeline to China. Only a month after leaving Moscow, Xi called Zelenskyy, and the immediate outcome was minuscule. Summarising their hourlong conversation, Zelenskyy tweeted about a “powerful impetus to bilateral ties” and hailed the appointment of a seasoned diplomat as a special peace envoy to Kyiv. The diplomat, Li Hui, served as an ambassador to Russia between 2009 and 2019. He speaks fluent Russian, is on friendly terms with Putin, and even received an award from the Kremlin chief. But to Kyiv, such knowledge of Russia is a plus. “Undoubtedly, this man absolutely understands how wild Russian society is,” Zelenskyy’s adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said in late April. Li arrived in Kyiv on May 16 and met Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. “Ukraine does not accept any proposals that would involve the loss of its territories or the freezing of the conflict,” Kuleba’s office said in a statement after themeeting, which ended, as expected, without a breakthrough.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/18/how-ukraine-views-chinas-role-in-peace-settlement
G7 weighs new sanctions on Russia to end Ukraine war,"Existing sanctions are some of the toughest ever imposed on a major economy, but there is still room to increase pressure.","Hiroshima, Japan– By some accounts, sanctions against Russia have left it more isolated than at any point since the aftermath of the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, when the allies of World War I put the country under a blockade. At the Group of Seven summit taking place in Japan’s Hiroshima from Friday, the club of rich democracies are expected to tighten the screws further as they attempt to force Moscow to end its war in Ukraine. While theexisting sanctions on Russiaare some of the toughest ever imposed on a major economy, the G7 has considerable room to increase pressure – although divisions over key areas like energy and the mixed track record of sanctions generally threaten to undermine efforts to bring Moscow to heel. “There is definitely plenty of space for the G7 to impose further restrictions and tighten the existing ones,” Lukasz Rachel, a member of the International Working Group on Russian Sanctions at Stanford University, told Al Jazeera. “The most important areas include oil and energy more broadly, non-energy trade sanctions and closing loopholes in this area, and technology sanctions.” A key focus of the G7 members – the United States, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy – is expected to be enhancing the enforcement of existing sanctions, including clamping down on sanctions evasion involving third countries. On Saturday, G7 finance ministers and central bank governorspledgedin a joint statement to counter “any attempts to evade and undermine our sanction measures”. The EU, which participates in G7 events as a “non-enumerated” member, is considering penalties for companies that help Russia get around sanctions, which would bring the bloc closer into alignment with the US sanctions regime.    In an interview with the Financial Times published on Tuesday, Josep Borrell, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, said the bloc should crack down on the importation of Indian petroleum products that use Russian oil. The administration of US President Joe Biden is also pushing to strengthen controls on high-tech exports by reversing the presumption towards prohibiting everything that is not explicitly authorised. Despite predictions of economic ruin,Russia’s economy has held up better than expectedagainst the Western-led sanctions regime, shrinking only by 2.1 percent in 2022. Although Russia’s trade with G7 countries has plummeted, China, India and Turkey have picked up much of the slack through increased imports of Russian coal, oil and gas. Some research also suggests that Western shipping companies are involved in violating sanctions on Russian energy exports. In a study released by the Kyiv School of Economics last month, researchers found that 96 percent of oil shipments from the Russian port of Kozmino during the first quarter of 2023 were sold above the $60 oil price cap set by the G7 last year. “On the sanctions front, the summit will be about implementation, implementation and implementation,” Agathe Demarais, global forecasting director of the Economist Intelligence Unit, told Al Jazeera. “This follows a flurry of media reports highlighting sanctions evasion from third countries, such as Turkey, Serbia, Kazakhstan and the UAE. Instead of lowering the oil price cap, the G7 will focus on tightening the effective implementation of this measure.” But Demarais, who is also the author of Backfire: How Sanctions Reshape the World Against US Interests, said it is unclear if the G7 will be able to effectively plug the loopholes “given the scope of the problem and the creativity of the Kremlin to bypass sanctions”.    Signs of divisions among G7 members have also emerged before the three-day summit. While G7 is reportedly considering proposals to permanently shut natural gas pipelines turned off by Russia following its invasion of Ukraine, European members are said to be hesitant to back such a move. Politico on Wednesday quoted an unnamed EU diplomat saying it was “very unlikely” the measure would pass due to European members’ continuing reliance on Russian gas. More broadly, the G7 must contend with the limited success that sanctions have had so far at achieving change in Russia as well as other pariah states such asNorth Koreaand Cuba. In astate-of-the-nation addressto mark the first anniversary of the Ukraine war in February, Russian President Vladimir Putin sought to prepare his country for a long conflict that would achieve its successes “step by step”. Kristy Ironside, a historian of modern Russia and the Soviet Union at McGill University in Canada, said the historical record on the effectiveness of sanctions was “rather pessimistic”. “I tend to view them rather sceptically: they are an attempt to ‘do something’ when direct options are limited, ie when you don’t want to put boots on the ground,” Ironside told Al Jazeera. “Sanctions, or rather their mere threat work best when there is a high degree of pre-existing economic integration or desired economic cooperation, but that has been limited since 2014. Russia has been sanction-proofing the economy since this, developing domestic food chains, moving currency reserves into yuan, etc.” “The application of sanctions and the threat of more has not dissuaded Putin from continuing this war,” Ironside added, “and at this point, I think it’s safe to say they won’t.” But Rachel, the Russian sanctions group member at Stanford University, said sanctions were already affectingRussia’s military campaignand the G7 must step up efforts to support Ukraine and weaken the Russian state. “It is impossible to know precisely what impact the sanctions have had on Russia’s appetite to wage this and future wars because we do not observe the counterfactual world without sanctions,” he said. “But the direction of the impact is obvious: this war has been a disaster for Russia and the Kremlin already, and with the Western support it will sooner or later be turned to a disastrous defeat.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/18/g7-weighs-new-sanctions-on-russia-to-end-ukraine-war
"Russian cruise missile attack targets Kyiv, one killed in Odesa",Attack on Kyiv marks the ninth time this month that Russian air raids have targeted the Ukrainian capital.,"Russian missile attacks have again rocked Ukrainewith one person reported killed in the southern city of Odesa and falling debris from destroyed missiles causing fires in two districts of the capital, Kyiv. Two more people were also wounded in the Odesa attack, Ukraine’s military administration spokesman Serhii Bratchuk wrote on Telegram on Thursday. “Most of the enemy’s missiles were shot down over the sea by the Air Defence Forces. Unfortunately, an industrial object was hit: 1 person died, two were injured,” Bratchuk wrote. Ukraine’s army reported several explosionsin Kyiv’s Desnianskyi district and said a fire had broken out at a business in the city’s Darnytskyi neighbourhood as a result of falling debris from the shooting down of missiles. The military also reported “cruise missile” attacks in the central Vinnytsia region, and local media reported explosions in Khmelnytskyi, about 100km (62 miles) further west. Kyiv’s anti-aircraft defences had engaged the air attack and there were no reports of injuries, according to Serhii Popko, head of the city’s civil and military administration, who urged people to stay in bomb shelters.    “A series of air attacks on Kyiv, unprecedented in their power, intensity and variety, continues,” Popko said, noting that the attack was likely carried out by two Russian strategic bombers launching cruise missiles. All of the missiles were downed by air defences, he said, adding that a Russian surveillance drone observed the area after the attack, the Kyiv Independent media outlet reported. Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko, writing on Telegram, said one fire had broken out in a garage facility in the city’s Darnitsya region and debris had also fallen in another part of the city. He said there were no casualties from either of the incidents. The attack on Kyiv marks the ninth time this month that Russian air raids have targeted the capital, a clear escalation after weeks of a lull and ahead of a much-anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive using newly supplied advanced Western weapons. Local media cited Ukrainian Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi as reporting that of the 30 Russian sea, air, and land-based cruise missiles involved in the attack on Thursday, Ukraine’s forces had destroyed all bar one. On Tuesday, Zaluzhnyi said that Ukrainian forces had shot down all 18 Russian missiles of various types that were launched in the most complex and concentrated attack on Kyiv to date. Russia had launched six Kinzhal ballistic missiles, nine Kalibr cruise missiles, and three Iskander land-based cruise missiles, Zaluzhnyi said on Telegram. Ukraine’s Air Force also shot down six Iranian-made Shahed drones and three reconnaissance drones. US-made Patriot missile systems have proved key in helping to shield Kyiv against relentless missile attacks targeting civilians and infrastructure. One of only two Patriot systems confirmed to be in Ukrainewas damaged by an unspecified projectile landing nearby, US officials confirmed on Wednesday, though they said the missile system was easily repaired and functioning, according to the Institute for the Study of War.

"Russia-Belarus border checks return, linked to Ukraine war draft",Partial border controls between Russia and Belarus return for first time in decades.,"Belarus has partially restored controls on its border with Russia, Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Aleinik said, the first time in almost 30 years that there have been checks at the 1,239km (770 miles) frontierbetween the two staunch allies. The re-introduction of border controls was designed to avoid the entry of third-country nationals into Belarus, Aleinik said on Wednesday, ahead of an agreement on the mutual recognition of visas between Minsk and Moscow. However, human rights activists believe the return of border checks between the allies was aimed at stopping Russian men fleeing mobilisation into the Russian army to fight in Ukraine. “It’s not really control, it’s more like monitoring the situation on the border,” Aleinik told reporters in Moscow, explaining that checks on people crossing the Belarusian-Russian border will be carried out by Belarusian border guards in close cooperation with their Russian counterparts. “Overall, the situation at the Russian-Belarusian border is relatively calm and I am certain that it will remain like this at all times,” he said, according to Russia’s TASS news agency. All border controls between Russia and Belarus were removed in 1995. But checks by the Belarusian border service returned on May 5, though Belarusian authorities did not comment on this development until Wednesday.     The new visa rules come into effect as thousands of Russians have fled to Belarus to escape military mobilisation as well as persecution in Russia of those who do not support Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which was launched in February 2022. In one recent high-profile case,Russian national Alexei Moskalyov fled to Belarusahead of a Russian court sentencing him to two years in prison after his daughter drew an anti-war picture at school. Moskalyov was detained in Minsk in March and later extradited to Russia to serve his prison sentence. Moskalyov, a 54-year-old single father, fled house arrest just before the court found him guilty of “discrediting” the Russian army. His daughter, now 13, had drawn a picture showing missiles next to a Russian flag heading towards a woman and child standing by a Ukrainian flag. Her head teacher contacted the police. Moskalyov’s daughter was taken away from him and placed in a local “rehabilitation centre” for minors, with the pair denied contact. Pavel Sapelko, of the Belarusian human rights centre Viasna, said the new border controls would limit the ability of Russians who want to leave the country “to avoid mobilisation and participation in the war with Ukraine”.    Also on Wednesday, Russian Minister for Digital Development Maksut Shadayev said that a unified database of people eligible for military service should be in place in time for the autumn draft, along with the introduction of electronic summonses. Under Russia’s new rules, signed into law last month, anyone served an electronic summons to join the Russian military is banned from leaving the country before appearing at an enlistment office. Russia and Belarus are longtime allies. Russia subsidises the Belarusian economy, via loans and discounted Russian oil and gas, and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has allowed his country to be used by Moscow as a springboard to send troops and missiles into the war in Ukraine.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/18/russia-belarus-border-checks-return-linked-to-ukraine-war-draft

Ukraine tells China envoy peace plan must not lose land to Russia,Ukraine’s foreign minister told China’s envoy that Kyiv would not accept any peace proposal that involved a loss of territory to Russia or that would freeze the conflict.,"Ukraine’s foreign minister told a top Chinese envoy that Kyiv would not accept any proposals to end the war with Russia that involved Ukraine losing territory or the placing of the conflict on hold, the Ukrainian foreign ministry said. Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba made the remarks duringa meeting in Kyiv with Li Hui,who is China’s special representative for Eurasian affairs and former ambassador to Russia. Kuleba discussed with Li “ways to stop Russian aggression”, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. In his meeting, Kuleba “emphasised that Ukraine does not accept any proposals that would involve the loss of its territories or the freezing of the conflict”. Restoring a “just peace” in Ukraine depended on “respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine”, Kuleba said, according to the statement. Li was in Kyiv on Tuesday and Wednesday seeking to promote Beijing-led negotiations to resolve the conflict. China’s foreign ministry issued a statement on Thursday in which it said that Li told Ukraine that there is no quick fix to end the crisis. “There is no panacea to resolve the crisis, and all parties need to start from themselves, build mutual trust and create conditions to stop the war and talk,” Li said, according to the statement. “China has always played a constructive role in alleviating the humanitarian situation in Ukraine in its own way and will continue to provide assistance to Ukraine within its capacity,” the statement added. Li is the highest-ranking Chinese diplomat to visit Ukraine since Moscow invaded in February 2022 and his arrival in Kyiv comes three weeks after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke by telephone with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Zelenskyy also appointed a new Ukrainian ambassador to China on the same day, the Kyiv Independent media organisation reported. Officials in Kyiv had warned ahead of the Chinese visit that Ukraine did not need “mediation for the sake of mediation”. “Ending the war with a compromise at the expense of Ukraine will not work,” a senior Ukrainian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the French news agency Agence France-Presse. Beijing said the aim of the visit was to “communicate with all parties on the political settlement of the Ukrainian crisis”. Li is now expected to visit Moscow, according to the Chinese government, and also Poland, Germany and France to discuss a possible political solution to the conflict. Xi, who visited Moscow in March and has aimed toposition China as a neutralmediator, has been criticised for refusing to condemn the Kremlin’s attack on its neighbour and the now 15-month-long war. China has alsosupported Moscowpolitically.    Officials in Beijing recently ordered foreign embassies to remove so-called “propaganda” on display at diplomatic missions in what is being interpreted as an apparent reference to shows of support for Ukraine. A spokesperson for the European Union said the Protocol Department of the Chinese Foreign Ministry circulated a note on May 8 to all diplomatic missions to the effect that they should “respect Chinese laws and regulations” and “not to use the external walls of embassies to carry out politicised propaganda to avoid causing disputes between countries”. The note does not specify what might constitute “politicised propaganda”, nor communicates further on the matter, said the EU spokesperson. According to diplomats in Beijing, Ukrainianflags and placardsset up by the embassies of Canada, France, Germany and other governments are the only public displays by most foreign missions other than tourism advertisements. Countries supporting Ukraine see little current prospect for a negotiated peace, particularly owing to Russia’s insistence on achieving its war aims and the Kremlin’s demand that Kyiv acknowledge Russia’s annexation of the Crimean Peninsula and the Ukrainian provinces of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhia, which most nations have denounced as illegal.    Ukraine has rejected those demands and ruled out any talks with Russia until its troops pull back from all occupied territories. Zelenskyy’s own 10-point peace plan also includes an international tribunal to prosecute crimes of aggression, which would enable Russia to be held accountable for its invasion. Zelenskyy told reporters during his recent visit to Italy that there was little point in efforts by certain countries to attempt to “mediate between Ukraine and Russia to end the war”, what was needed was a “just peace” based on Ukraine’s formula for peace. “Russia started the war. Russia took lives. The war is on our land. We know all the crises that have happened, the challenges: nuclear, environmental, food, energy. Only we know what it is like,” Zelenskyy said in respone to questions regarding China or the Vatican’s possible role in a peace efforts. “We have not proposed an artificial plan – we have proposed how to get out of this situation, to end the war – according to the law, respecting the UN Charter, international law, people, values,” he said, according to a transcript onPresident of Ukraine’s website. Several African countries as well as Brazil and the Vatican have spoken out in favour of peace talks. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Tuesday that Putin and Zelenskyy had agreed to host “an African leaders peace mission” in Moscow and Kyiv, respectively. Ramaphosa did not give a time frame or outline any parameters for the possible peace talks which would involve a delegation of leaders from six African countries to discuss a possible peace plan.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/18/ukraine-tells-china-envoy-peace-plan-must-not-lose-land-to-russia
Russia agrees to renew Ukraine Black Sea grain deal for 60 days,About 30.3 million tonnes of grain have been exported from Ukraine under the Black Sea deal to countries suffering from insecurity.,"Russia has agreed toextend a dealthat has allowed Ukraine to ship grain through the Black Sea to parts of the world struggling with hunger, a boost to global food security after the more-than-year-old war drove up prices. “I want to give good news,” Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday in a televised speech. “With the efforts of our country, the support of our Russian friends and the contribution of our Ukrainian friends, the Black Sea Grain Initiative has been extended by another two months.” Senior officials from Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the United Nations met in Istanbul last week and continued talks to discuss the Black Sea deal and its future. Turkey and the UN brokered the breakthrough accord with the warring sides last summer, which came with a separate agreement to facilitate shipments of Russian food and fertiliser that Moscow insists has not been applied. Russia had threatened to bow out if its concerns were not ironed out by Thursday. Such brinkmanship isn’t new: With a similar extension in the balance in March, Russia unilaterally decided to renew the deal for a similar 60 days instead of the 120 days outlined in the agreement. On Wednesday, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the deal had been extended to help countries in need, but added that Russia’s overall assessment of the agreement “has not changed”. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said, “We welcome the continuation of the initiative, but emphasise that it must work effectively.” “We hope that our partners will do their best to get the grain deal to fully work for the world’s food security and that Russia will eventually stop using food as a weapon and blackmail,” he added.  While Russia’s exports of food and fertiliser are not subject to Western sanctions due to its invasion of Ukraine, Moscow says restrictions on payments, logistics and insurance have become a barrier to shipments. The United States has rejected Russia’s claims about its difficulty exporting goods. Last week, US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield said: “It is exporting grain and fertiliser at the same levels, if not higher, than before the full-scale invasion.” About 30.3 million tonnes of grain have been exported from Ukraine under the Black Sea deal, including 625,000 tonnes in World Food Programme vessels for aid operations in Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and Yemen.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/17/black-sea-grain-deal-renewed-for-60-days-following-talks
"Russia orders arrests of anti-war theatre director, film producer","Since Russia invaded Ukraine, Moscow has cracked down on opposition voices, sentencing several to lengthy jail times.","A Moscow court has ordered the arrest of prominent film producer Alexander Rodnyansky and theatre director Ivan Vyrypaev for “spreading false information” about the Russian army. The initial court hearings against Rodnyansky and Vyrypaev were held on April 27, but not reported by the court until Wednesday. According to the court’s press service, Rodnyansky and Vyrypaev, who are outside Russia, will be placed in custody if Russian authorities manage to detain them or get them extradited. Russia’s Interior Ministry additionally put Vyrypaev on the federal wanted list. Kyiv-born Rodnyansky has been among the most influential figures in Russian cinema in recent decades. He left Russia after the start of the country’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and has repeatedly spoken openly against the war. In October 2022, Russia’s Justice Ministry declared Rodnyansky a “foreign agent”. Popular playwright, director and actor Vyrypaev has been living and working in Warsaw for several years and has also spoken in opposition to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Also on Wednesday, a Moscow court handed opposition figure and anti-war activist Mikhail Krieger a seven-year prison sentence. Krieger was arrested in November on charges of justifying terrorism and inciting hatred with the threat of violence, relating to social media posts from 2020 in which he praised the organisers of attacks at Federal Security Service buildings and referred to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s hanging. Prosecutors on Tuesday requested a nine-year sentence. In court, just prior to his sentencing, Krieger said that he was being prosecuted for his “anti-war and now openly pro-Ukrainian position”. Since Putin sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022, the government has waged a crackdown on dissent unseen since the Soviet era. The Kremlin’s sweeping campaign of repression has criminalised criticism of the war. In addition to fines and jail sentences, those accused have been fired, blacklisted, branded as “foreign agents” or have fled Russia.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/17/moscow-orders-the-arrest-of-prominent-director-for-disinformation
Patriot missile system in Ukraine likely ‘damaged’: Report,"As Russia claims that US-made Patriot system has been destroyed in Ukraine, US sources say the missile platform is likely only damaged.","A US-madePatriot missile defence systembeing used by Ukrainian forces has likely suffered some damage froma Russian air attackbut does not appear to have been destroyed, two United States officials told the Reuters news agency. The reported damage to the US-donated missile defence system follows Russia’s Defence Ministry on Tuesday saying that a Russian hypersonic Kinzhal missile had destroyed a Patriot missile battery in Kyiv. One US official, speaking on condition of anonymity and citing initial information, said Washington and Kyiv were already talking about the best way to repair the Patriot system and that, at this point, it did not appear the system would have to be removed from Ukraine. The official said the US would have a better understanding of the damage in the coming days and information could change over time. The Patriot is considered to be one of the most advanced US air defence systems, including against aircraft as well as cruise and ballistic missiles. It typically includes launchers along with radar and other support vehicles. White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters he could not confirm reports that a Patriot system had been damaged in Ukraine.    Kirby added that US military equipment sent to Ukraine is often damaged or worn out and that “it would depend on the scope of the damage as to whether or not it could be repaired by the Ukrainians or whether we might need to help them”. “Obviously, if – if there was damage done to a Patriot system that needed to be repaired outside Ukraine, we would certainly assist with that. I just can’t confirm it,” he said. On Tuesday, Ukrainian forces claimed success in shooting down 18 missiles, including six Kinzhals, which Russia had fired at targets in Kyiv in what was said to be one of the most complex attacks on the capital city – in terms of the number of missiles fired in a short space of time and launched from multiple directions. The commander-in-chief of Ukraine’s armed forces, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said earlier that the army had intercepted the six Kinzhals launched from aircraft, as well as nine Kalibr cruise missiles from ships in the Black Sea and three Iskanders fired from land. 18 of the 18 missiles were shot down, in particular, ballistic ones, which the terrorist state has boasted about. That's why we are constantly working on visits that will bring more opportunities, more Patriot, IRIS-T, Crotale, Hawk, NASAMS systems. Again and again, I thank all…pic.twitter.com/WnRtV7ae6D — Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa)May 16, 2023  Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu dismissed the Ukrainian claims that six Kinzhals had been intercepted, saying that Moscow had not fired that many, the RIA news agency reported. The number of missiles Ukraine claims to intercept is “three times greater than the number we launch”, Shoigu said, according to the report. “And they get the type of missiles wrong all the time. That’s why they don’t hit them,” he added, without elaborating. Russia began using the Kinzhal to hit targets in Ukraine early in the invasion but has used the expensive weapon sparingly and against priority targets, apparently reflecting limited availability. The Russian military says the missile’s range is up to 2,000km (about 1,250 miles) and it can fly at 10 times the speed of sound. Its speed and heavy warhead allow the Kinzhal to destroy heavily-fortified targets, such as underground bunkers or mountain tunnels. The Patriot system is one of an array of sophisticated air defence units supplied by the West to help Ukraine repel a Russian campaign of air attacks that has been aimed at critical infrastructure, power facilities and other sites. Ukrainian military officials also said on Tuesday that Russian forces had beenpushed back from the flanksof Bakhmut city, but that Moscow’s forces were pushing deeper inside the embattled town.  Ukraine’s Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said Ukrainian forces had taken back about 20 square kilometres (7.7 square miles) of a Russian pincer movement around Bakhmut – the epicentre of the current fighting. “At the same time, the enemy is advancing in some measure inside Bakhmut itself and is completely destroying the town with artillery,” she added on social media. The United Kingdom’s defence ministry said that “over the last four days, Ukrainian forces have made tactical progress, stabilising the flanks of Bakhmut to their advantage”. “As well as progress to the south of town, Ukrainian assaults have forced back the Russian front line to the north-west of the town,” the ministry said. Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin said in a video shared by Russian military bloggers on Tuesday that a US volunteer had died fighting alongside Ukrainian troops in the east. “He came to meet us. Citizen of the United States of America,” he said, showing what he claimed is the body of an American. It was not clear where or when the video was filmed.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/17/patriot-missile-system-in-ukraine-likely-damaged-sources-says
"Ukraine receives jet fighter support pledge from UK, Netherlands",UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Dutch premier Mark Rutte agreed to build an international coalition to provide Kyiv with F-16s fighter jets.,"The prime ministers of the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, Rishi Sunak and Mark Rutte, have agreed to build an “international coalition” to provide fighter jet support for Ukraine, a key item of military equipment Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has long sought from Western allies supporting his country’sfight against Russian forces. “The Prime Minister and Prime Minister Rutte agreed they would work to build (an) international coalition to provide Ukraine with combat air capabilities, supporting with everything from training to procuring F16 jets,” a spokesman for Sunak’s Downing Street office said in a statement on Tuesday following a meeting at the Council of Europe Summit in Iceland. “The prime minister reiterated his belief that Ukraine’s rightful place is in NATO and the leaders agreed on the importance of allies providing long-term security assistance to Ukraine to guarantee they can deter against future attacks,” the spokesman said. Most NATO members in Europe have kept open the possibility ofsending their F-16s to Ukraine, even as President Joe Biden said as recently as January that the United States would not do so, Al Jazeera’sJohn Psaropoulos reportedat the time. According to Psaropoulos, air defence experts say US-built F-16 fighter jets wouldoffer Ukraine an edgeover the Russian air force, but only if combined with powerful missiles and targeting information, which the West would also have to provide and which would risk drawing Ukraine’s Western allies more actively into the war. Rutte said in a tweet on Tuesday that he and Sunak had spoken about issues “we’re working on together and, of course, about our ongoing joint support for Ukraine in the face of the terrible Russian aggression”. The Dutch prime minister did not mention the provision of fighter jet support and training. The United Kingdom remains one of the Netherlands’ key partners.

I think discussions are under way with the Americans,” Macron said in a televised interview with the TF1 broadcaster. “The training can start from now,” he said, without providing further details. Dutch news outlet NOS reported on Tuesday that Prime Minister Rutte had said on May 4,during Zelenskyy’s visitto the Netherlands, that the supply of F-16s was being discussed between the UK, Denmark and Belgium, while Amsterdam and London were also in discussions on the issue of fighter planes. In a speech to the Council of Europe Summit in Reykjavik, Iceland, earlier on Tuesday, Zelenskyy again called on Western allies to help strengthen Ukraine’s air defences, particularly in light of the reportedlysuccessful shooting downof several Russian hypersonic missiles fired at Kyiv overnight.    “Ukraine’s territory is big and to make air defence results like last night’s the rule throughout the country, we need additional air defence systems and missiles. We also need modern fighter jets, without which no air defence system will be perfect. And I am sure we will get there,” the Ukrainian leader said. Later, in his nightly address, Zelenskyy called the reported pledge by Sunak and Rutte to provide fighter jets “a good start to the coalition” and added: “Thank you all.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/17/ukraine-receives-jet-fighter-support-pledge-from-uk-netherlands

US denounces arrest of former consulate employee in Russia,Robert Shonov is being held for allegedly cooperating ‘on a confidential basis’ with a foreign organisation.,"The United States has “strongly” condemned the detention of a former consulate employee who has been arrested in Russia, according to a local media report. In astatementon Tuesday, a spokesperson for the US Department of State dismissed the allegations against Robert Shonov, a Russian national who worked for more than 25 years in the now-shuttered US consulate in Vladivostok on Russia’s east coast. “The allegations against Mr Shonov are wholly without merit,” said spokesperson Matthew Miller. The Russian state media outlet TASS reported on Monday that Shonov had been arrested in Vladivostok and transferred to Moscow’s Lefortovo prison, the same detention centre where two US citizenshave been heldon charges of espionage. Citing law enforcement sources, TASS explained that Shonov had been interrogated following his arrest. He was ultimately charged with cooperating “on a confidential basis with a foreign state, [or] international or foreign organisation”.    Miller blasted that charge in Tuesday’s statement. The fact that Shonov was “being targeted under the ‘confidential cooperation’ statute highlights the Russian Federation’s blatant use of increasingly repressive laws against its own citizens,” Miller wrote. He explained that Russia had issued an order in April 2021 restricting local residents from being employed by the US diplomatic corps. Since then, Shonov had worked for a company “contracted to provide services to US Embassy in Moscow in strict compliance with Russia’s laws and regulations”. Miller sought to downplay any role Shonov might have had in embassy affairs. “Mr Shonov’s only role at the time of his arrest was to compile media summaries of press items from publicly available Russian media sources,” he said. Still, members of the Russian government applauded Shonov’s arrest in state media reports. “It’s clear that unacceptable activities by unfriendly states are not slowing down but rather are going up,” Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told TASS.    Tuesday’s statement is the latest indication of heightened tensions between Russia and the US, particularly in the wake of the former’sfull-scale invasion of Ukraine, launched in February 2022. Earlier this year, the US denounced the detention of US citizen and Wall Street Journal reporterEvan Gershkovich, with the State Department declaring he had been “wrongfully detained” by Russian authorities oncharges of espionage. “Journalism is not a crime. We condemn the Kremlin’s continued repression of independent voices in Russia, and its ongoing war against the truth,” State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel said in a statement on April 10. Gershkovich himself has denied the charges, which include allegations that he was collecting state secrets about Russia’s military-industrial complex. The US has also urged Russia to free another US citizen, former marine Paul Whelan, who wassentenced in 2020to 16 years for espionage. Whelan likewise has rejected the charges against him: In court, he appeared in the defendant’s box carrying a sign that read, “Sham trial!”    Both Whelan and Gershkovich have spent time in Lefortovo prison, a high-security detention facility with a history stretching back to tsarist times. Gershkovich is currently jailed there, and Whelan spent 20 months in the facility awaiting trial. Last month, US envoy to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield called for the release of both men, saying they were being used as “political bargaining chips“. “Using people as pawns is a strategy of weakness. These are not the actions of a responsible country. And while Russia plays political games, real people suffer,” Thomas-Greenfield said. In December, Russia and the US negotiated aprisoner swapthat saw the release of imprisonedbasketball player Brittney Grinerin exchange forViktor Bout, a Russian former arms dealer serving a 25-year sentence in the US.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/16/us-denounces-arrest-of-former-consulate-employee-in-russia
"CIA urges Russians to get in touch, Moscow puts spies on alert",US intelligence agency publishes video asking Russians to share information that could be ‘more valuable than you think’.,"After the US Central Intelligence Agency published a video encouraging Russians to make contact via a secure internet channel, the Kremlin said on Tuesday that its agencies were tracking Western spy activity. The CIA’s short video in Russian was accompanied by a text saying the agency wanted to hear from military officers, intelligence specialists, diplomats, scientists and people with information about Russia’s economy and its leadership. “Contact us. Perhaps the people around you don’t want to hear the truth. We want to,” the text said. Published nearly 15 months into Moscow’s war with Ukraine, the video invites Russians to take a colossal risk. President Vladimir Putin has warned his compatriots to be on their guard against traitors, and parliament last month voted to increase the penalty for state treason from 20 years to life in prison. In the video – published on the CIA’s official YouTube channel and the Telegram messaging app, popular in Russia – a male voice reflects on the meaning of heroism and endurance as lone individuals are seen weighing their decisions: a man trudging through snow, a woman staring through a window. “We are easily swayed by lies. But we do know what our reality is. The reality we live in. And the reality we talk about in whispers,” the voice says. At the end, a man and a woman are shown in separate scenes with their fingers hovering over mobile phone screens with a link saying “Contact CIA”. “This is my Russia. This will always be my Russia. I will endure. My family will endure. We will live with dignity because of my actions,” the narrator concludes. Asked about the video, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he had not paid attention to it, but added: “I am convinced that our special services are monitoring this space in the necessary way.” He added: “We all know perfectly well that the CIA and other Western intelligence services are not reducing their activity on the territory of our country.” Some Russians reacted sceptically to the video on social media, saying it looked like a “provocation” by Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB). The text accompanying it said contact could take place securely via Tor, a system for anonymous online communication. It directed viewers to another video for instructions on how to use Tor. “The CIA wants to know the truth about #Russia, and we are looking for reliable people who know and can tell us this truth,” it said. “Your information may be more valuable than you think.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/16/cia-urges-russians-to-get-in-touch-moscow-puts-spies-on-alert
